{"text":"Always an excellent experience! Great food and wonderful staff! Their prices are very decent and their rolls are large. My favorite is the Vegas roll. Can't beat the buy 2 get 1 free special! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's day,  party of 3 around 9pm. First time customers, we all did the AYCE. Sushi and side dishes came out pretty quick.  Side dishes were great,  sushi was good but I've had better. My son didn't care for the uni,  as it is one of his favorites. Just the quality and lack of taste wasn't up to par for him. He ordered one of the rolls with crunchies but it tasted stale. My husband who likes spicy sms hot couldn't handle the 911 roll. The spicy tuna was great but it was an even toss up of good and not so good rolls.
No sashimi (but most ayce don't have), No raw oysters (again usually you don't see that for ayce). That's okay I have my favorite spot where I get both in the ayce. 
I love sweets and the bonus is that you are not limited to one dessert only.  So I really enjoyed the lychee sorbet,  mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream.
The service was good, around enough to take orders and clear plates.  They just never offer refills,  even when our cup is empty we had to ask for the refills. 
I would go back,  but not a big deal if I don't make it."}
{"text":"I came here once and never again.

As good as the sushi was, there were roaches crawling up the walls and the employees were aware of the roaches on the walls and stood idly by doing nothing. I call health hazard because now I wonder if those creepy critters actually got into the food and could potentially get customers sick. 

If you want to eat sushi go elsewhere. DO NOT COME HERE!!!"}
{"text":"How lucky am I that this place gave me my first sushi experience ever!!! We come here once a week, and yes, almost everytime around dinner time there is a wait. BUT IT IS SO WORTH IT. Plus they are really good with their to-go orders. Not the greatest place for large parties who want to sit and socialize alot, but perfect for a quick, healthy bite. Try the tiger roll, it is by far the best."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Fish was fresh and portions were satisfying. We cant wait to go back again. The yellowfin was outstanding! My wife and i love trying new food locations and this was definitely one of the best spots we've tried lately! Highly recommended! Oh yeah, do the all you can eat. We are stuffed and it was less than $80 with tip and a large beer!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, and loved it! Under $30 for all you can eat sushi, appetizers and dessert. I was a big fan of the half orders so I wouldn't waste any of the food. Although I loved a majority of what I ordered I wouldn't get the spicy tuna."}
{"text":"Okay so went there for lunch today for the first time. I've been to the Maryland location and they were great and nice.
Sushi chef was nice at saraha location. 
Their tuna was kind of weird texture but other then that food was good. 
I liked their masago roll, moon rool, and garlic edemame.
The reason I give them 2 stars is because the manager charged me for literary not eating a HALF OF A SPOON of RICE I almost wanted to laugh it wasn't even a whole one peice of sushi. He wasn't nice at all about it. 
I probably wont be going back to that location just because of him."}
{"text":"Always pack here but we don't mind waiting cuz it's all worth it.  Yellowtail collar is my favorite. They will be close
On 4th of July."}
{"text":"I've eaten here ten times now over a period of six months and have had a great experience each time. About 26 bucks for custom made all you can eat sushi. I start with nigiri salmon, yellowtail, toro, maguro and anything else that looks good, so I know the fish going in the rolls is good. The New York girl in Las Vegas roll is unique. the 911 roll is spicy good. The Spider roll is average, the Spicy Tuna roll is above average. Fresh and clean and no fish odor, the way good sushi should be. And steady quality. there is a long wait during dinner usually."}
{"text":"First time at this location, I've been to the one on Sahara and I can say it was really good but I went to this one on Maryland and I hated it , the fish was horrible nothing was fresh the chef kept talking in their language never asked if we wanted something else when we would ask for something it took them forever to make I couldn't believe it I heard so many good reviews of this place I went I guess I just had a terrible experience I recommend Sakana sushi on Maryland and flamigo"}
{"text":"The place smells when you walk in. Sushi was mediocre to average. Some of the more specialty nigiri (garlic tuna, seared salmon) is also topped with a ponzu sauce that makes everything fall apart and way too salty. Spider roll was also very salty. Shrimp tempura was good. Service was not bad when I was there. For a good off the strip AYCE sushi option I suggest JJANGA, which has better sushi and is a dollar cheaper."}
{"text":"By far the worse service! The one in Henderson is way better! Don't get me wrong they do have great sushi it's just their service was terrible. I went here 3 times just to give it another chance but I am not going here anymore. They even forgot to bring out our drinks so that's when I had the last of it. 

The only good thing I can say about this place is they have a variety of rolls to pick from and if you like all you can eat they have it!"}
{"text":"Went to this place based off a friends recommendation, and was extremely disappointed. The menu has no variety and everything was pretty basic. No wow factor  The dining area is also fairly small, luckily we went midday so there wasn't a wait. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great place. 

Love this place. I have been going here since they opened. Consistent yumminess. My only complaint is that it is slammed on the weekends."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a regular. Love this place, the service at this location is awesome."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is small. It's always busy. The wait staff could use a little more training when it comes to acknowledging customers and replenishing drinks. But you HAVE to try this place!
I have gone to a lot of sushi places and this one is the best food experience that I've had in my entire life (which is saying a lot)!
The sashimi, nigiri and rolls are excellent and the variety is amazing! Everything they made was so good-and we were trying to get the full benefit from our buffet pricing-that I left so uncomfortably full that I almost despaired of life. 

THIS BEING SAID, I'VE JUST READ THAT THEY CHANGED OWNERSHIP AND THAT THE QUALITY HAS VASTLY CHANGED. I still plan to check it out on my next trip through the area and truly hope that this isn't the case. Because I really LOVE this place and think that you will too!"}
{"text":"Not bad for an AYCE for 60 mins. They have variety, but some items are a hit or a miss.. The uni was bitter. I should have known when I saw the chef scooping out pieces of dark-colored uni. I didn't have much expectations for AYCE places, but I wouldn't mind coming back here."}
{"text":"Food was not bad but the the only bad thing is that you have to finish what you order. Especially the rice from the sushi, you had to finish it or else they will charge you extra for that. The baked mussels were good! Hot and juicy!"}
{"text":"3 stars for an average sushi experience: 

Wait time was 30 minutes, which isn't terrible considering some places have an hour wait for a Friday night. The service was okay, nothing to rave about, but they weren't terrible. Not very personable or helpful. The food was meh, it's not the best, but there's definitely worse out there. I think I'll stick to Yama sushi"}
{"text":"We went to this place a long time ago when one of our friends lived in Vegas.  This last time around we wanted sushi but forgot the name of this place.  We yelped a good sushi place and boom, we were back here.  All you can eat is great and a great price. But, you don't really have to get all you can eat.  They have great priced meals you can get or meals for two, then you can also get different sushi and save.  People are nice there and the sushi guy is funny.

btw, didn't feel good that night but wasn't sure it was the food or the drinks.  Might have been all the drinks."}
{"text":"Just that mon.. nutin specialn..tiny rolls...lots of pep n very crowded. Cattle eating sushi... I think I slip into smiths n eat Doritos."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon never disappoints. It's a nice, casual sushi restaurant. The sushi is fresh and the rolls are good. The servers and sushi chefs are all very friendly and nice. Prices are decent."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this place fucking sucked.  We drove nearly 45 minutes off the strip to get there, and it was a disappointment to say the least, considering how much everyone hyped it up.  It was basically full when we arrived, but there were five seats open at the bar.  We stood around for five minutes with no host or hostess telling us whether or not we could sit down or not, and it was only after we flagged down a busboy that we were told we could have a seat.  

We all ordered the all-you-can-eat lunch, and proceeded to put in our orders.  For appetizers I ordered a green salad (completely drenched in dressing with mushy tomatoes), the fried calamari (it came out square-shaped and tasted like fish cake?) and the mussels, which was the only edible selection of the lot.  

For sushi, we ordered plenty of nigiri and some rolls as well.  The pieces of fish for the nigiri weren't especially big or tasty, and definitely wasn't on par with other sushi places I've been to.  I was especially disappointed with the rolls - while there was no dearth in selection, most of the menu items seemed the same with only minor changes in the ingredients, and the ones that we did get just weren't appetizing at all - we ended up having leftover pieces of some of the rolls we ordered with no one stepping up to finish it, not because we were full but because they just tasted gross.  Overall, just boring, unremarkable flavors that weren't appetizing at all.  At the end, I was so put off by the sushi selection that I had to go back and order the mussels in order to try and fill myself up (which still didn't end up happening).  

Save yourself the drive off the strip and take a pass on this place."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite sushi restaurants, and I would eat there once a week, but not anymore. The old owners took a lot of pride in treating the customers well and serving high quality sushi. since it was sold, the décor might be improved but the customer service and food quality stinks! They scrimp on the servings and the service. Also,I went there on a Tuesday night, after the main dinner crowd had left.  Only 2 tables were filled with customers and they refused to seat me at any table but a tiny one facing into a corner.  I am glad there are a lot of Sushi Restaurant choices on the west side, I've taken my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just starting coming here with my parents because we love Tony!!! He is amazing always hooks us up with delicious fish and awesome sauces. I love the spicy ponzu sauce he makes. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because its sooo small."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You can't go wrong doing the all you can eat here. You need to get the baked 428 though OMG it's simply amazing mmm"}
{"text":"All you can eat Sushi? Really? In Vegas nonetheless? Poor buffet quality imitation sushi comes to mind.  But Sushi Mon can't be further from that image.  

For less than $30 for dinner, you get high quality sushi for all you can eat.  It's a great way to try several different types of sushi and rolls (as long as you finish it) and you will like some more than others but I've never not been able to finish an order.  Everything is just that good.

Cajun Albacore is a personal favorite by the way.  Don't forget to save just a small bit of room for ice cream (included of course)."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since the new ownership, and things are getting better, so I'm giving them one more star.  The service has improved, and they have brought back some of the old chefs.   Worth a visit.   But sure wish the new owner wouldn't hover around the sushi bar, looking like he wants to make sure the chefs don't serve too much fish."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and of course did the AYCE. They are pretty busy so there's usually at least a 15 minute wait. The pastel roll is my favorite. Along with the ecstasy. I wasn't thrilled about the hurricane roll, but it was alright. Their fish is super fresh, the garlic tuna, super white, salmon, and Uni are my favorite! Fish to rice portion is perfect. Not too much rice, and the cut of the fish is not too thick. It's just like your average sushi bar, but you can count on their fish being fresh EVERYTIME. Service is friendly, chefs work at a fast pace. And you can do half rolls! You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We are regular here and most of the employees are very nice except for a heavy set Mexican guy. He's very cocky and rude, I made a mistake ordering a sushi by pronouncing the name incorrectly and he gave me this look that saying, \"WTF man get it right\", and he walked away shaking his head. I never expect that from a server especially to a place that I visit 2x a week. Just very careful when your dealing with this guy."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Mon, but this one is terrible. 
The servers were nice and accommodating but the sushi and the sushi chefs were god awful. They should be embarrassed to even call themselves chef. I went on a monday night, got all you can eat.
 Food was peer crap, they cut the fish up so horribly and it all had the wrong kinds of taste. Honestly whoever enforces the brand standards for this company should go here and shut the place down. All the fish we had tasted wrong and the many of the dishes were lemon like. We had all you can eat but every time we ordered it took more then 20 minutes.(place was not busy) We had plenty left overs but they didn't charge us because cmon, even they knew the food was crap and the chefs sucked. Funny how when I go to other sushi mon I see a diverse group of people but this one you see like 3 drunk people who, just by looking at them, wouldn't know sushi from dog turd."}
{"text":"Yum! Maybe not 5 star but for the price it can't be beat. Plus, with 2 hungry teenage boys we have to do AYCE!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Staff here is rude and disrespectful - including the manager as well. 

Go to Goyemon instead."}
{"text":"Just ate here and the younger of the 3 chefs was very rude and arrogant...talking down to everyone...it was our first time there and I will never go back...food wise it was okay...we had the all you can eat dinner and it was no match for hiker restaurant down the road...we spent over $150.00 on decent Japanese food being served by a Japanese prick...btw I am Japanese myself and I was shocked by how we were treated...shame..."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, lots of options. They used to have very slow service but I find they have corrected that issue the last few times I have gone. Definitely a go to for ayce sushi. Try the orgasm salad, spicy albacore Nigiri, and the crunchy rice w spicy Tuna."}
{"text":"My first day in vegas I ate here and was blown away. I know live a few blocks away and 5 years later I still dine there. Staff is amazing and the food is great."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is a real gem! It's far enough from the Strip that I doubt most tourists will ever hear about it, but I'm really glad I asked Yelp (and my local friend) where to eat sushi on a Friday night.

Sushi Mon does ACYE sushi (all-you-can-eat) the only way you can -- by ordering off a very extensive menu, and ordering more rolls whenever something catches your eye or when you realize you're still hungry. (No stale rolls under buffet glass here!) This only works if the restaurant has great service, and luckily, the wait staff is very prompt here.

If they still have it on the specials menu, you have to try the pastel roll. Unhealthy, for sure, but oh so yummy.

The only drawback was waiting for 45+ minutes for our table on a Friday night. In their defense, we were a pretty big group. We ended up killing time by stocking up on snacks and toiletries at the Smith's across the parking lot."}
{"text":"This place is going down, food still good but service is horrible. They say they close at 2:00 am, I got there yesterday at 1:01 and they didn't let me do the all you can eat, and the guy at the door told me an my friend, either Allan carte or leave. We couldn't believe it. Awesome costumer service. We will never come back."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and yummy!  Love the deserts!  We will definitely come back next time!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is the best place to eat Sushi ,Food are really good with good Chef's and they are nice ."}
{"text":"definitely my go-to place for AYCE sushi.

the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is casual.

i love this place for the following reasons:
1)  AYCE ice cream!! right?!! you can choose from red bean, green tea, or plum flavors.  or do what i do...get a bowl of all of the above. =)
2)  you can order shrimp tempura and ONLY shrimp tempura.  that means, you dont get the typical 2shrimp:10veggies ratio.  if all you want is shrimp, then thats all you get.
3)  you can order 1/2 orders of all the rolls so that you can sample all of the different rolls.  pretty awesome.  
4)  they have a frequent diner stamp card!  

btw, they have one of the freshest albacore sushi ive ever had."}
{"text":"Reviewing this sushi bar with all the other all you can eat places in town, Sushi Mon is far superior to all the others and this is the better of the 2 locations which are not affiliated in regards to the stamp cards.  This is by far the best place to go when your hungry for a big sushi meal. Plan on waiting for a tablenor bar room dinner and late night."}
{"text":"This was one of the first all you can eat sushi buffets here in town for me.  I love this place because of the quality of fresh fish, speed of service and location.  No need to worry, this sushi bar is a win every time."}
{"text":"I honestly think I was dragged all the way to Vegas from San Francisco because the boy toy wanted to dine here. This is his all-time favorite sushi restaurant.

The best part about this AYCE is that they don't try to fill you up on white rice. The rice is loosely packed, and with the way I dip my sushi in soy sauce, it fell apart. :) This is a good thing because I really just wanted to eat the raw fish. Yeah, I like calling sashimi raw fish because it is more fun to say. If you dislike it, then sue me. 

Boy toy and I were super duper disappointed that they no longer serve uni. The salmon roe with quail egg had to suffice, and its deliciousness almost did the trick. And the raw salmon was so fatty that it melt into my mouth. Oh, and the tomago texture was very consistent and eggy. 

Lastly, I was disappointed that the tempura ice cream was no longer on the menu. I had to settle for just ice cream. Get the plum ice cream, it is now my favorite Japanese ice cream flavor. The green tea tasted like vanilla and the red bean was too grainy in texture."}
{"text":"Alright,uhh this was a small but clean Japanese restaurant which located at Silverado ranch. I ordered \"all u can eat\", that was an impressed experience at that place. Each piece of sushi had a just good size for me to eat, not very big then hard to bite. N tuna was gorgeous because of it tasted fresh. In a word, I will come back without any hesitation."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken was disgusting. I had heard good things about this place. I was terribly disappointed. I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, the service absolutely sucked!  2 of us did all you can eat.  Ordered two rolls and two nigiri, first round took 20 minutes plus to get to us.  2nd round took even longer!  Will not return."}
{"text":"Best sushi for the price! We thought the rolls were very nice looking.  They were very accommodating. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Anytime you put \"all you can eat\" and \"sushi\" in the same sentence, you never know what you're going to get. But this place is superb. The quality of the fish is great, variety is awesome, and pricing for about $26.95 for adults (one hour time limit) at dinner time (a little less for lunch) is well worth it if you're hungry. 

They have all the usual nigiri favorites and an extensive list of sushi rolls. What blew my mind was the Ikura and Quail Egg...oh baby...my brother-in-law introduced me to this and now it's one of my favorite bites to eat. Needless to say, we had way too many on our last visit.

You can also order regular Japanese dishes like shrimp/vegetable tempura, hamachi kama, miso soup, and the like...which we did. But it really was the sushi that I enjoyed the most.

The only slightly disappointing thing we encountered was there's really no kids menu available. Kids 2-years-old and under do eat free, but if you're kids are older than that (like my son) then expect to pay ala carte prices to get that kid fed or splurge on another all-you-can-eat.

Other than that, we had a great time and would definitely return again if we are hungry for good quality sushi off the strip."}
{"text":"Another good AYCE sushi fix. The Sex Girl roll is the bomb.Always fresh fish and creative rolls.Lots of variety and they are open until the wee hours if you get a sushi munchy after a night out on the town.You will leave with a smile on your face and wanting to go back again soon."}
{"text":"We travel 4 hours to Vegas and we always have to stop by Sushi Mon. This time we tried the Maryland location. We arrived at 10:30pm and there was 20 minute wait. Most of people come here for AYCE sushi. It never disappoints us. I especially like their great service. That's why I gave 5 stars."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It would be my first go-to choice for sushi. They have a fairly big menu and the prices are pretty decent. I love variety so I always choose to have ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi.  You have to finish your order before you order the next roll.  That makes sense because it'd be such a waste of food, and of course no sharing.  Don't be cheap and ghetto and try to dish it off to your friends.  The prices are already fair as is.

Service is fast and friendly.  I love their 911 roll! I have a pretty high tolerance for spices and this roll is so painfully delicious.  When it comes to a spicy tuna roll, I prefer the tuna well diced and mixed with chili sauce which is how Sushi Mon makes theirs.  I don't like the low end sushi style of a tuna roll with just a blob of spicy mayo on top.  Their LASAGNA ROLL is also a favorite.  Try it out.

The last time I was there, I had apple/pear sake.  It was so good.  That says a lot from someone who rarely likes sake because of it's strong taste and burning sensation.  You definitely should give it a shot.

Off topic - it's a small restaurant. You get the mom and pop shop vibe (which I love and appreciate) Seating is pretty limited.  They're usually busy so they don't take reservations. That's the only \"bad\" thing I'll say about the place. Just make sure you plan to wait a little bit if you decide to dine their during the naturally busy hours.

Overall, I miss and love this place!"}
{"text":"One star for having roaches and poor service. 

First time trying out this location with my boyfriend. (He's tried the one on Maryland and loved it; we go to Goyemon -my favorite, on Decatur all the time).

Sat around for ten minutes at the bar before we ordered some rolls (AYCE of course). The rolls took a while to be made (very slow in comparison to all other AYCE sushi restaurants) especially considering how many customers were dining. It was just us, another couple, and one other lady. Luckily I eat pretty slow so I wasn't kept waiting too long between rolls. My boyfriend, however, really had to slow down his pace and did have to wait for new rolls. Btw, there were four sushi chefs working behind the bar. You definitely need to order as much as you can when you figure out what you want or else you will be waiting a while for your food to come. 

The server didn't come and take the drink order until after our food already came. Again, keep in mind that they made the rolls relatively slow (and we only made two nigiri and two half roll orders). So we were already eating by the time she brought our two waters. 

Skip to the end of the meal...after we order dessert we notice a baby roach crawling on the menu right in front of us on the bar. We didn't make a big deal (as gross as it was); my boyfriend just squished its guts out with his napkin. But to make matters worse, when we were brought our bill, they charged us for dinner instead of lunch. We brought it to their attention that we were already seated by 3:50 (dinner doesn't start until 4:00 and we weren't going to pay an extra $10 when we didn't even order any dinner specials -namely the green tea creme brûlée  which I love). The server then came back and informed us that their computer said that we came in at 4:10 and that's when I called bull. I specifically remembered looking at the clock when we got our waters and it was 4:07. Again, we waited forever for our drinks, and if we got the drinks at 4:07 then how the hell did we walk in and get seated at 4:10? They finally decided to CORRECT the bill from dinner to lunch, but our whole experience was already ruined at that point. Will definitely not be making a return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"WAY better than the Sushi Mon on Sahara. The restaurant is clean and the sushi is good. The servers weren't too friendly (one even walked around with a grumpy face); however, the service was decent. If you want something, you have to flag them down. At first we made the mistake of waiting to order when they came to clear our plates, but it took a huge pile and quite a wait before someone came by. They are quick to get you what you want after you order it though."}
{"text":"I had to write this review in response to the review by Joey S. of the $10 dollar special for their anniversary. We had the same issue, that is, we got there and they weren't taking anymore names since the amount of names they had would last them until closing time. That is perfectly reasonable considering they have to go home some time. They weren't taking reservations. The names in their waiting book were from people who got there before you and put their names in first. There's a difference between reservations and putting your name in way ahead of time in person at the restaurant. Sorry, we were both bested by others who got there before us. 

when they say they're not doing it anymore because too many people are there, consider the language barrier and assume they mean they can't cater to all the people who showed up due to seating and time constraints. They are not trying to get cheap on you and end the deal.

They always have great quality food and friendly service. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have decent price for all-you-can-eat sushi. I normally don't like going to all you can eat sushi places because I feel like most are trying to cheat you by giving you rolls or sashimi packed with rice or a lot of sweet eel sauce or all the rolls are made of california rolls with different toppings. However, this place is not like that. Their rolls size are perfect, and they have variety of different rolls and sashimi and not all california rolls based. You can also order half orders so you can save your stomach for more tastings. The sushi chefs are japanese so it is def authentic. Make sure you ask for the stamp card where you can get your 11th meal free"}
{"text":"First time to the west sahara location. I usually go to the Silverado/Maryland location (which is ALWAYS busy). Went with a big party at around 7:30 on a Saturday night. I was quite surprised it wasn't busy at all. They were just waiting for a larger party to finish up and we were seated in 10 mins. 

First off, I forgot how good of a quality their sushi is. I haven't been to Sushi mon in a long time since discovering Oyshi, Hikari and Island Sushi. After my first salmon nigiri, it instantly reminded me of why we always used to go here. Big, fresh piece of fish on a tiny nug of rice. Exactly how it should be.

I love their salmon nigiri and their natto! Their natto is the best I've had in town.. its the kind that is from a tube.. not the ones from the packs. Don't get me wrong, I like those too.. just not for my sushi.

I didn't realize that their prices went up to $30! That is pretty pricey for all you can eat sushi, when other venues offer much more of a variety. Honestly, I have been going to other places because they offer much more choices in appetizers. I'm not a sushi roll person. I don't care at all for those rolls stuffed and topped with random stuff. I mainly stick to the nigiris and explore the appetizer menu. 

Their appetizers... are not that great. I got the scallop half shell bake (something like that). I had a thought it was going to be a baked scallop in the shell topped with mayo or something. Instead it was baby scallops baked in a dish topped with a disgusting mayo sauce. I could hardly finish it. The boyfriend ordered the ahi poke (which i WAS going to order but didn't.. thank god!). I dunno what the heck what in there.. but it wasn't only ahi. There were other weird raw pieces of fish.. it was gross.

Service was quick and the workers there were very friendly! The lady even ran out after us to make sure we got the punch card. I will definitely be back, but will probably go to the Henderson location!"}
{"text":"The best bang for your buck. The all you can eat is definitely worth it if you can eat a lot. Recommendation : sexy girl is so goood it's a must if your in the area if not, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"This place was great! Went in for the all-you-can-eat sushi and ate as much sushi as we could stomach and ultimately paid half of what we would've had we bought individual rolls via al la carte. Sushi quality I'd give a 4 out of 5 due in part to the fact that they're trying to make so many rolls in such little time, but for all-you-can-eat I expected less so this was a pleasant surprise! The 9-1-1 roll was great and the Cajun (tuna?) was great too. As always, whenever you go to a sushi place, the bar is always the preferred seating and this place is no exception."}
{"text":"Visiting from L.A. and decided to try something new.  Just got back from there on a Tuesday evening.  We didn't have to wait at all.  Almost everything we ordered from the AYCE menu were pretty good.  On the menu, it does say it's AYCE within 60 mins but I don't think they really time you .. maybe on busier nights?  It's worth the $26 for dinner but I wish they would include the drinks (soda, tea .. ) with it.  We briefly added up the items to see if we ate at least $26 / person .. I think we each ate about $28 worth .. haha .. wish we could have ate more but we were so full!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, authentic, ayce.  When the food comes out at a cool temperature, not cold or thawed, and it's great, that's a good sign.
Great service.  Sit at the sushi bar & buy your chef a beer (that's the proper way)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Fast service. Clean and welcoming atmosphere. Delicious food.
When my friend and I sat down to eat the guy making the sushi was very accommodating and helpful. He suggested very satisfying items on the menu and kept very interactive making it a very enjoyable visit!"}
{"text":"Hurricane roll was outstanding, I generally shy away from all you can eat sushi restaurants but this was very good.  Well priced and sushi is fresh."}
{"text":"I like to go here after the gym, since it is so close.  Love the lunch time specials and usually get the 2 roll combo.  Very inexpensive and yummy too!  When you order the all u can eat, the fish is made to order and is super fresh.  I just wish the place was bigger because it gets crowded sometimes and you have to wait."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. Me and my boyfriend come here quite often and seem to get the WORST service. The food is great and it's cheap so that's why we kept coming here. The only generally nice ones are the chefs and the guy waiter. 

Tonight we went and were literally ignored and had our check shoved at us while our food was still on the table and told we had to pay now so they could close the register. 

Enough said, we'll never be coming here again. It's a shame since the guy waiter is extremely friendly and the only one that seems to work, I suppose that's why they get 2 stars."}
{"text":"My buddy and I did the AYCE thing. We were extremely pleased with the quality and taste of every roll and nigiri sushi that we ordered. Their 9-1-1 spicy tuna roll is no joke--wonderfully SPICY!!! To finish up, we ordered the Yebisu and Ecstasy rolls. Let's call it a happy ending! We agreed that these may have been the best two rolls that we have ever eaten. The garlic in the Yebisu was definitely not subtle, and the \"orgasm\" sauce on the Ecstasy roll, well, we don't know what it is, but it is delightfully sinful!

We sat at the bar, and were very impressed with the great speed at which these amazing rolls were produced after we ordered each. Not only will we be back here again, we will be dragging out-of-town visitors with us!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the new staff and changes in the restaurant. Before we moved this place was awesome! Now they have decided to use a new seating system that is no longer first come first serve. We were a group of two and kept getting passed over for groups of 4-6 that came way later than us. Sushi Mon you let us down and that's sad cause we always made a trip to eat here every time we visit and always recommend you to any friends who was visiting. We waited over an hour and 1/2, when your text said 40mins. Double sad that we left when you 3 empty seats open at the bar. At the two hour mark you sent a text and called but we had long gone since your hostess was rude and just didn't care."}
{"text":"First review, so bear with me. I'm just going to keep it simple.

It's not that good.

I should've known from all the mixed reviews. Oyshi is my usual choice for AYCE sushi in the Vegas vicinity but the last time we went to Oyshi, the quality had gone down a bit and we decided to try something else.

Even so, I'd rather go back to Oyshi than Sushi Mon. Sushi Mon doesn't have as much variety in terms of rolls and side dishes offered. The cut rolls weren't that impressive (rather bland as Michael T. mentioned) and the fish didn't taste exceptionally delicious. I was pretty disappointed.

Plum ice cream was probably the best part of the meal, but you don't need to spend $24 on THAT."}
{"text":"1.) Choice for Late Night Sushi/Sashimi!!
2.) Okay so BF got mad at me for giving sushi mon a 4 stars..so we compromised 4.5 stars

~ The Order ~
Sashimi Dinner - $13.95 for 12 pieces w/ soup & salad
* usually get this as I love sashimi
* good thick fresh yummy cuts; they don't skimp
* if you're lucky you get a 2 extra spindles of crab =)

All in all - BF & I always go here cuz he can get half rolls & I get my fill of sashimi

P.S. BF would like to point out that they are really big rolls.. and for the price..and open so late ...
P.P.S BF however will not sit at the sushi bar cuz he felt like the chefs weren't really nice to him bcuz he ordered the more conservative/americanized /cooked rolls vs. the out there rolls"}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi. However, I much prefer the Sushi Mon in Henderson. For some reason, the food tasted fresher. However, good place to enjoy an all-you-can-eat sushi place. Again, they include a lot of appetizers on the AYCE menu. Yay!"}
{"text":"When I used to go to Vegas 2-3 times a month, this was my go-to place to get my sushi fix. There were times when I used to come here twice in one weekend...shesh! The one thing I love about Sushi Mon is they include appetizers in the all-you-can-eat menu. The sushi is delicious. I mean, it is an all-you-can-eat place, but the seafood is pretty darn good quality. I usually get this knotty feeling in my stomach when I eat mediocre fish, and the only reason why my tummy aches from this place is cause by over eating. I will admit, I usually have to loosen my belt a few notches at the conclusion of my meal. I've listed my favorites below. The garlic tuna and cajun albacore are must tries! I used to order 5 orders of this. My significant other at the time hated raw fish. After tasting the garlic tuna and cajun albacore, they were sold! Darn, so wishing I was in Henderson right about now!

{"text":"We've dined here for YEARS but tonight just pissed me off. My daughter and I decided to dine here for the all you can eat sushi and our server not only took forever but he didn't bring half the things we ordered and when we asked him about it he said we didn't order anything  oh my god. Terrible terrible service. TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Usually has great staff and sweet service for when I am there.  I've become friends with the waiters because I am a regular here. The place closes at 2am and will accept late munchers until 1am, which for me, is such a great thing! 

The food is great in my opinion. I often order nigiris (salmon belly, yellowtail belly, etc) and boy, they are just so buttery and creamy in my tummy! They are often given to you as fast as they can because this place can get quite busy.

Food taste: 4 of 5
Ambiance: 4 of 5
Staff Attitude: 4.5 of 5


The only thing I really hate about Sushi Mon is that it is so cramped, which means longer wait for you and your party of however many to get seated. Often, party of 2 gets seated quite fast, but anything over 4 just gets ridiculous from waiting 40 mins to 1 hour. So, be prepared to wait and mingle around Smith's, Dollar Tree, or Toyko Discount before you get seated."}
{"text":"Need a sushi fix? Sushi Mon is an awesome AYCE sushi restaurant. I stop by here every time I'm in Vegas. It's quite small, however, the sushi here is really fresh and satisfies my sushi cravings! I almost always end up with a food coma whenever I'm here. However they do charge for uneaten portions."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Vegas. The food is simple and fresh with a nice sized piece of fish on each nigiri. While some of the nigiri and rolls have sauces, they don't overpower the fish at all. So many other sushi places rely on their sauce, not quality of fish. Since they've been under new management, the quality has gone up. We typically do AYCE, but if we don't, we get a sashimi dinner...so good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp and I assure you that this place deserve the 5 stars ! I tried the Pixie roll and loved it !"}
{"text":"The best sushi place in the sw area! All the staff are friendly and tentative, the chefs are always humorous to talk with while waiting and eating. This place is always packed but for a good reason! I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Sushi, Sushi, & More Sushi! 

A typical sushi restaurant in a strip mall here in West Las Vegas! In my opinion, the all you can eat Sushi is the best part of the menu option. It's nothing like the typical buffet style of all you can eat. They make the Sushi right in front of you! The all you can eat includes the hot portion of the menu! The baked sea scallops is the way to go! I usually get various different rolls and try to eat as much of the different varieties they offer! 

You get 45 mins. to eat as much as you can! You can order 1/2 orders of the maki rolls..the Hamachi is pretty fresh, but then again for the most part, so is everything here! All this for under $30 bucks! 

Service is great! They usually don't miss a step!"}
{"text":"Tried this place back in 2004 and I wasn't a big fan.  Haven't really gone back there until recently.  It's gotten a lot better and I'm amazed the quality of the food.  I used to pick Sushi Factory over Sushi Mon now it's the other way around.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.  It's a little small wish it was bigger to fit more people."}

The sushi is very fresh and nicely displayed. The staff at this restaurant are fabulous!"}

{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas, I have to drop by these place..  The sushi is amazing and fresh..  Everything is delicious, just remember there is always a wait.  It is very worthwhile though.."}
{"text":"Off the strip, but worth the drive.  Went for lunch and ordered the AYCE sushi.  Everything on the sushi menu was AYCE including appetizers and desserts.  Service was also top notch!"}
{"text":"The holy grail of AYCE IMO. This is the place I compare to all other AYCE. Fish is fresh and flavorful. Plenty of different nagiri, cut rolls, and hand rolls to pick from. Whatever sushi you are craving, I'm sure they will have it or something close to it. Lots of side dishes and deserts are also part of the AYCE menu! 

Whenever someone says, \"I found a good AYCE Sushi place.\" I respond with, \"Is it as good as Sushi-Mon.\" The answers vary from \"No\" to \"Close\" but never \"It's better than Sushi-Mon\".

This Sushi-Mon is smaller than the other one (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-mon-las-vegas#hrid:owGWHPWX2k4BruoxMgVNOA). Other than that, it's pretty much the same."}

{"text":"To be honest I gerneally do not make it out to that side of town, although I had a friend working over there and decided to meet her for dinner. With that being said, I arrived early (which is unusual for me) although once there they would not allow me to get a table till our entire party was there. Which placed me sitting akwardly in front of the door in everyones way, rather than at the table. Not happy about this already. The sushi was not necessarily bad, although there was nothing fantastic about it either. All you can eat makes sense when you have a large party... When time to leave our checks were wrong and they could not straighten it out, so we just paid and left. I am just not at big fan! Most likely not going to go back. (Mainly because my regular sushi place is closer, cleaner, better quality of food, and more inviting.) Not to horrible but I don't suggest it. That's just my honest review. Good day."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews here, hubby and I decided to pop by on a Sat night.  Although it was packed, we didn't have a wait because there was only two of us and we sat at the sushi bar.

My thoughts:

--the Maryland location is small-ish, so you're in close quarters with everyone.

-- it had a bit of a fishy smell, more so than other sushi joints. I chalked it up to the close quarters of place.

--they were flexible with the AYCE option. At first, we weren't sure whether we wanted to do AYCE. Sometimes it makes more sense, especially if you want to try lots of different rolls.  But you gotta be ready for AYCE, i.e., have some drawstring sweatpants on.

As we debated, the chef advised us that he would tally the amount once we were done, and charge us whatever was less, whether that be itemizing the rolls or the AYCE price. Awesome!!!

--one of the best things I loved is that they let you order half orders of most rolls. This is really great when there's only two people eating. My husband and I have different tastes, so it can be challenging to eat multiple rolls by myself. But we love trying lots of different rolls. Ordering half rolls was a great option for us.

--that being said, I didn't l-o-v-e the rolls. Don't get me wrong -- it was good but I just didn't think it was *great.* Some of the rolls we had were kinda bland. Maybe it was just an off-night we went. I think I'm willing to give it a try again ;-)"}
{"text":"This is an amazing sushi restaurant! Fast service, quality food, and friendly staff! Thank you for one hell of a Sunday lunch. I recommend the hurricane roll, sexy girl roll, and the super white tuna!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to sushi Mon for past 10 years now. Whenever I make a trip to Vegas, I always make sure to stop by. For past 3 years, they started to decline in their taste and the quality of the sushi. Last visit I had a week ago, the food was terrible and they confused my name with another person's name on the waiting list. So my family had to wait another extra 35 min with an initial hour wait. The manager was extremely impolite and hesitant to apologize. Sushi Mon is not the same as it was years ago. I won't come here anymore. It's time to find a new AYCE sushi in Vegas."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon have become our default sushi place. We always do ayce lunch and order a lot of nigiris. The fish were as fresh as you could hope for here in vegas -- comparable to goyemon (another favorite sushi place). Their rolls were good though none stands out -- but they will make you custom rolls which is great! Aside from our usual nigiris: super white tuna, yellow tail, salmon, eel, red snapper; we always order: frying jason, volcano, dragon roll, mussels, orgasmic salad and whatever else is on the daily special board. They have a more extensive (with grilled fish) dinner menu so its also worth going there for dinner but 808 sushi offers more grilled fish than sushi mon so thats where we go if we feel like having sushi/grilled fish for dinner.

Sushi Mon's service was great and friendly. We get our orders without noticing how long it has been... And we order a lot to get our money's worth! The flow of food coming our way was exceptional and they always refill our teas. The place is small enough that wait staff always see you if you're trying to get their attention. 

One thing i will always come back here for is their lychee sherbet!!! There's not a lot of restaurants here that serve lychee sherbet... its always worth the drive to have a little of this treat!"}
{"text":"When I am on the west side of town this is usually the place my friends and I head to for a sushi fix. Normally we get the all you can eat option and consume more food in one hour than previously believed humanly possible.  I noticed some of the other reviewers have said they felt pressured to finish their meal in an hour, but I have never felt like anyone was watching the clock.  If you get a seat at the bar, cross your fingers that JR is your sushi chef. He is very personable, and makes recommendations for new things to try.  Everything I have ever tried here was tasty and fresh. It's worth stopping in if you are on that side of town."}
{"text":"Ulysses the waitress gave us a vip attention, was kind, did our dinner a beautiful  experience,  thanks Ulysses"}
{"text":"First and foremost I'm no sushi expert, especially when it comes where to go in Vegas but my first meal here was great and i will go again.  The quality isn't upper crust by any means. However the all you can eat sushi menu had great variety IMO.  What made it truly favorable for me was sitting at the bar and being cool with the sushi chef so that he would just hook me up like it was omakase style!
I will most likely try out I Love Sushi and Kaizen Sushi as another friend suggests but I thought Sushi Mon was still worth a good review."}
{"text":"My favorite AYCE sushi in L.V. 
Kind service, fish is always good, really above other all you can eat sushi bars. I love their rolls too. This is a place I never miss when I come to this city."}
{"text":"good food, but service was slow.
in general not bad place but if venue is slow, then service should up to par."}
{"text":"AYCE here is okay. Service is okay, but the sushi quality is okay."}
{"text":"My husband and I have had dinner here a few times.  We love the food and atmosphere, so we decided to go again on our 1st year wedding anniversary, last night.  We were seated at a table, since the sushi bar was full.  Once we were waited on, I noticed the waiter was sort of rushed to take our order.  After our first round, of the \"All you can eat\" deal, the waiter quickly came around and asked if we wanted dessert.  He kept rushing us by asking the same question each time he came back to our table.  Then shortly after he placed the bill on our table. And again, kept coming back to the table to check if we had paid the bill.  This all within 30min of being seated.  We understood there is a time limit, but found it quite rude to have the waiter continuously lifting up the bill to check if we had paid it.  After about 4x of this, I explained to the waiter we would pay at the register, he insisted on having us pay at the table bc they need to clear the table for the next guests.  Meanwhile my husband, still chewing his food, I asked the waiter if my husband could at least finish eating. The waiter then turned and walked away. We received a dismissive apology when we told the cashier we were rushed out of our table.  At least my husband finished his last bite, walking out the door I guess.  Worst. Service. Ever."}
{"text":"Great sushi place off the strip!! Lots of vegan options! My fav rolls are the natto roll n the supreme veggie roll! N it's open late!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, not friendly if you are solo. I guess they can get more money place two people at a table instead of one. Both times I went there the bar was full, they had tables open and they wanted me to wait for a bar seat to open. The first time I left, the second time I made the seat me at a table."}
{"text":"We ate at sushi mon every time we visit Vegas. And we love the place. But this time, they changed the all u can eat menu. No sweet shrimp, no uni, no yellow tail collar. Salmon collar is out, shrimp head miso soup out. Don't know how to order now."}
{"text":"This place is trash. The food is nasty, and they have horrible service. I should've done a dine and ditch, because this was not worth $26, I am disgusted."}
{"text":"Workers here stare at you while you eat to make sure you are really eating your rice with your sushi. We went as soon as they open for lunch and today's special Kanpachi was written on the board, but then when we ordered 5 of those, they said they don't have any more and erased from the board. After we came out, I saw them writing Kanpachi on the board again. Foods tasted alright. Don't do the all-you-can-eat if you are so concerned about how much we eat. We were not satisfied to come back."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi. Tasty, large selection of nigiri and rolls, and friendly staff. This store's sister is Sushi Goyemon up in Spring Valley. Goyemon is also one of the highest rated sushi spots in town, and there is no percievable difference in the food, as they have the same menu and prices. Of course the actual chef could be having an off night or something that would make the quality suffer, but I've eaten at both locations multiple times and have never had that issue!

Some of my favorites are the super white tuna (seriously, I could just eat 10 servings of this and call it a day), the sexy girl roll, and of course the $6 giant Sapporo beers.

Inside is actually very small. I'd say something around 20 seats at the bar and about 10 tables. However, the longest I've had to wait is about 30 minutes and they will give you a call when a table or bar is ready.

If you live nearby, get the AYCE club card or whatever they call it. Takes 10 meals to get a free one, but after going a few times with my girl we are almost already there as they count all diners as individual meals, not 1 for the group which is nice!"}
{"text":"I love sushi mon!! We go there at least 3 times a month, food is good, service is good. My favorite roll there is the miles roll!!!! Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places. The all you can eat prices are really low during lunch and pretty decent during dinner time. All of their rolls taste amazing. I have been to this location and the other one time each. I can't help but say this is the best place to eat sushi. The chefs are kind of slow, especially when busy, that would be their only reason I wouldn't give them a 5 star rating. Other than that.. They offered great customer service the servers made sure my drink were always filled and they always checked to see if we needed something from the actual kitchen, because on the all you can eat menu they didn't have just sushi. You could order teriyaki chicken bowls, rice, poki, and other stuff. The Takoyaki (fried Octopus Ball) was really good not the best but it was pretty good! One of my favorite roll would have been the Dragon roll (California roll with eel on top and eel sauce) it was amazing. I would go back again. If you can eat a lot I recommend going here during lunch and getting the all you can eat you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sushi Monday is around the corner from me, and it's a solid choice for tasty Japanese food, especially late night. I'm not a sushi aficionado by any means, so this review will just cover the standard fare. The tempura is fresh and piping hot, therefor yummy. The age gyoza is great. Beef bowl is a delish winner, and the teriyaki bowls also have sliced asparagus, a perfect addition. The big complaint I have is how busy and popular they are! They take reservations, and it's a must have on weekends, unless you enjoy waiting for an empty table. They also do a great to-go business, so if you are like me, you call and order, then pick it up, and avoid how busy they can be."}
{"text":"Been going here since 2011 food quality went downhill, tuna texture rubbery, not fresh. Not going back."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, but has gone down hill. The same rolls are never consistent from chef to chef anymore. They also are very wet and falling apart most of the time. When we had rolls delivered to our table that were different than what we ordered, the waitress argued with us about how \"sushi works\" and that it's an art. I pointed at the menu which clearly defined the items meant to be in our roll and she finally took the wrong order away while rolling her eyes. 

This place used to be great. We'd eat here about every 2 weeks for all you can eat at lunch. My entire office is never going back after the decline in service and food quality over the last few months. I hope you figure it out Sushi Mon, you were the only decent sushi on this side of town for lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place. Service is always wonderful. The chefs are awesome. I always do the all you can eat. The bang for your buck. Plus you get deserts. If you get the opportunity to have chef Alfredo he's is amazing! Once he know what you like he will create sushi that cater to your flavor. The conversation is always great with the chefs. Everything is fresh. And I love their green tea creme breule."}

{"text":"All you can eat lunch time 11:45 -4:00 $21.95 person was good some dish are dinner like yellow tail salmon still good"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is a great little place about 20 minutes away from the strip if you're looking for an all you can eat sushi paradise.  My friends and I came here after a full day of cruising the strip and felt like gorging ourselves with some good sushi.   The decor is about average for a small sushi place.  The service was great as we had what felt like 3 servers going in and out of our table.  About half of our group ordered all you can eat and the rest ordered a la carte.   Their list of rolls is probably the most expansive I've seen so far.  Since i got the all you can eat I ordered a couple rolls to start off with before a server let me know that I can order half rolls.

Being able to order half rolls in an all you can sushi place is like the invention of sliced bread for a bakery; it was astonishing how much more of the menu I tried just because of the ability to order most things at half portions.  Most of the rolls were great and some were just too weird for my taste buds.  Another plus to the menu was the choice of dessert that comes with the all you can eat order.  Maybe I haven't been to enough sushi places but most that I know do not include desserts in their orders.  All in all, I had about 5 half rolls, 3 full rolls ( I can't remember what they were though...) and some mochi ice cream for good measure.  I came out of the place waddling like a penguin due to the food knocking my center of gravity out of whack.  Overall, 5 stars for the great service, good food, half order ability and dessert offerings.  Sushi Mon is a GREAT restaurant outside the strip that sushi/roll lovers should check out when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Sushimon is my usual go to place for AYCE, but the food tonight was terrible. Everything I ate was so MUSHY. The rice and fish were both too soft. I couldn't even taste anything. The terrible texture pretty much killed my appetite. Also, there was a hair in the dipping sauce that came with my shrimp tempura. I noticed that a majority of the sushi chefs were Hispanic rather than Japanese? Uhhh don't know if that affected anything, but I'm hoping it was just an off night for them."}
{"text":"Timed all-you-can-eat doesn't usually work well for slow eaters like me, but 45 minutes was plenty of time since the food came out pretty quickly.

The Thurs night that we went, the specials written on 8x10 sheets taped to the wall were not fantastic. We felt tricked into thinking the specials would be better since you're only allowed one order per person of those...

The regular sushi and rolls on the printed menu were super fresh and yummy though. We were so full that we skipped mochi and ice cream at the end!"}
{"text":"I dont like to hurt small business by writing negative reviews but this place surely deserve it. I felt taken for my money at the end of the day. That was one of the worst culinary experiences I have ever had.  Horrible service and no service is what I got at this joint.. Food way below average.... Their rolls are blend and tasteless.... Not to mention they dont even look like on the picture. The food is not prepared by Japanese chef but rather a dude with a Spanish accecnt. I h o nestly enjoyed only 1 roll out of 7 I ordered. Never was greeded upon arrival,  Never heard thank you once upon leavin. I will be sure to stay away from sushi mon"}
{"text":"Great to find a sushi place as good as this in Henderson! We love going to Goyemon on Decatur but wanted to find a place closer, and Sushi Mon is owned by the same company. OUTSTANDING Sushi and sashimi! Also great little side salad and miso soup! 

My only complaint was the orange chicken wasn't real crispy and was smothered in sauce, so I wasn't able to eat it all. However, stick to the fish and you're golden! We got the sashimi dinner, andy roll, and the taylor and they were all fantastic!

We were also happy with the servers and the sushi chef behind the counter (we sat at the bar) so no complaints on the service side either!

If you're nearby, you MUST check this place out! So good!"}
{"text":"Been to both Sushi Mons, I have to say I like the one on w Sahara much better than this one...........
I went with 2 friends on a Friday afternoon trying to have a quick lunch, we all had AYCE option, we didn't have to wait but the restaurant was pretty full so we were seated at the bar. The waitress wanted us to order directly from the chef, there are 2 of them inside the bar but they were always so busy it's hard to order from them, there were only 2 of them, a lot of times we ordered 2 order on one item,but it only came out with one, and you can't order more than 3 items with different quantities 'cause he will mess up 100%, also you have to pretty much be yelling at the chef to make orders because he is so busy and far a way. The quick lunch took us 2 and half hours, about more than 2 hours of that time we had nothing to eat and nothing to do but staring at the busy chef........
The ratio of meat to rice is also not as good as the Sushi Mon on W Sahara, with more rice and less meat. 
The only thing better about this location is the menu is larger , with a lot more selections and special rolls,,,Oh, the mochi is delicious, but you get the same thing elsewhere.
My friend asked the server several times for more ginger, but no, the server kept forgetting, so I just gave my ginger to my friend since I don't like it that much.....
I say they need more cooks and servers if they are so busy ....."}
{"text":"I cannot get myself to eat sushi elsewhere! I have been loyal to this place for as long as I can remember. I live on the northwest part of town and willingly travel out here whenever I want some good sushi. The bf invited me for dinner here last night and said \"hell yaa!\" without hesitation. We got the all you can eat for 26 bucks a head.
Here's a list of things we ordered:
seared tuna and salmon
Ahi poki
'fresh' scallop
Yellowtail collar
Shrimp shumai
Tarro(fish of the day)
Super white 
Eel
Spicy shrimp yum yum rolls
Gyoza(his order)
Tempura ice cream

Our orders consisted  mostly of nigiris except the shrimp yum yum rolls because we don't like other things on the fish (like cream cheese..eck!) but anyway everything was,as usual, deliciously fresh. Well, except the scallops, it tasted a wee funny. It didn't taste as fresh as they claimed it to be. But the BEST PART was that TARRO !! I can eat three orders if it wasn't limited to one order per person! And the super white is to die for! A must frikken try! They used to limit the order for this before the tarro fish came out and now order as much as you can! Yay! We finished off with the tempura ice cream and satisfaction finally kicked in. 

Overall, great food, the staff(servers) actually improved as far as the service, and definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Went here cuz it was recommended by other friends. They have a huge variety of rolls. The great thing about the nigri Sushi is that it doesn't have ALOT of rice. Overall, the food I give a 3, but the AYCE pricing is very good which I believe is $26.95 and you get 60 mins to eat. The Sushi Chef we had seem did not seem personable, which kinda annoyed me since we had to be seated right in front of him at the Sushi Bar."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon's menu for the price, selection, and quality (especially quality of seafood brought into the desert) are the best I have ever had. I have been frequenting this place over the years and have had the same good service every time. The sushi chefs and some of the employees that I have seen and talked to here at this location are from Japan, good to have some authenticity. All of the friends that I have brought here have loved the food and usually have bought the All You Can Eat special and happy with the value.

I recommend the All You Can Eat special; lunch time costs less than dinner, you have to eat everything you order, and you have like 45 min to an hour to eat so come hungry! If your not sharing with others consider getting half rolls so you get to try more and not fill up so quick. The special includes some non-sushi items that I like including Baked Mussels, Tempura Shrimp, Fried Calamari, and Cucumber Salad. Sushi Rolls are awesome here, flavor, the rice, the ingredients, can't go wrong. You want quality similar to local Nobu and Hamada at under $30.00 per person without feeling pretentious and don't mind simple decor then this is the place you should go in Vegas to eat sushi. Don't forget dessert, I recommend the Green Tea or Red Bean Ice Cream.

Sushi Mon use to be open until 4am way back in the day when it first started business, now it is still open pretty late, but not 24 hours. The line can get pretty long if you go during busy hours but definitely worth the wait.

Here are some pics from my last visit:

Don't forget to grab a punch card when you pay! This saved me lots of money over the years.

{"text":"Been going here for years, staff knows us and treats us very well. I seem to go here at least once a week or once every other week. Usually order togo but it tastes as good as if I were to dine in which is hard to find with sushi."}
{"text":"Sushimon- I have such a love/ hate feeling for you. It was a big step to go back after seeing a cockroach freely walking around your establishment. Which by the way, when we told the manager there was a roach, they quickly told us that it was a spider. Hmm. Roach.. Spider.. Roach? Two totally different things. But anyway, that's in the past. I have gone back a few times since then because the sushi is delicious. Many times I've gone while it was slow so the service was great. Oh but today, today someone had a case of the Mondays.

I was seated at the bar and at first, the service was great. The servers came by, checked on us, refilled drinks.. And of course the food was amazing. Then, came time for dessert. I tried flagging down any server passing by, one did look my way but kept walking. Okayyy.. I even went to the extreme of flailing my arms in the air and still, nothing. Finally, someone came over. I mentioned how we were forgotten and waiting for awhile. His response, \"so what can I get for you?\" Well. For damned sure you're going to get me my order cause I'm telling you to. But really? No acknowledgment of my comment, no apology, nothing. It's so sad because Sushimon's food is so good but their service leaves such a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"I had been here once before which the customer service was a lot better I think it was because we were being attended by the Sushi chefs. I went in recently again decided to take my cousin from LA to go have some all you can eat which turned out to be a nightmare the waitress brought us out our 1st order when we where going to order more she looked at my cousins plate and told her she had to eat that and pointed, we did'nt notice anything because we finished everything she came over again and got the plate and pointed at literaly 5 pieces of rice grains and told her again she had to eat that before ordering more well she did so we ordered more and finally it was time for dessert I dont eat sweets but my 6yr old son kept asking for Mango Mochi being that its included in the all you can eat I figured sure no problem as long as it get's eaten well here she comes again heard my son say \"mommy mango mochi\" she looked at me and said \"he cannot eat the ice cream\" I said \"excuse me? it's included in my all you can eat as long as it gets eaten there shouldnt be any problem it's not like I was feeding my kid sushi he had his own order of teryaki.\" she said \"Those are the rules\"  I told her to just bring it to me but she was waiting for me to say he wasnt going to eat it before she brought it I did not say that because the DAMN ICE CREAM was for my son not me. HORRIBLE service I get the all you can eat rules but this lady went overboard which cost her, her tip."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and it's very hard to find a place that has all you can eat sushi that doesn't sacrifice quality.  

When I first went here, I heard about the oysters and had to try.  They were delicious.  I now come a few times a month.  Well worth the money too."}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi place! We've tried many, and although most are good, this one just has everything we could possibly want. Huge selection, every possible combination, and they all work out awesome. My favorites are the stacey, the pastel and the j.j. Do leave some room for dessert (yep, you read me!). The lychee sorbet is incredible, the green tea creme brulee is to die for, don't get me started on the mochi ice cream, and chocolate mousse and ... I'll stop typing right now and head there! It is a terrific place!"}
{"text":"This was my go to place in Vegas. I have been going here for many years but was recently disappointed.  But I've heard that the owners changed and this may be the reason why the quality has suffered. The Sushi portions were ridiculously smaller, the quality of the cuts were off and the rice was bland overall.  I don't think I will be coming here again after so many years. I think they were trying to save some money by hiring inexperienced and untrained Sushi chefs.  I know that restaurants start to go downhill when they try to skimp on quality. What use to be five stars is now only two. Oh well Sushi Mon it was nice knowing you."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley!  Not only is this in my neighborhood; which makes it great, they have some of the best sushi around. Never too long of a wait and always quality service. Competitive pricing and large selection of rolls. Its nice to go back and get the same sushi chef each time."}
{"text":"had lunch here.  beef teriyaki plate.
wasn't bad.  beef was kinda tough.  but the sushi was good.
little side plates were good too.  haven't tried the all you can eat sushi.
but i assume it's not too bad.  20-25/person for AYCES."}
{"text":"After a busy day of gambling, drinking, and checking out various casinos, my boys and I were in the mood for some serious grubbage.  Our other friend suggested this place, and said for $27, you can get all you can eat sushi as well as anything else on their menu.

It's a fairly small place and it took us about 20 minutes to get a seat.  Not too bad a wait, but since all of us were so hungry, it seemed like forever.

Once you sit down, you can start ordering.  Stick to the nigiri choices, unless there are some rolls on the menu that look good (we ordered quite a few spider rolls).  A brief breakdown of what we ordered:

Salmon nigiri - 5/5
Maguro - 4/5
Ebi - 5/5
Hamachi - 4/5
Unagi - 5/5
Spider roll - 5/5
Shrimp heads - 4/5
Uni- 1/5 (color and taste was not good)...the only thing that sucked

Orders came out fairly quickly.  I liked the fact that the rice balls for the nigiri were small sized....this place doesn't try to fill you up on the rice.  Everything was really fresh and tasty.  Service was friendly and efficient.

One hour later, we waddled out, having completely killed this place.  I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Good service!!! The fish were fresh!!'  Most importantly, fast!!! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Whenever I see the words \"sushi\" and \"buffet\" combined together, images of horrible, unmentionable evil spring to mind and I am left a cowering mess underneath a table somewhere.

So when I found myself in Vegas in a rush for a sushi fix, Sushi Mon was brought to my attention.  A buffet, I cautiously whispered.  This can't be good.

But no - looking at the Yelp reviews, it defiantly stared back at me w/ its four star rating and dared me to say anything to the contrary.  Fine, I told myself.  *I* will be the judge of that.

The verdict:  It wins.

The place is pretty damn awesome.  It's a quick drive from the strip (and on top of that, it's easy to navigate to which helps a lot for newbs) and parking is simple b/c it's located right in a strip mall.

Strip mall sushi buffet = ZOMGWTFBBQ BAD, right?  RIGHT?!

No, damn you!  This place is GOOD!!!

The buffet is less than $30 / person for dinner and considering that each roll is about $10, you're getting a deal and a half going for the buffet option.  And unlike most sushi buffets that like to give you a high rice/fish ratio for their rolls, this place keeps that ratio relatively low and gives you a decent amount of fish per roll.

The rolls are decently sized and tasty.  I'm a big fan of spicy tuna rolls (I can hear all the purists groaning) and this place has the \"911 Roll\" which is THE SPICIEST TUNA ROLL EVER.  It's like eating fire wrapped around some tuna, rice and seaweed.  It is beyond brilliant.

If you're in the Las Vegas area and want to fill up on some quality sushi at a steal of a price, Sushi Mon is the place to be.

+1 for the late hours."}
{"text":"By far my most favorite sushi place. I always get the Ah Chi Chi roll and the Cajun Albacore.
The staff has always been extremely friendly to us, and the all you can eat is a good price. The fish is always great quality every time we go in and if you haven't tried the Green Tea Creme Brulee, I highly reccomend it."}
{"text":"Have eaten here consistently for years and if it's anything, my experience is always consistently good for AYCE. Generally speaking, quality offerings including some fresh catch on special, which, without question is the way to go and fill up on if doing AYCE. Tip: they'll sub out the fish on special for standard roll inclusions if you ask and you're doing AYCE (for example yellowtail belly vs. yellow tail). I'd like to see larger cuts served generally, especially on Nigiri, as well as more wild caught offerings rather than the mostly farm-raised variety (salmon belly) but I'm nitpicking."}
{"text":"VEGAS.  I really not a gamling type of guy, and if I was, I would probably count cards and kick everyone's ass at the blackjack table.  I have a semi-photographic memory and remembering things is not that difficult for me.  

Remembering this restaurant, however, is easy, even for a dufus.  Drive just a bit south of the Mandalay, and you will find an oasis of good sushi in the middle of nowhere.  It is located in a strip mall with Dollar Tree and other misc stores and the parking lot is huge and EMPTY.  Stuck in the middle is Sushi Mon.  

Ya, ya, ya!  The fish melts in your mouth, the waitresses are cute, and the chefs are freindly.  This was a place recommeded by you yelpers; and this place didnt disappoint."}
{"text":"I would call myself a regular here, not just because it's in my area but because I know what to expect every time. The fish quality is always up to par. The service is pretty good, depending on how busy it is. The wait could get long when sitting at a table, so I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar for quicker service. The price for AYCE (all you can eat) sushi is reasonable, as long as I get my mochi dessert at the end I'm a happy camper. Definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is Great!! Sit at the bar and get the AYCE ... Only problem with this place is that it's small, so sometimes it's hard to get a seat."}
{"text":"I like this place because their fish is pretty fresh compare to other AYCE. It's alway busy there and so I get to wait many times but its worth it. Will come back for hot sake and my favorite uni."}
{"text":"Just walked in and after ordering my son notices their health grade certificates on the wall. They had two,  B and C.  Staff was nice, but I probably should have left when I saw these grades."}
{"text":"Good sushi at a good price. Recommend for those who like to eat sitting close to strangers."}
{"text":"I ate here a lot until a recent experience.  There seems to be a shift in the quality and service from the past. There were new slow inexperienced servers now unlike before. I usually get AYCE and never had any issues.  Now they are like sushi nazi's. Watching the clock to make sure you don't order anything even a minute past your allowed time, trying to charge me for one piece of uneaten sushi from a roll I didn't really care for, I felt the eyes looking at us making sure my girlfriend who didn't get AYCE didn't have any of my order, etc.  they also seemed to disappear after my first round of ordering trying to allow the clock to run down, and limit the amount of sushi I could order in the time frame.  All in all it seems like they are out to save as much money, and pinch all the  pennies as possible (scary with a sushi restaurant). I also had a frequent AYCE card that was filled up and ready to use for a free meal. I had no idea, but it had expired the day before. They refused to accept it!  

I won't be going there anymore, and they lost a loyal customer.  They saved a penny, but only to loose a dollar."}
{"text":"AMAZING! If you like to eat a lot of sushi, this is the best place in town! Between the all-you-can-eat price, the abundance of nigiri / roll options, and the quality of food, Sushi Mon is the place to eat in Las Vegas! It is a little bit of a drive from the strip, but it is completely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years.  There is usually a wait after 6:00pm.  Sushi is fresh and the Uni is yummy compared to other places.  Decent service and worth the money if you have a big appetite."}
{"text":"This sushi is da bomb, best sushi for the price I've ever had. One thing that I think is pathetic is what I saw from the customers. This is all you can eat but its not a buffet, serve yourself type.
People are leaving $1 or $2 tips for meals they paid over $24 for. Then, the waitress has to run back and forth many times for you and give you all you want. Then, people stiff them for only a dollar or two. If you're getting poor service that's fine but almost everyone that rated them, loved the food and the service! Please take care of your servers, if you haven't noticed good ones are hard to find!
The lunch waitresses are much better than the night ones but remember there's only 2 of them serving the whole restaurant and no cashier to help them.
I know most customers are college kids and probably don't care but remember these waitresses only get minimum wage so with anyone in a restaurant the tips help them the most. Someday you may work a minimum wage job and see what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"Pretty average sushi spot. Spider roll very good though, nicely crisped soft shell crab. Service very pleasant and generally quick. Too many other good places for sushi to prompt a return visit."}
{"text":"yummy!!  i crave sushi mon all the time because the salmon and yellowtail is so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Wow... for ayce sushi.... its amazing.  The quality of the maguro was unbelievable, especially being in the middle of a desert.   The Hawaiian roll melts in your mouth.  a new fav."}
{"text":"I'll definitely come here next time I'm in town. Great food, friendly people."}
{"text":"Service here is less than sub par. We were told twenty minutes and when we inquired why we weren't seated after twenty minutes we were told to wait ten minutes and we proceeded to wait another 30 minutes. People who arrived after we did were seated even without reservation. Seriously bad business. I wouldn't come here nor would I recommend anyone to come here."}
{"text":"Taste and quality-wise, this place is probably the best all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant I have ever been to (so far.) I have tried Makino last year and the sushi is waaaay better here. The quality of the sushi is great. I had mostly nigiri sushi. The bincho was great, salmon and hamachi were great. The hokki... well it tasted like hokki. I didn't like it too much but I think the hokki I had in Japan tasted the same. The amount of rice was perfect as well. Not too much, not too little. I also had the Caterpillar Roll and the American Dream Roll. Both are unagi-based rolls and they were good. It was on the menu, but they didn't have hirame. bummer.

The only complaint I have of this restaurant was the grumpy old sushi chef . I'll refer to him as Gosc from here on. You'll know who I'm talking about when you go there. My wife and I were seated at the sushi bar right in front of him. Instead of ordering sushi from the waitresses, we were told to order our sushi directly from the Gosc. I guess it was because he was busy, he seemed really crabby and didn't acknowledge us at all. We tried to get his attention and he told us to wait. There was a sign on the table to tell customers to order a little at a time. We did that when we ordered, but the Gosc growled back at us and said something like \"order more at once because it's busy and that's easier for me!\" To be fair, I think it could've been a language issue. He may have had problems expressing himself in English and it made him sound like a Gosc... Or maybe he WAS a Gosc. His mood did improve once the busYness subsided and we were able to make some friendly small talk afterwards. 

Great sushi for a good price TRUMPS the bad service. I will probably go there again the next time I visit Vegas. And this time I will try there dinner menu, which includes amaebi, snow crab, and uni. and maybe they will have hirame next time...."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi place.  I've been going here for years!

Definitely order the all you can eat and don't forget that it includes ALL food items on the menu (apps, dessert, etc).  The fact that I can order a lychee sherbet, plum sherbet, AND red bean ice cream for dessert makes it so worth it. :)  Also make sure to check out the daily specials that are posted on the walls."}
{"text":"service was great!  then sushi came rice fell apart when i picked it up, ikura had a very sweet taste (not common) my daughter who loves them could'nt stand the taste.
other nigiri was dry, salmon skin hand roll had only bits and pieces. my daughter had just the the salmon off my nigiri the waitress wanted to charge me the ayce price! for her   WTF! did i mention the 45 min wait at 5:30pm."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick late night sushi date with my good friend , right off the bat our server was rude , didn't sense good vibes from him at all , he literally took 20 mins to take our order wasn't busy at all .. He was standing there talking to his friend. Finally when he saw us \" giving him the eye \" is when he came .. The food was okay not to expensive ... Could have been better , literally had to keep flagging him down .. The services overall sucked"}
{"text":"Always awesome. Love all the special rolls. My favorite Sushi spot at home. Great service and excellent Sushi - the rice is a little soggy at times. I haven't done \"All You Can Eat\" in a while, but the value is great. Get there early or very late. There is always a wait at the peak hours."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!!! I really recommend the dynamite, green mussels and hurricane First time here and I just love it"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best all you can eat sushi bars i've been to.  The selection cannot be beat, where else can you get sea urchin or buttery raw shrimp included? Only gripe, Mochi ice cream was a lil frozen when we got it.  Delicious and a great value at 22 for lunch (i think)."}
{"text":"They should really call this place Sushi Nom Nom Nom.  All you can eat sushi... and so much better than the places on the strip.

It might not be comparable to haute cuisine, but its pretty damn good for the amount you pay.  One hour is more than enough and the thing I like best is that you can have half orders of rolls.  Don't forget to leave a tiny bit of room for dessert too.

Come hungry, leave uncomfortably stuffed."}
{"text":"I've gone here several times before and I remember years ago it was pretty decent, but the last few times I leave there being completely dissatisfied.  My parents enjoy it since it's close to them.  The rolls are loaded with rice and tasteless chewy fish.  I should have ordered cooked food.  And the service.... I literally had to flag 3 servers down and it wasn't even that busy.  Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and passed on the AYCE, so I do not know what that experience would have been like but it seems a common theme amongst many reviews here. 
Ordering off the menu was a fine, the combination box offered chicken, tuna, salmon, California roll, tempura, rice, salad and miso soup. Sushi was very tasty and the drinks menu reasonably priced.
The spot was well frequented by locals, always a good sign for out of town visitors like my group.
Atmosphere pretty plain, we sat at one of the few tables that feel squeezed in. 
Contrary to other reviews we saw only Japanese sushi chefs working behind the bar.
We saw the ACYE option during lunch, the dinner menu offers more options than the lunch. Given the rather strict rules including the 45 minute time limit, I doubt we would have tried it anyway."}
{"text":"sushi mon really is one of the best sushi restaurants in town.  the lunch/dinner specials are really tasty...but the best bang for your buck is the all you can eat menu.  it's the best way to experiment with different rolls and it's such a great deal for sushi.  $25 per person for dinner sounds pricey...but when you consider the fact that it's all you can eat sushi/fish, it's actually really inexpensive.  

try out the baked green mussels.  they're delicious.  also, drink some green tea while you're there.  it's so good for you!  try the seaweed salad too...but if you're not into it, make sure you share it with someone, because you have to eat everything or else you get charged.  

the best place to sit is at the sushi bar.  the sushi chefs will get you your order right away and you get to watch them prepare everything too."}
{"text":"1 year ago I was really craving sushi and my personal trainer recommended this place. I'm serious when I say that you can't go wrong with this place, especially with the \"all you can eat\" deal. Almost every weekend I have to eat sushi and this is the best in town!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly since '09, and I have to say, they have probably the best nigiri creations in town. I am more into the traditional japanese sushi, none of that western sushi (dragon roll, california, & philly roll kinda stuff). That said, I cannot comment or review about their western sushi rolls. Fish to rice ratio is well done. If you're feeling adventurous, order deep fried shrimp heads (not on the menu)."}
{"text":"When you think of a Sushi Buffet, I'm not sure that many real sushi fans think of it positively. Most sushi buffets don't offer fresh fish or great service, so I didn't go into this place thinking that I'd be striking gold or discovering great quality sushi. However, I was pleansantly surprised at the quality of the sushi, and the friendly service. It wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, but it wasn't all that bad. The fact that the fish tasted fairly fresh, and that I didn't have to worry about the price (since it's a flat-cost)... made this a pretty good place to dine. I also came here with several friends, so it's definitely a suitable place for groups to gather. The friendly and noisy atmosphere made it a nice place for younger crowds, but I think in about 5-6 more years, I may think this place is a bit too noisy for me to have a pleasant dinner with friends... Maybe if it's right after I just won big in Vegas, and in the mood to scream and yell in joy... I may tolerate it a bit more. But, the restaurant itself isn't all that bad."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of sushi (too filling) but I love sashimi.

With sushi, restaurants can get away with less-than-fresh fish by adding sweet things to it like gravy, etc. (I don't think the authentic Japanese restaurants never do this so if you find sweet gravy or sauce on your sushi, that's probably not authentic Japanese or the fish tastes stale on its own).

With sashimi, there's no getting away with stale fish.

I loved my Sushi Mon experience today because the Sashimi Dinner was reasonably priced (about $13) for the ample serving they provide, the service was great, and the fish was delectably fresh.

Additional notes:

It's hard to get a table at Sushimon -  and I live about 10 minutes away, so lately I've found it practical to order takeout by phone. The food is just as good."}
{"text":"I think my honey and & I finally found our favorite lil hole in the all place to eat, lol. From the exterior Sushi Mon looks fairly decent until you step in and the interior gives off that hole in the place feel mind you it's that feeling that makes it diamond in the rough.
All I have to say is the super white tuna is superb it taste's like melted butter in your mouth. The service was great and quick and who's ever heard of tempura ice cream? Of all the joint's we've ate at we've obviously never heard of it and I must say it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Spectacular all you can eat deal.  Quality is top notch.  Always look forward to going here when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh my God!!!!
This is the best sushi place ever...
I mean I've been to several sushi restaurants all over before...
Plus, my parents own a sushi restaurant in Billings, Montana.

I like to go to this cozy little restaurant whenever I have my chance to go to Las Vegas. Also, I like this place.. because it's not too fancy and you can just casually sit at the bar.. and chat with families and friends.. and don't have to worry how loud you get.. Well.. at some point you need to shut up! lol

I went again for the second time two weeks ago. (Since I don't live in LV, it was only my second time.. how sad..) Everybody had their dinner around like at 8pm and.. somebody said.. let's have sushi tonight!
ok... we had a pretty big dinner.. and sushi? but who can say no to Sushi-mon? So everybody started to walk the neighborhood for like an hour or two to burn some calories before we went for sushi.. (Hey! anything for great sushi! lol) then.. we went there like at 11:30pm.. still open and very busy.  Though they were out of serveral kinds that I really liked, but, at the same time, we went to the restaurant like an hour or two before they closed.  It was great even if I couldn't get my halibut and the other goodies.  

Ok.. here is what I think of Sushi-mon.

First, the qualitiy of the fish.. is great.. I think it was like close to $30 for dinner.
You have about an hour to eat up all  you wanted to eat for sushi.
a whole HOUR!!!!

They have so many other choices of sushi to pick from.
When I went to Sushi-mon for the first time like two years ago, I was a little skeptical about the quality, freshness, variety of the fish.
Then I looked at the menu.. I was surprised by the variety of the sushi, appetizers, and dessert to pick from!
Then they were not pre-made at all!  they make it right front of you once you order it.. depends on how many orders or how busy they are.. it takes about 5 minutes to get your order! Hey! c'mon! five minutes? That's so quick!
quality and freshness of the fish... wow... that's another jaw dropping situation.
I don't know how they afford all that!
Very fresh.. tasty.. good quality of sushi!

I know they were fresh.. and good.. because I also have a great knowledge of sushi by working at the sushi restaurant for so many years.
You can have my word on it! I promise you, you won't be disappointed if you like sushi.
Go down to Sushi-mon once you are in Las Vegas!
They are cheap, fresh, and very tasty!
It will make your belly very happy!

Thank you for great service once again, Sushi-mon!"}
{"text":"Use to come here all the time when I was in town and loved it. Came here the other day and was very disappointed, either they changed owners or switched there food quality. The fish was not good quality and very dry. The menu prices are not what you see on your bill. Check your bill cuz the add a bunch of add ons not stayed on the menu or the waiter. For the bill I had to pay, I could have had great quality sushi for that price at a luxury hotel on the strip. Save your time and stay on the strip for good sushi."}
{"text":"I always go here for All You Can Eat sushi. They always give good service and also good food! It's a bit pricier than other sushi restaurants but I believe it's worth it at the end."}
{"text":"Close to home... First time trying Sushi and it was excellent!!! Small place but worth it..
To go is just as good as well!!!"}
{"text":"26 bucks All you can eat is the only way to go. Sushi is bomb all the traditional rolls. Clean and orderly if i want ayce this is the place to go"}
{"text":"I am a long time Sushi Mon patron and I am pissed! Sushi Mon used to be high quality sushi at an all u can eat price. Now it is LOW quality sushi at a very high all u can eat price. I moved from Vegas a few years ago but come back to eat every time I am in town until now. The year 2010 I ate at Sushi Mon on four different occasions and the quality was worse every time. It seemed to be even worse during lunch time. Do your-self and your waistline as well a favor and go sit down in a relaxing environment elsewhere and get some great fish."}
{"text":"I went both of Sushi Mon; West Sahara, Henderson. I prefer to go Sahara. Service is great, and sushi chefs are all Japanese, who knows exactly what sushi is supposed to be. I normally don't eat rolls much, so I don't have anything to say.

Nigiri, here in sahara sushi mon, is really good. Great ratio of rice and raw fish, sashimi. Also, the rice is marinated really well."}
{"text":"Last week I ate here with four friends on friday. Their customer service was great, rolls we ordered came out quick, and they were not bothered by how loud we were."}
{"text":"I have such a hard time talking about this place. It's not my favorite place to go to but then it again it has some items that I absolutely love there. So let's talk about what I normally order and we'll go from there.

Salmon collar: Yepp, you read it right, salmon collar. This is the only place in Vegas that I know of that has this dish and when it's done correctly, it's so fabulous. Salmon collar is the cheek of the salmon. So you get this salmon flavor fatty part that is just so tender and literally melts in your mouth. It's done with a miso glaze here and again, when it's right (not too salty, which is usually most of the time) is just delicious. I swear  by this dish with a side of white rice, very asian of me. I will admit that I will come here just for this dish.

Green salad: Oh yah. I don't know what is in the dressing but it's one of my favorite dressing. I usually order a side of it to take home because I'll dress all my salads with this dressing if I could. So bright and refreshing.

Shrimp head miso: It's not on the menu so you gotta tell them shrimp head miso. It just adds just the right about of brine and salt to the miso. You don't have to eat the shrimp head but it's worth the try. You're in Vegas, right?

Nebakyaki udon: Served in a clayish pot and pretty darn good. I love udon but there's something different about it that makes me crave it. And when I crave udon, this is the udon that will cure my cravings. The only thing that I still find soooooooooooo odd and needs to be changed is, you CANNOT have this to go. I guess it's that hard for the owners to order big to go cups. I hope changes soon because I would have this soup more often if I could take it home.

All baked rolls: Okay, I going to let you all in on a small secret, I don't eat anything raw. I know, I know, don't judge me. But the good news is I can tell you that about the cooked stuff. No? Still not a good excuse? Well, deal with it. But, again, all the baked sushi is good there. Sometimes you just want to be unhealthy and break the cycle and have some cream cheese on my sushi. Speaking of, try the Frying Jason roll, one of my favorites here.

Now, the not so fun part, SERVICE. Where is the customer service? This place is the worst when it comes to service, minus the sushi chefs. ALL the servers there are so incompetent. They never seem to know whose section is whose. We get asked for water at least twice, I guess it's better than nothing, no one comes to check on you and you HAVE TO FIND anyone if you want to order more food, especially when you have the all you can eat. I wish they were just hire people that knew how to be servers. You're job is to be helpful, bring food to the table and check up on your guest, is it that hard for you to do? You're not in a fine dining restaurant, can you at least manage to be helpful?

If this place didn't have the few items that I can't seem to find at any other sushi place, I wouldn't come here. But, if you're lucky and come when there's no lunch or dinner rush, you'll find this place to be just that, okay.

Ciao and until next time, happy eating everyone :)"}
{"text":"AYCE. 60 minutes to chow down. The 911 roll is ridiculously spicy. It warns you on the menu, but oh man. My entire mouth was on fire. I also had the orion roll. Very tasty. The staff was slow to come back and get our order, but as our stay continued the service picked up. My husband wasn't impressed with his tuna roll. He felt like it had been made and was sitting out.  However he loved his spam roll and his deep fried California roll. All in all a pretty successful dinner."}
{"text":"I love the variety of this place.  The all you can eat option allows you to eat tons of different kinds of sushi and side dishes.  The quality of the fish was okay, but I wasn't expecting much from an all you can eat sushi place.  I recommend getting half orders so you can try more options.  The service was very fast and friendly and I would defeinitely come back again."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Friendly staff and delicious sushi!!! We love to sit at the sushi bar and try as many sushi possibilities. I love this place as I am able to request hand rolls and their specials of the day are exquisite. All-you-can-eat with a lychee ice cream to seal the deal. Will re-visit when I am back in town."}
{"text":"I don't know why there's pressure to say up front that I'm no sushi expert (no one seems to say they are not Chinese or Italian food experts when reviewing pizza or dim sum joints, right?), but it seems like with sushi, you have to establish your cred (or not) right away. So I'm an amateur!

But I do like me some Sushi Mon. 

The AYCE deal is available both for lunch ($22) and dinner ($27) and if you are planning on trying more than three rolls, this is your best bet since the prices otherwise take you over $25 real quickly. Unlike some other places, the AYCE sushi does not include miso soup, seaweed salad or a drink, just so you know. 

Let's say you love sushi but your friends don't- bring them here anyway, since there are plenty of other Asian-themed dishes they can try while you grab the fish n' rice. There is a $10 \"dinner special\" with a green salad, soup, vegetable tempura, chicken teriyaki, potato salad and yes, a California roll, but your non-sushi friends can give that to you. Also, there are breaded and fried pork options, other teriyaki plates, etc. 

But back to the sushi, which to me has to mean AYCE. Prepared mostly by Japanese (not always so at other places) and served very quickly once made, it has always been fresh and exactly as described on the menu, which is a big help since I'm not an expert, of course. Something new to me were the fried rolls (volcano sushi, flying Jason roll, etc.) and I could have done without them because they added lots of ballast, but it shows the creativity of the sushi masters at work. You can ask for half-rolls of most offerings, which allows you to try more types and not feel completely stuffed as you leave.

Now the place is indeed small and very popular, so you should definitely expect to spend up to 30-40 minutes waiting for a table if there are more than 2 in your party and if it's after 5 PM most days, but it is worth it. And beware- the wait staff is definitely militant about not sharing AYCE with those who order entrees and are also always on rice-wastin' patrol. Don't be the one to be called out- I've seen this happen once and it's not even funny.

What's interesting is that reviews of other sushi restaurants in the area (or even across town) often compare whatever place is being reviewed to Sushi Mon, which means it must have a standard-setting reputation among those who really know their sushi. As I said, I'm an amateur, but even so- Sushi Mon is a great place for all levels of sushi-knowledge, it seems."}
{"text":"This place was packed. So much so in fact that I had to wait almost an hour just for a seat! I was excited and thought it was going to be fantastic! Boy was I wrong. The only reason I'm even giving them two stars is because the chef was really cool and checked on us very often. But there was literally nothing on the menu worth the money, at least from what I tried. The food was just overly bland. I got the spicy tuna roll, regular tuna roll, albacore sashimi, shrimp tempura, and spider roll. I could never recommend this place to someone, unless you don't mind extremely low quality AYCE. Disappointing, because I was really hyped up because of how busy it was."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for almost 2 years almost weekly. The last two times we came the service was SO slow. We were actually there for an hour yesterday and got 1 roll each. We were told they hadn't even started making our other food yet. When we got there it was dead slow! About 20 minutes in it got very busy. That's fine it's busy. But if I'm waiting an hour for rolls they shouldn't be falling apart as I pick them up. It was awful. We finally just paid for what we had received so far and cancelled our other order. 90 minutes total we were there. $25 check with no tip left and my husband and I each ate a single roll. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I only ever come here for the AYCE and it's pretty great. The food taste great and although the restaurant always seems busy the staff do their best to check in and get any more orders in. However sometimes you might have to get the staff's attention because there is so much going on in a small space"}
{"text":"I guess when you give away the same Ferrari for $10 people will still complain. \"Hey why is that guy's Ferrari looks shinier than mine?\" or \"Why do I have to get mine Ferrari after the guy who got here before me and is in front of me in line?\"

Same quality of food and service for 1/3 of the usual price is a 5 star performance in my book. Kudos for Sushi Mon for having the balls to throw an event like this for their fans."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a relaxed Sunday lunch and ordered a few things on the menu.  

I ordered:
Ikura nigiri.  My usual because it's my favorite and i order it everywhere i go.  It was nothing special and actually I was disappointed.  The roes were visibly small and very fishy which usually means it's not fresh.  
Sashimi lunch special.  It came with 3 different sashimi (albacore, tuna, salmon(the usual)) but again, very fishy and really nothing mind blowing.

BF ordered:
Lunch special.  Chicken teriyaki with a cali roll cut, salad, rice, and some pasta salad?  The pasta salad part was a little weird for me but the dressing on the lettuce salad was refreshing and the cali roll cut was delicious.  The chicken was a little fatty so that wasn't good.  

Our overall experience wasn't anything memorable.  What makes me hesitant on going back is because the only good part was the cali roll and i think cali rolls is little bit too standard for my taste.  The service was excellent but if the freshness of the food was better i would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place!  It was fantastic again.  We got there early to beat the crowd.  We got our order in quickly.  Even with the shift change, we got supurb service as always.  They were very attentive to all of our needs.  The all-you-can-eat service is the best.  Always good and fresh!  We get enough of eveything we ordered.  The daily specials were delicious.  Part of our group ordered Teshoku meals.  These were super large portions were hard to finish.  Kamchi-kama were meals by themselves.
A great place to go and get your fill of Japanese Cuisine.
Gochigosamades!
You bet, I will go back for more."}
{"text":"Always great and fresh! Last visit was super busy and it didn't help that their computer system crashed but you'd never know the difference really...service was great as usual."}
{"text":"The Place: Clean, Casual
The Service: Quick, Friendly 
The Food: Variety, Good Food

The first time I went here there was a 45 minute wait for a table of two.  I ended calling in a order of sushi to go.  It was ok, nothing that I would write home to mom about.  
A few months later I decided to give them a second chance and did the \"All You Can Eat\".  The fish tasted fresh, but it seemed that my sushi had more rice than fish.  I haven't been there since, nor would I go out of my way to eat there. 
Island Sushi is where it's at for \"AYCE\" and coming soon 808 Sushi in the southwest!"}
{"text":"I love this place. This is a must-go restaurant in Vegas. They open till 2 am everyday so if you are hungry after all-night's partying and feeling like some Japanese food, go to Sushi Mon. It is an all-you-can-eat sushi bar that also serves other Japanese delights, such as tempura shrimp, teriyaki, gyoza, noodle, and tempura ice cream. What? You don't know what tempura ice cream is? shame. It's deep-fried ice cream Japanese style! Super yummy!
Everything there is fresh and made to order. I prefer sitting at the counter because I can just tell the chef what I want and they will make them right away. If I feel like some hot food or soup, I can tell any waitress to bring them out and they have fast service too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened. I remember waiting hours to get a table and it was worth it. Key word WAS. It's sad that my once favorite restaurant has become just a blah Japanese ayce restaurant mixed in the infinite amount of ayce Japanese places in Henderson.

The fish quality is poor. Maybe the chefs were able to buy all of food for less's close out seafood. I couldn't finish my food. Just bad.

Service is below average. Way below average. I mean the high school squad at McDonald's can out run the staff here... In the kitchen and on the floor. 

How sad. Good bye forever sushi mon. 

I love sushi once again is my favorite Japanese place in Henderson."}
{"text":"I primarily like it here because it's less than a mile away from my house, and it's fairly consistent. Nothing to really blow you away, but nothing too disappointing either. The tempura vanilla ice cream is soooo good... I remember falling in love the first time I tasted it. 

Kind of small interior, so I'd avoid during peak times or prepare for a wait. I'd recommend sitting at the bar for quicker service."}
{"text":"The BEST place to go for sushi in the city. No other place compares to Sushi Mon. The fish is ALWAYS fresh, the service is ALWAYS excellent and I will ALWAYS pick sushi mon over any other sushi bar. 

Give the cajun albacore tuna a try. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"I must have gone on an off night... Everyone else on here seems to love this place and we couldn't even finish our food. 

I NEVERRRR send things back (even if I hate them) and I send back 2 of our 6 rolls. They were inedible and smelled like they had been left out in the sun all day. 

I am not kidding when I say I wouldn't feed this to my dog. The staff was VERY nice and apologetic about the food... I guess thats how they earned the one star I'm giving them."}
{"text":"You can have all of the sushi you want ... for about an hour. 

I tried this place with a group of my friends while we were staying at Vegas. They have a good variety to choose from and it's all made to order. The quality of the fish was decent but pales in comparison to a regular pay-as-you-go sushi bar. Some of the pieces had warm rice! There's also an assortment of rolls to choose from such as the spider roll and salmon skin roll. Beware... the rolls are huge! 

Some of the items are one-order-per such as the Sweet Shrimp and the Sea Urchin. But they also have a bunch of other none sushi stuff that's all you can eat such as the miso soup, green tea ice cream and shu mai. 

The place is small but can still accommodate a couple of large groups. A real cozy feel with waiters watching you to make sure you don't waste food.   They were quick to respond and take additional orders.

Overall you get what you paid for and for $27.00 (dinner) I can see myself coming back for more.  Just don't expect the best quality."}
{"text":"We went here with the expectation of being slightly hustled. Was I ever wrong. The service is very friendly and efficient. The sushi chef, Jilson, was very helpful with our ordering. Half rolls are the way to go. The fish is fresh and tasty. The place is spotless. Restrooms are very clean. New favorite sushi place. Highly recommended. Go and eat here."}
{"text":"I usually love coming to this sushi spot for lunch because it's near my house, lunch price is great, and it's not too busy. Service is usually great but I came a couple of nights ago and sat at the sushi bar and got a bad customer experience. 

It was obviously a full house so me and my boyfriend were in no rush to order. But a guy named Alejandro came to us from behind the bar and asked us what would we like to order. Wonderful! We always get the same things on first order: salmon nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, and tuna nigiri. And we threw in a roll. So he makes our order except for tuna nigiri. No biggie. We know it's coming soon. 10 mins go by.. 15 mins.. (mind you there are 4 other sushi chefs and two in the back helping and they are fast with making orders)

He then hands a roll we did not order and I say we didn't order this. And he just looks at me dumbfounded like I was stupid and I didn't know what I ordered. And he asked what we order. I accidentally said salmon instead of tuna but I corrected myself right away and he just bluntly says \"well is it tuna or salmon??\" And my boyfriend corrected. Alejandro walks away and he NEVER SPOKE TO US AGAIN. He didn't even give us our order. Another 15 mins later. Nothing. I was getting super annoyed and was about to talk to a manager for how he was so helpful at first and now he was did not make any eye contact or make our food. The sushi chef next to him Jun, asked what we order and he was gonna make it for him but Alejandro saw him making it and just did it himself, but it was shitty. 

Still debating if I'll return."}
{"text":"I'm no sushi expert so take feedback from me as a novice connoisseur .   Very excellent fresh sushi. Awesome rolls and selection   Ill go again."}
{"text":"I went there to treat a good friend of mine to an all you can eat sushi.  I have always been pleased of the service there in the past.  Tonight, it was by far the worse customer service I have ever had in an AYCE sushi.  The waitress on more than one occasion kept telling us to eat our food and finish it!  She was hesitant to take our order and looked at our food every time we ordered and reminded us AGAIN to eat all that we ordered!!!  Obviously, I told her that I have been there before and know their rules!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed this visit. It was my man, myself, and our 13 month son. We did all you can eat sushi. They charged me $3.00 for my son. Really????? She goes if he's going to eat there is a fee. Ummmm yes he's going to eat do if you are going yo charge us than do it but I'm sooooo confused. When did they start charging for toddlers. But okay!!"}
{"text":"It's not too spacious but the food pretty good. Not a fancy smancy sushi place but the quality is scrumptious. They have a picture menu where you can actually see the rolls you are going to order. The all you can eat ($24 lunch- $28 dinner) is worth going for. There are no limits to their desert. They have Mango, Strawberry, Vanilla, and CHOCOLATE mochi. The tempura ice cream is to die for since it's fried ice cream! They also allow you to get half rolls which is a plus!

They wait might be long, but once you are seated and place an order, It is super fast and friendly. They played good music and bathrooms were clean. I would recommend people to come eat here :-{D!"}
{"text":"in vegas, the growing world of all you can eat sushi restaurants mimics the rapid growth of vegas.  i yet have to find my favorite place.  i frequent this place a lot b/c of the proximity to the people i usually eat there with. 
i was disappointed my first time. they did not have an alcohol license at the time.  (I want to drink Sake and SAKE BOMBS, argghhh!!!!)  the service was awful.  the waiter kept reminding our group that all-u-can eat sushi had a time limit and that we had to finish all our orders, including the rice.  i was truly offended at the comments.  i came from Reno, where i still believe the concept of all-u-can eat sushi at the sushi bar began (this was about 16yrs ago...props to Sushi Teri).  We were also very hungry, it was not necessary to remind us.  i mean it's even written in the menu.  at that point my friend and i was pissed.  the two of us to start a mission to target one item on menu and make them run out of it.  we  targeted the mussels.  we kept ordering 4 orders of them (about 5 times).  it came to the point where our waiter kept avoiding our table and avoiding making eye contact with my friend and i.  i finally got him to return to the the table, so i can ask for some more.  he was apologetic to tell us that he can only give us 1 more order because they had no more left. ha..ha...ha  our mission was complete along with eating several orders of sushi, some tempura, some edamame, yellow tail collar, and some ice cream and mochi.  
the all-u-can-eat  menu is quite extensive.  they have several types of appetizers, nigiri, hand rolls, long rolls, and dessert items.  i haven't tried that many rolls b/c i just love nigiri and the rolls fill you up too fast .    im disappointed that they limit you to only 2 orders of ama-ebi and toro. i think their ama-ebi was crap anyway.  i don't think it's really sweet shrimp.  yeah, this is one of the better all-u-can eat sushi place in vegas, but i doubt it is the best.  so the search goes on...."}
{"text":"The buffet is expensive but you get what you pay for. 

 My favorite dish is Salmon Delight.  It basically a California roll but it has Salmon and a slice of lemon on top of it.  I also like to eat the Dragon roll.  I like to come back to this place because it's the only place where their food is fresh. 

I don't actually eat their all you can eat anymore unless it's special occasion. Otherwise, I think i'm happy ordering by the dish.  Their proportions are very generous.  Sushi mon would always be the first place I go to when I think of Sushi.  

This place is better than the other sushi mon that's on maryland pwky and silverado. No doubt!"}
{"text":"I didn't like their service.  Their proportion was small.  For instance, i asked for a dragon roll, and they give me four pieces of sushi.  Can you imagine how long a dragon roll is if there's only four pieces?  We didn't even ask for half orders but all their servings were really small.  We asked for vegetable tempura and it didn't come with yams!  What is a vegetable tempura without yams?  Not to mention the tempura they made was not crunchy, it was soggy.  Same thing with the most anticipated calamari that I wanted to eat.  We expected the food to be fresh.  The raw tuna and salmon there was not fresh, even the avacado had to taste fishy.  I think I will stick with the other sushimon on Sahara in Las Vegas (at least their surrounding looked better).  The only thing that I felt that tasted good was the fried shumai.  But to sushi mon....., if you can only make good fried shumai for your buffet, I rather go elsewhere considering how much i pay for your buffet."}
{"text":"Still the best all you can eat sushi I know.  I compare all other all you can eats to Sushi Mon!   I love that they have tempura ice cream included in the all you can eat as well."}
{"text":"my friend absolutely love this place, so i thought i would try it out. I've been to the one on the sahara already, so I kind of expected the same, but it was worse.  

I was with a group of people so i was waiting about 50 min to be seated, and i'm not complaining about that. Everybody in my table got all you can it, and i didn't. so for those who look for a lot of rolls and appetizer it might be a good deal for about $30 per person.  They weren't picky about having everyone to get all you can it and such so that was cool, but i didn't find our waitress very friendly, and how they just sort of threw the plates on the table over my head to set the food down. I mean its not a big deal but i really wasn't feeling very comfortable to even take bites from my food.  I got Chirashi, its sort of like terriyaki bowl, but instead of chicken i get variety of fish, cut in sashimi style.  it was $13 if i remember correctly and i got a soup and a salad with it.  the quality of the fish wasn't very impressive at all, some of the fish actually seemed very dry in my mouth.  They also threw some pickled mushrooms, and radishes, and a LOT of ginger and wasabi to cover the rice.  It was nicely decorated plate, but i really  didn't like how my fishes weren't fresh.  I also looked over at my friends food, they were huge rolls in many defferent colors, mostly deepfried and cream cheese.  I can see why it could be a cool spot since you can order half of things and try all defferent things, but it just didn't do it for me.  I didn't find my friends plates very appetizing, although it might of tasted good, a lot of the rolls were very similar to one another. I guess next time i should try the all you can eat if i get dragged into that place again.  I've had better experience at different all you can it place in california, but from what i hear its the best all you can eat in las vegas, and i think thats very questionable. although the one on sahara was 3 stars."}
{"text":"My family of 4 live nearby and have tried this place about 4 times. Although the food is good (thanks to the sushi chefs) and reasonable, the service or lack thereof is poor to say it politely. They are simply unfriendly and border on rude at times and they act like they do not care whatsoever whether you come back or not. They do not show any appreciation for our patronage either, which is irritating to say the least when you spend your hard earned money. So much so it makes the whole experience unenjoyable.  It's too bad because we enjoy the food and love sushi and since we live nearby, we want one of those places that we can go to often and you know them and they know and its always a pleasant meal and experience. However, after eating here 4 times and hoping the service will be better each time, it just isn't and we walk out saying well at least the food was good. We really want this to be our place but I guess we'll have to give our hard earned money to another establishment that appreciates it. Very disappointing. If I could give 0 stars I would. Again, this review is not a reflection on the sushi chefs at all, the food is good, its the service and management that has driven us not to return."}
{"text":"solid 3.5 stars. i'd say this is perhaps among the best you can get in LV. i've been here several times when visiting relatives in vegas before i became a sushi snob and really liked it in the past. i still enjoyed my meal when i went today for an AYCE christmas lunch, but more for its great bang for the buck and selection.

GOOD:
- orion and salmon lover rolls
- unlimited ice cream. our party of five AYCE'ers ordered a bowl of green tea and red bean ice cream EACH
- these aren't on the menu and thus are limited to one order per person, but definitely get them! toro, amaebi, uni. unfortunately they were out of the uni, but we maximized the other ones
- other limited items that are on the menu (sake shooters, yellowtail collar, oysters)
- salmon and albacore were decent

BAD:
- edamame was straight up disgusting. it was all wrinkled like it had been reheated several times and the pods were chalkier than normal

again, it's an AYCE joint so you can't go expecting quality sushi. but definitely bring an appetite and your frequent eater card, and you're set!"}
{"text":"This place is clean and the staff is friendly and attentive but if you have a shellfish allergy, don't expect special treatment.  They will not switch out the shrimp tempura for veggie tempura if you order 'all you can eat'.  The good news is that you can order half rolls and try a little of everything.  The 911 roll is no joke.  My bad ass husband was tearing up like a school girl and he does like it hot.  The salmon is nice and fatty and the proportion of salmon and rice is in your favor.  If you sit at the bar, there are little hooks for purses, which is nice.  There is nothing to complain about here.  The sushi is fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow. This is one of my favorite restaurants. I live in Southern California but this is one of our must-eat places when we come to visit family in the Henderson/ Las Vegas area.  The best thing about this place is the choice of sushi/rolls you get.  You have a huge menu to choose from (desserts are included on the menu).  A very nice selection and high-quality.  Also, the staff is totally cool and are always ready to take additional orders.  Outstanding."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here on our last trip to Vegas and I really enjoyed it! We went around 2 PM on Saturday so it wasn't too crowded. The fish was fresh and there was definitely a lot of variety. One of my favorite things was the selection of desserts!! I know I wasn't \"getting my money's worth\" by loading up on these, but there were so many options and I love dessert. I had green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream, and best of all, lychee sherbert!!

The price was also decent and the wait staff was very friendly. The drive was definitely worth it and I ate so much that I skipped dinner. I wish they had Sushi-Mon in LA!!"}
{"text":"I've been a patron of Sushi Mon for as long as I can remember, and with every visit, I enjoy it more and more.

The place itself is quite small, and features a sushi bar, several tables, and booths. The service here is just lovely; everyone--from the waiters to the sushi chefs--is both kind and courteous. Whenever I enter, I'm always politely greeted by nearly everyone who works there.

The All-You-Can-Eat special at Sushi Mon is probably the best I've seen in the entire Las Vegas valley. For around $25 per person, you can choose as many different types of sushi rolls as you'd like from menus with images of virtually every item available for your convenience. Every roll--cold or baked--is made and served in a timely manner. My personal favorites are the Caterpillar, Lasagna, and Pixie rolls!

The side-dishes offered at Sushi Mon are lovely, as well. They've got anything you might possibly desire, from tuna and octopus poké to cucumber and seaweed salad, miso soup, and baked mussels. One of their newest additions is the sashimi salad, which is simply to die for.

The dessert is, without saying, extraordinary. The green tea ice cream is a must, as are their various flavors of mochi. If you're looking for a quaint little place to have sushi or any other Japanese dishes, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"It was my favorite all you can eat Japanese restaurant before. Nice sushi...Japanese people are famous for their service but not this one...
The situation is getting worse and worse...please spend some time to review my uploaded picture...they are slow and impolite...refuse to let us know some food is sold out an hour later we ask them where are the food( we do not know if it is really sold out because we can see other people having it) ... SLOWSLOWSLOW...look at the ice cream...did they give us leftover from other table? Won't go again. Goyemon is still okay, hopefully Goyemon will not act like its sister company."}
{"text":"Orgasm salad not good and way too expensive. All you can eat good. Sushi good especially frying Jason, lasagna and California."}
{"text":"ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT-SUSHI (incl misc apps) all MADE TO ORDER.  Noice!

Since I'm new to town, I've been meeting a whole mess of locals, and they all converge here on Tuesdays, LATE night...like MIDNIGHT late.   (..and here i thought i relocated from the city that never sleeps [aka NYC] but apparently VEGAS seriously..no SERIOUSLY..never E.V.E.R. sleeps..)  

...and evidently, neither does SUSHI MON! This joint closes at 2am! SuhWEEEET!

It's all you can eat GRANTED you finish YO food.  So far, my fave is the Moon Roll - albacore, yellowtail, avocado, eel sauce and tempura flakes...I think...  And it's YUMMMM.. 

They also serve flavored Hana Sake, which is a plus for yours truly. 

I'll definitely be back because, as 4 stars says it: YAY. I AM A FAN :)"}
{"text":"A great sushi place. The fish quality is very good. I only had one bad experience at the restaurant. And it was an employee with a smart mouth. I don't think I can hold it against the place because of a low level employee. So if you are looking for sushi, try it out."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. The \"all you can eat Sushi\" for dinner is well worth the money. You need to go when your hungry though. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Good sushi...HORRIBLE SMELL INSIDE!  Cant take that gosh awful sewer smell EVERYTIME!    Go there and see what I mean but bring a clothespin."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Mon last night for dinner.  
When we walked in I noticed how small it was (thus only the four stars)   Only 6 tables and the sushi bar . 
We sat down and decided to order. They have a really diverse menu, and you can order half rolls which is good if you are not sure about the item you are trying. 
The atmosphere is really good, and the restaurant seems to buzz  with everyone having such a good timel
Tried a Royal California roll.  This is a california roll that has been deep fried.  I can't even begin to describe the tasty goodness.  I think the crunchiness of the rice really makes this roll special.
Also tried a mexican roll - very spicy  I loved it. 
shrimp tempura- extremely light and crispy.
chicken teriyaki- so good and not too sweet.
JJ roll - was extremely good and even had asparagus in it. This was new to me. But the flavor and texture was amazing.
We tried the Alaskan Snow crab - VERY SWEET! it was good but only a one timer for me ... not my fave.
I truly enjoyed how fresh the flavor and texture of our food was. The servers were great and helped explain what was in a roll. Or suggest a roll... or even answer mundane questions they probably get all the time.
Overall a great dining experience and well worth the 28.95  for all you can eat..."}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi does not get any better than this.  This restaurant is a staple everytime we visit Las Vegas, and we visit a lot.  What makes this place great is that is has an extensive menu and the rolls you receive from the Sushi Chef are quality rolls, not that mass produced junk you would expect from a place like Makino which is left out for just anyone to touch.  This place is great because the sushi that comes out is made to order and it keeps coming at you for a straight hour.  

One thing to remember is that the hefty AYCE price of $28.95 extends to all appetizers and desserts as well so eat everything in sight!"}
{"text":"We went on a Tues night, no reservation, no problem. We were seated promptly. The AYCE sushi dinner is a bargain. The sushi came out quick as they had quite a few sushi chefs working that night. A few of us ordered the salmon, tempura, cali roll combo. The food was delicious & the servings were huge! There were 2 pieces of salmon, combo shrimp/vegi tempura & 6 pieces of cali roll. I would return when I'm in Vegas again. The food was good, service was quick & they are definitely affordable!"}
{"text":"See my review of Goyemon just remove all mentions of pork belly. Great quality sushi + tempura ice cream = Perfect place for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"I ventured here to this sushi place because my usual and favorite sushi joint didn't open til 4pm.

First off nice ambiance.  It was almost packed but due to the 45 minute time limit of AYCE, people were just in and out.  

We were super hungry, all our food came out within 10 minutes of ordering.  Service was helpful and friendly.  The menu was easy to read and came with pictures which was a plus.  

I still prefer my usual sushi spot but SushiMon had the Ecstasy Roll which was so good that I will come back just for that.  

The 45 minute ayce time limit made me feel rushed but I get it, it's a business.  At first I was going to give this place 4 stars but not all places give you AYCE dessert.  So they deserve the 5!"}
{"text":"Came here for my FIRST TIME with family while I visited.  Just say \"SUSHI\" and my big booty is THERE.  Lol!  At $22 (for lunch) and $25 (for dinner) I think I ate waaaay more than what was paid.  People have said the nigiri portions (fish to rice) aren't great but I thought they were fine.  I mean, I'm no sushi expert but I thought it was GREAT!  

Ordered (12 people)
1. Super white tuna -my FAVORITE thing there, nice and clean flavored with the ponzu sauce that it had.  Oh so MELT in your mouth delicious.  Get it!
2. Salmon -it's always my go-to when I eat sushi.  Very soft and melt in your mouth awesome.
3. Masago w/quail egg -crunch of the masago mixed with the creaminess of the quail egg...MMMMM!
4. Uni w/quail egg (only served at dinner) -ORGASM IN YO MOUTH
5. Ikura w/quail egg -ocean flavor with that creaminess?  Yes.
6. Shrimp tempura -Filler.  It was ok but, not doing again.  
7. Seared tuna -Also came with the same ponzu sauce.  It was ok, probably woody order it again.
8. Soft shell crab roll -I'm a sucker for soft shell crab.  Another must order.
9. Green tea ice cream -My palette cleanser.  Nice green tea flavor.  A must after I eat sushi.
10. Tempura ice cream -JUST.  GET.  IT.  A deep fried japanese bread holding vanilla ice, whip cream, and a cherry.  Yum!  If they drizzled chocolate syrup over it...PERFS.

There were other things ordered but these were what I mostly ate.  Service was not that bad.  Orders came out once they were ready (not like other places that come out at ONE time).  That's a plus for me.  Well...the fact that it was ALL YOU CAN EAT...made it a SUPER plus for me.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"So fresh! Great sushi chefs with great personalities! This is Goyemon II but without the crispy rice cakes ( for now...they are coming soon).
My boyfriend said to give it a one star because he doesn't want it to get crowded! Lol!
Really great sushi and AYCE too!"}
{"text":"Have ordered take out from here several times and would recommend to anyone close by. Food is always done extremely fast and it tastes delicious. Caterpillar roll is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Sushimon is my favorite sushi place in Vegas! There are a great variety of rolls oozing with creativity, great taste and with fresh ingredients.

The fish and seafood on the nigiri are fresh and stellar.

The hot food are also stellar like the sesame chicken and dynamite.
 
Highlights for the rolls are Sexy girl, Pixie and Achichi (special when we were there (salmon with shrimp and habanero sauce)."}
{"text":"At first, you would think this was another wanna be sushi joint. Shockingly, this place is very good. I always go for the all you can eat. Go figure, I am a glutton. Try to come here with a large group so you can try all the rolls. If not stick to the small sushi or else you will get full with two orders of sushi rolls. There is always a wait every time I come here, so try to get here as soon as they open. I know that quality has gone down but that is every sushi joint in town. Some worse than others. Yes, I am a fan of this place."}
{"text":"All you can eat. WOW!!! I really liked this place. Probably better than the one on Maryland Parkway and Silverado ranch. My favorites: the salmon sushi, ama ebi, fried shrimp heads and pretty much everything. They do not mess around here. You can order as much as you want...as long as you eat it all. Which I always do. You can order half rolls which is great because you can try a lot of different variations. This place has now become one of my favorites."}
{"text":"The fish wasn't very fresh. It was borderline going bad. I was extremely disappointed. I used to go all the time when I lived on that side of town and it was amazing years ago but I don't think I'll be returning. I've had better sushi from a grocery store."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday, didn't realize it was AYCE, but we rolled with it, after realizing our order would nearly be the same, and this way we could sample several items.

Last Samuri Roll: spicy tuna, cuke, cilantro and topped with shrimp and spicy mayo. Very tasty, would order again.

Orion Roll: spicy tuna, cuke topped with cajun albacore and garlic sauce. Again, very good.

Oh! Philly: salmon, cream cheese, cuke deep fried. It wasn't a favorite I'd likely pass on it next time.

9-1-1: Very spicy tuna, only a slight heat at first, but then the burn follows. Very good, but do have a drink onhand. 

Baked Green Mussel was recommended by the waiter. Flavor was good, but it was overcooked and a tad chewy.

Cinco de Mayo: Like jalapeno popper on steriods... fried pepper, cream cheese, spicy tuna and topped with spicy mayo. Yum! Yum! Yum!

Finished with green tea ice cream, creamy and delicious.

Sushi came quick. We surprised them when we asked for our check. We ate quick and not nearly as much as most diners, apparently. We were stuffed, in any case. If I had the appetite I'd return for AYCE. The Cinco de Mayo alone might lure me back."}
{"text":"I usually frequent the Sushi Mon over on the west side. But we were taking a friend to dinner that was staying on the strip. We thought the Maryland Pkwy location would be more convenient. The restaurant itself is considerably nicer, but I prefer the sushi selections better at the Sahara location. I like spicy rolls and the 911 was weak, and it was the hottest of them all. I also really missed the cinco de mayo. The sushi and nigiri we did have was fresh and pretty tasty, it just lacked that extra kick to elevate it. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time with a friend who is a regular here. Walked in around 7pm and it was a packed house. We didn't have to wait long and were seated within 5 minutes. The place was smaller than I had envisioned and I was wondering how the small two top we were seated at was gonna hold the smorgasbord of food we were about to 
order! The service was very attentive and my friend commented this was the best waiter she's had in all the times she's been here. I was happy to see they had my two favorite items on the Ayce menu. They are hamachi kama and baked mussels! Yummy! Only downside is you are limited to one order of the hamachi kama. Ordered a bunch of nigiri and several more hot apps. Loved the unagi and super white tuna. Both fried and steamed gyoza were delish as the skin was nice and thin just the way I like it! Finished off with Mochi ice cream and lychee sorbet. Very refreshing! I was nervous about the one hour time limit as I am a pretty slow eater. :) they did not enforce the one hour limit. We were there about an hour and a half and no one seemed to be rushing us. Good food. Good service. Great company. I was a happy girl. Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Chef Clyde and Chef Bon for the fresh fish! I absolutely love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I have to give this place a 1 star. Server sucks.. waiting on our food and they already gave us our check. Never coming here again! I am only going to sushi Mon on Sahara where they have better customer service there."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is pretty mediocre in my opinion. I had a lot of their nigiri during my visit. Not bad, but not the greatest.

The one and ONLY memorable thing here, SNOW CRAB NIGIRI. A must try if you're going to visit Sushi Mon.

I have found a better sushi spot and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Only place in vegas that I know that offers all you can eat dessert too. I always get my fill of mochi ice cream here.  This is a small interior so it fills up fast. Sushi is super fresh, with nice fish to rice ratio where you are actually eating fish, not rice. If the uni and fresh shrimp is done right, the place is 5 stars in my book.  This was my favorite place until Goyemon opened up, which I only prefer due to location, but is well worth the drive if you want to pig out on ayce mochi ice cream too."}
{"text":"First time in Vegas, second time trying an all you can eat sushi place, and it was totally worth it!  The chefs were very efficient, very polite, and made my friend and I feel right at home.  We both took advantage of the buffet and we stuffed ourselves silly.  My favorite roll was the California Dream Roll....so good...this place holds in a spot in my memory bank of my first trip to Vegas.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"An all you can eat sushi extravaganza. The sushi is good quality and for every ten all you can eats you get one free. I guess people go there a lot. The price is typical for Las Vegas Sushi joints. Almost all are All you can eat due to competition. This place always comes up with new things which is nice cause every time you go, you can get something new. The only problem that I have ever had was the wait. So, you know that it gets busy. Great place to try . Even my mom loves it."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Mon Sahara on Mon, March 11 for dinner.  We are not casual or infreuqent sushi eaters.  Wife & I were visiting from Hawaii and we have a lot of good Japanese restuarants and sushi bars in Honolulu.   Haven't been to Sushi Mon in over two years. Man, something must have happened since our last visit here, because the quality, servuce and food  in this place was very disappointing.  An soon as we walked in, there was a foul odor like they might have had a sewer overflow problem recently.  We were looking forward to some good sushi, so decided to stay. Sat down and waitress came over to take drink orders, I asked about the Japanese beers if they had any REAL Japanese beer from Japan.  She spoke very condescendingly and said that \" All Japanese beer are from Japan!\" which is not true - it's all right on the labels.  Kirin, Sappora and Asahi all have associate breweries in US or Canada, but a few of the true imports are available in certain restuarants.  She asked if I wanted the regular bottle or the large bottle and when I asked her how many ounces were in the large bottle, she couldn't answer that.
We ended up with a different waitress and she was very polite and friendly.  As usual, we went with the All You Can Eat.  The edamame was either old or overcooked.  The Hamachi, Scallops, Uni and Ikura was dry and dark (and this is an understatment) meaning that these items have probably been sitting out since lunchtime or worse.  My wife ordered the Tako and it was so hard and rubbery that she couldn't even bite it in half.  I looked over at the main sushi maker behind the sushi counter and he saw me and looked down - he knew of our disappointment and couldn't even look me in the eye.  Will never eat there again and will tell all our friends from Hawaii about this disappointing change in their quality.
Funny thing is the next day, my wife spoke with a friend who lives in Vegas and this friend told her that they don't eat there anymore either for the same reasons."}
{"text":"can't really say I'm a big fan of this place.. to be fair the food is actually very good. they have a great variety of the special rolls on the AYCE menu and ive never had a bad experience as far as taste goes... the servers are the only problem. every time ive eaten here ive usually had a mid 20s male server along with an older woman and they always make me feel rushed. its like im bothering them when I ask for a refill. last time I went we had ordered our last 2 plates along with mochi ice cream at the same time and before the food could even get to use the servers began taking our plates and drinks away... i wasn't even finished eating! i told them i didn't want the last of the food I ordered that they began to bring out and asked for the bill and left. will definitely not go back, it was the last straw service wise. go here if you must for the good quality food, but be warned about these servers."}
{"text":"Stopped in mostly because it was near where I was staying for work. Couldn't get in the door on first try, went back a few days later and sat at the bar. Since it was so crowded we expected it to be pretty good, sadly not so much. The sushi chef talked us into the all u can eat deal, cheap enough at $27 a head. I'm am typically a sashimi guy and not a big fan of paying  for mostly rice nigiri, but what the hey nigiri it was. started with some of my favorites uni and ama-ebi naturally they are on the limited to one order list, but thats cool. The Uni was to say the least not at its peak freshness, in fact most normal sushi bars that i frequent would not have served it. Moved on to the hamachi and tuna, edible but not very fresh. Tried the 911 roll it was ok but not nearly as spicy as I would have liked. My associate ordered a spider roll, which the menu claimed was fresh softshell crab (as you would expect) it came out with 2 small crab legs hanging out of each end and a lot of \"Krab\" in the middle, when asked the sushi chef admitted that fake krab was used we pointed out the menu was wrong and sent the roll back, which seemed to offend the chef. If they write fresh crab on the menu and give you Krab, they need to expect that!
All in all it was a very mediocre or worse sushi experience, but it was cheap! 
The only reason that I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was the Hamachi Kama which was very good, but sadly also on the limited to one list. I'll not be coming back, good luck to the folks that give it five stars."}
{"text":"Extremely over-crowded. Like everyone else has mentioned, it does seem like the tables are packed in tight like sardines. ACYE price is great - lunch was $21. However, the sushi wasn't all that great in my opinion. Goyemon (although owned by the same owners) is better."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat in Vegas. High quality fish every time I go! A must try for anyone with a sushi craving."}
{"text":"This is the best all-you-can-eat sushi buffet I had ever been to!  Sashimi is fresh and quality is very good for what you pay for.   The best items to order are fresh scallop and tuna belly sushi.  It sure beat the regular sushi restaurant in terms of food qaulity.  Price wise - only $27.99 for dinner, that's a very reasonable price for a buffet in Vegas.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and good service.

All you can eat for a reasonable price is hard to beat.  We've been a couple times and have always had a great time.  Sitting at the bar we can talk with the chef to quickly get whatever we want.

It is a smaller restaurant and can have a long wait so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"ok - a little bit too overrated.

They change their daily specials so the specials we had today were Salmon Belly and Yellowtail belly:
Salmon belly - WOW amazing. Very buttery
Yellowtail belly - nothing to write home about.  So bad I only got 1 order.

Con:  their rice with their sushi was horrible.  I think I had the bad end of the rice because most of my sushi had cold and 40% hardening rice! 
Uni was NOT fresh.  Sweet Shrimp was NOT fresh either!  it was a chore to eat. 

Pro: Sashimi salad, unbelievable dessert (Get the ice cream)

If you are a big eater, its a good bargain.  you get a HUGE order of yellowtail cheeks as well! Don't come here for quality."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night this place was packed and busy but the service was prompt. We sat at the bar and the orders we made arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Was a shift change but both of the chefs were friendly and made some good suggestions. Overall an excellent dinner. The baked green mussels are to die for."}
{"text":"Went there for a lunch special with my daughter and I very good service  the sushi was good. Can't complain. My daughter is the sushi person and she said it was good so I'll take her word for it."}
{"text":"OMG, the worst! Fish is so stale, the sauce cannot cover it! I was so disappointed,  was told by everyone to try them.  My husband and I took relatives from out of town on a weekday  as it was so close to Anthem. Horrible experience.  Terribly embarrassed , please rethink this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The best way to enjoy this experience is to go with several people and opt for the all-you-can-eat special.  Our group was able to sample dozens of different items and were well satisfied by the end of the meal.  
My favorites were the hand rolls, scallops with yuzu, soft-shell crab and tuna, calamari and lychee sherbet.  It turned out to be a very good deal for the amount we ate."}
{"text":"UPDATE:Returned a few days ago and they definitely made some changes. The sake is very affordable not like other sushi restaurants. Also the food quality is way better. This might be my favorite place. Also the cooks are really nice and constantly check on you. Great food and service. :)"}
{"text":"Since I lost my close to home fave sushi place this is my current price friendly go to sushi place. Fresh fish, good choices for AYCE menu and yummy other food. Wish it was closer to home and the location was larger because at peak times this place is packed! (Go during off peak times for less of a wait time.) On our most recent visit a couple days ago we both did the sushi meals and it was yummy. The fish pieces were huge! And delicious! I don't have anything bad to say about the food except for Yum. Mind you I am picky since I'm from Hawaii and miss having access to my sushi or poke. What I would say is don't be too excited about the ahi or tako poke. Those are just okay. Another high point is for gyoza or shumai you are able to get them steamed and not fried. A great option for a healthier audience. If you like spicy, the spicy tuna is spicy and the 911 roll is HOT! If you like super, super spicy don't get it! The regular spicy tuna is yum and perfectly hot. The salad that comes with the meals is under par. I've had better. But all in all it's a good eat and buy."}
{"text":"It's by far my favorite go-to spot for a great sushi lunch special! They are always so friendly and their food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"You can't beat quality AYCE sushi for $27!

Come hungry. While Sushi Mon is a tiny little place, it's always busy. Their fish is good quality and they're very accomodating if you have a special order. Their service is attentive and their chefs at the bar are helpful. I'm not the kind of person that like to talk to chit-chat with the chefs much because I don't enjoy the in-your-face type of dining, but they are clearly BUSY.

I love that the appetizers are included in the AYCE price and my favorite are the baked mussels..very rich though. They have a more extensive menu (than the one at the Sahara location) with a great variety of rolls as well as nigiri so they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"The sushi is good but they pack on too much rice.  Service is always excellent.  My favorite Chef is MOON!"}
{"text":"really don't know how they could ever get this high rate and please don't make too much hope on here and the all you can list eat always ran out of the expensive price sushi ( like uni and sweet shrimp)"}
{"text":"Sushi is one of my favorite foods! $21.95 for all you can eat is an incredible price for sushi that includes all the raw fish, unlimited desserts, etc.  My favorite is the sexy girl and of course hamachi, maguro, and salmon nigiri. I was kind of annoyed by the waiter that came like a million times to bug us about collecting our plates and eventually we anticipated him coming so we did the work by stacking the plates and putting it on the side.  Aside from that, the food was so good that I will keep returning.  I like sitting at the bar because the sushi chefs are nice and come every now and then to ask if we wanted to order anything. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"SUUPER UBER BUSY AT NIGHT TIME

but needles to say the food never disappoints! I recommend sitting at the bar area so you can see the magic happen. Been here more than a handful of times and the service differ from time to time, but overall still good."}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi, AYCT Service  (All You Can Tolerate)

A lot of the sashimi I ordered was chewy, which is a horrible adjective to use for raw fish.  The usual mayonaisse bathed, over-riced rolls were present too, but what makes this place go from average to sub-par is the service.

Our waitress looked very irritated each time she came by our table.  She dropped off our food at the table next to us, and then attempted to bring it to us after the diners had been poking at it in confusion.  Items were forgotten and never brought out, and no apologies were ever offered.  

My biggest issue here is that it says all over the menu, \"We charge for leftover food, including rice, 45 minute time limit.\"  If you're going to impose strict eating guidelines on your customers, at least present them with a pleasant experience and decent food.  

There are many AYCE places in town, I wouldn't return to this one."}
{"text":"There are so many other better places to go than here. We had AYCE and it was almost like they were playing games and wouldn't come back to take our order for more. The sushi is boring with little option other than something with rice around it. The sauces were mediocre and the rolls were small with what seems like a lot of rice. It doesn't deserve 4 stars for AYCE, maybe it's different if you don't get AYCE but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Service is good but instantly got stomach aches and bad bathroom issues... not sure if the fish sits out to long but man o man last time I'm going there. If you want sushi go anywhere else and spend a few dollars more"}
{"text":"Good food at good prices. tiny shop, gets full real fast."}
{"text":"Was recommended here by a valet at our hotel . Amazing hand rolls , the 9-1-1 was intense but worth the heat. Service was great , food was great , can't wait to go again in our next trip"}
{"text":"Superwhite tuna nigiri & shumai & lychee sorbet & shrimp tempura are my fave's! The best!!!"}
{"text":"Having been jaded by \"All You Can Eat Sushi\" before my husband and I were hesitant to meet our local family members at a strip mall for sushi.  We had even made alternate dinner plans with our friends on the Strip, just in case.  It was a week night and pretty early 5:30 pm so there was a lot of room for our party of 5.  The waitstaff seemed a little standoffish at first, but after we ordered they were very quick to refill our hot tea and check on us.  3 of our family members ordered entrees.  The portions were huge and looked tasty.  My husband and I ordered the AYCE and were very surprised to see that there were so many choices for both rolls and negri.  We ordered several rolls both standard (spider, spicy tuna, yellow tail) and specialty (Vegas a go go)  We were delighted to taste fresh fish.  We ordered till our mercury levels were off the charts and then the sea called and asked us to pace ourselves for fear they could not generate enough fish for the rest of the world.  We left satisfied and happy.  I do appreciate their 20% charge if you do not finish the sushi you order.  I also appreciate the 1 hour limit on AYCE except if I was going to be held by it...I am not sure if its really busy that AYCE is worth it if you only have an hour."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now so I figured it was time for a review.  The food is pretty good here. Not amazing, but think of it as \"all-you-can-eat\" quality. I've done the all-you-can-eat option each time I've been in just to be able to try a bunch of things and I haven't been disappointed. There is WAY better sushi out there, but this place is better than you might expect.

The staff is outstanding, super friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. They know/understand/accommodate gluten-free options very well. My wife, who is very sensitive to gluten did the all-you -can-eat and had no problem finding plenty of tasty options. 

4 stars for two reasons. The sushi is really good, but not amazing. Also, they have a LOT of rules, and they post them everywhere. They don't seat partial parties so if you are the 1st of 6 people coming, you're not getting seated until the other 5 show up. There is a laminated card with rules for the all-you-can-eat option: No sharing, charges for leftovers, 45 min time limit for lunch and 1hr for dinner, etc.. Rules plastered on the window talking about \"last call\" and \"last order\" and all of that. I think I get it, but it doesn't make for the most welcoming of environments.

I'll totally go back again, and probably skip the all-you-can-eat and just pick a few things I know are good."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for some sushi. Though we came in during lunch, and expected to pay for lunch, we ended up paying the dinner fee because we went over the time limit (I think, but I know we came in around 2pm). BUT, it's totally okay because the food quality made up for it. 
To be sure that we got a table, we made a reservation ahead of time. I'd suggest it, especially if you're going here on a Friday or weekend day. 

It's a small restaurant, with a a sushi bar and separate tables. The food took at MOST 10 minutes to come out and we ordered many plates at a time so we could all share. It is a good thing that they let you order half rolls if you want to try everything. (Rather than the full 8 pieces you'd normally receive, you'd get 4.) 

The servers were nice and were nice enough to take an awkward picture of the group as well as recommend some of their favorite sushi off the menu. 
Out of curiosity, we ordered the 911 roll, not knowing how spicy it would be. It has jalapeno sauce mixed in with the spicy tuna and the burning sensation lingers on your tongue for a few minutes after you eat it. 

Overall, I had a very good experience here and I'd most definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I usually go for quality over quantity, but at this place you get both with AYCE. The Super White and Salmon Nigiri are my favorites. They will let you order half rolls, which allows you to experiment and find the best pieces for you. Be sure to order some ice cream, its great!"}
{"text":"Finally I made it here again. It's been almost 2 yrs. Super white tuna damn I had probably like 5 orders alone. You can get half orders on some rolls. Fish is very fresh especially the sake(salmon). No toro though. Limit 2 orders on sweet ebi my fav and uni was ok. It's about 20 min trip off the strip. But well worth the trip. $26.95 pp for dinner. Great place def recommend. 
Bring your appettite."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is best all you can eat sushi restaurant hands down!  I am just going to lay it out sweet and simple.

Pros:
- Huge parking lot
- Located off the strip so no need to hassle with traffic
- Open until 2 AM, 7 days a week
- Fresh fish / creative rolls
- Has an extensive All You Can Eat Menu (rolls, sushi, appetizers, dessert)
- Dinner for All You Can Eat is $26
- Can order half rolls so you get a chance to try out every single roll on the menu
- Friendly staff / customer service
- You can order even when you are not done with your previous order when doing the All you can eat.

Cons
- Only 60 Minutes to do All You Can Eat for dinner!

I went with the all you can eat deal.  Boy was it worth every penny. 

Make sure to read the walls because they have specials that maybe included with the All You Can Eat deal.  I was able to order the Albacore and Salmon carpaccio.  I was also able to order a scoop of green tea, plum and red bean ice cream.  If its on the MENU they can't say no.  Why did I even bother asking.

At the end of the night I paid $75 for me and my GF.  And that's with a generous tip!  I am not going to any other place for sushi when I am in Vegas anymore.

If your looking for fresh sushi, delicious Japanese food, friendly service, and at a good value, then you better sprint over to Sushi Mon!!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi!! Great price!! Good quality fish. Service is awesome. The chef are so fast that you can barely finish eating one order before your next one comes out. Only reason this isn't five stars is because of the hot rice. Wonderful experience overall and I will be back."}
{"text":"Okay, usually I associate AYCE Sushi with mediocre, fast-food, Americanized Japanese eats simply because 19 out of 20 times it is.  Then, there is Sushi Mon, the 1 in 20 where it is not! 
First of all, the well staffed chefs and servers are exceptionally considerate to the patrons. When I say \"exceptionally considerate\", I don't mean in the over-the-top annoying manner either. There is a genuine warmness in the staff, even in the \"welcome-to-this-sushi-bar-we-have-to-greet-everyone-who-walks-in-the-door-so-here-I-am-giving-you-this-greating-for-the-seventy-third-time-today\" welcome. What pleased me even more is the fact that everyone seemed to be pleased with their coworkers and appeared to enjoy EVERY aspect and tasks of their jobs (I might even seek part-time employment here, well maybe not... but I'll keep that idea in my memory bank).
Sushi Chef, Hiro, was awesome! He made my wife and I's 8th wedding anniversary exceptional.  The whole experience was first class. It was if we were at dinner with old friends we hadn't seen in a while and had a chance to catch-up with each other's families.  
Oh yeah, I almost forgot...we ate food here as well. love the fact that you can order 1/2 rolls which made the sampling of their variety enjoyable. Hiro was very good at explaining each dish and offered great suggestions. Besides the normal rolls we ordered he had us try the Green Mussels. I was hesitant with the Mussels but was so glad I did. And the offering of the Fatty Tuna was well called. Hiro was correct in his description of melt in your mouth buttery taste on that one. The two daily special rolls, Hurricane and Ecstasy were scrumptious. I think my favorite however was the Domingo. 
The menu items we ordered were perfectly cooked.  Their gyoza comes steamed or fried.  I'm a fried guy but ordered steamed on a whim. Order the Gyoza and order it steamed. The flavor is very kind to your momma!
I can say more but, I want to leave some of the experience up to you."}
{"text":"Best sushi buffet i've ever eaten.  the buffet menu had amost everything i like and the price was very reasonable.  

def going back next time im in vegas"}
{"text":"We had a 15 min. wait on a Sunday so that was understandable. The food arrived quickly although it was extremely busy. I didn't feel rushed or ignored at all. I enjoyed their version of the philly roll. Would revisit."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. We had bad service and mediocre food. Rice was falling off the roll.  There are much better options nearby."}
{"text":"Frying JASON roll (8pc): $10.95
-- baked J.J. roll with yum yum scallop & sauce

Pretty nice! Waiting line is pretty long too. Lol...."}
{"text":"The lunch and dinner selections are excellent, the grilled hamachi Kama was well done with great flavor. Service was prompt and courteous. Have referred friends to this restaurant when traveling to Las Vegas. Will try the all you can eat next visit."}
{"text":"I love the all you can eat sushi
Great price great food
And the hours are very nice 
We come here many times a month"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED this place. I've been to many sushi places and this one was by far the best. I loved all their rolls and didn't think there was too much rice on them. One particular roll was my favorite, although I can't remember for the life of me what it was. It was baked (i think) and was wrapped in tin-foil and just tasted amazing! Anyway, I definitly ate my money's worth of sushi and highly recommend this place.  Best in town."}
{"text":"It's MY sushi place. Love the all you can eat specials, love the salmon bento box! I am however upset that I can no longer get the green tea custard with the all you can eat special anymore! Since I moved here in 2005, service has dwindled a bit as well as the quality, but it never deters me from eating there."}
{"text":"The sushi is good, except that they include imitation crab in almost everything. Service is very slow :( my boyfriend and I had to wait so long to get another order during an all-you-can-eat session!"}
{"text":"Made to order all you can eat sushi!
Fast service and decent sushi for what it is.
Cheap sake, which always helps."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but the service was lackluster at best. Our server disappeared about a third of the way through our meal and we never saw her again. They rarely checked on us and when the new server finally took out last order, they forgot half of it. It took forever to bring out all of our orders. It was our first time here and most definitely or last time as well. You can do much better."}
{"text":"Hubby took me here yesterday night for both of our first times. It's a smaller place, not as big as most sushi places in town. Although it looked as a full house, we were seated within 5-10 minutes. Immediately we were greeted with our server who asked us for our drinks and took a look at the menus.

We both had AYCE sushi, so this is what we ordered.
2x Garlic Tuna Nigiri
Fried Gyoza
Fried Calamari
Shrimp Tempura Roll 
Teriyaki Chicken
Orion Roll (8pcs)
1/2 Order Crispy Rice (5 pcs)
Steamed Shumai
2x Shrimp Tempura
Cajun Albacore Nigiri
1/2 Order Cynthia Roll (5 pcs)
1/2 Order Royal California Roll (5 pcs)

Everything was so good, the service was prompt and all the food came out in good time. Would definitely recommend this place for the sushi lover who doesn't like the craziness of other AYCE sushi places. More secluded, more intimate. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. I recommend trying the lemon role! It's amazing all you can eat here is approximately $28.00"}
{"text":"Uni was great 
Sweet shrimp was impressive 
Pixie roll - the soft shelf crab ROCKED 
Poke was good 
Collar was very smooth in texture and yum 

Don't really remember what else I ordered but they were pretty good in general.... The only downside was the food came kind of slow because it was pretty busy that day even when we were dinning at 3pm."}
{"text":"Very rude employees made unpleasant dining.
Too long to get food served and water refill was never been easy.
Also i got sick after eating here."}
{"text":"You can't beat Sushi Mons' AYCE selections. Very fresh sushi and great bang for the buck. One of those \"melt in your mouth\" type of deal. AYCE is $25/ per person. 

Be prepared to wait approx 40 minutes to be seated on Friday and Saturday nights though. Even the sushi bar can get really crowded.."}
{"text":"Arturo is always my sushi chef here & he is by far the most efficient , sociable chef , attentive chef there . I come back all the time & wait just to have him as my chef ."}
{"text":"We shouldnt come back here

Service is still poor. It took 15 minutes just to get our drink. Server is not paying attention to its customers, takes 30 minutes to get our orders.

We will never come back here ever"}
{"text":"As a regular (ate here well over 20 times) I would say this place is a hit or miss. On a busy night i would skip this place altogether.  While the raw scallops the best I have had for an all you can eat place the service is just horrible. On their slower nights the service is wonderful and the food is equally great. I dislike how rude the host/cashier person can be. I get it 'you have a high volume of people in that small restaurant' BUT that does not justify treating your paying guests like a burden. I will say the food is pretty tasty and for what you pay it's worth it. Service needs improvement regardless. Go check it out."}
{"text":"This is a decent place but I can see myself be a fan eventually.  Decided to check out this place since it was close to the house and the sushi place I usually go to is now a bit too far.  The price was decent but holly cow the rolls were big!  I can usually eat about three to four rolls and extra but I was completely stuffed after two rolls.  The rolls weren't the prettiest and fell apart when I picked it up but it could also be that we went around 12:30AM...and they closed at 2AM.  But for as late as it was, they had a pretty decent crowd.  I will definitely go back and I can see myself eventually be a fan.  I just need to give them a few chances to see me as a regular.  Overall, it was good...working on being great. =)"}
{"text":"We had a great time the staff was friendly the fish was fresh. Everything we ordered came out quickly and we had all around good time this is all you can eat place and my favorite one of them all and I've tried a bunch in the city I just wanted the best so I came hear"}
{"text":"***Yelp Challenge 2016 1/100***

Love sushi and especially salmon belly! I always stick with nigri. I like to keep it real! LOL I love mixing things up and getting things like ikura and quail egg. One thing about lunch here is that they don't have uni available. It's ok though. They have many others to choose from. The super white tuna, poke and orgasm salad were all UNO! 

The chef was also super cool. He had a smile the entire time. I recommend this spot to anyone looking to try something different. It's not as packed as the location on eastern. Also don't forget to ask for your stamp car for all you avid sushi eaters! If you don't want it you can give it to me haha JK Happy Sushi Eating. This place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is my sushi home away from home.  Since I travel to Las Vegas often, I have tried all the high end sushi eateries you can imagine.  Although all were amazing, the hit to your wallet is worse than some of the gambling tables in Vegas.  

$26.95 gets you all you can eat sushi which includes a plethora of choices. Keep and eye on their chalk board for special cuts. For instance I was fortunate enough to have had Blue Fin tuna which normally is an fin and a leg - yes that was cheesy, sue me - but it was included in the deal. 1 order per person on the special items.

The house rules are simple and if you can't read, they provide simple illustrations to follow. Despite the handy instruction card they have at the bar, you will inevitably have someone try to cheat the system.  I don't know about you but the last person I try to antagonize is man who is very skilled with a super sharp knife. 

If eating as much sushi as humanly possible is your objective, then void the rolls or ordering too many sides dishes.  Stick with the nigiri and venture out of your comfort zone. Don't be afraid to ask for suggestions and letting them know of any allergies you may have. I have a shell fish allergy so they prepared my sushi on a different cutting board to avoid cross contamination.

That is really going the extra mile because other sushi establishments I frequent can care less.  The attention to detail and their customer service sets them apart. 

If you want great sushi at a reasonable price, Sushi Mon will definitely hit the spot. Oh and don't forget to try the lychee sorbet... Simply the best!!!"}
{"text":"Called on the way there to ask how long the wait was and the man on the phone said 35 minutes. Arrived there (literally) 2 minutes after the phone call, checked in and the same guy said it was an hour wait. Basically told us false info on the phone to persuade us to go. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The rice is big on sushi and they didn't even cook the rice throughly before they make sushi with it, and the most horrible thing they did was charge my son who's 2 years $3 for sharing our ayce.  What kind of business that charges a 2 year old toddler for sharing his parents food.  The menu didn't stated anything about kids charge and the waitress even dare to question why do I get upset after hearing that.  What the hell, I can't even express myself in this damn restaurant and they will charge your toddle for sharing.  I want to give this restaurant 0 star and will never recommend anybody going and I will never come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Get the sexy girl. and the dinner combos are great for 2 people.  Would recommend to friends and family.  Service is good and the sushi is fresh.  Enjoyed meals there every time they are consistent with their excellent food."}
{"text":"My experence was ok ... it wasnt the best to die for sushi but the reson why i gave it 3 stars is the service..."}
{"text":"Ok, here we go. Now I'm not sure if it's because I have been to many sushi places. But this place was horrible. My girlfriend and I went there expecting really outstanding service. What we received was the complete opposite. They took way too long to prepare sushi as far as drinks we practically had to chase down and corner the employees just to get out first set of drinks. As far as refills you have you be even more aggressive, otherwise you will die of thirst.
   Employees here do not care for customer service. They are not attentive to your needs. This company will not get anymore business from me or anyone I speak to. I do not recommend this place. I advise that you search elsewhere, that is unless you like to be over charged for crappy service."}
{"text":"This place use to be my favorite sushi restaurant, however, they are not any more. The quality of the sushi is fair to poor. The fish does not taste fresh.  The restaurant was closed down by the Dept of Health a few months ago, for one day, due to a large amount of flies and food being kept at incorrect temperatures. I still gave them a chance after that. The last time I was at Sushi Mon I saw a large roach crawling down the wall behind the sushi bar.  I will never go back. I was a loyal customer for six years and I will find a new sushi restaurant to spend my money at."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of people. First off you walk in and there is the smell of sewer. Big no no with me. Asked for manager and everybody acts like that's normal for that smell. They have fans blowing when you sit down for a reason. Food is good. We tried pretty much everything on the menu. I agree with other posts on the staff except for one server who stood out from the rest. If she leaves the place is screwed.  They do use a hand held computer for orders which is good."}
{"text":"sushi mon you are consistently delicious! always busy but regaurdless always great service and food. My only complaint is that SOME sushi chefs go heavy on the rice. Other than that everything is great, i love how its open late so i can enjoy after a night of drinking. Price is very reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant instead of my usual sushi place. The food was good and the prices seemed fair from the online menu, but I was not satisfied at all. I called in and ordered it for take out (my boyfriend and I wanted a nice night in for Valentine's Day). When I got there to pick it up, the staff was completely rude and said they had no record of my order so it was never even placed! They said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Fine. After FORTY-FIVE minutes went by, my order was finally \"ready\", but they forgot one of my rolls, and I had to wait even longer for it to be actually done! Then I got home. I was so disappointed! The rolls are so tiny that it reminded me of how gas station sushi looks - the entire roll could fit in my hand, not exaggerating! The couple extra bucks I would pay at my usual place doesn't seem so bad now. I definitely will not be a customer here again."}

This place is awesome for cheap and extremely tasty sushi... smack dab in the desert of Nevada. Huh. AND it's ALL YOU CAN EAT! EAT ALL THE THINGS!

The cuts are pretty huge.. just the right amount and not with a ton of wasabi like you normally get at other all you can eat sushi restaurants.

My friends and I kept ordering a bazillion orders of yellowtail because it is our favorite! It's about $25 total for as many as you want!! Ahhh!! The waiters were awesome and very quick.

They started us out on one order on a normal plate, then started bringing our orders on huge plates with 8 orders on them because the yellowtail disappeared into our bellies. Friends: \"Wow, our orders are getting bigger.\" Me: \"Wow, the fish cuts are getting bigger and bigger. I think they want us out.\"

This place is also open LATE! We arrived in Vegas at midnight and my friend who lives around the area took us here at around 1 am and we ate for an hour til we were full! Wish there was one in Torrance!

P A R K I N G

Easy lot."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi. Try the Albacore Nigiri, Baked Grren Muscles, Sexy Girl Roll, Ecstasy Roll, and Mochi ice cream to finish it off. Very friendly and fast sushi chefs. 

Tip: come for a late lunch (before 4pm) and enjoy AYCE sushi and food for only $21.95. 

Warning: stay away from the 9-1-1 roll unless you can handle extreme amounts of jalapeño heat. This roll may put a speed bump on your sushi experience."}
{"text":"I went there 3 times in the past year. First two times were excellent.  The third time not a charm. The sushi rice was cold and mushy.  Cuts of fish were fresh but small. Too much rice for a small piece of fish.  Also very thinly sliced. Teriyaki chicken was precooked with sauce poured over. Pretty dry.  Could be different chef.  Price is reasonable. Will try again because maybe caught a bad day. Servers always good and pleasant.  If your consider price probably 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great sashimi, all you can eat made to order so its fresh, and great service! Would recommend to my friends and family!

Try the volcano baked roll....so good! The spicy tuna rolls were really yummy. And the sashimi was so fresh and so good. The baked mussels were excellent as well.

The mesquite rolls and halibut were allright. And the dinner price was a lil pricey like almost 30$ per person. I think coming with a lot of people would maximize ur experience bc that way you can try more stuff. Also note: u can order 1/2 orders and handroll anything. At the end of the dinner, my friend and i were way too stuffed b/c we were trying to eat everything and if we had known we could 1/2 orders/handrolls that would have helped :)"}
{"text":"Clean location, went there about 10pm.  The sushi was a bit on the warm side.  The spicy tuna roll was good.  Overall average food.  Although service is better than most sushi places.  That is why I chose to give it a 3 instead of 2 stars."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant is owned and managed by the same people as the one on the south side of town, but this one seems just a touch below, and I'm not sure why.  It's still great, and I've been here many times.  Same rolls and food are good here.

Do get:
Futomaki
Spider Roll
Unagi
Super White Tuna
Yellowtail Collar
Green Tea creme brulee
Something with Scallop Yum on it"}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE sushi place in town.  They make the best Futomaki and Spider rolls out of anywhere I've been.  They also have great unagi there.  When they have yellowtail collar as a special I suggest you get it.  Another great special is their green tea creme brulee.  They include all their side dishes for their AYCE price, and they have great hot tea to accompany any meal.  It gets quite packed in here, so be ready for a wait, or go after the lunch rush and before dinner (2pm-6pm)."}
{"text":"OMG, all you can eat sushi for $28!! And I'm not talking about the nasty Todai or buffet style stuff! This place has a full menu of sushi, sashimi, rolls, appetizers, and desserts that you can order endless amounts of if you choose to do their all you can eat option. Otherwise, the rolls will cost you $4 to $9 each. You can also do half orders of each roll so that you get more variety! Of course, you need to finish everything or be charged for the price of that plate. Not like anyone would waste good sushi, right?! I've never been so full in my life! 

My favorite roll here was the deep fried philadelphia roll...mmm. I think I ate 3 full orders of various deep fried rolls that night! Another thing to try here is the fried shrimp heads! I didn't think I would like them, but they are delicious! Crispy and flavorful :) The desserts here are good too...I had the strawberry mochi and lychee sorbet.

Word of advice...it's probably not a good idea to do an all-you-can-eat dinner less than a few hours before you go out clubbing and binge drinking. I'll be coming here for lunch next time!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the bad reviews. I've been here several times and the food has always been terrific. Yes, around certain hours, you'll have to wait. That just means a lot of people enjoy eating there. :-) Their take-out service is outstanding. I ordered a full meal today and it was ready in five minutes. Friendly service and I love their sushi! Good prices, too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"2 thumbs up for this place!!!!!!!!!!!!

I saw my fd's pic when she went to vegas and i was told the sushi is GOOD (she's not a sushi lover). So I went there to try in my vegas trip (you know how hard you have to squeeze a quota out from the vegas buffets when you only stay there a few days) Then, I came out with a fat belly with high satisifation =)

1st, their price is reasonable!! only $27 for all-you-can eat with all FRESH sushi!!! You can really tell the freshness of sashimi WORTH every penny you pay!! Unlike other sushi buffet, they give you cheaper fish to maintain their cost, sushi mon has really good sushi (or even better than some Jap rest)!!! The sauce with some sashimi give you a better taste or refreshment! I love their citrus sauce!!!!

2nd, like all buffet, they'll remind you dun waste the food so you have to finish the rice. However, unlike other sushi buffet, their sushi rice is abit smaller than usual so that will give you more room to try other food. 

3rd, even though they limit your dining time to 45mins (dinner hours), but that's enough!! Because the chefs made it quick and won't waste your time!!! 

4th, all other hot dishes and appetizers are also delicious =)

So combine all these reasons, I went there twice on my 3days vegas trip. I'll definitely go there again when i go vegas =)"}
{"text":"Great food great service favorite sushi restaurant! Went here with my wife and had a great experience drinks and plates were always Instantly refilled the sushi chef himself was very nice and would talk and laugh with us. Just a great time altogether"}
{"text":"I come here quite often because the location is very close to me. It just so happens that they serve very good quality sushi! It has been a few months since I have last visited, but today it seemed like it was exceptionally flavorful. The staff is also fantastic. They're all super sweet and attentive. 
The rolls are always delicious, and well made, especially when they're AYCE which at many places tends to be sloppy. My favorites are their takoyaki, baked green mussels, garlic tuna, super white tuna, red snapper, the Moon Roll, and the Ecstasy Roll.
A couple of small things I wish they could improve on are outside seating and a tiny bit more effort on sweeping. With the outside seating, it gets pretty busy some nights, and you can not sit unless your entire party is present. With the sweeping, the restaurant is pretty much always clean, but my boyfriend dropped a piece from his roll today and there was rice everywhere under his seat. We got the attention of one the staff and told them what happened, and if I was a host or server there, my first instinct would be to sweep it up right away."}
{"text":"Incredibly sick!! I Ordered take out on 11/30/16 at around 8pm. Purchased 2 chicken teriyaki combination dinners, baked mussels( which i suspect to be the culprit here)and gyoza. Upon waking the next morning, my girlfriend began vomiting. She said her stomach was a wreck and she was physically ill and could not leave the house. I on the other hand was in training for a new job and had to attend work. About an hour into my day, I noticed a queasy ache creeping in my stomach. This queasy ache quickly escalated, and in less then an hour I was running to the bathroom to vomit. Unable to leave work, I had to push on. I was having terrible cold sweats, my body was achy from head to toe, and every so often I had to run back to the bathroom to puke. Upon returning home, my girlfriend, who was still in an awful state (still is), called Sushi Mon to inform them of the issue. To our surprise the restaurant did not offer us any kind of apology or even a refund but informed us to go to the doctor and show them paperwork to prove our story. I went to the doctor today. My girlfriend wants her own immune system to fight it . She's the kind that unless she's dying she doesn't go to Doctors office . If she doesn't feel better by tomorrow she will definitely go to the doctor. But I'm in utter disbelief on how this restaurant handles such public health concerns. This is how outbreaks happen! Don't plan to eat here ever again!"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon was a regular place I'd go to with my friends or family or whoever else loves it there!
All you can eat sushi for 20 something dollars is winners!! 
The staff were always friendly and welcoming which is a huge plus at any restaurant.
Sushi is fresh and so good; the selection is awesome! 
I wish we had a Sushi Mon in HAWAII!"}
{"text":"Wow! Sushi Mon just topped our list for sushi in Vegas. Nigiri was some of the best we've ever tasted. Rolls were fantastic. Sushi chefs were top notch. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First time we wanted to dine here, there was a 30 minute wait. We were too hungry so we left but anticipated our return since there were so many good reviews on here.

I hate to say our experience did not live up to expectations..

We sat at the bar for all you can eat. The sushi chefs didn't talk much at all, and the waiter was pretty slow in refilling drinks. Mine was empty for 5 minutes before they came to refill it.

I was enjoying my calamari and my Volcano Roll. I then ordered a deep-fried roll which I had never tried before, and stopped when I pulled a long hair out of a piece of my sushi. I completely lost my appetite and won't be returning. I really don't see what the hype is about, we've had 200% better experiences at I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"Great place. Cheap and open late! 
Five star for the sturdy toothpicks"}
{"text":"The sushi is good not the best I've ever had. Just good, period. For the price is a bit overpriced the sushi didn't quite look like the picture. But overall was tasty. We also ordered on the side the fried gyoza and the seaweed salad, and mango mochi and green tea ice cream for dessert. Gyoza was good, seaweed salad was sub par, mango mochi was delicious, and the green tea ice cream had chunks of ice cubes in it. Not good.

The service and cleanliness, but especially service is what knocks it down several pegs for me. My mom and I got off work together and when we sat down at the bar tonight we could barely hear the server over the music/loudness. And a couple of customers came in after us and sat down near us and seemed to be friends with the sushi chef and started chatting away. Not only did they get served their appetizer and their ginger and wasabi first but they got their drinks with their water. I ordered a drink I didn't even get, luckily wasn't charged for it. The counter where we were sitting hasn't really been wiped off it was still dirty and grungy from the previous diners. 

Seemed like the sushi chef was angry with me specifically because I asked the server to get us some wasabi and ginger. He didn't want to make eye contact and only spoke to my mom when he did speak to us. Which was only twice the entire meal. The other chefs smiled and were doing their things, but ours was clearly enjoying himself entertaining his friends.
Disappointing since I am a big sushi fan and I just moved to Vegas and I've been asking for recommendations. This was one of them. I'll likely not be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here for a day trip from Cali to Vegas from time to time. If that doesn't say good food (for the price) then what does?"}
{"text":"We went last night kind of late for the AYCE dinner.  Being from Reno, the capital of AYCE sushi, we were too spoiled to spend for a la carte anywhere else in Vegas, and this place was recommended by a few people.  Checking yelp and looking over the menu we got excited, the variety was great.  
I like to start with nigiri but the fish looked bad, my yellowtail had a lot of different shades to it, maybe it's the way they cut it or maybe it's just kind of old but they do give good fish to rice ratiio.  Also, the salmon didn't come with lemon on it as it does at my favorite place back home, and the sushi chef was fairly inattentive when I wanted to ask for some slices so I just dealt with it.
The long rolls were not anything to write home about either.  They were loosely rolled and had a lot of rice, so much that when I picked one up it fell into soy sauce which splattered ALL over me.  When this happened, the sushi chef offered soda water, which was nice, but it didn't have to happen at all.  
We ordered a couple rolls with no issue but when my boyfriend ordered the Monster roll, thinking it would be piled high with fish, we got disappointed.  The chef made something that looked delicious then piled a whole bowl worth of rice onto it, rolled it up and served it.  My boyfriend decided the only way he could fit it in his mouth would be to take out the actual roll and discard the rice.  He told the waiter he wasn't going to eat it and the waiter was very nice, saying he would have warned him if he'd asked, stating it might be better for a table of 5 people (it's only 5 slices).  We just wish the chef had warned us. But we weren't charged for not eating the rice which was good, cause they charge over $12 for that roll, and that's almost half the cost of dinner.  
So, to summarize, love the AYCE, love the late hours and variety of rolls.  There was so much we wanted to try that we didn't get a chance to.    Service is also excellent but the chef could've been better/more service oriented."}
{"text":"We were at sushi mon on December 24th. It was a little bit of wait for 3 of us to get seated. This is our 4th time and we figured things out. We ordered specials on the chalk board first, because they are always fresh and good. The yellowtail collar appetizer was great. I felt like I was back in japan in a small izakaya. 

We only order nigiri sushi because we love fish. Seared tuna, seared salmon and fresh scallop were our favorites of the day. Their fish is always very fresh and as good as being in japan. They sometimes get rice either not cooked right or the chef did not roll it tight enough, and rice can fall apart. However , we hit the good night and all nigiri made were near perfect.

We tried other AYCE sushi places, but this place is the best among them!"}
{"text":"The food was good but it takes forever for them to bring the food out. I ordered spider roll, it was pretty big so it was hard to eat in one piece. The dynamite was good but it took a while for them to bring it out. I actually had to ask them again for it. And since it was sweet, I needed to off-set the taste so I also ordered shumai. It took half an hour and still no shumai. I finally asked one of the servers for it and within a couple minutes, they brought it out. Were they just sitting on it?"}
{"text":"We are fans, closest to our house and last one to try. The service is awesome, lots of staff and friendly faces. My hubby is a fan of AYCE and tried many items, enjoying them all. I tried rolls, and am happy that they office 1/2 rolls, BUT they are 5 huge pieces. I ordered 2 and couldn't even finish. The miso soup was so-so, I didn't have mine...it was scalding when it arrive and later I did not want to use up valuable space. We tried the shu-mai (terrible, should not have ordered) and chicken yakitori (it was fine) apps, but apps are a mistake if you are there for sushi and rolls. I truly wish that the AYCE places offered true half rolls or made their rolls smaller. Bigger isn't better in this case because you cant enjoy variety if you have a small stomach. I had 4 pieces left and the server explained if I left more than 2 she would have to charge me ala carte. Didn't matter, my meal (2 half rolls and yakitori) didn't even come to the 26.95 price, actually I would have saved money. But for those like me who's eyes are bigger than their stomach, beware. I understand their position, just good to know. Awesome red bean and green tea ice cream. Everything we saw coming from behind the sushi counter looked amazing, everything fresh and the temp expected. We went at 5pm, good time, not too crowded and we know this place does get crowded regularly. Nice selection and many items that don't have cream cheese (wish that had not become a thing). Anyway, recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"The all you can eat is an amazing deal!! We got so much good quality food for a great price! Everything on the menu is included in the deal and it is all high quality.

I lived in Japan for 3 1/2 year, and while the quality here is not quite at that level, it is amazingly great for the states and phenomenal considering its in the desert!

Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Everyone says this place is better than Sushi Kaya but I have to disagree. The rolls here are nothing special and I'm a roll girl... The salmon nigiri is pretty fresh and good but that itself won't keep me from coming here. They don't have too may options with rolls or side dishes either. I would only come here if I really wanted AYCE and was in the area. Though the service is very attentive and sweet."}
{"text":"Great place...great service & very close to my home.  The wait was not bad for a Friday night. This is now my new favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was to try the all-you-can-eat, and my friends all say it's a great value-- but if you're like me and don't want to stuff yourself, go with ala carte ordering!

This is place is perfect for me because they let you order HALF rolls which are also half priced! So it's four rolls for about $4-5 dollars an order. 
I love it because this way I get to try all the rolls I want without stuffing myself and still end up paying less than all-you-can-eat (but I always go with a friend though so we split the bill, usually around $20-25 each after tip when we have about 7 half rolls. 

My favorites:

- New York Girl in Las Vegas (unique salmon w/ cream cheese and a lemon slice)
- Orion Roll (i LOVE the albacore on on the outside)
- ANY of the baked rolls (Flying JJ, Volcano, Volcano 2-- too good.)

On an endnote-- the chefs are usually pretty friendly too and it's actually pretty nice sitting at the bar even when you're with someone. :]"}
{"text":"Large fish, little rice + AYCE = Me very happy.

I've been coming back to this place for a couple of years now. Filled a couple of frequent eater's cards. However it looks like they are cutting back. The last time visited they took a few things off the menu, like Uni. About 25-30 bucks (pre tax-pre tip-pre drink) depending on if you hit dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I go here because it's close.

Yellowtail collar is strong. Fish is fresh. Only thing I don't like is that the rice falls apart too easily. That is kind of a big thing when it comes to sushi.

Would I go here again? Sure, but I definitely would drive farther to go to a better place."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon's Chef Soto is one of Las Vegas' best-kept secrets!* Go right before lunch ends, around 3PM, sit at the bar, and make a new friend.  I  have him do an omakase-style meal of nigiri and the daily specials (which are all reliably great!), and eat until I can't anymore.
Soto is good at pacing so you can enjoy quite a few pieces of fish before unbuttoning your pants or admitting defeat, and is quite charming to make conversation with as you munch.

Stellar stand-outs: fresh scallop, garlic tuna, cajun albacore, tuna hand roll, ika with mint (totally crazy!), and the sea bass. Sides of mussels, miso, orgasm salad and/or sashimi salad are also good add-ons. 

I'm not too big on rolls here unless I'm ordering to-go, but the Lemon roll, Crispy Spicy Roll, and Moon roll are all good picks- they have quite an extensive menu organized by specials, fried rolls, and tempura rolls and most have pictures to accompany them.

For dessert, I tend to stick to the classic green tea ice cream which is never gritty or chalky, while my BF swears by their tempura ice cream (today's special flavor was chocolate-fudge), but they also have a green tea creme brulee on the dinner menu that I've been meaning to try.

All the staff here are incredibly friendly and genuine, but Chef Soto is my favorite. Even if he's not working, all the guys are willing to feed you the best quality and best tasting fish in town, served with a smile and a joke or two.

EDIT: dropping my rating. Chef Soto and several other familiar faces behind the bar are gone, and with them the top-notch service and quality I've loved about this place."}
{"text":"I live close by so I always drop in late night since their open till 2am.
For the all you can eat sushi of $27...you can't go wrong.  I'm not a fan of their yellowtail sushi...one time it didn't taste fresh so now I stick to the rolls.  My fav by far is the Jay Jay roll...shrimp tempura, avocado, philly creamcheese, asparagus, wrapped in seaweed and rice...topped with eel sauce...melts in your mouth!!!!!  This roll is priced at $8.  You can't go wrong with all the other rolls either...and their reasonably priced, but if you can put down some sushi..go with the all you can eat! :)
Location is decent...not like super nice but it's decent..at least they have a flat screen where they have sports on all the time!

If you have a craving for sushi and you need to feed it really quick with good sushi then this is the place, but if you want to really impress a date or significant other..hit up Yellowtail on the strip!

ps.  Jay Jay roll! my fav!"}
{"text":"After moving to Henderson/Vegas 2 months ago, I've finally found my new favorite sushi restaurant. Everyone was incredibly nice (especially our chef!) and most importantly, the sushi was wonderful. Definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"All you can you sushi made to order in Vegas. Very fresh sushi in the middle of the desert believe it or not. For around $25/person you get a wide variety of fresh sushi and side dishes. The restaurant was not too big but we came for lunch on Sunday so we didn't have to wait, I heard it gets crowded at peak times. My favorite are definitely all the nigiri and they don't give you a huge piece of rice as filler. There are a couple of high end more expensive items on the menu that you can only have one order per person. I say take full advantage and order it all because they were all very delicious; Uni, sweet shrimp, cajun salmon, amberjack, and yellowtail collar. 

We stuffed our face and proud of it. All you can ask for in Sushi are freshness and variety and SushiMon satisfy both. Only downside, it is located about 20min drive from the main strip and if you do not have a car, it's not worth it to taxi out there."}
{"text":"i really liked this place, the prices are reasonable, the servings are generous, the food is good, and the service is not too slow."}
{"text":"After waiting for hours to get a table, FINALLY!!!  I can't believe that I consumed so much sushi in an hour.

The fishes are fair, the service is sub-par, but the prices are really good."}
{"text":"I'm usually very skeptical of AYCE sushi... but this place was surprisingly good. 

Decent sushi (quality and prep), great selection of the basics and the rolls. They don't have any fancy fish selections but they have the basic and they are done well. The fish was fresh, the service quick. The fish to rice ratio of the nigiri was good. The rice was done well, not too tangy, not mushy, doesn't fall apart. Loved the yellowtail, red snapper, and albacore that day. I'd say pass on the fried oysters and the green mussels. Rolls are ok. 

All in all, definitely worth the $30 and the ~25mins drive off the strip (as a vegas visitor)."}
{"text":"I love u guys to death! But these continued 30-45 min waits are getting old! When are u going to expand this location!? And if u aren't u need to create some kind of VIP program!! U should have some kind of VIP card for ur customers that are at ur establishment all the time! The ones u know by name! Or maybe start taking reservations! I have to take my business else where tonight! PLEASE, as a loyal customer, please start takin care of us!!"}
{"text":"iono about you TODAI, but this place has the best AYCE sushi 

the first time i came here when i was in vegas, i was too hungover so i didnt have room in my stomach for AYCE so i just ordered 2 rolls special of my choice out of their selection and it was last then $10. i dont remember what i got but i all i know is that the rolls i got were fresh and comforting

so..for the REAL review..came back to this place last weekend..yes another trip to VEGAS! i feel like its my 2nd home alreadyyy

i was ready for the $25 AYCE sushi..started off with salmon collar and tuna poki salad! amazing!! u HAVE to get the salmon collar..i also tried the mussels, gyoza, and the seaweed salad, all awesome!

then i had sunrise roll, baked 428 (chicken teryaki inside a sushi?!)  flying jason roll, baked dynamite roll, tried the quail egg shot, halibut nigiri, salmon nigiri, and the Jala Jala roll...im sure theres more but when i remember, ill update

for dessert, green tea and strawberry mochi ice cream, lychee sorbet (YUM) and then to finish it off, tempura ice creamm!!!

you can have it all, just for $25...and this place opens til 2 AM WAHH"}
{"text":"The All You Can Eat Option is the way to go at this restaurant. 
There are plenty of choices and everything is made fresh to order. The fish is very fresh. Service is excellent and the entire staff is super friendly. Definately a much better value for your $$ then most of the sushi places in town.

I was brought here by a relative and loved it but I have been bummed out that every time I try to go back the line is out the door! This is a good thing for them, but not for me when I'm starving. Sushi Mon, If you read this, GET A BIGGER RESTURANT so I can eat too!!!

FYI, door opens at 5pm, be sure to get there early. $25 for all you eat (1 hour limit)"}
{"text":"On a recent trip from Oahu, we ran into this restaurant while searching for an all you can eat sushi joint...
The 4 of us got there at about 7:30pm on a Wednesday night and had about an hour and a half wait. Besides the reservationist/cashier being a little on the rude side, and the all you can eat sushi menu only allowing each person only 1 order of uni, ama ebi, and the hamachi kama each, the fish was very fresh, and they had nice size cuts of fish on their nigiri sushi. All in all I'd give it a thumbs, and will be returning there on my next visit to Las Vegas! I just hope the reservationist/cashier doesn't read this or the next time my wait will be even longer, buahahaha."}
{"text":"Now who loves Sushi, I do, I do. Well if you're like me and can be picky at times, Ha Ha Ha.  You will be pleasantly surprised that this small place packs a huge punch with delicious food and great customer services. I went for the early lunch All You Can Eat and I had the Sexy Lady Sushi roll and it was amazing full of flavor and I couldn't get enough of it. The Spider roll was also a top pick and all the other appetizers I tried I really enjoyed. The staff from Chef to wait staff were really good and very attentive to our table. There's no shortage of parking and their restroom was very clean. The grand finale of my lunch was dessert and their Strawberry Monchi ice cream made my day. Be sure to get a stamp/initials to your loyalty card, because after 10 stamps you get a free dinner."}
{"text":"Definitely a go to place when you're in Vegas and want AYCE Sushi.  

Let me start off with the place.  It's a pretty small location and with the amount of interest, this place gets packed and wait times can range from 10 min to 90 min+.  On our last trip there, we had a party of six and what disturbed us the most was that seating was not on a first come first served basis for larger groups.  You would expect the staff to hold tables that are next to each other and almost nearly closing out to fit a larger group but that was not the case.  Groups of four was being seated before us and we had to wait for a larger table that would normally fit six.  We had to wait almost 90+ minutes before we got a table.  My recommendation is to get there before they open which I believe is 11am or after 2pm when it starts to die down.  

The food there is awesome!  Nothing to complain about.  Try anything that catches your eye.  My top picks are the white tuna, garlic ahi, ama ebi, unagi, masago w/ qual eggs, calamari, shrimp tempura, etc.  

It looks like they opened another location so we'll most likely try that place out when we're back in town."}
{"text":"If you're looking for sushi in Vegas, this place is fantastic. A little off the beaten path for tourists (not a negative, really), the food was stellar."}
{"text":"Went in to try this place again tonight after about 5 years and the sewer smell was the same as the reason we stopped going here. They told us it's only been like that a week and they don't know where it's coming from. I told them it was from the sewer system pipes and we left."}
{"text":"I really don't get why people like this place so much. i go all the time because it's near my house but there are like 5 others in a 2 mile radius that serves all you can eat and is way better.  For awhile I thought the staff was kind of rude. I don't need them looking over my shoulder to see if my half bite of my friend's sushi roll is breaking their \"no sharing\" rule. Dang, I just want to try so I know whether or not to order. I recommend I love Sushi or Kaizen Sushi (more expensive though). They're close and off Eastern."}
{"text":"I live in the Bay Area so I love fresh fish and sushi rolls. After hearing my cousin, who lives in Vegas, tell me this is the best AYCE spot, I had to stop by. I got seated at the bar right away. I give one star to the staff for being nice and attentive. One star for the quick service and getting my food out quickly. One star for some pretty fresh Salmon nigiri. But their rolls were just not good enough. None of the rolls wowed me enough. I liked a couple rolls but it just wasn't that great. I really liked how big their menu was and how many options they had but I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Lots of positives. They're open late, you can order half rolls to get more variety, service is pretty quick. There's plenty of cooked stuff for those adverse to raw fish.

We arrived at around 9:30 on a weekday and the restaurant was still at least half full. We were seated quickly, and we noticed a sign saying we only had 1 hour, so we ordered hot tea and a few rolls literally right as we sat down. Our waitress put our order in, and we got some more time to take a closer look at the menu. 

Round 1 comes, and we order our round 2 right away. Then round 3 and 4 fairly soon after that. By round 4, our waitress said to us \"you guys know the rules, right? no leftover rice?\"
Us: uhh... I think so?
Waitress: you guys still have a monster roll coming
Us: yea, we know

Hahahaha, she wasn't rude about it, but more shocked at how much we were ordering. We read over the rules, just in case, and asked her about the 1 hr rule. She said we were okay, they just don't allow customers to sit for 30 mins before ordering again. We continued for several more rounds, and then even ordered 2 rounds of dessert. I loved the green tea ice cream, but the lychee sherbet was a close second.

The fish was pretty decent. Ami ebi was awesome, and so was the yellowtail collar (warning, you can only have 1 order per person of these). Plenty of variety, and definitely worth the $27."}
{"text":"Low quality food and service.
Not worth the high price tag of all you can eat.
I've been to places cheaper than this with top notch customer service and food quality.

We were never introduced to our waiter, had to order from the lady that seated us, after getting our first order and when we were ready to order another round we ended up waiting 30 minutes and the lady we initially ordered from informed us that she is not our waiter. 
Soda was watered down, tuna had a odd consistency, and it took forever to order.

Will not be coming here again.
There are many other sushi restaurants, I recommend going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Loved this place !! Very good for All You Can Eat and at a great price !! The service was very good and they were packed !! 

Very large selection of AYCE and fast with getting it out to you ! They are open from noon till 2am and we ate at the bar ! We will definitely go back ! The place is very clean and expect a little bit of a wait !!"}
{"text":"Sushi to rice ratio is way off. 2x the rice to thin slice of fish. Don't order appetizers  (miso soup / seaweed salad) they put extra salt to get you to drink more and eat less. They get mad if you don't finish every grain of their rice. \"That's a 'no no'. You must eat all rice or they charge you\" says the waitress. Who is \"they\"? Lol 

Quality of cuts is not good as the sushi \"chef\" leaves the tough \"silver skin\" in the fish, making it disappetizing. Add the excessive rice clump to the mix and you get expensive gas station quality sushi.

1 star for the can of Febreeze in the bathroom.  Thank you ;)

Tip: You can easily dump their excess sushi by putting all of it into a napkin and flushing it into their toilet! Or load your mouth and spit it into the toilet, if you don't want to keep asking for napkins!)

Health: Kitchen has a moldy stink to it. You may want to give it a wiff while waiting for your table. You may change you dining plans afterwards. I didn't notice it until I went to dump my rice load. 

Go to Kazuki Sushi on Decatur. WAY BETTER AYCE!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi but also offers other great options. My bf and I go here frequently, the downside is there is usually a wait but they are good at seating as soon as possible. The food here is good and they have some pretty good deals. We often get the dinner special and the beef dinner special they are good with a lot of food and a great price."}
{"text":"Food always good and fresh, get all you can eat, try everything, Salman is the best, I prefer cooked rolls and the cook came up with some special rolls Cartered to my liking"}
{"text":"Ok..so if u want me to get straight to the point. I have been to this locatiom 3x. It NEVER dissapoints. I am talking about the best sushi in TOWN!!!! Moon roll, miles roll, JJ Roll the list goes on..chefs are great, food is exceptional, wait staff is friendly. The price moderate, for AYCE, but its worth every penny. This location is better than the one on W. Sahara, since they have more to offer. If someone talks about Sushi-Mon go to THIS LOCATION!!. The sushi chefs are much better, and the food is better and they have more to offer on the menu. Everything comes out fresh, and have not once have had a complaint. Don't forget the strawberrry mochi, and ice cream tempura, baked mussels and ahi poke are great too. This is the real deal, for sushi in vegas, forget the strip, with the over priced rolls. This is the best deal in town, and the best sushi in TOWN!!! If anyone out of town, asks me about sushi, i tell bring them here!"}
{"text":"Staff was really friendly as I've always remembered from previous visits when I would be in town. But the quality of the food has unfortunately gone down! 

The chicken yalitori is a thick cut piece of teriyaki on a stick instead of small pieces of juicy chicken. The amount of rice that comes with the nigiri remains small but the quality of the unagi, super white, seared salmon, hamachi, and tamago have declined since my last visit a couple of years ago. Maybe the rolls are still delicious but I only ate nigiri on this visit. 

On the bright side, the tempura is as delicious as I remembered. The yuzu sorbet I could have eaten for the whole hour I was there if I hadn't come with an appetite. 

AYCE- lunch $21.95 / dinner $26.95."}
{"text":"Great \"All You Can Eat\" sushi restaurant! They have a huge selection of specialty rolls that you must try. Loved the \"Sexy Girl\" and \"Crispy Rice!\"  And...save room for ice cream!  Head there early for din (or you may need to wait up to 90 min for a table) and bring your appetite! :)"}
{"text":"Food wz good. If you want ur food timely, you need to order at least 15 mins ahead of time. Service is slow, especially if there's more than two tables occupied. I like Makinos better. I get what i want, when i want it."}
{"text":"My wife and I love sushi.  We have been to several Sushi restaurants and sushi buffets in Las Vegas and Henderson.  Personally, I think Sushi Mon is the best - however, it is one of the most expensive.  The only knock on them is:
a.  $27 price tag per head - ouch -- pretty pricey.  Most sushi buffets run around 20-24 bucks.  If you look around, you can get some under 20 too...  If they lower their weekly prices, they probably get more customers. 
b.  1 hour time limit on dinner -- early in the meal, rather than enjoying the meal, I found myself \"clock\" watching.  But, actually, this was not bad, after 45 minutes, I was ready to be rolled out in a wheel barrow.  I was stuffed and felt like I was going to give birth. Being a guy, this probably would be my 15 minutes of fame on CNN.
c.  You may have to wait 20-40 minutes.  By the way, problem with waiting is that there is NO waiting area.  The street is it.  

We have been here 3 times already.  Unfortunately, they do not take reservations.. Be ready to wait in line.  The first time we were here, we had to wait 45 minutes (ended up shopping at Smith's grocery store to past the time).  Secondly, I would recommend asking to be seated at the BAR.  When they seat you at the table, they give you this menu and you have to hail down a waiter.  I rather sit at the bar and watched the \"sushi guys\" make the sushi.  Also, you get quicker service instead of waving down a waiter.  You can ask the sushi guy directly to make you the roll.  As for the sushi, it was fresh!  We love the cooked eel, salmon, and yellowtail.  yum... definitely, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi quality is fantastic--I can't believe that it's AYCE. And you can get one order of uni, sweet sushi, and some of the other pricey sushi that they have on special. Frequently, you can't see the rice at all underneath the nigiri because the large planks of fish cover the rice entirely. Definitely worth driving away from the strip for."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about this place. 
My first experience here, I did not do the all-you-can-eat, but the rolls and sashimi I ordered were just awful. Everything I ordered came warm and sticky, like it had been sitting out for a while. I gave this place a second chance when I went with my man and some friends, and it wasn't any better. 

Major disappointment after all the good things I had heard.

If I could rate this place a zero, I sure would."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi restaurant. I know there is better and this place is not all fancy inside but I have never had bad Sushi here. The service is also awesome and the staff is great. The place is always packed, that should tel you something, but if you go early you can usually get in pretty fast. The appetizer menu has a ton of items and with the all you can eat you get appetizers and desert. Last time we went in they had taken the Mochi ice cream off the all you can eat but go ahead and splurge to get it, it is awesome!"}
{"text":"back for more food, so happy they went up to an A rating. My confidence is back, so is my business, highly recommend"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi, but the catch is that you can only order three dishes (per person) at a time, and finish before you are able to order another round."}
{"text":"Gone downhill!   It used to be one of our favorites for AYCE sushi. We would go almost once a week but slowed down the frequency when we thought their quality was slipping. We noticed a big change with the new management.  Place looks old and bathrooms need cleaning. The food was really disappointing. None of the fish seemed all that fresh although the tempura was still good. If you loved the old Sushi Mon, you may be disappointed with the changes as they are not for the better."}
{"text":"One of the top ayce in town. Service is slow and can take minutes to hours to be seated because of how small the restaurant is. The food itself is great and is always delicious. Average pricing and creative rolls."}
{"text":"just wanted to say it is and always will be my choice of sushi bars. I was introduced by the old chef from NOBU, Lindsey. And i have never really eaten at any other local places. Yum! cant wait till next time"}
{"text":"First off, it's hard to compare this place with other sushi joints local to Las Vegas because I am technically a Southern Cali girl. But Overall, I did have a good experience at this place. 

Some friends and I were running some last minute errands in Las Vegas and we were way off the strip to take care of them. We were also quite hungry and just looking for some decent food we saw along the way. It was either Sushi or Greek. Everyone felt like Sushi so as soon as I saw a decent Sushi place, I said \"let's go to THAT one!\". 

So we parked and headed inside. This place is TINY as heck. We luckily got seated fast but then a line started to form immediately after us. We definitely lucked out! I can only imagine how long you must have to wait to be seated when there are so few seats in this joint.

The service was not bad. But they did forget TWO of our orders. But the sushi was very good. We didn't opt for the All You Can Eat because there's no way I could eat $27 worth of sushi all by myself. I wasn't THAT hungry. I instead just ordered 2 rolls which came out to less than $15 total and I was a happy camper. The rolls were delicious and satisfying. 

This place is busy and seems very popular among all. It must be a rare good sushi place in Vegas and so that's why everyone comes here. In my personal opinion, it's very hard to find good Asian food in Vegas. I have not been very impressed but this place is the first to semi impress me. I would actually come back again if I felt like driving off the strip for some sushi."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday night for all you can eat Sushi for $27.99 and I must say this was one of hte best Sushi places I have eaten in ages!!!
The best seat is by the sushi bar and the service is faster than you can blink!
When you order a side such as seaweed Salad  you barely are done with the word and your salad is there! and all 5 star!

The wine/beer menu is very cheap also .. 3.65 for a glass of wine?! How cool is that!

Also you get a free Sake shooter included with your meal!

I will DEF be back when I can get to Vegas again!"}
{"text":"This place is the exact same as Sushi House Goyemon. 

Everything on the menu is the exact same, therefore I love it just as much and was the same enjoyable experience.

Decor is not as good as Sushi House Goyemon but taste is the same.

Overall service and everything is awesome. The store is small so there might be a little wait time from 20-60mins."}
{"text":"Pretty good all you can eat sushi spot in Las Vegas! Sat at the sushi bar and service was definitely quick and we enjoyed our sushi chef Yasu! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Always great sushi no matter if you are doing AYCE or individual orders. Always a wait for this place."}
{"text":"Average AYCE sushi.

They don't have no real crab meat, even outside the AYCE menu - imitation crab is a deal breaker for me. While some items were good, others not so much. The chef was a nice guy.

Probably it's just that I'm not into AYCE sushi. Maybe I'm just missing Tsukiji Sushi-Zanmai for the incredible value for the price. I know, this is America..."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Mon many times before and I feel like each time I go I'm more disappointed. I used to love Sushi Mon and would tell everyone it was the best sushi  spot around. However, the past few times I've gone the quality has not been as great as it used to and the service isn't that wonderful either. 

I went with a friend last night and we waited over 40 minutes to be sat. That isn't too unusual for Sushi Mon and before I never minded the wait. However, sushi mon has a website where you can check who is next on the wait list. When we were next to be sat, a party of four was sat down before us and then we were sat shortly after. Not a big deal, but a host should always follow the list. Especially when we had been waiting beyond our quoted time. The server, Claire, also took the order of the table next to us before taking ours. She waited approximately 10 minutes to come take our order and was extremely rude to us when she came to our table. In the middle of our order for AYCE she said \"okay is that enough for first round?\" Even though the table next to us had ordered far more she never asked them if they were done ordering. Once we ordered our food it took a very long time for it to come out even though the table next to ours who she clearly favored got their food shortly after placing their order. 

The sushi was alright, definitely not as good as it used to be. I found the presentation of the sushi to be sloppy and inconsistent. So with the average sushi and poor service it's safe to say that after being a very loyal Sushi Mon customer I'm not sure if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Always a wait. The absolute freshest sushi. Great service in spite of being very busy. Worth a try for sure"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just OK. Went in, staff was welcoming and kind. Attentive for the most part. Atmosphere was clean as well and the sushi was just OK. It didn't taste bad but it wasn't memorable also for me compared to other sushi spots I've ate. If I had to pick a roll I liked the best, it would be the Royal California. Their Baked Mussels is pretty good. Not really much I can say more but that."}
{"text":"I have been around the sushi block and I will say that this is still my favorite. I wish the wait was not so long at times and the service could be better, but I do think that the quality and consistency of their fish is incredible."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to recommend this place start taking reservations. Our group lost 2 members due to some confusion about wait time. We were told 1 hour and really only waited 20 minutes. 

AYCE sushi should warrant a wait (as in 4 laps around the parking lot before you are allowed to sit down) and sushi is prepared fresh--- no rolls sitting under fluorescent lights here!

Started with seaweed salad, which was followed by;
Mingus roll
Domingo roll
Yebisu roll
Jala Jala roll
Hurricane roll
Ecstasy roll
Red dragon roll
Pastel roll
Mussels
a few nigiri rolls (yellow tail, halibut)
along with smelt/quail egg roll

My stomach hurt so good that I somehow managed to have a bite of strawberry mochi!!

Dinner was about $26 a person (beverage not included), well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my husbands and I's  favorite place to eat sushi. Great fresh fish, and speedy service! I only wish that they expanded the property. It gets a bit stuffy and its usually busy. So for the most part you will be waiting at least 30 mins if you go in the evening. Thank goodness they opended up a sister property Goyemon which gives you the same great taste with great ambience plus its on our side of town. Cant go wrong there! either way its worth checking out :)"}
{"text":"Had a craving for sushi and found this place from Yelp.  It was the closest Sushi place from our hotel and the rating was pretty high so we decided to check it out.  

Had an awesome experience, very friendly staff and the fish was high quality.  Good thing we ordered the all you can eat since we ate almost triple of the  amount of what they charge for ayce.  Our sushi chef's name was Mike, very friendly and knowledgable.

We will definitely visit again the next time we're in town and will recommend the place to our family and friends."}
{"text":"We had a good experience in this small restaurant with big surprise in flavors.
The sushi and sashimi was very good absolutely tasty made. Come here if you are looking for fresh and simple sushi that will melt in your mouth. The price was really reasonable with good service. I love to have lunch in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't understand the big deal with this place. Yeah, it's open til 2 am, yeah it's all-you-can-eat, but I'd rather eat at Yama earlier or spend like $5 more at Osaka (which is also open til 2 am and has a late night discount menu, which includes philly rolls and japanese lasagna).

The rolls are DECENT. Nothing spectacular. They don't bond the seaweed/rice properly. Or perhaps the rice isn't cooked right. But the rolls look like crap and fall apart easily. 
Japanese lasagna is ONLY tolerable at Osaka. Anytime I see it on a menu somewhere else I have to try it. And it disappoints. Always.

This place is too small. Good luck trying to get a party of 4+ in here. The service is sub-par. It's usually loud as hell and packed - inside and out. I'm not waiting. I don't want to drive to eat somewhere and find out it's too busy to serve me. So I just don't go here - period.

I'm trying to sample most of the good sushi places in Vegas, and when I find an affordable place that serves good standard AND special rolls, I return frequently, especially when service isn't lacking. AND I tell everyone I know about it. Sushi Mon just isn't worthy. Kekkou desu!"}
{"text":"If you want bad service & ok sushi, then this is your place.Don't be fooled by the yelp sticker on the front door! We arrived at 1:15 pm.  We needed service for 3 adults & 1 child.  We had to wait for a table, no problem. There is no waiting area. We stood there, blocking the door with our 2 infant car seats, toddler, & 3 adults.  Who's gonna wait outside in the 100deg heat?!   We finally sat down at 1:50, the tables had been clear for a good 10 mins before they finally sat us.   Another 15 mins to tell them we wanted AYCE, we were able to order some food.  
Cons: SLOW AND INCONSIDERATE STAFF.  They need more help, 2 servers & a busser were clearly not enough for the busy lunch hour.  I heard the busboy tell the server we were ready, he simply said ok, I'll be there.  Then 10 more mins passed by.  Not that he wasn't busy, but he was too busy doing other things then to come & take our order.  Then he & the other server had to discuss which one was taking our table.
-The red bean ice cream they served was old-tasting & old-looking.  My friend asked if she could get another since it was so ice cold, her spoon was about to become disfigured as she tried to eat it, but the server said that was how it came, \"hard as a brick, sorry\".  
-We had to flag them down for everything...
Pros:
-the AYCE menu included hot/cold appetizers as well.  I thought that was a good deal. 

Be back? Probably not, since there are at least 3 more sushi restaurants within a 5 mile radius competing for my business."}
{"text":"Very good AYCE, love the fact that you can do half orders of most rolls.  The chocolate mousse is fantastic.  Not a large restaurant so there is usually a small 10-20 minute wait."}
{"text":"About 9 pm on a Thursday evening, we're off work for the holidays, and craving sushi. So of course it's time for Sushi Mon!

The AYE menu is generous, the staff always friendly, the fish always fresh and my belly always happy and full when I leave. Dang. As I'm writing this review I'm craving it again...

I really like their fried calamari - it's lightly seasoned, fresh, and served with a hint of sauce over a small bed of lettuce.

Here's a tip:  Order from the specials board 1st because items sell out quickly. Be sure to pay attention to the different colored stars since they indicate if you can order 1 per person or more.

My favorite for years was hamachi (yellow tail), but Sushi Mon's super white has taken over. So delicate, fresh, and tender. The halibut is also really nice with just a tiny hint of citrus (I think?).

I also usually love the Sexy Girl (I order a half roll), but the Crispy Rice with spicy tuna will definitely be a repeat.

I always forget my punch card, so thank you for stamping my receipt. Now if I can stop losing my receipts...  No matter, it won't stop me from enjoying Sushi Mon's awesome food!"}
{"text":"This is a regular stop for us in Vegas...great price for all you can eat sushi (and green tea ice cream).  This time around was a different story...they brought us a tray of gray....yes, GRAY...fish and tried to pass it off as Toro.  For you sushi eaters in the know - Toro is like the filet mignon of tuna.  One of the girls in our group (who speaks Japanese) spoke to the owner and told her we were not comfortable eating GRAY fish...the owner replied that it was flown in the day before but we were stil skeptical.  No one touched it...not even the guys in our group who will eat anything. 

Sorry Sushi-Mon...can't bullsh*t the bullsh*tters...we won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi,  not too much rice at all.  Great selection of all types of nigiri sushi,  we didn't bother with the rolls or appetizers.  Sit at the bar, you'll probably get better,  quicker service but you better know what to order.  Save room for dessert,  the green tea and red bean ice cream is da bomb."}
{"text":"If you go with a group of friends, all of you do the all you can eat. They won't let you share if you are doing the AYCE and a friend isn't.

When i feel like having sushi at work for lunch, I always call here for an order to pick up ;) Its really convenient and ready to pick up in 10 Minutes. 

I usually come here for the AYCE special. You have two sides on the menu and the appetizers and ice cream desserts are also included in the AYCE menu. 

The shrimp Tempura and the Ahi Poke are my two favorite appetizers. I will usually order five servings in one sitting. ;) Great stuff. 

My newest favorite roll there is the Mesquite Roll. Its a Spicy tuna roll topped with Raw Salmon and Mango strips topped with a mango chutney sauce. This roll is refreshing and different from the usual rolls on the menu. 

The place is usually always busy when i go there to eat and the staff usually is very attentive. 

You must try some of the baked rolls that they have on the menu, its really good and I am starting to order those a lot more every time i visit. I order the Jason Roll: California roll with scallops and cream cheese, baked and topped with yum yum sauce. It melts in your mouth, but watch out, let it cool down before biting into it its HOT. and attempting to pick it up while hot is a no-go. haha unless you want it on your clothes...i would wait a little bit. 

This place is family friendly and don't forget to try some of the special rolls that they put out (usually its written on paper and pasted on the walls in the restaurant) 

Happy dining!!!"}
{"text":"The host was the manager I'm sure and was the most unaccommodating person ever. Do u want business or not? We had a party of 10 people and we were willing to squish and he was NOT willing to accommodate?! Wtf...

Nigiri comes with a big piece of rice thats hella hard, and we were supposed to eat all of them?! I would have if they cooked it better. and employee kept pushing us to finish the damn rice. Ugh

They gave us 45 min limit for all u can eat but it took them half hour to bring out each order...what?

Mediocre in every aspects."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi experiences of my life.
I started to get adventurous with the menu and the sushi chef offered small tastes of things to me, instead of whole rolls or plates. I was super impressed with this, and I could also say that this was the freshest sushi I ever had...I am not a sushi snob, but its some fine ass sushi. lol
Price is right, we did AYCE. I would be back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My husband and I had only seen an udon noodle bowl of soup this amazing looking on the travel channel. Definitely our favorite spot from now on."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi joint! It has become a comfort place for me. They should make the dining area bigger since a lot of people come here and the lines are always long. The food is always fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"This is perhaps the worst service I've experienced from any sushi restaurant. I was out to dinner with 2 friends & after reading the reviews this place relieved, it sounded fantastic. After the first round of orders the quality of the service & sushi went down drastically. The server let us sit for 15min after taking our plates from the first order before returning to take our follow up orders. When the 2nd order had been placed, our server returned 10min later & rudely questioned if we could even finish our order. This led to another 10min wait before receiving our food. I understand having to serve & accommodate other orders/customers, but the delivery of our food was a slow & drawn out process, especially when compared to the super quick food drops when we first sat down. Sushi that was supposed to be hot was cold, & the cold sushi was warm as if it had been sitting out. At this point we knew we were no longer wanted. After flagging down our server, we requested dessert along with the bill. The mochi was on point, but the tempura ice cream was presented in a soggy condition, ending our evening at this establishment. All of this & they had the nerve to ask for a 12% percent gratuity on the check. They treated us horribly as customers. We were not loud in anyway,  rude or disrespectful in any manner, or deserving of this horrendous customer service. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The Best all you can eat place!!
i live in LA and i would sometimes drive to vegas with my friend just to go to this place!
The sweet shrimp with the fried head is a must! its SOOO good!
i love their yellowtail, unagi, and their yum yum scallop is also good. \
for dessert, definately try the tempura ice cream! the best thing ever!!
and rememebr to get the stamp card. You can get one free all you can eat if you have 10 stamps!"}
{"text":"This is a quality neighborhood sushi joint. The service was very friendly and prompt, the fish fresh, and the $26.99 AYCE for dinner was a great deal. We had several rolls: sexy girl, athena, tiger, and 911 (which was disappointingly un-spicy). For nigiri we opted for uni (limit one per person for ayce), salmon, scallop and tuna.  We also had two orders of their calamari which was great. All in all the food was fresh, service friendly and on point. I am marking one star off because Athena roll was bland and 911 roll was not as spicy as advertised."}
{"text":"I've tried plenty of all you can eat sushi restaurants in Vegas (they seem to be popping up everywhere). Now it's kinda hard to go to a place like Little Buddha and pay $20 for a roll knowing you can go to Sushi Mon and pay about $30 for all you can eat. Usually when I hear all you can eat or buffet, I would say I am not interested because of the quality of the food.

Sushi Mon is def. the best for all you can eat for locals. You get the same thing for lunch, so it would be better to go for lunch if you can and pay less. They have a ton of rolls here-which are all really good-too many to mention. Alot are covered in sauces, but its not overboard like some other sushi restaurants. I also like how you can get a half order of the rolls. 

Sushi seems fresh and the place is reliable. Waitresses are fast and available. I have tried to take out of town visitors here, but if they want some cool Vegas type place I guess this would not be the place to go. You would have to go on the strip, but then you pay for it there and portions are much smaller.

I would like this place even more if they let you get sashimi! I have been to another all you can eat in Vegas that has sashimi on the all  you can eat (Hikari) but this place was dirty inside, old looking, ok I will just do another review haha. 

They also have a good choice of appetizers you can get with the all you can eat."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!  Def worth the money!  Made to order.  So, it's fresh."}
{"text":"Soooooo good! Got the all you can eat sushi, such a great experience! The all you can eat is $22 and the service was great. They help you out if you're not familiar with the menu and are very patient. I would Definitely come back if I'm back on this side of town. Looking for amazing sushi? Come here!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at Sushi Mon.  It was always one of our favorite all you can eat spots in town.  For some reason we hadn't been in 3 years and decided to dine there tonight.  I went with a friend and my 3 year old son.  My son does not like anything that is typically offered on a sushi menu so I packed a juice box and a plastic bag with something he would eat.  Our server mentioned that it was their policy not to allow outside food and told us that if my son were to eat or drink what I brought we would be asked to leave.  I tried to order a drink for my son (juice or milk) and was told they only carried soft drinks or lemonade.  I didn't want to cause a scene so between sushi rolls I took my 3 year old outside to eat his meal.  It was tough to explain to my son why he had to eat outside in the 105 degree heat.  The most frustrating part of this evening is when we explained to another employee why we were feeding him outside she said that she had never heard of such a policy.  

I was also disappointed in the service we received.  We tried to flag the waiter down for drink refills multiple times with no luck.  Luckily the hostess had a pitcher of water and could at least keep our waters topped off.  There appeared to be plenty of servers and ours did not look overworked but we were not given much attention

The sushi wasn't bad but not like I remember it.  I know this review won't apply to people without kids but Sushi Mon made it very clear that they have enough of a customer base to be family friendly."}
{"text":"I took two sushi fans here for the first time and we had an amazing experience!  The food and service were outstanding!
We got there right around 11:30am on a weekday, and shortly there after the place started to fill up!
I also recommend the call in and pick-up...they took about 10-15 min to make my rolls!"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi! U said the magic words! I'm such a sucker for good sushi!
We came here on the last day of our trip.  It was 20mins away from the strip, located in an Asian strip mall.  Wait time was abt an hour.

Place is small, seats abt 50 at most?
Service was great! we had Hamachi and salmon belly (which both r soooo good) baked muscles, and tons of rolls.  We started to order everything and anything, since we all were pretty hungry.  

it was $22/person.  Which is an awesome price!!! 
Thanks for being a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I had this the weekend I was in Vegas for my birthday. I didn't get the AYCE but their rolls are really good. They aren't super huge but if you get it as AYCE it would be a great way to try em all. They also have strawberry mochi for dessert. All orders came pretty quick."}
{"text":"Love this little all you can eat sushi! !! Best sushi in town, I think.. All the sushi is super fresh,  rolls are amazing. . Don't forget to try the yellow tail collar,  it's one of my favorites also the fried shrimp heads!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot good thing about this place so we wanted to try out.  We've been some sushi restaurant but I think this will be our spot.  Nigiri sushi were a lot smaller than another restaurants but it was pretty good!  Just order more.  Lol. Rolls are awesome too.  But I didn't  see any noodle menu like everybody posted thogh.  Overview,I'll recommended to my friends."}
{"text":"Perfect quality of food. Perfect service. Fair prices for lunch and dinner. Good location (please come to San Diego). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have 3 all you can eat. The selected nigiri we had were all awesome! We had super white tuna, yellowtail, salmon (the best), albacore, Cajun albacore, halibut, red snapper, mackerel, yum yum scallop, salmon roe, and smelt egg. Plus, everything on the board of daily special fish, spider roll, half hurricane, and green tea ice scream and lychee sorbet. One the other friend is a vegetarian. She had everything that has no meat and she loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I dont know what happened to this place... It used to be awesome food for awesome prices. But the quality of the food has dropped. I would recommend other places before this restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm a very common sushi eater averaging 4-6 time a month. I know when choosing an all you can eat bar over a pay per plate, you are going to lose some quality but my experience at Sushi Mon was just sad! Total lack of care. Rolls were just thrown together, Unagi Sauce on the menus and table, dirty glasses and plates, and the decor was non existent. When spending $27 there are a lot better options in town! 

The ONE positive thing I will say is, the staff was very friendly and provided great service and that's the only reason they got 2 stars!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've been to. I have been to a few, but this one is definitely one of the favorites. 
I have gone there twice in the past couple of weeks for their all you can eat sushi. Amazing service, and the sushi were just delicious! 
A bit pricey, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my parents.  When I had to opportunity to go to Vegas for a convention, I suggested it to my coworkers and we went to try it for dinner.  There was a line when we got there and the wait was about 40 minutes.  We weren't in a rush so we killed time by checking out the surrounding stores.  

When we finally got our seats, we immediately told the waitress we wanted the AYCE sushi (all of us love sushi).  It was about $26 at the time.  The one thing that we didn't know going in was that you only have 1 hour for AYCE.  We ending up coming a second time and ordered a lot of plates at the beginning.  When we had eaten about half of the plates, we would order again.  That way, we could eat more and not get full as fast from waiting if you order one plate at a time.  I tried most of their specialty rolls (dragon, caterpillar, tiger, volcano, athena, etc.).  All delicious.  If they have it in stock, you can order sweet shrimp and salmon collar too.  One order per person though, even if you are doing AYCE.  The tempura ice cream was a nice dish to finish off the meal.  We all got our money's worth for sure (and then some).

If you're ever in Las Vegas and have a craving for sushi, definitely consider coming here.  There's another place called 808 Sushi that's similar to Sushi Mon, but I don't think there's a time limit.  I'll have to check it out the next time I visit."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Mon in Sahara Ave location and I liked it. I was hoping it's the same but I didn't like it in this location. I was going to give it 1 star but I'm feeling generous today. if I want to be satisfied eating sushi, I will go to Sushi Neko in spring mountain. Compared to this place, its double the fish & half of the rice.."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance and instantly regretted it. Walked in and waited five minutes to be sat at the sushi bar. There were only four other people in the restaurant! 
I felt rushed the entire time. I got there at 12:45 and didn't get any sushi until 1:05. Then they told me last call was at 1:30. 
The sushi chef was really rude. He held up his finger like I was an inconvenience when I asked for extra sauce.
The sushi tasted ok but it was room temperature and almost warm.
The best part of my meal was the fried stuff because I was able to eat it without feeling like I might get sick.
I probably won't ever go back and the only reason they got two stars was because the servers were friendly and kept checking on me."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I drove a long way and arrived 11:25 pm. Closing time is 12:00 am. Not even the smallest attempt to put together a to go order. We litteraly got kicked out. Even though the quality is barely to par, the fact that they are open late made up for that. Not the case anymore. Never going back."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Went to lunch in March.  Actually went twice.  People nice.  Food fresh and delicious.  Will be back when in Vegas again for sure."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Hamachi handroll was delicious.  Fish was fresh service was good.  Enjoyed the white tuna.  They had Toro on their special and it was fresh.  Service was good."}
{"text":"this is hands down the best AYCE sushi in town.  we typically go for lunch and the price can't be beat.  they have an array of choices in their menu and the sushi masters are really great."}
{"text":"I took my buddy here for his birthday last week. The food was pretty good. I ordered my normal salmon nigiri and a few of their other rolls. Nothing was amazing but it was good for AYCE. Pricing was typical 25-30 per person. The service was good. We enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Excellent. We did the all you can eat with half orders. Fresh and tasty. Because the sushi and service were great."}
{"text":"Great selection, great pricing on the All You Can Eat.  Would go here 5x a week if it wouldn't make me 800 lbs."}
{"text":"DONT ORDER NOODLES! First NO manager working on Sunday at 5pm. 
I ordered the NABEYAKI UDON (Udon noodle soup with chicken, vegetable & shrimp tempura in hot pot) with the EGG OVER HARD. One and half hour later, after sending it back 3X aaaand starving. I got this SH*T on the picture!! First they brought a vegetable noodle with egg over easy. Second again vegetable soup with no egg and soggy shrimp tempura. Third time finally the right noodle but NO EGG and NO shrimp. Then I left. So don't be like me and waste your time with stupidity!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi rolls you will love Sushi Mon. This place has a huge selection of rolls that leave you spoiled for choice (make sure to choose at least one that has \"yum-yum\" sauce). The mochi ice cream is great too."}
{"text":"This place has to be the best \"AYCE\" spot in vegas...

I am a sushi fiend and nothing satisfies or competes with the selection you get here. Service has never been a let down, but if you do decide to show up with a big party, do expect to wait a little bit. 

Sushi is fresh as it gets, and i cant resist their side dishes either! Grilled yellowtail collars, the best baked green mussels, fried shumai, fried shrimp heads, and dont forget the fried (tempura) ice cream! The list goes on and on!

Hands down the #1 sushi spot!

One Love!"}
{"text":"Been cmn here for 11 years and it's getting better and better with the years. Love mike the best chef there. The best all you can eat in vegas!"}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas I just happen to select that place to eat at and wow was it amazing. The sushi was made fresh when we order it and the rolls were delicious. There was a wild selection of available rolls and nigiri and the lycee and tempura ice cream was amazing. The service was fast and very friendly. Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"i love piggin out , me and bae went here and we got STUFFED! so delish!"}
{"text":"This is my #1 sushi place. The fish is always fresh, and the staff remember me every time. 

Reading some of the negative reviews on this place, I just have to comment.Too much rice and rolls are too big? Come on people! Its sushi, not sashimi. In Japan, the piece of fish you get is HALF the size they serve us in America. So of course your going to rice with your fish. If you dont like rice order the more expensive plate of sashimi instead. 

With that said, they have an extensive amount of rolls to choose from. The price might be a little high ($27 for dinner) but they also have stamp cards for All You Can Eat. Buy 10 and get the 11th free! 

So with good quality sushi comes price, but its well worth it. They are always busy so that has to mean something."}
{"text":"Everyone can argue which AYCE sushi is best in Sin City but in my sushi-venturing tenure, Mon is the best. (Note: OPINION)

This is the sister franchise of the renowned Goyemon, in which I was disappointed with in terms of service. There is practically no difference other than the infrastructure  because they serve practically the same rolls with maybe some minor differences.

Every visit I've had here, they have been on top of their service. The servers tend to lack personalities but who needs personality when you have great service? I routinely begin my rolls with the Volcano, which can take a bit longer but Mon takes a reasonable 5 minutes max as to Goyemon which took approximately 20 minutes. Why such a discrepancy? No excuse other than terrible service.

My favorites: Volcano, sexy girl, ecstasy, philadelphia, hurricane, 911(warning: very spicy hence, the name), cynthia, & stacy.
All cooked to near perfection and delight. Fresh avocado, fish, rice, etc.

Some tips:
- Order by half rolls unless you have a large party. I'm sure you're here to stuff yourselves but you should take advantage of the diversity of the rolls you can get with an AYCE menu. Diversity over quantity.
- Make your order subsequently to receiving. Start with one roll then once it arrives, order your next so that you don't have to wait long periods of time cause sushi does take some meticulous care to make.
- Chew slowly! Since sushi has rice, it has a lot of carbs. No need to be rapid since you get all you can eat cause the faster you eat, the more carbs you consume which fills up your stomach.
- Get a stamp card! Whether or not you're an out of town visitor, you're destined to come back since it's so good and every 10 stamps is one free AYCE meal. They really do accumulate, especially when you come with big parties. 

Don't forget to leave some room(I doubt it) for dessert! They serve green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream (strawberry & vanilla, lychee, etc. 

Overall, I truly enjoy being a local here. You can never go wrong with an endless selection of sushi."}
{"text":"Group of us came here. First time for me and repeat for them. Good idea to order the \"all you can eat\" for price, speed and selection.
Ordered several items off the menue for all of us and within minutes it was on the table. 
Good food and presentation along with the attention from the server. All around good time here.
Will come back :)"}
{"text":"Came through for AYCE lunch on a Friday. We arrived at 12pm, only 15 minutes after opening, and the place was already buzzing. By 12:15 it was packed, although the lunch crowd had cleared out by 1pm.

The food was great! My favorite was the Exstacy roll. I also like that they put extra sauces right on the menu, and of course they are included in AYCE. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is that they did not have any sashimi on the menu. Some other AYCE places will limit you to one order of sashimi per person, but I appreciate having the option. But, their fish was very fresh so we did get a couple orders of plain sushi."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi! Full menu of appetizers and rolls available, as well as your nigiri. 
Definitely try the poke- or have two, as I did. It's that good! 
All of the fish was super fresh and flavorful, and there are some pretty inventive rolls on the menu- admittedly they're a little heavy on the cream cheese and/or avocado, so more Americanized than some people prefer, but it was awesome and affordable and immediately followed by a trip to the gym in an attempt to minimize the damage.
Also wanted to note that the restaurant was packed most of the time we were there, but service was still speedy and very polite and attentive, as well as clean!
Will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is great! We've been to the Maryland location numerous times and have never had a bad meal. Their AYCE Sushi is a pretty decently priced as well.

I really enjoyed the fact that I could order a half order of an item that I wasn't too sure about. This made it easier to order certain things that I wasn't too sure about. But all turned out delicious and the fish is always fresh. 

The only negatives is the building itself is quite small and the wait times can be horrible. They need a larger building."}
{"text":"Ordered carryout sushi, some nigiri and some rice. Uni was not that fresh, but everything else was good. Only complaints are that they gave me tuna instead of salmon even after I repeated my order twice, and that they don't do udon soup as a carryout menu item."}
{"text":"Still love this place! There is always a wait, even at 9pm on a Monday. Such great customer service and really fresh sushi."}
{"text":"The best Sushi in town we always go there for all you can eat Sushi Lunch $21 Dinner $29/person. Try fried Shrimp head and Calamari."}
{"text":"Never fails when I come here. All you can eat is the way to go. They post their nigiri specials on a blackboard which a lot of sushi joints in vegas don't have. Chefs are nice, friendly and attentive.  Great fish to rice portioning. You can have more than one dessert at the end of your meal. This is my go to AYCE sushi because of the consistent excellent expectations.  So far so gooooood!"}
{"text":"Sorry for the lack of stars.. It's only cus i've only been here a few times and that was cus it's the closest to my house. The 2 stars are mainly for this cinco de mayo roll I had. It was a whole green chili pepper. The taste was more pleasant it's looks. And the other star is for actually have PLUM ice cream. Other than that.. The price is too dramatic for my belly. And most of the meat here doesn't seem as fresh. Seriously, my wallet is more in pain than the tightness of my jeans at the waist."}
{"text":"whoa. this all you can eat place has me waving the white flag sometimes.

we stroll in here, a few times now, and they never disappoint.

the fish always taste fresh, the fish to rice ratio is perfect. the service is perfect. I really don't have a bad thing to say on this spot after multiple visits.

between this sushi mon and sushi koma, I am a happy camper!"}
{"text":"this spot is just as good as their other location on the west side of town. stopped by here recently while coming back from Henderson and was 99% happy with it.

the food was served very quick, the service was on point, the prices are perfect for all you can eat. the only thing I didn't like was the rice to fish ratio. they do put more rice with the fish then the other location does, smaller fish cuts here for sure, but not really that big a deal.

I'm a fan already so I will for sure be coming back to this place if I am in the area"}
{"text":"If you don't like the basic rolls then don't come here, variety sucks, fish has a very fishy taste everything is so bland and the green tea ice cream didn't taste the same as it should. Won't be back here"}
{"text":"I've come here twice already and the first time I came here it was extremely busy yet i got all my food fast and the service was EXCELLENT. But today i don't know why things are different? Like seriously it was not busy at all and the guy kept messing up our order and the food was coming out extremely slow and it was irritating me because I had somewhere to go. I expected to be out of there around 5 but now it's 6 and I have work at 7 and I was supposed to go to is sweet ugh irritates me when I can't get my daily sweets  like seriously I ordered baked green mussles first and that was the last thing that I got before paying the check. I think our server was Anthony? Well he kept messing up our orders and I asked for the mussles like 3-4 times before I got them. And I ordered one green salad and a poki tuna but I ended up getting two green salads and no poki tuna I had to remind them twice. Like cmon guys it wasn't even busy. Definitely not coming back here when I have somewhere to be because that just totally took all my time and I'm always on a time crunch"}
{"text":"For our last few trips to Vegas, we've included a trip to Sushi Mon.  Located off-strip and in a strip mall, don't let the location fool you.  This hidden gem is open til 2am and when we arrived at 9pm, the place was packed to the gills!  A good vibe of hungry and happy customers enjoying their meal.  

For $26.95 (dinner price), you can get AYCE sushi!  Order anything you want off the menu which includes selections of ice cream for dessert.  Not conveyor belt style like most AYCE sushi places.......everything is made to order!   If you're sitting at the counter, the sushi chefs take your order and get right to work.   If you're seated at a table, all of the waiters are very attentive - they make sure you've got something on your plate at all times!   Good customer service makes the experience complete.  

They have every kind of sushi you can imagine, and then some they've created on their own.  My particular favorite is the Volcano Roll.   Baked California roll with yum yum sauce and scallops.  Delicious!  

Sushi Mon is our favorite sushi place in Vegas.  If you're willing to go off-strip, Sushi Mon is a great choice to indulge your sushi craving."}
{"text":"I've had sushi many other places , I have to say this is the best. They have a huge selection and always have special  side dishes on a chalk board. Only down side to this place is the size of it. If they could expand the seating to outside they would be wise. Other than that this place rocks."}
{"text":"This is more than once now that I've come to this location and the service is terrible and the hosts are ridiculous. The only reason I come here is for all you can eat.... you're better off visiting the sushi places in Anthem. Try I Love Sushi or some of the places near there. Will never come back."}
{"text":"my boyfriend's sister, who's a sin city local raves about this place! so on our last visit we made this our final stop just before heading to the airport. i have to admit we were a bit skeptical at first. we're pretty hardcore sushi eaters and this place just seemed way too good to be true!

the four of us came for the sushi buffet at about $25 per person. we seriously tried just about every roll on the menu and were stuffed but still made room for dessert! who could turn down endless green tea ice cream scoops right? the fish was fresh and the rolls each had it's own sushi mon little twist to it. i forget the names, but i enjoyed their variation of the usual spider roll and garlic tuna. 

this place is a super steal at price, quantity and quality! generally a couple rolls sets the check at about $30 at typical sushi bars. needless to say we boarded our returning flight satisfied and full. sushi mon will definitely be one of our number one hit up spots when visiting vegas from now on."}
{"text":"i like this place and love the taste of the sushi. great quality for being no where near the ocean.  only sucky part is being the person who has to eat the leftovers because some girls have hungry eyes..."}
{"text":"Firstly, this place smells like sewage.  It's not a random event, it's every day.  Don't be deterred and expect to wait.  It's worth it.  This is our regular place.  The staff doesn't change and neither does the quality.  Don't expect fancy over the top rolls to delight your Instagram followers.  Do expect lots of sashimi choices.  Get a punch card, you will be back.  Consistency is where it's at here.  Also, lunch is cheaper with mostly all the same items.  Order the Cajun albacore and the baked mussels... you will be glad you did.  Lastly, if it's your first time, order half rolls so you can try everything.  Happy sushi eating."}
{"text":"After eating here for many years, our favorite sushi chef Hiro-san is gone and now a bunch of inexperienced chefs have taken over. For the first time in 25 years, I spent the night throwing up bad sushi. This used to be a very nice restaurant with the freshest Sushi. Not anymore."}
{"text":"I love this place! Its best to come at lunch time to avoid the crazy dinner wait. Some times the wait for dinner can be as long as 2 hours but they are open untill 2am!!!

Sushi is great and the rolls are awesome. My two favorites are OID and Yebisu.  This is always one of my first stops when I arrive in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"New management, with better quality of foods! Even isn't AYCE, a la carte menu is valuable and it's delicious!
Just missed Happy hour of beer and sake, on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday only, so we will try again!"}

{"text":"All you can Eat Sushi. 
My friend was raving about how AWESOME this place is....
And when we got there... even HEEE was like.. o snaps... the quality just went down.

I mean it's all you can eat... so I can't really give anything less than a 3. But the servers were hella mad dawg'n at us (I have no clue as to why) and they were slow at bringing us our food.

The only thing that was fresh was the Tuna that day. Everything else kind of tasted old. Iono... business be hard these days....

3 stars. no more."}
{"text":"OK, my 1st review...here it goes...

Arrived at 8 on a thurs night, they said it would be a 30min wait but it was only like 10-15...so not bad at all.  

If you haven't been before it's like $27 i think it was...for all you can eat sushi, rule is no leftovers, and you have to finish the rice.  If your getting rolls I would also recommend ordering half rolls unless u knw of a specific one you really like and know you'll finish with no problems...

We sat at the bar and service was great.  The sushi guy was always checking to see how we were doing with a smile...

Ok, onto the food!  I think I had to be rolled outta the place, everything was so goowd!  

Starters: Green shell mussels are a MUST!!!  I'm usually not a fan but they were really good!
Dynamite was just ok and a lil oily...
Miso soup, tasty and had good amount of tofu.  You can order it with shrimp heads if you want a seafood miso...I think it's alright but my friend loves it...
Shrimp tempura...gotta love it!  Serves hot and perfectly fried

For the nigiri everything was so fresh!  We had garlic salmon, yellowtail, and mackerel (my favorite...fishy I knw but yum!). Order was done quick and don't be afraid to ask for any sauce or extras like jalapeños like we did...(not that it didn't taste great, I just always add extra!   =)

Onto the rolls!  We had the 911 roll...like a spicy tuna roll on crack!  Doesn't seem hot when you put it in your mouth, but like 3.2 seconds later it hits ya and your looking for high quality H2O!   =p

JJ roll...tempura, avocado, asparagus, cream cheese...tasty!!!

And the Sexy Girl Roll...hard time remembering what's in this one...shrimp, scallions, crab meat, avocado maybe?  Very good!...BUT!  This is why I recommend ordering half rolls till u knw what u really like...it was towards the end and was SO hard finishing, 

I did (somehow!) save enough room for desert which is included...choice between green tea, red bean and tempura ice cream.  And vanilla and strawberry mochi balls.  We had strawberry mochi balls, great way to end meal!  And red bean ice cream!  Yummo!  

Great way to get GOOD sushi!  Much better then strip places in my opinion!  

Ok, that was my 1st review!!!  Hope it wasn't too long n hope it helps!!!    =)"}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi spot in Vegas. Service is quick and the fish is amazing. Definitely with the $27 price"}
{"text":"Since it can get packed up in there--ya gotta wonder.  Is it hype?  Is it good?  Is it both?  YES.

Apparently they have managed to use quality fresh fish at low prices to their advantage and hence the place is packed.  As good as I have had for \"All Ye Can Scarf\" Sushi.  This is definitely all about the All You Can Eat vice the a la carte items.  Just be prepared that if you go during typical dinner-evening rush hour times you might wait a bit.  If you are on a tight time-line you should think twice about coming.

For the price of what you get, it is top value in the sushi world.  I was almost expecting mediocore food due to the amount of people and the constant, intense, back-and-forth sushi retrieval operations going on.  However, for the volume and low price, they maintained a decent presentation and didn't do a hatchet job on the sushi/sashimi.

If you wanna binge on sushi of good quality without getting schwacked in the wallet, you can't beat this place."}
{"text":"Used to come here a few years ago as my go to spot, but the last few times were disappointing. It actually used to be pretty good. Something about their rice makes it too soggy and it falls apart. Had some vegetable tempura that didn't even seem fried all the way and was drenched in grease. I probably won't be coming back to be honest."}
{"text":"Excellent Sashimi!! I always get takeout because it's so busy!! Their all you can eat is awesome as well! Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"For the price i paid and the quality of the food it was a great deal. I had more then a buffet. I had a feast! Service was good and the food was decent for the price. I cant complain. The ice cream the sake the sushi the tempura. All very good in my opinion. Def. worth stoping in when im in Vegas. Lots of parking, casual atire and prettty much just bring your apetite with you to make it worth it!"}
{"text":"If only I can give 0 star I would. This 1 star is for the service. Specifically a server. His name is JEFFREY. Ate here last night with a group of 10. The host sat us quickly and tried to merge 2 tables together but to try to make it easier for them we said they can leave it separated. We sat down and they came back and said the server wants the table together which was fine we didn't really care. They only gave us 3 menus (mind you there were 6 adults and 4 kids. So we asked for more menus no big deal but come on. I mentioned to the server JEFFREY that we plan to split our bill and he said ok but you can tell he was irritated. JEFFREY took 1 person order on one side of the table cause we weren't ready so the other side of the table decided to order. When he was done taking their order I asked if we can order so he wouldn't have to go back and forth and when walking back to the other side of the table he rolls his eyes and mouths \"oh my fucking God\".  And that's where I lost it. I'm pretty sure it's your job JEFFREY to take our order so why give us attitude for something that's your job!!! I hope the manager sees this post  because it's UNACCEPTABLE!!! Please talk to your employee to ensure this does not happen again.  And JEFFREY learn proper customer service especially if you plan to stay in the food industry."}
{"text":"This place definitely has a huge AYCE menu. Loved the variety! =)

We came promptly when they opened at 11am on a Monday and the restaurant was already have full!  I came at the recommendation of a coworker and he had suggested that I try the yellowtail collar. Unfortunately they don't serve that at lunch. Three of us  ordered off the AYCE menu and the fourth person ordered ala carte. I'm so glad that Sushi Mon doesn't have that rule that everyone has to order AYCE at the table. It is also really cool too that we can order half rolls so we can try a lot more things on the menu.  

We tried so many different rolls, appetizers, nigiri sushi, I can't even remember them all. What I do remember is that almost everything tasted pretty fresh, some of the rolls were really unique and they have AYCE mochi and ice cream for dessert too. Score! 

We were rushing to make sure that we could eat under the 1 hour time limit at lunch, but after awhile we realized that the waiters were pretty relaxed about it. Food came out relatively fast after we ordered and the servers were pretty prompted about filling water and taking more orders. 

Paid about $27 (including tax and tip) for AYCE lunch. 

Sushi Mon is definitely better then some of the AYCE sushi places in Cali!"}
{"text":"another place i've been to twice... 
that being said.. it must be good.

the first time we went though, there was a confrontation with a customer about sharing.. being that it is all you can eat, you pay a flat rate of about 25 bucks and technically can only share with those who also have the \"all you can eat\" menu.  

anyway, there was a big ass scene.. i don't know what exactly happened, but we were sitting right next to the table and it seemed like the dude was trippin' over the mother sharing something with her toddler son..

idk if i liked that too much..

but, all in all.. it's a good place with good sushi..

being that their seems to be a lot of people that go to this place, a reservation would probably be best if your in a large party... or even if there's only 2 ppl in your party.  it's not a very big place and doesn't seat to many people at once.  

since it is all you can eat,  we tried to order all our sushi at once.. and sometimes they forgot to bring something out... but do manage to bring enough out for you to kinda forget... i stress kind of...

anyway, good place... and they're open late!"}
{"text":"Food was old and nasty , poor service don't recommend this sushi place , it's a waist of money"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite sushi spots when I lived in Vegas. Their all you can eat is an amazing deal and it gives you a chance to try new things. If you sit at the Sushi bar, the chefs are really nice and great for recommendations. The list of rolls is a little different than most which is kind of fun but they'll make you anything if you ask!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas.  The rolls are made fresh to order, the menu has a great selection, and the service is fast.  The best things on the menu besides the rolls are the baked mussels and Ahi Poki.  Just those two I could eat forever.  I would have given this place 5 stars if I didn't have to wait so long for dinner.  But it was well worth the wait.  Sushi Mon needs to expand so they have more tables."}
{"text":"All you can eat lunch is $21.95 and dinner is 24.95, I think. Time limit for lunch is 45 mins and dinner is 60 mins. Service is okay. Food is good, but I can't say I was blown away. For some reason, I like the AYCE in S Rainbow Blvd better. The ones that stood out to me are baked mussels, and volcano roll."}
{"text":"This is a must-hit if you love sushi and you happen to be in Vegas.  

Recently the hubby and I took a trip to Vegas and it was all about eating!  After reading all the great reviews on Yelp, we were excited to try Sushi Mon and it did not disappoint!  We didn't even check in to our hotel, but went directly to Sushi Mon for dinner.  Nothing that says \"Welcom to Las Vegas\" better than a good AYCE sushi buffet, you know.

They had a wide variety of cooked and uncooked rolls.  We ordered mostly nigiri rolls and they were fresh and tasty!  You definitely need to ask the chef what their daily fresh fish specials were because they were awesome!  Although there is an hour limit, we went over an hour and they did not make any comments.  Maybe it's because we went on a Thursday night and it wasn't that busy?  I also liked how the dessert is included in the AYCE.  It seems like a better deal to eat dinner there because they give you an hour limit, whereas it's a 45 minute limit and a couple of bucks cheaper for lunch.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Quality is amazing for ayce sushi and it's open late. Service I find is usually subpar and though I tip 20% it's because I feel they have a tough job. Sit at the sushi bar in front of Honda for faster service"}
{"text":"Definitely off the beaten path, but so worth the drive and the over an hour wait! My girls and I made this our last stop before heading back home to Cali. 

We ordered salmon belly, yellowtail belly, baked mussels, and various rolls that I can't even remember all their names. We even ordered a baked chicken roll, which was not typical, but was unexpectedly tasty! The salmon, yellowtail and baked mussels were my favorites though. The fish was very fresh. Sometimes it's best to keep it simple, especially when you're eating so much!

We thought we would not have much room for dessert, so we decided to share a scoop of strawberry mochi ice cream, lychee sorbet and green tea ice cream. The lychee sorbet was really good, with real chunks of lychee on the inside, but the real winner was the strawberry mochi ice cream. We loved it so much we ordered two more scoops. 

Service was good, though there was a little misunderstanding with quantity (make sure you know how much is in an order) and you can't beat the lunch price of $22 per person. 

My only wish is that they would serve uni for lunch, but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Although famed for their AYCE sushi specials of which I did not partake, Sushi Mon has solidly well valued, if not great, Japanese food.  This corner shop is more on the \"suburban\" outskirts of Las Vegas and is in a shopping plaza.

In short, I got a teriyaki lunch special for 6 bucks and it was quite filling with its large bento box full of servings of chicken, rice, tempura, salmon sashimi, gyoza, and the additional (and obligatory) bowls of salad and miso soup. I guess the only minor gripes I had were that the soup was lukewarm, the salad was drenched in dressing, and the salmon was dry. But for the amount of food I got for the money, there's not much else bad to say."}
{"text":"I live close by & I have been here twice. Once with my husband a year ago, at about 5:00PM & the service was good. I took my 19 yo daughter there last week & it was horrendous beyond belief, without apology & remorse from the staff. My daughter had been here last month with her college friends & warned me of their negative experience. We were neither greeted nor served at our table for 10 minutes. I had to ask for water & menus. They came late with a longer wait for the orders to be taken. The soup & salad came, but we had to endure more than 20 minutes for the main order. My daughter's order came & was finished but mine didn't. The waitress walked pass & never bothered to check on us. I went to the counter & asked the male staff if I should be served or I should leave. He was not apologetic at all. He went to the kitchen & I was served a plate of cold food that was obviously left too long forgotten in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Ridiculous! I called to see how long the wait was since I knew they get busy. The girl said there was no wait so I drove straight here only being 1.5 miles away. As soon as I got here, there was magically 8 people ahead of us and now it's an hour wait to get seated!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for an AYCE sushi spot near my house and I found this place! We came around dinner time so it was pretty busy. The restaurant is kind of small and we were seated at the bar so we had to squeeze in next to other people. 

Our sushi chef who took care of us was really nice and the service was quick. I really enjoyed their tuna & garlic tuna nigiri! Can't complain about the fish to rice ratio. 

Dinner price is about $26.95. They also give you a stamp card! Pretty cool since I've never been to a sushi restaurant that offers that. 

The only thing that bothered me was the person sitting next to us at the bar. He was rushing the sushi chef because he \"had somewhere to be.\" If you're in a rush don't eat at a restaurant? Try a drive thru instead."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a great AYCE meal at Sushi Mon, at the counter. My chef was excellent, had tons of orders, kept mine coming. Food was very good (not excellent, but very fresh), and the garlic edamame was off the chain! Highly recommend this place, food and service excellent, atmosphere busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in Henderson. The prices are reasonable and the sushi is better than most. I order about 75% of my sushi off of the list of daily specials and I primarily order nigiri. I highly recommend the salmon belly, toro, and the yellow tail belly. There fresh scallops and ama ebi are also consistently, very good. The AYCE menu includes a wide array of appetizers. The dynamite, takoyaki, baked mussels, and calamari are outstanding. Be sure to save a little room for dessert because the tempura ice cream is to die for. They of course have a variety of mochi ice cream and sorbets that you can eat to your heart's content."}
{"text":"by far the best AYCE sushi i have tasted in vegas!!! it's not the best sushi place, but best AYCE for sure!!! there has never been  a time that we experience  bad sushi or the service. its great!!! plus, the price is reasonable. also, if you decide to become a fan. be sure to get a stamp card when you ask for  the check. if you get your card stamp in full, I believe your 10th AYCE is free. 

here is some of my favs you must try:

Nigiri : scallops, salmon, garlic tuna, yellowtail, super white.

sushi rolls : ALL OF THEM!!! YOU CAN EVEN ORDER HALF ROLLS!!! & yellowtail hand roll is one of my favs!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot on the westside for AYCE or take-out.  

All the nigiri is great.  The difference between some lower quality places in town vs the better places is always the quality of the fish."}
{"text":"This place better watch out, cuz I'm here to get my all-you-can-eat money's worth ($26.95 per person). Came here on a Sunday for an early dinner, no wait to get seated and service was quick. Everything I tried was good...my favs were: ahi poke, tako poke, super white, salmon belly, jason roll and lychee ice cream. I like that you can get half orders on rolls so you can try MORE stuff. Also, there's a good variety on the all you can eat menu, more than most Japanese restaurants  --including different appetizers, desserts, fancier rolls and other special items like kobe beef, sweet shrimp and uni. Recommend sitting at the bar for easy ordering. This is definitely gonna be a regular spot for us whenever we're in town again. Husband kept saying how he'd gonna bring his fat foodie friends here next time they're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The sushi was good but I think the ambiance kills it. I had to wait 30-45 min for me and my husband on a weekday and even though I liked that they served you super fast, I felt like I was rushed so that other people can use our seats. I like to eat sushi in a relaxed kind of place, to be able to have nice conversations with people that I'm with. I might come back though maybe in some off-peak time."}
{"text":"Best place In Las Vegas to eat sushi. Especially on ayce fresh fish. Friendly staff. The extra side dishes are amazing. The dynamite is the bomb. I will eat that all day every day. Super delicious. Been going here for over 7 years now. Won't go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. 

Drive 6.5 hours to Reno and eat at Sushi Pier!!!

I've been eating sushi since 1984. Way before it was cool. It has always been my favorite food and something I crave regularly. So when I moved to Reno, NV I was excited by AYCE sushi places with reasonable prices and an incredible selection of nigri, maki, and appetizers. 

I came to Vegas for a job interview, which went pretty well I might add, and rewarded myself in a typical fashion, with AYCE sushi. I figured how different could it be?

I scoured Yelp for a while and came across Sushimon and Yama Sushi, the two most reviewed AYCE spots around. I chose Sushimon based on Yama reviews stating that they pre sliced their fish and one person had seen cockroaches. 

I pulled up and the place was pretty full, good sign, so I sat down and ate. The only memorable things were hamachi Kama and tempura sweet shrimp heads, and they were memorable only because they aren't typically available at my sushi spot in Reno.  

As a sushi fanatic, there is a price point at which I would rather enjoy the taste and art of well prepared sushi, than gorge myself on very mediocre stuff. And at $30, this hits that spot!

Bottom line is people from Las Vegas should know what good food is, and this sure ain't it.

2.5 stars for friendly sushi chef, hamachi Kama, sweet shrimp heads, and plum ice cream. They also get points for serving half rolls."}
{"text":"If I could eat sushi everyday for the rest of my life I would. Sushi Mon is a cute lil' sushi restaurant located on Sahara and Cimarron next to Nothing Bundt Cakes. I was being lazy one night and didn't want to dine in, so I got my food to go. Staff was friendly and my order came out quickly. I ordered three rolls:

Sushi Mon Lasagna
Pastel 
Domingo

One thing to note is that the sauces come on the side with to go orders. This is good because it gives me a chance to try the rolls naked. I loved the Domingo roll. It has tuna and avocado with jalapeño salsa on top and ponzu sauce. This roll was super tasty as is, but the addition of ponzu sauce upped the ante for me. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.

The lasagna was a second favorite. This roll is very decadent. Cream cheese and scallops baked on top of a California roll and smothered in eel sauce. Soooo good and probably a billion calories a piece, but so worth it. I was hesitant the first time I ever tried a lasagna roll. Who knew cream cheese would be so good with fish? Not me. But it is amazing. This is a very rich roll so maybe try half if you have never had it before. 

The pastel was good as well but was my least favorite. It had shrimp and crab wrapped in soy paper, and shrimp and avocado on top. I omitted the cream cheese from this roll but it does come with it. After that lasagna roll I couldn't think about eating more cream cheese. Eel sauce and spicy mayo top this, but I felt like the sauces didn't add much to a pretty plain roll. 

While I sat and waited for my order I was offered water which I declined but thought was nice. Everyone I came across was nice and they even thanked me for waiting. I will be back for the AYCE- Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95."}
{"text":"Came in here based on a friend's recommendation for their
all you can eat sushi for $26 buffet option.

They're with a good 10 min. drive off-the Vegas strip so you see only moset of the local they come in.  

We were seated in front of the Sushi Chief who was like Sushi machine that were able to make any sushi/rolls in a min./two upon your request.

The sushi was really fresh & excellent staffs.

Highly recommended it if you have a car to get around LV & try something off-the-strip."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants in Vegas, and it got to the point where when asked if I wanted to go to sushi at ____, I would usually say no.
Sushi Mon changed that. Found it out of the blue, and never looked back. They have AYCE and a la carte menus, and handle each with grace. 
My experience?
~ The sushi and rolls are always delicious. They handle special requests easily (i.e. I would like this roll, but with salmon instead of tuna, soy paper instead of Nori, 911 sauce on the side, etc.)
~ They remember us. There is something to be said for staff remembering you, and bringing your drinks (water with extra lemon, hot green tea, etc.) without you even asking.
~ The sushi chefs are personable and fun, and make for a good experience. 
~ The wait staff are super nice, and always make us feel welcome.
~ They have a frequent AYCE card - get stamped every time and the 10th time is free (might be the 11th- I don't eat AYCE, but the other half does, and they don't even hesitate to honor it)
~ It doesn't matter who your waitress is; everyone will help you.
I just went there last night with my other half, and his parents, and we had a great time. The sushi was excellent (tuna melted like butter) and the rolls were excellent.

P.S. The \"Love Boat\" is an amazing deal. Salmon is tender (it's a filet, and cooked - delicious), california rolls (just ask for the sushi bar to make them right then - they will), edamame, chicken yakitori skewers, salad (their dressing is YUM) with chicken, miso soup, and tempura shrimp and veggies. All for $11.95. Great deal, and comes with a delicious sliced orange dessert too. 

I'm IN!"}
{"text":"A \"must try\" place. The sushi is ALWAYS fresh, the service is ALWAYS fast, the chefs are ALWAYS nice and ready to recommend something.It is a little pricey comparing to other places, but definitely worth your $.
However..this place is SO tiny..and if you got on a Saturday or Friday night..you would have to wait 30minutes at least to get in..but we ALWAYS wait 'cuz we'r good sushi loverz :D"}
{"text":"There is a Vietnamese boy at this sushi joint! At first I had the suspicious that he's Vietnamese but kept on thinking he might be Korean or Japanese. He looks kinda like Kim Hyun Joong but Kim Hyun Joong has plastic surgeon and 99-100% of Korean actors have plastic surgeon. He doesn't have plastic surgeon so I kept on thinking he must be Vietnamese. I finally asked if he is and he said yes but he doesn't know how to speak Vietnamese. Mystery solved. He doesn't seem as difficult or strict as the Korean and Japanese. Might be easy going to ask him then the others. Usually I don't dare to ask to much except to eat my food and pay. He's young so will have less experience but I'm Vietnamese I can handle inexperience than strict personality. He looks like he's from Da Lat region. Em trai nhin thay yeu ?uoi, nên uong sua pha voi 
bot calcium cho to con lên! 

As for the food, I live a block away so I have to come here for sushi. Everything is either prudent or bland here. Salad has a prudent ginger soy sauce with sesame oil. Sushi hand cut and all sushi roll have bland taste. Fish taste ok, but from time to time the tuna is brown. I stay away from it multiple times. Dipping sauce is only soy sauce + wasabi and no other sauce available. High fresh quality might be given to Kabotu. I have the suspicious that SushiMon is part of Kabotu, Goyemon, and Monta Ramen. Monta Ramen is the noodle house and Goyemon is the sister sushi house that will capture those that doesn't like or know SushiMon. SushiMon on the westside is for those that are in the west but are a fan of SushiMon. Kabotu is for those that willing to pay for the higher quality fish reserve for its priority. Goyemon might be the sister but both SushiMon locations will always have a better quality of fish. Goyemon might is the 3rd standard, so 1st Kabotu, 2nd SushiMon, and 3rd Goyemon. 

Best dishes for the buck are the Salmon Dinner Special and Sashimi Lunch Special (include rice + miso soup + salad). 3 hand cuts or 2 hand rolls lunch special (include miso soup + salad) for $9 is not bad. Good price. Sushi at Wasabi on Eastern might be a little better but SushiMon's price is the best in this area. Nake Sushi in Summerlin on Rampart x Lake Mead has a similar deal, but it's in the west side. Here in the southeast, SushiMon is the place.

This is an AYCE, so be smart when you order or else wait. Order 4-6 at first then go down. DO NOT order 2 at a time, because that's a long wait. Those that complained about the wait, is because they do not go to AYCE often or have lack of experience with AYCE. It's like the Rio buffet, when it's self serve it's fast that's because you serve yourself, but once you order something special like a sauce the waiter seems to disappear for a very long time."}

Its crazy like nothing I've ever been to. Its totally okay tho its almost like making reservations, we called an hour and a half in advanced kinda crazy! The inside is rather small, like literally maybe only 10 tables and a sushi bar. The sushi was delicious, all you can eat for $25.00. Ive also gotten the beef udon soup. The broth of the soup is simply delicious, haven't had better udon soup anywhere else! Prices aren't too bad, they are like any sushi place, pretty much. Service was great our waitress was pretty funny and nice. Again, this definitely isn't a spot that you could just randomly drop into when you want because the wait is far too long! Plan ahead and call in when you are at home and see how long the wait is and you'll be okay (;"}
{"text":"I love love love sushi mon, dont really know what the mon stands for, but lemme just say it must be an abbreviated form of monster. Sushi mon is the best, and I mean best all you can eat sushi!!!! Service was awesome, sushi was fresh, and it is so lively in there, conversations galore. I went here a couple of times during my stay at Vegas. O yummy goodness."}
{"text":"I've came to this location a few times in the past whenever I come to Vegas. It's fairly off the strip but it's probably the best local spot that doesn't have the Vegas markup. Personally I rather eat this than a Vegas buffet. It's a small humble location in a plaza. The wait staff were super friendly and quick with their service. They do not skimp on anything. I would probably place this in my top 5 sushi spots.

The nigiri is super duper fresh! How do they even get fresh fish all the way out to Vegas!? The price is very typical but you really get your worth in quality. Dessert, drinks all included. I can't really say anything more."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great service. Great food. Love the fresh sushi rolls made in right of you. Cold saki. And so close to home. Cute little place and great service too."}
{"text":"Great place for AYCE sushi. Usually AYCE sushi restaurants don't give great quality of sushi and slices. Sushi Mon offers good quality cuts for their all you can eat menu. 

I've always been a fan of sushi mon. It became a must go whenever we're in vegas. Told all my friends about them too and most of them feel the same way. It's like a tradition now. If you still have room for desert, the plum ice cream is good too. They usually offer 4 selected special sushi pieces (you only get one order of each) offered at dinner prices, which is about 3-4 dollars more. I highly recommend doing that. Great customer services to boot."}
{"text":"When we drive to Vegas, this is always the first stop before we hit the strip. Sometimes we even make Vegas trips just for Sushi Mon. Great quality cuts for the sushi, which is pretty much the only thing I order here. The service is exceptional too.

Never got the rolls so I can't review them, but going back to the sushi. The salmon cuts are very nice! They usually have 3-4 featured sushi, but it costs a little more, just charges you dinner prices which is about 3 bucks more. If it's available, it's kind of a no brainer for me. 

Love this place, highly recommend it, which I do to all my friends. There's dessert too, but it's up to you. I usually just eat more sushi instead, but the ice cream is great."}
{"text":"The basics:
-All you can eat of the full menu
-45 minute time period to order your unlimited sushi and appetizers (I don't think they really keep track of this)
-the unlimited sushi includes the special rolls on the back page
-there's a charge if you have any leftover food
-The tempura ice cream was really soggy. The lychee sorbet was much better."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by an employee from the M casino due to its popularity and proximity to the hotel. It is located in a Plaza with ample parking.  We went here for lunch and the place was not busy. We were seated right away and our server got our order. My friend got the deluxe combination which wad a few pieces of sashimi, 4 piece California rolls, tempura, rice, salad and miso soup. I got the combination of chicken katsu with rice, miso soup, 4 piece California rolls and salad. We also ordered fried oysters and baked mussels on the side. The service was good. They had a lot of staff there that kept checking on you. The food was good for me. But he didn't like it that much. Their sushi was not that good. Maybe we should have tried one of their special sushis. The price was reasonable. Just not sure if it's something that we will go back for."}
{"text":"This place always has great quality sushi and they are quick! The only thing I noticed recently was that the last couple times we placed orders for appetizers in all u can eat and nobody brought them to us. We even ordered twice just to be sure but nothing but normally the service is good and if it wasn't for that happening on occasion I'd give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"The service here, from the manager to servers, make you feel like you are not really wanted here.  Their friends on the other hand get treated quite well, it's understandable but ....  Order second round and the rice is packed like hell and the fish noticeably thinner, eel was so pathetic on the second round we had to laugh.  Enough is enough, wonder how long there guys will last on their past laurels."}
{"text":"I was partial to a different Sushi place before my boyfriend took me to sushi mon now its the only place we go! They have a variety of dfferent rolls and you can order a half order as well which is great for me! Everything from the simple house salad to there fanciest rolls are worth trying its all good."}
{"text":"One of my first all you can eat sushi joint I use to go to all the time. Now and days I go to other places. Wondering if their still good?"}
{"text":"Yum yum. 4.5 AYCE.  Sushi restaurant with actual Japanese sushi chefs! It's so rare nowadays! 

I can't come to Vegas without getting my sushi fix at Sushi Mon.  

Always a wait, always worth it, but always a wait. 

Fish is fresh, the cuts are quality, and the rice is nice and warm."}
{"text":"...... still my favorite sushi restaurant ever.   Amazing ayce dinner!   Fresh fish and a lot of varieties ......  so good they already saw me twice this week."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is amazing...... The chefs already know what I like to eat. I've been coming  here for the past 4 yrs and I have no complaints. They always have a variety of fish and it's always fresh.   You guys rock!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night in a party of 7. Their $26 AYCE sushi was great value considering the quality of the fish we were served. Their specials included multiple nigiris that I haven't had before at AYCE spots including mackerel. They were very timely with service, providing water whenever we were low and coming around to clean up finished dishes very quickly. Of course the total bill was enormous with the beer and sake we ordered in conjunction, but with the fun atmosphere (we caught the end of a Packers-Bears game on the TV at the bar) that allowed us to sake bomb at the table, I will definitely return and recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Here's the place where I first fell in love with Uni. They limit 2 plates of Uni per person, I think, but the quality of their seafood is really fresh. They have all you can eat sushi, but the awesome part is, it is NOT BUFFET style. They make it upon order, so the rolls always come out hot and fresh. The tempura is actually still crispy when they serve it! It's quite a drive from the Strip and at night, I don't even know if you can get a cab to go down there to pick you up and bring you back to the Strip."}
{"text":"Came here for their AYCE lunch and had a great time. This was one of the better AYCE sushi joints around henderson. With their reasonable menu prices at 21.95 per person for lunch and 26.95 at dinner time, you can't really go wrong. This place gets really busy so be ready for a wait.

Their sushi was well made with great fish to rice ratios. The food was so good I couldn't really get a good picture we were eating it too fast!

We left here stuffed and got here early enough we beat the crowds. Our waitress was very kind and kept our cups full and orders rolling. I would recommend coming here if you don't mind waiting to eat."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to sushi places, but I did not decide tonight.  My friend craved for sushi.  

I was uneasy since there was a wait and was told at first that it would be 30+mins..  We waited and was seated in less than 20.  We got a nice seating in the bar area.  After being seated, I was ready to eat.  I was amused by the ayce rules.  60 mins. I was curious what would happen if I went over by 5 mins?  I absolutely loved how great the ayce menu was.  Side dishes and dessert?? dang!  I am sold.

Nice because I felt like i had my own sushi chef.  We told him different items to prepare for us.  Very nicely presented and the fish felt fresh.  I like that because I have had poor experience at other places.  For an ayce, I see why there's a line outside.  I enjoyed the 624, baked sushi which I haven't had before.  Very unique and hot!  The snow crab was a little dry.  I didn't like it.  Friend was craving for salmon and we over ordered.  Regardless, it was very delightful.  I usually have a hard time with rare fish, but it wasn't an issue tonight.  House was very efficient  on getting our side dishes.  We had very awkward request.  We had ice cream in the middle of our meal.  Sushi chef thought we were done.  I tried some lychee sorbet, very tasty but not for me.  I did enjoy the special mochi mango ice cream.  Friend was full, but I told her it was amazing.  She managed to intake half of it.  

Service was nice, Sushi Chef was friendly and chatty.  Overrall, a great atmosphere.  Not made for large groups."}
{"text":"Not that good at all. All the rolls tasted the Same and nothing out of the norm. Quality of fish is not that fresh.Service is okay."}
{"text":"Love this place!!

AYCE fresh sushi & rolls.  The great thing about it is that you can order half rolls (4 pieces), that way, you can order more types of rolls.  Always get the special.  The last time I was here, they had one with mango on top!  YUMS!

The plum ice cream is sooo good, included in the AYCE too!!"}
{"text":"What happened!!! I came here 3 times within 2 months. Bad service, the food took a very long time. It was not as fresh as it used to be and the service...again! Pfft!"}
{"text":"Hait! We're supposed to be in Vegas but end-up in Japan. We are the couple that must find at least one best Japanese restaurant anywhere we go because hubby was an ex-sensei and I'm a forever sashimi-eater. So here we are. We came to Sushi Mon for dinner with hubby's family (the Vegas residence) before, but this time we came for lunch with his nephew. We had a great lunch. They ordered \"all you can eat\" and I ordered chirashi bowl. So I cannot eat all that I can because \"all you can eat\" cannot be shared but I was happy with my order. Who needs to eat it all? Most sushi place in Vegas have this type of promotion, all you can eat, surprise that everyone seems to be able to follow this \"all you can eat\" trend. The servers are Japanese but the four sushi chefs are mixed, could be Japanese and Chinese but I saw one was teaching the other, one was focusing on filleting, one was on a cell phone (kidding!). Of course no one's on a cell phone here, hello! Anyway, the lunch was great and we would come back here, for sure. Someday I'll try that \"all you can eat\" thing and see whether it's true that I could eat it all! Enjoyed it, thanks! Recommended."}
{"text":"I don't come here often as it is usually not in the normal price range but for random occasions and meeting up with friends it's great!

Every single time I have come here I have ordered AYCE -- my fiancé has too -- and we both feel like we always get our money's worth without eating ourselves sick (hah!).  He is not nearly as in love with sushi as I am but he can eat yakitori, tempura shrimp, edamame, and green tea ice cream like nobody's business.  He is also willing to try what the table orders sometimes, so it works out.

Service here is above average and I have always had a decent experience.  Everyone is friendly.  Be forewarned:  This places is POPULAR and SMALL so it can get crowded and service can get bogged down during busy times.

I really like how AYCE allows you to order half-rolls.  I know several places do that but this was my first experience with one...hee.

What to order: Dragon Roll (I'm biased), Aloha Roll, Moon Roll, umm... just look at the menu and dive in.  And dessert is good, too!  I am IN LOVE with tempura fried ice cream, and this does not disappoint.  Next time I am gonna see if I can get green tea ice cream up in that tempura shell... mmm."}
{"text":"This is one of two of my go to sushi spots for AYCE with the other being Island Sushi.  This place is great despite the wait that usually accompanies coming here.  The restaurant is very bright due to all of the windows which is really nice and the staff are always happy and attentive.  The food is great and always comes pretty quickly!  I usually come here about once a month with my friends going about twice a month lol."}
{"text":"bleh...

the restaurant is pretty small so large groups beware...my group took up half the restaurant

ayce but i felt like i was eating all you can eat rice...yea i love my rice but not that much!

service was okay...we had a waiter and a waitress poor girl was doing all the work..so we snuck in extra tip just for her...cause u know it's one of those all servers share tips kind of shit. 

baked mussel was bomb! i normally never eat those cause it's soo creamy and heavily mayo but here it was the perfect ratio

dont think i'll be coming back"}
{"text":"The sushi was okay, not much in selection. Don't come here unless you LOVE cucumber in your rolls as well, seeing as they are in almost every single roll"}
{"text":"A VERY GOOD AYCE SUSHI PLACE ON THE WEST SIDE
Sushi Mon is on of a myriad All You Can Eat (AYCE) Sushi restaurants throughout Las Vegas. For the most part, I have had favorable experiences at the AYCE places in Vegas. In the old days, AYCE meant Buffet Style like Makino. Makino was fine, but sushi lovers knew that the price you had to pay for AYCE was that it was not as good as Made To Order. But a few years ago the AYCE trend caught on at many of the good sushi places that were only set up for Made To Order and that is when AYCE Sushi really took off. Really, there are so many AYCE Made To Order places in Vegas I don't know how the places that don't have AYCE stay in business.

In November 2009, AYCE Made To Order Sushi in Las Vegas is going for between $24 and $28. My eleven year old son, Tristan, can eat $28 of sushi in about 15 minutes, so we make out way ahead, dollars wise. What would normally be a $150-$200 bill ends up being just under $100 for three people (with drinks and tax).

In Henderson, my favorite place is The Ka (Warm Springs & Green Valley). The sushi is top-notch for AYCE and the atmosphere is actually very good for a sushi place. Most sushi places that put any effort into their atmosphere tend to charge much more than the other sushi places, but not The Ka. Additionally, the sushi chefs at The Ka have quite a bit of personality (which makes up for their challenged English... hey, I can barely speak any Japanese, if THAT is what they are speaking, so they're doing much better than me on the bilingual thing.)

Now that we're living on the \"West Side\" we have to find a place to get our sushi fix. My girlfriend lived over here recently anyways and Sushi Mon was \"her place.\" We actually went to Sushi Mon for our first date although neither of us were really paying much attention to what was going into our mouths in the restaurant that day.

The quality and selection of the sushi is very good. I like to gage my sushi places by the quality of the salmon (aka \"sake\") and I was not disappointed. It was very soft, smooth, and very tasty. My girlfriend likes to use the Yellowtail as her gage and it certainly passes muster with her as with me. We had a variety of the typical rolls you can get in Vegas and each one of them was good to great.

The atmosphere is typical for Las Vegas sushi restaurants, at least the non-casino places. It always seems to be busy here and it seems they would be able to fill a few more tables if they had the room for it. Not much for decoration but there's nothing disconcerting about it either. The most important part is that it is clean, which it is. The sushi chefs were very good and surprisingly fast (in spite of a packed place). I wish they had a little more personality but I probably need to go back a few more times and start some kind of rapport with them and they'd probably be just fine.

Here's a kicker for me: THEY HAVE A STAMP CARD. Your 10th AYCE is free, which is like getting $2.80 off each meal. Not all places do this in Las Vegas and if you're looking for a new \"favorite place,\" this certainly helps tip things in favor of a place who does have a stamp card.

If you're looking for All You Can Eat Made To Order Sushi on the West Side of Las Vegas I would recommend that you check this place out. I'm sure there are other good places in the area, but this one is good for me."}
{"text":"Best sushi you can get for an all-you-can-eat! food is always fresh and cant complain about the prices. Only downside, the restaurant is a little small."}
{"text":"Hm went here with my friends and the sushi was okay. We sat at the sushi bar and the presentation of one of the rolls I got was just awful. Don't get the Domingo roll. It looked like something they scraped off the kitchen floor! But I also got the royal California which was deep fried California rolls for only $6.50! Everything was pretty affordable even though I didn't do AYCE. My friends were really happy and overall we had a great time!
I might come back if my friends want to go again. Nothing really stood out to me, but still a good sushi place."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite All You Can Eat sushi spot in the area! For lunch, the price is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95. Definitely worth it! The quality of fish is good for all you can eat, the nigiri is nice with little rice so you can eat more . 
The wait can be busy between 6-8pm. Service is quick and on point! Definitely recommend coming by if you're looking for a solid sushi spot and not spend too much money. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and really had high hopes for the food here because of the reviews!  We ordered two 2 roll specials (which include miso soup and a salad), three specialty rolls and a side order of gyoza.  When we received our order, we discovered the combo rolls were packed incorrectly which was inconvenient since each order belonged to someone different.  The special sauce for one of my husbands rolls was packed in the gyoza box which gave me a surprisingly extra spicy surprise when I tried dipping my food in it.  The rolls were dry and did not taste fresh at all.  My friend said that the breadcrumbs on top of her roll tasted really stale and my husband at all of 3 pieces total because he said the taste was not good at all.  The miso soup was quite tasty and the gyoza was up to par.  I don't think I will return though as I have experienced much better tasting sushi around town."}
{"text":"This is about the 8th or 9th time I have eaten hear over the last 3 years and I've seen this place fall quite a bit in quality and service. We ordered the all you can eat. We both ordered rolls we had before and were surprised at both how bland they tasted but also on how a couple of them have changed. Their 9-1-1 roll, a past favorite, tasted like nothing but crappy habanero hot sauce. The staff was good and friendly until we were ready to leave. We wondered why they had not come by with the check and when we asked, they told us we had a single piece of sushi left out of the 6 rolls we ate and we were told unless we ate the last bite, they would charge us.  I've seen this policy before on many places but have never seen it implemented in such an unfriendly way. Suffice to say, we will no longer be eating here. 2 of the 6 rolls were good and the rest were meh to bad."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times with friends. It's good just nothing extraordinary. They offer all-you-can-eat which is a great option for when you're hungry. There really isn't much more to say other than you'll find all of your typical sushi offerings here and it's good enough to satisfy a sushi craving, but don't expect anything exceptional."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over ten years.  It is by far the best sushi bar I have ever been to. Not only in Vegas,  but better than anywhere I have eaten in Cali too! Everything is superb from the minute you walk in the door until you leave,  full and satisfied. Amazing side dishes and creative delicious rolls make for a super combo your taste buds will thank you for! My favorite is called \"crispy rice\". I will always be a fan.  Thank you sushi mon"}
{"text":"This place is one of the better ayce in Vegas.
It's always SUPER busy, especially at night, so make a reservation.

The service is always pretty solid. I can't really think of any complaints there.

The apps are super good. Seaweed salad, poke, gyoza, everything super fresh and tasty. Miso soup is pretty solid. The mussels are amazing. Not too much globby cheese and sauce. The poke is also very fresh and not overloaded with onions like some other places do. The Cajun albacore here is still my favorite. The perfect amount of spice. Nigiri cuts are always pretty thick. The ecstacy roll and the lemon roll are my favorites. They do half rolls here, too. Which is awesome. 

I love that you can also get more than one mango mochi for the all you can eat. A lot of places don't do that and I'm obsessed with mango mochi."}
{"text":"They make the best avocado rolls which is the only thing I eat at sushi places
Sushi mon and Kabuki!"}
{"text":"Used to come here EVERY TIME we went to vegas but it's come down a little in my opinion over the years as more people have found about it and frequent this place..  and since they don't take reservations the wait can be long, but usually worth it.  
Its all you can eat for around $30, and that includes almost the whole menu.. appetizers, nigiri, rolls, dessert... thats what makes it so great its not just the sushi..
 
The kicker here is you get 1 order each of Uni, Toro and Ama Ebi, (provided they have it) i always give away my Uni and ama ebi to whoever im with.. not my thing.. 

there are 2 schools of sushi, THE NEW: rolls with fancy names and this inside and that on top; and THE OLDl: traditional nigiri, rice with fish on top.  

if you like rolls this is definitely the place for you, many different types of rolls and you can ask for this, instead of that on top, they don't mind. (just leave a little more tip would ya?)  

But if you are a nigiri person, heres the scoop.. Seems like you are only allowed so many servings of the good stuff per person (maybe 3 or 4) then you get the second rate stuff.. heres what i mean.. say you have 2 people.. you order 6 orders of  hamachi.. they come out nice, fresh, white belly part.. yum so good.. you want more?..\" 6 more please,,\" what you will get will not be even close to what you got the first time!  you might get the redder part of the fish or older and kinda dried out.  nothing like the first batch..  So heres what you gotta do.. order 8 or 10 orders the first time.. then move on to the next fish and never return to one that you've already ordered.. the best thing is to take people who order rolls, that way you get to have their portion of the \"fresh stuff\" while they dine on the rolls!!  bonus!!  (this rule dosent apply to rolls only nigiri, the rolls are always consistent i think)

There are specials too, they are unlimited (not part of the holy trinity of \"1 each\", uni, toro and ama ebi) there is also a supposed 1 hour time limit but its not strictly enforced (i just leave a bigger tip when i stay longer)

The next question, how does it stack up to Hikari?  The fresh stuff is much better than Hikari, the 2nd round stuff is not.  You can't order just sashimi (no rice) here only nigiri.

Pros: Freshest AYCE made to order sushi \"first round only\"

Cons: Uni, Ama ebi, and toro, 1 order only, 2nd round of nigiri is lacking (but understandable why they have to do it to get rid of product and not be cleaned out) 

The fine print: you have to eat every thing that you order, or you have to pay for what you don't eat on top of your AYCE price.. 

Tips: Get there before opening to avoid long wait times.  check specials board on the back wall.. if they have Moi (pacific thread fin) get it!!  that is the bomb!!  if you order Ama Ebi, ask them to fry the heads for you.. its like eating a potato chip but shrimp flavored.. to get the most for you money.. avoid fillers and fried stuff in the beginning they fill you up faster save them for the final rounds.  avoid the tako poke, its not sliced tako its idakko (whole small tako), more rubbery and chewy, nothing like Hawaiian style tako poke. 

Verdict: it teeters at 3 1/2 stars but if you follow the 10 step nigiri program i've laid out it could be a 4 star deal."}
{"text":"Ordered seafood combo for 2, enjoy the food, good size and decent quility.
Employees are friendly and hrlpful. The only complain will be the quility of the tuna sashimi. It wasnt a good part of the fish, very chewy."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this place but the last 7 or 8 visits have not been so great. The main problem I've experienced is that I sit and wait for 15 minutes to get a sushi order at the bar. This is happening when I am paying for all you can eat. Today in 40 minutes I received 2 orders of sushi and 2 rolls. I actually decided to leave still hungry. When I got home I checked to see if recent reviews were similar to my experience and it appears they are. The worst part seems to be that the restaurant recently received multiple health code violations. I think I am going to spend my hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place but that was not the case . Our server was hard to understand. The appetizers were over cooked & shrimp tempura was not crunchy it was soggy . The chicken teriyaki was to dry . The 2 pcs of fish wit salmon had too much rice & salmon was not fresh it was chewy . There tuna was ok & yellow tail was ok. The scallops were hard to chew. The server said that our 1 hour ion all you can eat is about to be over & if we want desert , I feel like we were rushed to eat go very uncomfortable. The desert was ok I fished . My sister & I won't be back."}
{"text":"best all you can eat sushi! 

my favorite thing about this place is that you can order HALF portions of the rolls. so you can actually try a lot of different rolls on their menu! 

the fish tastes fresh and I've gotten almost all the rolls on the menu except the deep fried ones, and I can say they're pretty awesome! 

another plus about this place is that appetizers and desserts are included in all you can eat. I like the baked green mussels and edamame and miso soup. and then lychee sorbet green tea ice cream tempura ice cream and mochi! have to save room for them all. 

the OID baked roll is good!"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon has great all you can eat sushi.. for an rather affordable price...

Ask to sit in Fredo's section at the sushi bar!!!

Great selection of fresh fish.. (which is always a positive when eating sushi)

Ask for Fredo!!!

Lots of rolls to choose from, as well as sushi choices, and they don't use too much rice to fill you up!

Fredo suggested the salmon collar (which im surprised that ive never had before, being that we eat sushi about 1 to 2 times a week) it was delicious.. try it!! :) 

and ask for Fredo.. he's from Hawaii and makes some awesome sushi and is just an all around great, funny guy!!! 

Also, you get apps and dessert included in your AYCE price, that is if you still have room for dessert after all the sushi you consume...

Dont forget to ask for a punch card, (and Fredo, hey im just trying to give you a great experience here) once you get 10 punches you get a free all you can eat!!!! well WoRtH IT!!!!

Open late..... and Fredo is there Tuesday thru Saturday, 4pm till close.....  Its hit or miss as to it being busy, you can get right in or there could be an 30 min to 1 hour wait.. so cross your fingers you go at the right time!

For all you can eat, you cant beat it with a stick!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the quality and price.  If eating AYCE sushi is your passion, then this is a must try.  When friends are in town, they always ask to revisit.  Glad it's only down the street."}
{"text":"Yay for $13 pitchers of Sapporo! 

The place was mobbed when we arrived and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The fish we had was fresh, though the cuts weren't as nice as what we get at Bluefin.  

I also liked that they had various daily specials, so that you could get a small sampling of other higher-ticket  items. We were lucky and the specials were for super white tuna, fresh scallops and white clam. 

We tried the tuna and scallops and they were both tasty. I loved the scallops, they were big fresh pieces and very supple. 

The amaebi was a bigger portion and pretty nice. Sweet, juicy with that distinct raw-shrimp mouth-feel. Yum!  

The home smoked salmon was interesting! It had bits of dill flecked on it and was smooth, subtly cooked and with a mild creamy flavor. Not as strong a flavor as in commercial smoked salmon, which could be a positive or negative depending on your preference. I liked it but wouldn't buy a large package of it. 

I had masago with quail egg. The masago was was briny and sweet with nice pop and a generous portion. The egg seemed a little less fresh. The overall effect was still pleasant.  

The uni was NOT as fresh as what I've had at other restaurants. There were odd discoloration marks on it, which I haven't seen anywhere else.

We got a half order of the volcano roll on a friend's recommendation and neither of us liked it. It had a lot of krab in it, which is a turn off.

An order of gyoza meant 2 little bitty pieces. The boy had those and found them unremarkable. He also had the yakitori, which came in a super heavy sauce. Not something he'd go out of his way to have again, and though the portion was small he tried to enlist my assistance in demolishing it.  

I also had the miso soup with fried amaebi heads. The batter got soggy because the heads were totally submerged in the scalding-hot broth, which was disappointing. Also, the fact that the broth was a few degrees shy of boiling- miso is NOT meant to be boiled because it ruins the integrity and health benefits of the miso. The soup utilized white miso and was still flavorful once it cooled down enough to be edible without the risk of 3rd degree burns. 

The ahi poke salad was very mild in flavor impact. I liked the combination of seaweeds/seaplants in it but otherwise it was forgettable. 

The lychee sorbet was a refreshing option. I liked the little bits of what seemed like candied/dry lychee that I'd occasionally discover.

Overall, it was fun and we enjoyed our beer but we won't venture out of our way when we've had better luck with sushi spots closer to home."}
{"text":"Really good place with good services. 
I like this place, I don't think it has the freshest fish but it wasn't the worst fish I've ever had. Lol 
My friends and I went there for Lunch AYCE, it was like $24 including tax. 
We had half orders on a lot of the rolls because that way we can try a little bit of everything. 
I do have to warn you on the 911, we are not kidding. I eat a lot of spicy food but I could barely handle the 911. They straight up use ghost peppers for it because I know what ghost peppers taste like. 
LOVE their nigiri because they don't give you too much rice like other places which is super great. I love it. 
Would definitely come back to this place. 
And I definitely recommend everyone to go there and try the food themselves because it's not bad at all."}
{"text":"So I ate here at 9 on a Sunday night and it was super busy. We had to wait 15 minutes to sit anywhere and there were empty tables they would not let us sit at because they said there were other people on the list that we're going to be seated there. For a party of 2, waiting for that long to then finally be sat at the bar where I originally asked to be seated at was annoying. 
Best part: sushi is awesome and the garlic edamame is delicious. You can get half rolls which is nice for all you can eat.
Bad part: long wait, hostess service sucks, waitress was ok and made it very clear we had to eat all of our sushi or we would be charged extra. There are so many rules and I was scared that if I didn't eat every single grain of my rice they would charge me.

Honestly I prefer other places that are more lenient and don't stalk your leftovers."}
{"text":"The shrimp tempura almost didn't even have shrimp in it and it was extremely over cooked and greasy. The waiter was ignoring us and I had to call out for someone to come bring us the bill. The food was just okay, it just so happens to be near my house, however I don't think I will come back. It just wasn't anything special. The presentation was nice though, the rolls looked pretty."}
{"text":"cold unsalted edamame- bleh
incessant wait staff who wouldnt layy off us while we perused the menu.
uncomfy seating
loud.. maybe i meant to say boisterous. 
I'd never go again, we fought to walk out the entire time."}
{"text":"I like the night shift chefs and servers. They served me sushi with very little rice throughout my meal. Very good cuts as well. The chef accomodated my food allergy very well. Sometimes I have to wait but the chef would always apologize and explain though I can see that they are preparing for someone else's order (which I understand). But when they are not busy, the chef always goes to my side whenever I'm almost done, to see if I want to order more. One time I ordered sake nigiri and the chef asked if I want belly (not on menu) instead. Yes pls! Very satisfied. 5 stars. Left $10 tip. 

I went back for late lunch with a friend. Only got one tray of wasabi and ginger (good my friend doesn't like them so I took that 1 tray for myself). Rice was very little on my first order then they put more rice after that  (even my friend commented on the significant increase of rice on my nigiris). The cuts (small and not properly cut) are also worse on my next orders--I can tell they are skimping fish on me. The chef did not want to accomodate my food allergy so I wasn't able to get one of the sushi that I want. 1st server ignored us even when he see me looking at him(he's doing his best not to make eye contact) and the other server heard us talking about it while looking at the 1st server, 2nd server went straight to the table beside us (which was already asked by the 1st server) then she proceeded to serve other tables before we were able to make her feel pity on us. Our water wasn't filled right right away and had to flag the 3rd server to get water. 0 stars. Left $1.24 tip.

Very disappointed, I keep bragging to my friend how good I was taken care of from my prior visit. Tip: go late at night or maybe give lunch servers their tip in advance MAYBE they will take care of you. Or NOT to request anything if you're going on lunch or early dinner time if you can't go late at night. And yes, I was friendly to them until they keep ignoring us."}
{"text":"What's unique about Sushi-Mon?
1.  1/2 orders are ok with them -sharing IS caring, good to share with friends and try different rolls
2.  their AYCE menu includes appetizers and dessert (hard to find elsewhere)
3. Lychee Sherbet is a must try ( finally! I found it at Nijiya http://www.yelp.com/biz/nijiya-market-san-jose#hrid:E43VdZqPGTwG0IyS1xDVtQ)
4. Open late until 2 a.m.

They have a good variety of rolls and everything is pretty fresh.  The place is always full with a line out the door and a waiting list so you know it's good! The specialty rolls are great, and I recommend the Pixie, Mingus, and the Spider.

Just wish their poki salad was a tad less salty.

I can't eat as much as I used to but want to get my money's worth."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite spot for sushi going on a few years now. Just made another visit yesterday and had excellent service for lunch. I recommend the ecstasy roll..it is my favorite!! I also brought a friend with me and it was his first time eating sushi, which he loved!  If you want fresh food, come here!"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular and feels obviously like a chain. It's a decent option but I'd rather drive a little further for something better. Did have a very negative experience once with one of the chefs while sitting at the bar.  Took forever for any of them to take notice that we needed to put in an order. When we asked for another volcano... He shot us this look and said again??  Obviously this was an inconvenience to make.  Seemed like he tried to be a little more friendly toward the end because he realized his own reaction but it was too late and really spoiled the experience.  Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Over all we liked this place.
AYCE but still quality is good (some are not excellent but still good).
I want to come back again."}
{"text":"Let's face a fact: AYCE and excellent sushi were never meant to go hand in hand.

That is, unless you consider California roll to be sushi, in which case you'd need some sushi education.

This place serves higher than the average buffet quality of sushi, many popular side items, and rolls, all at a low price of $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner. I can safely say that the quality is much better than every other AYCE sushi bar that I've eaten at by a long shot, but that's not to imply that the other places were overwhelmingly difficult to beat.

Pros:
- Price. If you don't order like an idiot (\"let's order rolls\") you will definitely get more than what you pay for.
- On their AYCE, with the exception of sea urchin nigiri, sweet shrimp nigiri, sashimi salad, and yellowtail collar (maximum one order each, per customer) everything else can be ordered as many times as you want.
- Their miso soup is delicious! It comes with a sweet shrimp head in it.

Cons:
- Inconveniently located away from the Las Vegas strip.
- This place is always busy. Good luck on weekend nights.
- Good service is something of a rarity."}
{"text":"Update: had a pretty awesome AYCE meal here last weekend. Sat in front of the friendly Kazu-san and had a good time. Incredibly tender unagi. Nice salmon belly and yellowtail belly. Very buttery toro. Sushi rice in the nigiri was on the warm side, and loosely packed - and I appreciated that. All of the nigiri was prepared like this. Kazu-san's got skills!

I was also served a perfectly broiled Yellowtail Collar - medium rare. Delicious. The scallop sushi was very firm and fresh - the closest to live I've had in nigiri form. (Sushi Koma's scallop sushi is rather slimy+fishy in comparison.)

My new hand roll rule: Only order hand rolls one-at-a-time at the sushi bar *only* (to maintain a crispy nori cone). Makes all the difference. Your hand roll nori will become a soggy latex funnel if you let it sit for more than 20 seconds. Gobble it up as soon as it is made!

I am again a big fan of the 'new' Sushi Mon. Great service, little or no wait time, and a convenient location for West-siders. I *do* enjoy the kitchen food at Sushi Koma a little more (e.g. their Tostada, their gyoza) but as far as straight-up sushi goes, Sushi Mon is fantastic."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi here is amazing! My number 1 spot when I'm craving sushi. Good service and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Two locations not the same owner...
Some of the rolls are good enough but the lactation on Maryland Pkwy are much better. Aside from the food the service was very good, all of the servers were on top of things and my glass was always full."}
{"text":"We use to eat here all the time when it first opened and it being only 3 mins away from home. My wife is Japanese and according to her the quality of their sushi dropped significantly, even my teenage son says their fish was bloody. We no longer go there."}
{"text":"OMG? talk about all you can eat sushi. 

One of the best thing about Las Vegas. The service and food was great. The chef was very friendly and offered us some really sushi. Definitely one of the best experience in town. He is from Hawaii which made the conversation more comfortable. Although you can only have ama ebi, you can have all your can each ama ebi shrimp heads (which is my favorite). The salmon special was good and huge. Everything else was so delicious, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I haven't been there in quite a while. My friend's and I were pleasantly surprised that the service, quality of the food and price were good. We had a great time."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I don't know where some of these 'amazing' reviews are coming from. I ordered AYCE and they offer a wide range of selection. The food is good, everything is seasoned well and it tastes great. But the reason why I will not be returning is because there is JUST WAY TOO MUCH RICE and the fish is too thin. When i put the sushi in my mouth, 1/3 of the time I can taste the rice and fish evenly. But for the remaining 2/3 all I am chewing on is rice. It felt like I was downing a bowl of rice with fish flavoring. At my go-to AYCE sushi back home (sake2me-tustin), the size of the fish is 2x the size and rice is 1/2 that of Sushi Mon. I didn't expect it to be at that standard, because that's just how you do ayce sushi business (so the customers don't eat alot), but I thought the amount of rice:fish was ridiculous. I think I ate 1/2 of what I normally eat at an AYCE sushi because I was so full on rice. I glanced over at the next table and saw the rolls. I was glad I didn't order one.. lol
I saw the great reviews on here and was excited for it, but I will not be returning... The waitress was really helpful and nice though."}
{"text":"this place sucks everthing tasted like sandpaper and terrible guest service.
i work at outbacksteak house. stick with steak people. its fabby"}
{"text":"I have to give Sushi Mon * * * * * five stars. 

It's one of the best deals in Vegas.  High quality food, great service, and nice fair prices.

It's an AYCE all you can eat, Sushi restaurant that also has non-sushi items on the menu that counts towards AYCE, so you can have a variety of foods and flavors.

It's much better than buying sushi a la carte, by the order, if you can eat more than 10 pairs of sushi, then you're going to really get your money's worth here.

I'd come here again.  If you're from the Los Angeles area, and know the place \"Midori\" in the Valley, this is similar to that in format and quality.  And inversely, if you like Sushi Mon in Vegas and are ever in the LA area, check out Midori.

Parking was easy, in the hot, outdoor lot shared with other retailers."}
{"text":"Go to Island Sushi & Grill, on Eastern & Serene streets. It's way better food, for non sushi eaters & sushi eaters. They have ALL YOU CAN EAT, lunch for $21.95 & dinner for $26.95. Kids under 10 are half off, for lunch & Kids under 10 are half off, for dinner, as well.

NOT worth the wait! I've tasted better food at other Japanese restaurants & I've had excellent customer service at other restaurants, in general. The GOOD, the servers seem friendly & seem to move fast waiting on their customers. The BAD, crowded restaurant & it's loud, the extended wait time to get a table or a seat at the bar. Customers see employees gathered around the host / hostess area chit chatting with each other & not paying attention to their customers. The manager doesn't smile, moves slow, not professional, not friendly, lacks skills to be a manager & does not resolve matters for customers. They should get rid of him & get a experienced manager. Do they have an assistant manager? Doesn't seem like it. It's not a kid friendly restaurant & they don't have a kid's menu. Seriously time to BOYCOTT Sushi Mon..."}
{"text":"The best Sushi AYCE place ever ! Fresh food, awesome service, a must go place for me every time I come visit Vegas."}
{"text":"The hostess greeted me and I immediately thought his place was gonna have great service. My friend and I were sat very quickly at the sushi bar where we were greeted by our sushi chef who's name I don't remember, but he had these light green eyes you can't miss. He was awesome. The real trouble began after he informed us he was going on break and had a different guy take over. My friend asks for another roll, as the chef begins to make this, the server drops off our checks, right in the middle of our meal. Now I wouldn't be so irritated by that if we were almost finished, but it felt as if we were being rushed to finish. Also my friend was supposed to pay for this meal, somehow they gave us each separate checks, one AYCE and one ale cart. We told them we were BOTH doing AYCE and that it would be ONE check. I was a little annoyed but figured hey must've forgotten or something might have happened, so I brushed it off. The final straw however, was when the checks were dropped off the chef stopped making our rolls and looked at the bills. He then asked us why the checks had been dropped off, and if we were done. When we told him we weren't finished eating and to continue making the roll, he still continued to question us as to if we were finished, asking if we were gonna pay for the rolls he was making, saying \"I don't know what's going on.\" Only after we flagged down a server to change both bills to AYCE, did he continue to make our rolls. The first sushi chef we had was amazing, I'm really sad he had to go on break before we finished our meal. I'm sure this review would've been much better if the second chef hadn't been so rude. I won't be back, but for everyone else who goes and sits at the sushi bar, look for the Hispanic man with the green eyes, like I said he's AWESOME."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for sushi for my husband and I. Great service, decently priced menu and best of all, ayce!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time.. Seems like their service has gone down. We have been waiting for our rolls for at least 10 mins per roll. We mass ordered about 5 rolls to get us going since they are kind of busy. However, they ended up bringing us 1 by 1. You have a 1 hour limit to eat and order so I hope they will not kick us out since we have been waiting. 

The food, food is ok. Rolls are loosely rolled. Some places tend to tightly roll their sushi so that's what we enjoy. It's decently fresh.

My recommendation is to eat at the bar. Do not request a booth unless you want to wait on your food for a long time."}
{"text":"we love sushi; but usually stay far away from all you can eat places.  however, we decided to give this place a try based on yelp reviews and friends' recommendations.  for all you can eat, it's awesome.  definitely the best all you can eat sushi place we've tried.  just stay away from the sea urchin, but that's just a personal opinion!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in town! I always go for all you can eat, but also enjoy their bento lunches. Price is average compared to other sushi joints. Fish is fresh and tasty. The only bummer is that they don't offer as many good baked scallop roll options as Osaka, but that has never stopped me from coming here for either an excellent lunch or late-night food option. Also right next to the Japanese/Tokyo store; a great location!"}
{"text":"Nearly $30 for all you can eat at Sushi Mon is a bit of a rip off.  The nigiri fish is not very fresh. You can tell when ponzu sauce is added with the white tuna, red snapper etc.. You cannot savor the freshness of the fish when drenched with sauce. I could tell just by the hamachi which was served without ponzu sauce, it was not as fresh as from other places. 

And for $30 of AYCE with a 2 sided menu is just not as good of a selection. Everyone is probably sick of me comparing all AYCE to Xtreme Sushi but I really do prefer Xtreme. Everything on the menu is AYCE and for sushi mon, the 2 sided menu with a short list of appetizer list is just not enough value for $30.  In addition, way too much rice and I was displeased of the uni...it definitely lacked freshness. 

I did like the salmon skin handroll and the lasagna roll.  All of the concoction masked the taste but rolls were synthetically yummy."}
{"text":"I'm not a Vegas local, A friend and I are here on vacation from Reno, so I'm used to different sushi joints. When we got there we were seated at the bar and ordered our rolls. We tried ordering appetizers but he said he's doesn't do that. We had to wait for the waitress to come by and ask for drinks. The roll pieces were really big and thick, so that being said I was filled up fast and didn't eat half of the roll. When she came by she asked why I didn't eat it, which was weird. But I told her. 
Another thing is I didn't get my edamame until a little before the check.
Overall it was an okay experience.... I don't think I'd eat here though."}
{"text":"I visited twice.  Dine in and take out.  This restaurant is convenient because of walking distance from my house.  I moved from CA last year and Sushi \"neta\" (fish) is better than restaurants in San Jose, but they must improve the way to prepare their rice.  Shari was very dry.  Particularly, Maki sushi I took out collapsed its shape when I picked up by chopsticks.  Also, I felt their rice is missing \"Umami\"."}
{"text":"AYCE. Be patient with the service. They are so nice here. I hate when patrons are rude when it's busy. Often has a wait. Quality is not the best, but it's good none the less. Great variety. Also good for lunch take-out. Seating is tight. If your food companion eats sushi they have probably been here and likely like it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places! Some of the best in town for sure. The only downfall is the restaurant is small & a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We haven't been to this spot in years and it is great to know they are still the best.  Friendly service and fresh delicious food. The specialty rolls are the best and there are so many of them.  We even had our little one with us and she was well looked after."}
{"text":"Sushi and service here are great! 

We always get the all-you-can-eat here and love it! The appetizers are good and they have a large variety of hand/cut rolls to choose from.

Two thumbs up! Will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been going to sushi mon (both locations) for at least 5 or 6 years and for the price I doesn't get much better when it comes to AYCE. No, it's not the best in quality but that's not what you're paying for. If you want average sushi with good service this is the place for you. Our favorites are the pastel roll as well as seared tuna, red snapper, salmon and baked muscles. Can't go wrong with the poki either. The longest I've ever waited is an hour and now they can text you when the table is ready. You can get better sushi for 5 times the price just depends on what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Always good service, a smile and great food!
 If you can't be seated right away at a table try the bar. Kinda cool to watch them make the roll in front of you."}
{"text":"I just called five minutes ago the gentleman on the phone said he could not take a pick up order as they are closing in five minutes I live two minutes from there. Please fix your yelp says you're open until 2 AM. 
I heard this place was great. I was trying to feed some nurses at Saint Rose Hospital."}
{"text":"Came with my boyfriend around dinner time and it was packed. It's rather a small sushi place compared to others, so we were waiting in line. Once we got in, we chose to sit at the booths which wasn't bad because we got personally served with one of the chefs who was sweet. We did AYCE and ordered several of rolls, seaweed salad and mussles. Food was delicious and service was great, the waiter was always checking up on us. 

Unlimited servings of desserts and the green tea ice cream was delicious! 

Would love to come back here again!"}
{"text":"okay. im a sushi whore. and i know it.

and there's no where better to whore it up, than at Sushimon's All You Can Eat sushi. basically, one flat fee to keep eating sushi nigiri, rolls, and food from the kitchen for an hour. 

sushi - is good. really can't F'up the nigiri - its fish on rice. nothing fancy - rule is tho you must eat the rice. the rolls are the stars, as they are usually custom and made to order - i love the jaelin roll, tiger roll and super caterpiller roll. its good stuff - and whats cool is they'll let you order half rolls to really change it up.

hot food - is good too. mostly side dishes and apps - but i like the curry rice, yellowtail collar, fried gyoza and miso soup.

dessert - fried ice cream or mochi - the ultimate is the super sweet and exotic lychee sherbert - yum.

ALWAYS a stop when im back in vegas, i suggest the same for you."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi!!!

I came here to eat with three of my guy friends when we were in Las Vegas for vacation. We're all from Hawaii and 3 of my friends work at a sushi restaurant, so we know what we wanted and knew what sushi is supposed to taste like. I'm going to admit, I was satisfied. Sushi in the desert, who would've thought this place would be genuinely great!

All you can eat everything! Maguro, salmon, spicy tuna, tobiko, ikura, ebi, etc. They also have a wide selection of rolls to eat from. Funny story, we were half way through our eating frenzy when one of my friends orders the 911 roll. It's one of the hottest, if not the hottest roll on the menu. It wasn't a tasty hot, like sriacha sauce or like a tobasco. It was a burn a hole through my stomach hot! I'm so glad I had eaten sushi before I tried the roll because for the rest of the night my tongue was fried and all I ate was ice cream :(

Great selection of sushi for an all you can eat restaurant, puts all the Hawaii sushi joints to shame. Great place to bring sushi lovers and non-Vegas peeps."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fresh and delicious sushi you found the right place. I have been going there with my family for over three years and always enjoy. If you are going on the weekend you might have to wait more than thirty minutes but it's worth it."}
{"text":"You lost my business! I understand two people at a six top can potentially cost you money, but you lost the revenue from our lunch and any future visits. We came in and the only table available was the six top by the door. We were told we couldn't have that table because a larger group MIGHT come in. We were then told we could wait 15 minutes or so to see if something else opened up. I understand it is a small place. Why not capture as much business as possible? We will find another sushi place, due to your HORRIBLE customer service."}
{"text":"After going to this location for a year my wife and I had to leave.  Chefs are inconsistent, as soon as you form a bond with a chef he is gone the next day.  The staff is pretty cool, never an issue, but the chefs will mess up your order and blame it on you.  The hostess or host is usually so over whelmed they can care less of they give you great service.  I left this one and now go to the Sahara location."}
{"text":"Good service, very crowded at night. But overall the food is amazing and you are served very quickly. The garlic tuna, super white tuna, and yellowtail some of the best in town! Lemon roll and pastel roll are also very appetizing for specialty rolls. Overall can't go wrong with all you can eat, but they offer a variety of lunch specials as well!"}
{"text":"Been going at this place for years every time I take my family in Vegas.. My Fam grew & now had a 2yr old daughter.. We walked in wit my daughter eating her yogurt, drinking her apple juice & was told by the waitress that outside food is not allowed.. thought they would give it a consideration since my daughter is 2years of age & doesn't eat rice at all.. It's not the waitress fault, she's just doing her job.. Management should make a better judgement & I think exceptions can be made.."}
{"text":"how could i NOT have written a review for this place? I used to go here at least twice a month!

sit at the bar - ask to sit in Fredo's section.

especially if you from Hawaii - he'll hook you up!

i love the baked mussels. but Fredo just keeps stuff comin - we don't even need to order!

Pricey: a little. But for the food and quantity - worth it. 

GO!"}
{"text":"Sushi, sushi, sushi. The secret is to literally starve the whole day if you are gonna eat some afterwork with friends so you can get the full benefit of all you can eat.  The trick is the rice that fills you up quick.  This place is excellent for your sushi cravinigs.  The wait between orders of sushi is a little long but it's worth it and understandable when the place is busy.  The sushi rolls aren't just rice with minimalist fill. It's appropriate to what you order.  All you can eat sushi is incomplete without edemame, wasabi, and soy sauce on the side.  You have to have miso soup to wrap it all up toward the end of your sushi session.  It's a nice cozy joint and the staff are friendly.  Recommend: Spicy Tuna roll, ahi poke, 911 roll, 007 roll, miso soup, teriyaki bowl, unagi, and screaming orgasm."}
{"text":"It's 10:30pm on a Tuesday night, and it hits me that I'm hungry... Really hungry!  I remembered driving by this place, and it looking fairly crowded before.  I yelped it, and it looked try worthy.

This place is not bad at all.  You can't beat the price for all you can eat sushi in Vegas.  I was seated at the bar and was given a brief explanation of how the all you can eat works.  The waitress suggested that I order small because whatever I don't eat, I will have to pay for in addition to the all you can eat price.  Also, you have to eat the rice and the fish (sounds obvious, but I do know of people who would hide the rice and just eat the fish).  Also, you can order half rolls (4 pieces instead of 8), so you can eat more of a variety.  There is also a 1 hour time limit... so no pulling Man v. Food all day here.  

I ordered and ordered because I was determined to get my money's worth.  I had the sweet shrimp (only 1 order per person), snow crab hand rolls, crab sticks, garlic tuna (my least favorite), halibut, some kind of variation on the a shrimp roll with avocado, more snow crab, the hottest 911 roll I have ever had (I couldn't feel my tongue-- it was awesome), and more halibut.  I was stuffed, but determined to finish my last hand roll when I was asked by Jun (one of the sushi chefs) if I wanted anything else.  I told him I was tapping out.  I had fought the good fight... then he offers dessert.  I'm not one to turn down sugar, but I don't think I could have looked at more food much less ate it.  

My bill was about $30 with my plum wine.  The only reason I couldn't give this place 5 starts is because I've had fresher fish elsewhere at an all you can eat.  Of course, this was in Cali."}
{"text":"Pretty good all you can eat Mexican sushi.   They restrict the good stuff, but overall a decent meal."}
{"text":"A strong 3 Stars IMHO...

I saw a tip recently that they do a great California Roll here...lol...well they do more than that.  There are only a few incredible things I find here these days (under the \"new\" owner and staff,) but there is still a lot they are doing right here.

As I see it, there are two reasons to come here: Uni & AYCE.  They don't serve any disappointments here.  Just about everything is a little above average, so with AYCE you get a lot of good food at a solid price $26/$27 I think.  But outside of the Uni there is nothing here worth calling out specifically in my book.  One of the better spots in the immediate area, but not a place I go out of my to get to."}
{"text":"Fresh and lots to choose from. My favorite rolls were the Ecstacy Roll and Sexy Girl. The seared tuna and salmon nigiri was also great. For dessert I would recommend the lychee and green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the atmosphere, our server was really good, really fast and attentive! Would def come back! The blue fin tuna was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a zero if I could. My daughter and her 3 friends went there today and all but one had the all you can eat buffet for $23 each. She called me to pick her up because she really felt sick after eating. She had big stomach aches. When we came home she said that the other 2 girls had to throw up and had stomach aches as well. We called the restaurant and the manager said to go to the doctor and have the doctor prove that it was their food which made her sick. Really? And how do I do that? Besides waffles this morning she had nothing else to eat, and the fact that her other friends got sick also should speak for itself. I just found out that one of the others called as well and the manager said she wasn't sorry that they got sick! How absolutely pathetic. We didn't want a free meal, we more wanted the money back, but the manager flat out said no money back. Don't ever go there please and eat the buffet."}
{"text":"I gave it couple tries and was never happy with this place.. The sushi is good but not great and I just didn't feel like I was eating something different with every roll they brought to us. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Once again Sushi Mon has exceeded my expectations.  This is now our second time here and had the best service from the staff and our Sushi chef Tomo. 

If you come to the location on Maryland be sure and ask for Tomo you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was the best in town for years. It had two amazing qualities. Value and quality. Now you get better value out of grocery store sushi with the small serving sizes. Secondly the quality of the fish has gone down greatly. Not nearly as fresh now. I am assuming because less people are coming so they must be saving the fish. 
Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome. There will be a wait, especially if you have a group of more than two. And the wait can be very very long because the place is small. But it's worth it. Just go to the Starbucks a couple stores down and relax until your table is ready."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it opened! They have so much sushi rolls it's ridiculous! 

If you are going to come here make sure you get the all you can eat! I guarantee you want to try everything on their menu! 

The fish is super fresh! It taste as if they had the ocean in their back yard.  So awesome! 

The hamachi kama is my favorite and the baked mussels is a must! If you are hungry this is the sushi place to visit! 

It can get extremely busy at times and their can be a wait as longs as 45 mins- 1 hr.  If you have the patience your wait will be worth your while!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fast service, more fish than rice, caviar is the bomb, love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place very quite place to eat with the famiily employees are great!! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Every time I came to Vegas, this is the first restaurant I will go to immediately. Generally I order the all you can eat, most of them I like are appetizers. My favorite Japanese restaurant. The only thing I really dislike is that we have to wait for at least 40 minutes for dinner. No reservation."}
{"text":"I would say that this is a step down from the other location in Vegas. However, it's still pretty good. The price is good, the variety is good, and they seem to have pretty fresh fish. It just depends on what you order. Unfortunately, they missed on a couple of dishes:

* Snow Crab - stuff was NASTY
* Yellowtail Collar - Super dry. Texture of dried chicken with the taste of fish.

Now onto the good stuff:

* You can order rolls by half order so you can try more things
* Their hamachi, tuna, and salmon were all pretty good quality
* They have two price points so you can save money if you don't need some of the pricier fish (uni, salmon/yellowtail collar, snow crab, etc)
* They have really delicious smoothies (does not come with AYCE)
* The rolls are creative and give you a lot of variety in preparation and ingredients.
* They have natto (that gives them an extra star)

All in all, the lunch was a good experience. It's just too bad they weren't as consistent as the other location.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is not the best sushi I've ever had.  However, it is the best AYCE sushi I've ever had.  And it's considerably better than some regular sit down sushi places I have been as well.  The fish is pretty fresh, they don't overdo it on the rice when you order nigiri sushi, the rolls are creative and very tasty and the coup de grace: they have natto!!!  I had four natto hand rolls on top of everything else I ordered when I ate there.

Just a very well done AYCE sushi experience.  Kudos Sushi Mon!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"this place used to be the bomb, great service great food, and a ridiculously long wait during peak hours. I really liked the waiting system where they text you and let you know how long your wait is and when your table is ready that way you can go hang out at starbucks nextdoor or run some errands. The last time I was there with the husband, there was no more waitlist texting system and we waited 3 hours for a party of 2 when the hostess originally said only 45 minutes and they would call us when our table was ready. Came back after 2 hours as we waited in the car because it was so cold and windy outside and the outdoor heaters were broken or turned off. I thought they had the wrong number to contact me, but nope. I told the hostess that they weren't on, she just said, \"oh, ok.\" anyways, after a 2 hr wait in the car in the cold, the hostess told us it would be only another 45 minutes. Waited another hour and finally left and went to Sushi Koma. It has been 3 weeks and I am still waiting for a phone call to tell us our table is ready at Sushi Mon. 

I had also gone to Goyemon (a sushi mon related joint) about a week ago and they still had the texting waitlist system which worked perfectly. Not sure what is happening at sushi mon on maryland."}
{"text":"Pretty decent all-you-can-eat sushi bar, which is harder to find in Las Vegas these days.  My favorite used to be Hamada, but they stopped doing it a year or so ago.

They have some rules, which seem fair.  They state that you must eat everything (including rice) in order to avoid getting charged, but they didn't seem to enforce that rule, grabbing plates away before we had a chance to eat every crumb.  I think as long as you don't abuse the all-you-can-eat, they are totally cool about it.

The place is nothing special, located in a shopping strip mall.  However, they are open late, which is a real plus in my book.  We went late, and there were quite a few people coming and going.

The hamachi and maguro nigiri were actually very good.  The miso soup was not (too watery and not much tofu).  The sunomono salad was also very tasty and fresh.  The rolls are big, so order conservatively until you see what I am talking about.  The 9-1-1 roll was scorching HOT!  We loved it, but unless you want to sweat, don't order it.  The menu warns you in case you don't listen to me.  Keep in mind the rule if you don't eat everything.

Overall, I give it a thumbs up.  I would go back if I was looking a late night sushi spot for sure.  The total bill for 3 people was $95.78 and that included 3 all-you-can-eat orders and 1 large Sapporo.  Tip was extra."}
{"text":"Always hits the spot! Very affordable for AYCE Sushi especially for lunch! Staff always have a smile on their face and very friendly. Sushi Chef's at the Sushi Bar are also very attentive."}
{"text":"The sushi chefs are great.  The food was great but haven't returned since 2014 for one reason even though it was one of my favorite spots to go to.  I will never return just because the waitress/ female server scolded me for having leftovers.  I was extremely stuffed and couldn't take another bite.  She said that \"next time, don't leave leftovers. I said, maybe there won't be a next time.  There will never be a next time."}
{"text":"Two stars for service only. The food is very mediocre at best. My sushi items did not arrive cold, just \"cool.\" Didn't feel well the next day. Price is one thing, but truly there is very little quality here. If you must go, I would recommend cooked items only."}
{"text":"I ALWAYS go to sushimon whenever I'm in Vegas...always loved their food and service.

But this time..i was very disappointed with their service. well I should say the MANAGER!!

we had party of 10 so we had to wait until all the tables opened up. We put our name down and waited inside since it was cold outside. The manager told us to wait outside so other guests can sign in. Then, we asked him how goyemon was (the same owner) and we talked among ourselves if we should try goyemon instead.  We decided to stay and continued to wait outside for our table. 

After 40minutes of waiting, the manager comes out and goes \" Oh, I gave your table away because I thought you guys weren't eating here.\" 

UHHHHH WHY DO YOU THINK WE WERE WAITING OUTSIDE!!!???

No sorry or nothing...Very disappointed..."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful - 4 stars.

The quality of the food was 2 stars. 

There were 4-5 sushi chefs working and I think the least experience chef prepared our sushi rolls and sushi cuts. What we should have done was asked for our food remade by a different chef.  You live, you learn...

Was so disappointed with the quality and presentation of the food we received that I asked for a call back from the manager.  Have not heard back from the manager. 

Parking: plenty of parking spots available in the plaza."}
{"text":"This place seems to be super packed all the time- which means the service is rushed with everyone snappy and out of breath. Sushi is good. Once, there was a hair in one roll and after informing our waitress, she apologized and brought back a bowl of tempura ice cream after the bill...which was cool. Because it's super packed, you are jam packed with other people like a can of sardines so it tends to get noisy."}
{"text":"Good selection of sushi. Good service.

Small restaurant.

You mark a list and they bring food to you.

Not on the strip, so plan it on the way to or back from Vegas.

Ice cream tempura hits the spot.

Bottom line: Not anything different or special, but a good place to eat sushi in Vegas if you crave it!"}
{"text":"One of the best All You Can Eat Sushi Restaurants in town.  Been coming to this place for the past nine years.  Awesome Sushi - Cajun Albacore, Salmon, White Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Tako and Yellowtail are excellent.  911 roll is a challenge, but if you like to drink a lot of ice and water, this is the roll for you.  Orion Roll is one of the best, also, Supreme Salmon Roll is awesome.  So many rolls and different type of items on the menu to try...worth the all you can eat price.  Just be prepared to wait for over twenty-forty minutes during the busy dinner times."}
{"text":"I eat here once a month. Love it !!! I personally think they should allow children to bring in their own food because not all kids eat sushi. But that's there rules!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 12 of us during our trip to Vegas.  Friend in the group had been here several times and recommended the place.  We called ahead to make rsvp and they were able to accommodate us with such a big group...so that was awesome.  
The place is kinda small and our group took over almost of the restaurant.  The service was great and the waitress were nice.  Some of us decided to try the AYCE and the other group did the a la carte.  I went for the AYCE and it the sushi was pretty good.   I would definitely come back and do the AYCE again but this time come with an emptier stomach!"}
{"text":"It took 1.5 hours for my squad to be seated on a Saturday, so we went to Sitara to kill time. Once seated at SushiMon, the waitress was very patient with us & personable while we took a gander at the menu. She recommended items based on what we liked. All of the rolls came out soon after we placed our orders. Everything was good and tasted fresh, but hardly stuck out to me from their competitors. The notable rolls: Lemon Roll, Chubby, Hurricane, & Sexy Girl. I was starved from the long ass wait that I did not take a single food pic. I also liked the octopus seaweed salad. They have lychee sorbet as a dessert item, with lychee chunks! Reminded me of home (Hawaii). Fyi Goyemon on Decatur is its sister property & has the same exact menu."}
{"text":"Great attentive friendly service. AYCE sushi. Take note that sashimi not included. Read the house rules before you order or else you might be charge more. Came here for lunch for the all you can eat for $ 23 tax included without gratuity. Had the tako salad which was a bit salty. The sushi were fresh and generous amount of fish on top of the rice. The rolls come in half orders just tell the sushi chef. Overall it was a pleasant and refreshing experience to dine here."}
{"text":"Came with three people and we all got the \"all you can eat\" for $22 during lunch. Dinner isn't much more than that.

Started things off with the sexy girl roll, the most expensive item on the menu. A pretty tasty shrimp tempura roll. It contained shrimp tempura, cucumber, scallop, spicy tuna. Blended with spicy garlic sauce and eel sauce.

For the nigiri, we had the yellow tail, salmon, and tuna rolls. My favorite was the salmon nigiri.
We followed things up with the cajun albacore. Loved the unique cajun seasoning on the albacore. Brings out a new flavor to sushi.

Other Orders...

Volcano roll came out nice and warm with quite interesting flavors. Overall, pretty okay.
Scallop yum yum roll with orgasm sauce was the best!
Pixie roll contained crab, shrimp, cucumber, avocado, smelt eggs, and eel sauce all wrapped in soy paper. An unusually large roll. Also an unfavorable ending to my stomach considering the amount of sushi we already had. 

Finished things off with a tempura ice cream. Unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing. The tempura was just too soft and soggy."}
{"text":"I never had bad service from here and sadly i did last night. Never once a 5 stars from me dropped to a 1 star. I work in the food industry also so i know how it works. The only way to keep customer coming back is having good food quality and providing excellent experiences for them.
We waited almost 10 mins to have anyone to noticed us and sit us. 
Only time the server check on us is when he asked for our drinks. Asked for one iced tea and 1 water with lemons came out 2 water with lemons. Hey thats ok. People make mistake. 
What upsets me the most is that if we seated at the bar, the reason to sit there is to be served directly from the chef. 
We sat there exactly for 10 mins. And no one even acknowledge if us were there. NO HI NO HELLO NO WELCOME but a glare from a mexican chef with his unhappy face. We get it youre busy. But it takes 30 secs to remind customers that you know they are there, and will be right there to help. I wouldnt mind waiting so much.  I wanted to walk out so bad but the bf told me not to since we ordered side dishes already.
10 mins passed, still no help so i had to get the server attention if we could order and he took our orders. 
Was going to do all you can eat but we felt so uncomfortable with the place were being so loud, no one seems to want to come check on us or even help us. Also the mexican guy kept glaring and rolling his eyes at us. So we switched it to ala carte and hurried to leave. The Experience werent great at all."}
{"text":"We've eaten here years ago. Never thought about coming back because We have our favorite Sushi joints and there are just tons to choose from in the city. My in laws invited us to eat here with them one night so we happily obliged.

We got the AYCE dinner. Kids don't have reduced AYCE price, one star off for that. My kids don't eat much but I like that if they want more, they can just order. But since they didn't have kids AYCE price, we ordered a la carte for them. 

We started with half Roll orders. I ordered a tiger roll and another one (I forget the exact name). All were bland and bla. Poké and nigiri were good. I was turned off by some of the food my kids ordered and by the rolls we all ordered. No umph in looks or taste at all!! 

Even though my palate and stomach were satiated by the nigiri (because after a taste of the other food, they were my only options), I felt a bit robbed. After I ordered my dessert, I turn around to the sushi bar (because my dessert took a good loooong 10 min or so (ice cream scoop), and I notice a chalkboard in the back with \"specials\".

I was so annoyed because our waiter didn't tell us that our AYCE dinner included all that is listed on the chalkboard. Why was I so irked??? Because one of my favorite things to order at Japanese restaurants were up there and not on my menu at the table -- hamachi kama and sake Kama. I told the waiter I was upset because he didn't mention the specials to us. He did apologize but that did not remove the bad taste the whole place left in my mouth. Pun intended!"}
{"text":"Love this place! A Vegas trip would not be complete without stopping by and getting me some AYCE sushi. The food is authentic and the waiters are friendly. The cost is about $25ish. Definitely would not suggest bringing a big group, unless you don't mind the wait. There's a 90minute time limit to their AYCE, but of all the times I have been there, they have yet to enforce it. Try the Dynamite. It's delici-o-so! Be sure to pick up a stamp card before you leave because you'll be coming back here again and again!"}
{"text":"Can't beat these place with AYCE Sushi.  I've probably been here for 6-7 years now.  Yes portion has decreased somewhat, but it is still good..  It's almost like a mom and pop shop.  They always have some sorts of fish belly."}
{"text":"A few people had recommended this place for all you can eat sushi, so I was looking forward to it. This was the fourth all you can eat sushi place I have tried in Vegas. Honestly, I was really disappointed. The tables are almost stacked on top of each other when you are seated. I could have rubbed elbows with the table next to me. The fish was not fresh when I was there, which was a big bummer. I'm not sure why everyone is raving about the menu selection, because this place had the smallest selection of the 4 I have been to. They are quick to get the rolls out to you, but quick isn't always good. The quality definitely wasn't there. I think most people like this place because it's convenient, but outside of that you should go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The host was really unfriendly when we tried to get a table. Didn't get the phone number correctly and told us to get out of the restaurant to wait...so we went somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sushi fan.

SACRILEGE!

I'm just not.  I have this weird fear of fish, live ones, and sashimi still scares me a bit because it's a little too close to the live fish state.  It's an irrational fear and I can't explain it, but it exists.  I like a lot of rolls, but I have a problem with nori, too.  So when all my friends go to Sushi Mon for the All You Can Eat special, I totally get teriyaki chicken and shrimp and veggie tempura and it is GOOD.  I'm pretty picky about my tempura, and theirs was great.

My friends always finish amazing amounts of sushi, and they bring it out pretty quickly.  It tends to get really crowded and the tables feel a bit cramped, but that could just be your ever expanding waistline as you consume mass amounts of food.

Try it out.  It ain't bad at all."}
{"text":"First time here....it was good. My second time, oh man. The rice was hard and fell apart. Tempura was flavorless. And the fish was so bland. We were so disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in town. Even if you don't do raw, you will love it. tempura ice cream is a must!"}
{"text":"All you can eat- Yes please!

They say you have 45 min to eat all you want but I have never been kicked out but I do think I am always full by the 45 min marker.  

The fish is good and fresh. They get you in and out in a good time without being pushy. The rolls are always coming on strong there.  

They do not take reservations which can mean that you are and WILL be waiting in a long line to get in.  IF you are two people then it is easy to shimmy up to the bar.  Tables can be a wait. Do not come starving during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Ate here today with my two friends. It's a pretty small place and it's popular so there was a 45 minute wait for a table at 8ish, which is to be expected. We just wandered around while we waited. 

Once we got seated they got us drinks pretty fast and we sat at the bar so we were able to tell them right away that we were doing ayce and start ordering. 

I wasn't a fan of their cucumber salad. I think they should have it chopped differently. I also wasn't a fan of the naked mussels or tempura. 

The red snapper was delicious as was the garlic tuna. 

The wait staff was terribly unattentive. It made their 60 minute rule for ayce seem unfair. They checked on us maybe twice.

All in all it's ok but I prefer going elsewhere"}
{"text":"Soo soo good. Everything is fresh! Everything is delicious. The Service is great. the baked green mussels! To die for! Oh how I love this place. I could eat sushi here all day everyday. The all you can eat is so worth it. Maybe I'm just a fatty, but I love this place and I could eat there alll day long. YUUUUM!"}
{"text":"My sister and I have been coming to Sushi Mon for more than a year and we always leave satisfied! The servers are always super nice and coming around to take more sushi orders and refill the drinks. And I love that they offer half rolls so we can try more of the menu and not fill up on was one or two rolls. I love the garlic edamame and the ecstasy roll! I always start and finish with it! Oh and they even have a punch card! We've already gone through two!!"}
{"text":"New management in this location. No Uni and no substitute! No fried shrimp head in my miso soup! WTF! From the waiter, the new management limit the food to save costs! Sorry to see one of the best sushi places go down like this. We come here for over 15 years and always order fried shrimp head in miso soup. Now they stop doing that to save food cost, why don't they close the business to save the rent!! Time for searching a new sushi place, IMO"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in the US we have had so far!

Every time we come to Vegas we rent a car and make the trip to Sushi Mon.  We get the All-U-Can-Eat and we take full advantage of it.  Everything we had was delicious, fresh, and wonderful!

I wish I could be more specific but we had so much that we can't remember it all.  Be sure to get there early in the day to make a reservation, the AYCE availability fills up fast at night.

The sushi chefs are very nice and the wait staff is great too!  Be sure to order half orders (4 pieces) so you can try a lot of different rolls.

Remember people, you have to eat the rice too!  Don't get all you can eat and pick the fish off!  And don't complain when they tell you that you have to eat the rice.  If you don't like it then just order sashimi a la carte."}
{"text":"Nice out of the way all you can eat sushi place.  I usually eat enough nigiri to make the trip and price worth while but as a discerning certified asian, I eat muuuuch more than I can handle.  I can eat way more fish than the $25.95 all you can eat price.

Only restriction is one uni and amaebi dish per person (and one toro when they have it).  The tempura here is very well done and somehow, in the middle of a desert, the fish is quite fresh.  Definitely a place I'd go back to when I'm in town."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I always come here when we're craving sushi. It's our go to sushi place! 

The service is delightful! The waiters/waitress are very polite and quick. They filled up our glasses as needed, cleaned our dishes as often as possible. (We ordered a lot at a time for a very little table, them taking our dishes away constantly helped a lot!) 

As for the food, 11/10 highly recommend! The baked mussels here are my favorite. We always do AYCE when we come here. The sushi is never dry, it's refreshing. The sushi here is never overloaded by rice like some places. It's the right amount of rice to compliment the fish.

The experience I had here was amazing. This will always be my go to spot for sushi!"}
{"text":"What a shame? New ownership. Used to come once a week. Was very friendly relaxed atmosphere. Maybe it's changed in the last 4-5 months, but after the changeover it became very uncomfortable. Large slices of fish became thin. Included items became additional charges. I have a son, 2 years old. As a regular, I think you let people get away with things (I say this as a restaurant owner who let's my regular customers have things all the time). I have to admit, I was annoyed when they charged my son who eats two pieces of a roll and plays with a third piece. I'm not cheap and I don't mind paying for him, but we were good for at least once a week. . . Let it slide. 

Then flavors from the kitchen changed too. Take it or leave it. I bought my restaurant as an existing business as well. Your customers liked what they received. You may think you're improving something, but in reality you are changing something that people like. It was good before. Now we're regulars at sushi koma. Very happy, but miss the old crew."}
{"text":"Boy was I disappointed. Had all the run of the mill sushi that you expect an All you can eat place to have, however past the basics, there wasn't much. 

Food was decently priced.

Service was scarce at best.

Overall, the quality just seemed lacking. I love sushi and this place did not rub me the right way."}
{"text":"Still and always will be my favorite sushi place. Fresh fish, great service! I am never disappointed at SushiMon!"}
{"text":"Great place! Nice staffs! Love the screaming orgasm so much! As it was recommended by the chef when i explained what i was craving for."}
{"text":"This place has an all-you-can-eat sushi thing, but the thing is you can't share. It also says there is a time limit, but they don't care, so eat to your limit! I sometimes eat the all-you-can-eat sushi, but I also like the donkatsu which you order separately apart from the all-you-can-eat. As a finale, I always enjoy the strawberry mochi ice cream, my favorite. Don't worry for all you all-you-can-eat peeps, dessert is also all-you-can-eat!"}
{"text":"I go to Sushi Mon on Sahara several times per month. The employees are friendly and attentive (unlike their partner Goya Mon on Trop where they make you feel like you are imposing every time you order something). The food is amazing - the sushi is fresh and they offer some favorites like garlic edamame, baked mussels, and  sashimi salad on the all you can eat . I would recommend this sushi place to anyone who is looking to stuff themselves on great food."}
{"text":"Sushi mon was A-OK. We were pressed for time so we just wanted something quick, easy and that would fill us up. 

We tried 3 different rolls: 

Spider roll - (5pcs) Deep fried soft shell crab, crab meat, cucumber and avocado wrapped in soy paper with eel sauce $9.95- The soy paper was green so it looked interesting. The fried crab flavor was faint and almost tasted like shrimp tempura. I wouldn't say it's the best roll I've ever ate, it was basic and not memorable.

Volcano roll - (8pcs) California roll with yum yum sauce & scallop  $8.95 - it was smothered in yum yum mayo/eel sauce. I'm not complaining since I love that decadent stuff. 

Caterpillar roll - (8pcs) Eel and cucumber wrapped with sliced avocado & eel sauce $9.95 - one of the classics! It was good, the eel was fatty and I enjoyed it. But $10 is pretty pricy in my opinion. 

I think that they are overpriced for their presentation and what was offered to us. But businesses have to make their money somehow!"}
{"text":"This place has been here as long as I've been living in the area. It is located on Sahara just east of Durango inside a shopping complex. Had no issues parking and came at 1pm just a few hours after opening. 

After the disappointment at 808 tapas I've been craving some good sushi, especially an AYCE spot. In comes Sushi Mon, their AYCE is $21.95 and they give you 45 minutes to eat. 45 minutes may not seem like a lot but at the speed they make them in and how much you can order its more than enough time. 

I ordered some nigiri, salmon, squid, and cajun albacore along with 007 roll, JJ roll, pastel, and alaskan roll. It was all very delicious, service was super fast and very efficient. I was completely stuffed when I walked out and more than satisfied. 

Whats great about this place is if you really want to try something but don't want the 8 pieces, they let you get a half order's with 4 pieces, so you can really try a diverse selection rather than get stuffed on a few items. Remember anything you don't finish they charge you for so make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach.

Get their frequent dining card, after the 10th AYCE you get one free, whats great is if your with someone and they get the AYCE it counts as two on your card so if you go with people that don't go often get credit for their meal. All in all I enjoyed my lunch, at dinner its 3 dollars more for their AYCE and they give you 15 more minutes for a total of 1 hour."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon you dropped a  on me. Veggie tempura was fantastical! Domingo roll exxxtra exxxtra good Royal california YES! The Royal led us to the Crispy and MG! dessert perfect Lychee sorbet  thank you so much to our server George who was very attentive and made our experience extra special. Thank you to all orher staff for being so friendly and helpful. Sushi chegs you Rock! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I always love coming into this sushi spot. Ben & Tony are awesome and knowledgeable about the fish your eatting. I would say go into Sushi Mon and enjoy their great sushi. I have to say the only disappointment is they stopped free saki in certain days."}
{"text":"Sushimon is one of my favorite go to spots when I don't feel like risking a new spot. It's not the best spot I've been to but is consistent and reliable. Same with their sister property goymon."}
{"text":"pleasant surprise.  I'm usually disappointed with the all you can eat sushi places.  I've never been happy with a sushi roll that has fruit on it.  Somehow, they have one that is really quite good.  The hand rolls are very generous with a nice piece of fish and not a ton of rice.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Everytime we are out in Vegas, one meal has to be at Sushi Mon.  It's a great AYCE nigiri, side dishes, rolls, and desert selection.  The dinner includes uni, toro, and amaebi...if you love this type of nigiri sushi.  I don't know any place that have this option in the AYCE menu.  I'm usually full from the nigiri but they have a wide selection of rolls.  That's what the hubby enjoys...a variety.  We keep coming back here to Sushi Mon...the fish is fresh, good quality, and prepared well!  Kan pai to our sushi chef, Rocky, who made everything delicious and such a great environment.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"For years, this use to be our go to sushi spot and the only place to eat sushi in Vegas.  The last few visits have been disappointing and it's been downhill.  They use to have the freshest fish and best selections.  Now there's barely any special sushi (like Uni, of course they tell us mid-meal, tons of rice in the nigiri and fish doesn't seem fresh or top quality - not the place it use to be.  Not sure if we'll be back..."}
{"text":"Fish is not fresh,  sushi is salty and fried tempura ice cream-is generic and old.  Shrimp tempura is fast and cold,   Sauce is. Cold and light. Calamari loos like a fried tofu chalk, poke is tasteless.  Don't know why this place is full. Won't go back here anymore."}
{"text":"Hands down the best AYCE sushi experience anywhere.  I wish i can say i have joked about making the trek from Los Angeles out to LV just for this sushi but it has happened!  We always have to visit Sushi Mon whenever Vegas happens.  This is not cheap, poor quality, limited option, endless up-charge sushi either. It is impossible to try everything here even on multiple visits since they always have new offerings. Your options are close to 100 and include hot items like baked mussels and gyoza and desserts like mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream.  You can order half rolls too so you can try more of a variety.  I have never seen fresh scallops, sweet shrimp, uni, halibut, and sometimes toro all  on a AYCE menu.  The best part of it all is lunch is about $27 with tax/tip and dinner is just a few bucks more!  I am sure we easily would pay double since they amount of food and the quality is on par with $100 sushi experience at any of my normal spots in the South Bay.  On top of this they give you a punch card so after 10 AYCEs you get one for free!  BONUS!!! So yes it is worth the trip, the gas, and the experience!"}
{"text":"I am kicking myself for coming here! I live close and thought I would try it. The worst sushi I've had in a long time. The rice was super dry and the fish is prob grade D. They hide the worst fish in the rolls."}
{"text":"Fish was fresh and cut in decently thick (read: not paper thin) slices.  We had salmon belly, tuna, seared tuna, super white tuna, scallop, snow crab meat, unagi, amaebi, uni, and more that I don't remember (3 guys ate about 45+ orders) and there were basically no complaints.  Service was pretty fast, despite a mostly packed house.  Orgasm sauce was unique and tasty, but it kills the purity of the nigiri.  

Best AYCE sushi I've had and good enough quality for non-AYCE."}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday seems to be a popular local place for sushi ...dress pretty casual ....place kind of small think McDonald's size ...happy hour they have $4 something glasses of wine and cheap beer ...the best part is out of the all you can eat menu you can do halfs of each my favorite baked roll !!!!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi place. I went for lunch. A smaller establishment than other AYCE sushi places in vegas but still solid fish. 

They have a 45 minute time limit, but they didn't seem to enforce it since it took them about 20 minutes to get the first set of rolls out. 

The salmon belly was amazing. The sushi rice was a bit  blah and I got tired of it really fast. 

The yellowtail was also very fresh as well. 

In addition, great rolls and very different from the standard fare."}

Wait just a minute! how the hell do they manage to have so much fresh fish when they're located in the middle of desert? Better than the places back at home in CA. 

Next time your in Vegas take a little trip, about 15 minutes away from the strip, come here with a big group, order everything on the menu, 
and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I love the sushi here, they have delicious rolls. The only down side is how busy it can be. Coming here for dinner you have to expect a 30-1 hr wait at least the times I've come. Other than that my favorite place to eat Sushi with a group."}
{"text":"parking: parking in front. lots of parking. 

environment: came at 12:05 pm, a little bit after they opened, and the place was half filled. customer service is a - ok. i think they have more people coming here earlier so service slows down. they are really good with serving food. we had the ayce for 21.99, each order is 2 pieces. what has changed since the previous time i was here is that, before we got uni for lunch too. this time you have to add 5 dollars, then every person can get 2 orders. which isnt a great deal.

food: sushi is fresh, and sushi is cut nicely. sadly the food doesnt come fast enough, and leave us starving :/"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at this location at least once a month.  Today was our anniversary so we decided to go here.  This visit was awful.  Normally the service is excellent, but tonight not even close.  After our 1st serving of the all you can eat deal the waiter asked if we were ready for desert, and ask three more times before we were finished.  We were reminded that our hour was up and we could make one final order.  I have no problem with this, but it was the first time that has happened.  While I was still chewing my food the waiter who had dropped our check on our table kept checking to see if we put our card out to pay, and we said we would pay at the counter and he said they needed the table.  So before I swallowed we just got up and paid.  I am terribly disappointed and most likely will not go back.  It's sad because the food is great and I can deal with bad service, but not straight up rudeness."}
{"text":"awesome prices awesome food and they are generous with it! i can't forget to mention the great service. this is my new sushi spot! i highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This place is a great go-to for AYCE sushi AND ice cream! The service is fast and the quality of everything is pretty damned good considering how much you are paying for AYCE. 

They limit certain menu items (e.g. toro and amaebi nigiri) so beware when you order! The shooters and carpaccio items are good when you need something other than just straight up sushi. We got an order of the shrimp tempura for some fried goodness and were happy with our decision to do so. 

Don't forget about the AYCE ice cream!"}
{"text":"I...don't know why I haven't written a review for this place yet. How weird. 

This is definitely what I consider to be my gold standard when it comes to AYCE sushi. For $35 (dinner) this is definitely a bargain...especially since the quality is up there.

I hate to admit...but their rolls are pretty amazing. I'm usually not a fan of rolls but their sexy girl and ecstasy rolls were my favorites. 

Their selection of nigiri sushi is pretty good. Don't forget to look at their specials...those are usually too good to pass up! 

Did I mention I'm a fan of their tempura ice cream? Soooo good! 

And I'll be honest, service here sucks (go figure). They're slow as heck but you definitely get your money's worth (and then some) so whatevers. I'll overlook the poor service this time."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was fast and friendly. That's why the wait is soooo long during peak times though."}
{"text":"Having a sushi roll named after me is an automatic 4 stars!! 
Come on now, a Cynthia roll!?! My goodness. That NEVER happens!! =D

But besides that, I'm glad there's a sushi place located on this side of town that is opened pretty late. It's good for those late night sushi fix and you don't have to go all the way to the busy Chinatown area.

Aside for the Cynthia roll, we order a couple others and they were all delicious. Each order came with 8 pieces. 

Cannot justify giving Sushi Mon the full 5 stars because 1. it's a bit pricey if you are planning to order a la carte. I'm a  very small eater...I love trying different sushi rolls but I just CANNOT, will not get AYCE because it won't be worth the price for me. So ordering a la carte, you're looking at $10-14 per order. Also, the place is pretty small which means tables are fairly close to each other. Not a big fan of that...I really don't want the table next to me to hear my mildly-inappropriate conversations to my significant other. ;)"}
{"text":"We've been going here since 2008 and we are never disappointed. Place is clean, sushi is always fresh with great quality, staff is always nice, friendly, happy and accommodating. Sushi Mon is a tiny restaurant, sometimes a long wait on weekend dinner nights but it's worth the wait for something local. They don't take reservations either, they keep their business simple. They are not over priced, their sake menu is awesome and sushi menu is exceptional."}
{"text":"Having eaten my way through most of the AYCE sushi places in Vegas, I can say that some definitely shine bright (more creative rolls, better fish selection, etc), but Sushi-mon wins every time in overall value, consistency and freshness.

Admittedly, I have history here, so this review may be somewhat biased. I've been coming here since the advent of AYCE sushi in this town. Though I've ventured off to try other places, I somehow always find myself back here. It sort of has a \"Cheersish\" vibe for me.

The main reason I love it here is that I know I will get fresh, consistent product. I have never received anything less than that. At a lot of places in town, you may receive old or frozen fish which is very disconcerting. Sushi-mon somehow always has beautifully fresh fish. 

In addition, they are FAST! I order something (in most cases, LOTS of things) and it's on the table in 5 minutes. Sushi-mon chefs seem to get a kick out of the people who order ridiculous amounts of food, so they send it out as quick as they can. 

Speaking of the staff, they are as friendly as can be. Fransisco is my \"go-to\" server and he always takes care of us. Paul, the busser/runner, knows us well too and always keeps our drinks filled and our table clean. 

But on to the food...

As I said, we usually order our fair share of nigiri: hamachi, garlic tuna, aji, hirame, hotate with yuzu...but our favorites are the hokkigai (surf clam) and sake (salmon). I've never had surf clam as fresh and delicious as theirs. If you've tried surf clam somewhere else and hated it, try it here. Trust me.

The rolls are no joke as well. Some favorites are the Yebisu, Stacey and Hurricane roll, but I've yet to try one I didn't like. Another tip: you can get most rolls in \"hand roll\" form. I like to get yumyum scallops, california and spider rolls that way. Also, try some baked green mussels. They're creamy and briny, yet sweet and unctuous. If you're still hungry after all that, get the Frying Jason roll. It's delicious, but it'll put you over the edge. Their side dishes (miso soup, tempura shrimp, sesame chicken, calamari) are terrific as well. 

Ok. That's enough. This review is making me hungry. I'll see y'all there!
:::insert Cheers theme song here:::"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. AYCE or not, best fish in town! the fish is soo fresh! it's a bit of a wait depending on your luck.. but worth the wait and the price.

- baked green mussels
- yellowtail collar
- cajun albacore nigiri 
- super white tuna nigiri
- sexy girl roll
- moment roll

YUMM-MAYYY! trust me! 

the staff from sushi chiefs to waiters provide excellent service!"}
{"text":"Oy. I don't even know where to start. My friends have gone to the Sushi Mon over on Maryland before, and one of them got pretty ill, but she gets sick pretty easily so I didn't necessarily think it was cause to boycott all Sushi Mon locations in the state. How wrong I was. 

I was here the other night on a date (his choice), and I was immediately underwhelmed by the super small interior, fishy smell, and the fact that they said the wait was 20 min but ended up being 35. We finally got seated at the bar and opted for the AYCE, which I normally never do, but seemed like a good idea so I could order some uni and salmon belly. I was slightly skeptical about the quality of the fish, but I've eaten a lot of gross things in my day and figured it couldn't be thaaat bad. 

Well, a few pieces of sushi into the meal, a beetle comes crawling across my plate. That's right, a BEETLE. I sprang into action and crushed that sucker with my napkin, as it became incredibly clear that my date was paralyzed by bugs. Too stunned and disgusted to fully comprehend what just happened, I was in the process of looking around for a server to tell them what I saw when ANOTHER BEETLE came crawling up from under the sushi bar and onto my plate. At this point I jumped up from my seat and my date's face was white, (I was grossed out but also found this whole scenario incredibly funny, and I felt really bad for him), and as small as the place was, no other diners really seemed aware that they were eating next to bugs, and what's more alarming is that the employees barely cared!! A busser came over to take my napkins with the bugs in them that I had already killed, mumbled out an apology, and went on his way. We had to then ask for the bill so we could get out of there, but that was it, no other apology, no comping of anything, we barely ate more than 4 pieces of nigiri and they still charged us for 2 AYCE meals. Absurd. 

Bugs on Sahara, recorded illnesses on Maryland, horrible service at both. Health Inspector...where are you!?"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Been going there since 2003.  Best all you can eat sushi in town. My favorite are the baked mussels. Make sure you order what you can eat.  Sometimes Toro is on the special menu. I highly recommend it.  Also plan on waiting a little bit. This spot is hot. They have a texting system. They told me 45 minutes. I left than came back when I was texted. Sweet."}
{"text":"Good food and service.

Their sushi is pretty good but I felt that their fish wasn't as fresh as other joints that I have been to. Their AYCE selection caters to diverse palettes. My favorite picks would be the garlic tuna and bake lasagna. Another plus is that you can order as much ice cream and desserts.lol The staff is very attentive and friendly too."}
{"text":"My favorite all-you-can-eat sushi spot.  Extensive appetizer menu including baked mussels and himachi kama. Yummmm! If you like heat, try their 911 roll. Absolutely delicious!

I give it a 4, not because of the food (food is definitely 5 stars), but the service is hit or miss. I would suggest sitting at the bar. The chefs are always great. The waiters...not so much. 

Quick tip: expect a 20-30 minute wait if you go around lunch time or in between 5 and 7."}
{"text":"This sushi place is good but not great. We got there and there were no seats at the bar and only a table for 6 they said we couldn't have. Well when another group of two came we all said we would share that table and they still wouldn't give it to us. So we waited but not too long. 
The service was good as came by frequently and kept drinks full but not very friendly just there to do their job it seemed.  
The roll options are good but not great. I like spicy options but try to stay away from tempura. Not many choices without tempura and without yum yum sauce. No options without rice.  Shared the pixie and the sexy girl were good though and the chubby was the first time I tried eel and it wasn't overwhelming and it was good. We got two others I can't remember the names, maybe the sunrise was one and i didn't like the spice of the garlic sauce. 
Good but not great as there are other places in town I would rather venture further for to have more options."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I have ever eaten, but it was pretty darn good.  We went on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated.  We were going to get the all you can eat special but you only get an hour to eat and after looking at their menu, we thought it would be cheaper to go the a la carte route.  I got the screaming orgasm and calamari appetizers.  Both were tasty and I loved the screaming orgasm sauce.  My husband got the salmon teriyaki, which was not the best, but not bad either.  I got the chicken teriyaki and was pretty good, not the best.  But, for food value, this place rocks.  Our entrees came with miso soup, small salad, tempura, and a small california roll!! Our bill ended up being just at $40, not too shabby if you ask me.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Plum wine is great, the service is awesome. It is a great price point. I can't complain about one thing. I always get the chicken teriyaki bowl, its soo good. Everyone who visits me here, from out of town. I take them there and they love it. We go to the one by South Maryland Parkway."}
{"text":"Amazing ! I go here all the time. The servers are great. The decor isn't the best, but who cares because the sushi is amazing. The workers are awesome. They are very accommodating to my meal modifications since I eat a little on the healthy side. The sushi is also so so inexpensive. My friends flew in from Michigan to visit me. Instead of taking them anywhere on the strip I took them here ! Its honestly such a great place."}
{"text":"MY all time favorite all you can eat sushi spot since I've moved to vegas!

I mean its always busy! It's open till 2am so its usually crackalackin!  Through the years I've noticed they have gotten faster with bringing out the food.  

A very famous spot amongst local hawaii peeps! People visiting from Hawaii come here.  We bring our friends here!

I have too many favorite rolls to list.  

Just get there with enough time to wait for a table = 0)"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is perfect for a sushi wuss like me who doesn't like to get too wild and crazy. There is a ton of variety but I like to stick to my core rolls and with All You Can Eat being $25 bucks you can get a lot.

The weekends are super busy but here's my little trick. Run over to the PT's bar across the parking lot and just call in your reservation. By the time they call your phone you'll be 2-3 beers deep and ready to put some spicy tuna inside you.

Oh and ask for the Hulk Roll, it's crazy good. Don't ask for the Shewchuk Roll... they might boot you out of there."}
{"text":"Me and my family eat here very often. I can say that we've filled out those AYCE cards several times over. I always get the seaweed salad as a starter because of how fresh it tastes, and then basically any bit of sushi, nigiri, and side that they offer on the AYCE menu. I then finish off with one of their desserts such as the mochi ice cream, green tea ice cream, or litchi ice cream. Sometimes they are out of the strawberry mochi (which is my favorite) but I'm fine with getting their other flavors when that happens. While this place is kind of small, it is around the corner from my house so it is the one we always go to. I don't feel like the wait time for food is that bad; if you order several sushi dishes at once they bring the next out just as you finish off the last dish. Go as a group and all get the AYCE so you can share. Lastly, if you order an nigiri, don't forget to request their fresh wasabi to go with it!"}
{"text":"I vote the next location opens in the San Gabriel Valley, California! It's painful to have to wait until a Vegas trip to fill my belly with this delicious fish (and mochi ice cream)!

The cuts of fish were above what is typical for an AYCE sushi gig. The scallop nigiri was fresh and tasty. The cut of fish simply named \"white fish\" was really good, too. I could eat unagi anything all day long. 

They have many rolls to experience as well. My personal favorite was the spider roll which was huge, and had the best combo of ingredients and sauces. I like that you can order half orders of rolls, so that you can try a greater variety. 

The desserts were wonderful, too! The vanilla and strawberry mochi ice cream balls were the best. The tempura ice cream ball was next best, and the green tea (wasabi-looking) ice cream came in at a close third place.

The best part about this place is all of the choices! You get to try such a variety of great-tasting different things, and even experiment with things you've never had the opportunity to try before. 

An entertainment aspect of Sushi Mon is they have some pretty awesome names for their rolls... We had many \"that's what she said\" comments with their creative names, especially the famed \"Monster Roll\". I also can't wait to try multiples of the Orgasm Roll next time! Should be a real treat! ;)"}
{"text":"Place is not what it use to be. Wait time is very long for mediocre sushi. I would only go for the tempura ice cream. Quality in sushi has declined."}
{"text":"If you're going to hit up a Sushi Mon, go to the one in Henderson. I'm pretty sure this location is where they send their old fish and slow sushi chefs. I swear, I am sitting here watching this guy move as if he's underwater. Maybe he's pretending he is a fish - maybe it helps him connect to his job on a spiritual level - maybe he just took a little too much NyQuil for that pesky cold he can't kick -  I don't know. All I know is that I'm hungry and when you're sat by the bathroom you get a lot of poo smell. Double fail."}
{"text":"Sushi is awesome and delicious, however, seating is extremely limited. I would recommend ordering for pick up because it is always busy!!"}
{"text":"We spent 22 dollars a person for AYCE lunch and an additional $1.75 for soft drinks. Our waiter was very understanding of my husband's shellfish allergies and even jotted down a list of safe rolls for us to enjoy. We got about 8 different half rolls, including our new favorite ecstacy. We will be back for lunch again, or maybe just to try stuff ala cart."}
{"text":"This place is NOT kid friendly, they state clearly at the table that you can't share food with your child and I'm sorry but my 3 year old is not going to eat enough that they should be worried. Additionally they charged is 3$ for our infant whom we know is really going to just slobber on some rice."}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that this was a sushi spot open late at night, it was just okay to me. None of our group was hungry enough for the AYCE sushi, but we got a few nibbles at 1am. 

The nigiri itself was very good, as were the rolls we ordered. The Japanese style diced beef steak was very dry, which was disappointing because I had high hopes for it.

Other than that, nothing really stood out to me, but I'll definitely give it another shot when we're in town."}
{"text":"Always a good choice to come here! Drove 598 miles from Sacramento to eat here tonight! Autyte!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I didn't get the all you can eat. We just ordered 2 specialty rolls and 3 basic. The reason for the 2 star is bc the quality of the yellow tail for the yellow tail rolls were not good. It made me never want yellow tail again. The color was off and also I have never had to pull a bone out of my mouth from eating a roll until today.... a pretty large one at that. Today's experience made me not want sushi for a long time."}
{"text":"Fantastic!

Way away from the strip on Sahara. Seems mostly attended by locals.
Very small, can get hard to get in sometimes.
Fantastic selection of sushi to choose from, all are very fresh and well prepared.
GREAT staff. very friendly"}
{"text":"Wait this isn't right, this is not the sushi-mon i know.
Ok so this is my first time at this particular sushi-mon location and I'm here with my sister & my dad and not in the best of moods but I'm hoping some all u can eat sushi will help fix this melancholy.

I must say compared to Sushi-mon on Marland Prky there is a completely different atmosphere. it looks nice and the place is larger but it is not the atmosphere I'm use to.  There are still chicks with pink panties hangin out of their low rise jeans but the menu and clientele are different. And there is no mochi or tempura ice cream! They do have plum ice cream but it is not a replacement for mochi and tempura ice cream however. I didn't have any edamame but my sister reports the edamame wasn't good and from the look of it I wouldn't try any either. Looks like it was left out to dry.
And I don't know if it's because of my bad mood but the sushi was not up to snuff. Even the seaweed salad was bleh.
At least I didn't have to wait long when i got here at 615p. 
Uh the service was good and I did enjoy my miso soup. 
I am going to have to come back and give them a second chance since I do have a free all you can eat card filled up. However, I must say this is the first time I decided not to stuff myself with more sushi and just leave feeling content with the amount I had eaten."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon has a special place in my heart. When I came to Vegas in 2005 I had never had sushi before and thus is the place I went to try it. Funny enough, it is also the first place my wife ate sushi, and back then, we didn't even know each other. Anyway, to me, this is one of my favorite places. I always get along with the chefs, they are very fast, the rolls are good, and the fish is fresh. What more could I ask? The price is pretty standard for an AYCE. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"If you want a place with great customer service, this is not it! Usually one of my favorite places to go because a few of the chefs and servers are really friendly and it is close to my house. I have recently changed my schedule and have to go later in the evening which means longer waits to get a table. Along with this comes bad service. As it gets later the better chefs here get off and they have a bunch of new people that are not as friendly or good behind the bar. They also recently changed managers and promoted a server to that position, which is not a good change. What irritates me in particular is one waitress who usually takes over service of the sushi bar when she comes in and she would rather talk to coworkers and hide in the back then actually take care of customers. I have been a loyal customer for years and the food is always good but the service here is getting to the point where I am starting to look for another ayce sushi joint. So if you want great service this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"My friend's daughter became sick from the fish there.  When they tried to reach out to sushi mon about it, they ignored their calls and communication attempts.  Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Ok.. this place is OK.. the fish is good and the options of rolls is good but after about 10 visits I have to say the service is consistently hit and miss and just like most other local AYCE spots the rice is overwhelming in the portions. Not bad all around though"}
{"text":"Really? 4.5 stars and 90 reviews. Are you kidding me? Maybe it's a teeny notch up from Todai back in them days. This is exactly like the all-you-can-eat quality. If you are into sushi for the good quality of fish, rice, and presentation...this isn't the place. The rice is hard and fell apart when picking up the nigiri and the ahi poki came out in 2 seconds meaning it was pre-made sitting around. This was a bad choice and I'm sorry I messed up a lunch for my brother and mom who were out of town guests. Next time, we're going back to En Sushi. We can't go wrong there and they have great, friendly service!"}
{"text":"For an all-you-can eat sushi bar, this place is really good. But otherwise it's just eh. Not the place to go if you are looking for a high-end sushi restaurant.  They do have a very interesting selection of rolls they have created, so if you like an all-you-can-eat place with a lot of unusual options for rolls then this is a decent choice.  Very casual, no reservations and a long wait to be seated during busy hours."}
{"text":"For the price best all \"you can eat\" Ive had in vegas. All the nagiri sushi was very fresh with large slabs of fish, rather than just a big clump of rice to get you full. The only down fall was that the cucumber salad was a little off and there was a bit of a wait. But definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good here, but I hate the wait.
It's a small place so there will always be a wait...even during off peak hours.
The ambiance here is very plain and nothing fancy.

The size of their sushi is small here. But I liked this b/c then you can order more variety. 
The rice was nicely done as well.
The rice/fish ratio is perfect.
AYCE price is the same as all others around Vegas.

My whole family loved the seaweed salad to start.
All the sushi is good, I especially liked the halibut.
And I loved their red bean ice cream.

The cupcake place next door is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Another 3.5 star restaurant.
Honestly compared to other ayce sushi restaurant in vegas I've been to, it's at least better than that one. However ridiculous amount of rice! They pressed rice really hard so it wasn't really tasty. Good thing was they let you get one order of uni (sea urchin) and amaebi (sweet shrimp) Their takoyaki was MEH. I've had much better takoyaki at other places! (But I guess maybe it's because this restaurant is ran by Korean people :P) Also you can get an ice cream for dessert! (I don't think they limit # of dessert you can get but not 100% sure about it) I tried lychee sorbet which felt like yogurt ice cream to me rather than sorbet. :/ 
Might visit again."}
{"text":"All we wanted was to have a beer while waiting for our party of 8 to show, one seat open at the bar, but there were two of us. So they said we had to wait outside. They don't have a liquor license for their patio. The guy at the counter was so rude, he could Cate less about us. Skip this place if you want to hang out and drink! They're too cheap to buy a liquor license for their patio, and you always have a 1/2 hour wait! Yes the Sushi is good, but there's are other places you can go with just as good Sushi, and happy employees & managers! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Never ever make the mistake of going here. I eat tons of sushi and this is the absolute worst ever. Even the server agreed. BUT they have a really good green tea Creme brûlée and chocolate mouse which is more like a ganache. The interior is dirty and non descript. Overall bad. Sorry. I really wanted it to be good as its owned by Monta Ramen which is soooo good."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!! Staff is very friendly.   Fast service!!!  The buffet is worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is typical. Nothing really too good. It's realistically good enough for the amount you are paying. The waitress though made a comment when we ordered a lot from the \"all you can eat\" menu.  One other note -- not very clean!!"}
{"text":"I  love this place!!! have not been able to try a  lot of sushi, you go, you order you get big rolls you eat it then too full to try something else. My daughter eats here a lot and talked me into going omitting the part that there will be a wait, I do not wait  well. But this place is well worth the wait (which by the way was only 20 min on a Friday at 630) At Sushi-Mon all you can eat, you can order two or 4 or 8 of anything and everything.  I tried things I have never tried before, you see it and if it looks good to you  try it, if you like it you order more what a great concept.  Not to mention everything is delicious!!! Right down to the desserts, again order them all if you want.  The staff is very  friendly and helpful, it is a dinning EXPERIENC I cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi that delivers! 

This was about a 15min drive from the strip. It is well worth it. I came here because one of my friends said he always eats here whenever he comes to LV. The fish here was really fresh and soft. The salmon and albacore were like butter soft! They had a lot of rolls that were fun and I loved the spicy mayo in some of the rolls. They also let you order half rolls so If you didn't like it you' wouldn't have to down 8-10 pieces. The only thing that I didn't like was that the rice was a little hard. Other than that this was an amazing all you can eat sushi dinner. The sushi here for me was great and all you can eat made it even better. I recommend this for people who can eat endlessly!

Recommendation: Salmon nigiri, any roll with cream cheese and spicy mayo, green tea ice cream"}
{"text":"The sushi cooks are super friendly and the food is great! Kiran, crispy rice roll, frying Jason and teriyaki chicken are amazing!"}
{"text":"I think you have to come here and get the AYCE. It is costly, but stick with the nigiri (NIGIRI LOVERS) to be satisfied with the cost. The tuna, yellowtail, and salmon are the greatest in terms of quality. I believe the mackerel is pretty good for a sushi place (mackerel is usually oily and has a fishy scent). Also, their octopus and seared tuna is DELICIOUS! Do not start ordering rolls and appetizers. Try to stick it out with the nigiri.

The appetizers are decent, but you can get better at Sushi Bay located in Henderson.

The rolls are filled with different flavors and sauces (I try to avoid this at sushi restaurants)."}
{"text":"Fred our original server, his service was just awful. I noticed he would give our order to another table and make us wait so long. However Jefferey, was the savior, he actual helped us with our orders. I'm sorry to say that Sushimon is a sushi place I don't feel comfortable going back to. If they hire more people like Jefferey, the customer service would be so much better."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and I love that they'll do half rolls for AYCE. Excited to find a great sushi place near my house and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place has pretty crappy quality ACE sushi. The service sucks and slow. The younger japanese waiter is rude and hell when taking your orders (HE WANTS YOU TO NAME THE ORDERS INSTEAD OF USING THE NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM). I honestly wish I never tried this place and took the DIRTY CIG BUTT FILLED outside waiting area as a give away this place is trash (SEE PICS)z"}
{"text":"Excellent well-crafted sushi, me and my girlfriend ordered all you can eat and had our fill of an amazing variety of delicious choices, customer service was fantastic and will define you be back"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of sushi, or seafood in general, but my husband and friends love it, so I tag along. However, the rolls here are just really good, and usually fresh. I really like their Veggie roll. Of course, some chefs make it better than others, but it's still good. I also like the spicy tuna rolls quite a bit. The service is usually good. But, sometimes with different people coming to check on you & getting you refills, it can be lacking. Still, better service than most AYCE sushi places.

The only bad thing is the crowds. There are often very long waits, and sometimes the company isn't too great either. Last time we got stuck to a group of people older than me (I'm 26) talking about how drunk they were and yelling \"penis.\" Not the restaurants fault of course."}
{"text":"This is my number one AYCE sushi choice. I've been going to Sushimon ever since they opened up. I cant speak for their regular item since I always eat the AYCE. Love the freshness and variety of rolls."}
{"text":"OK, just avoid the toro, it was rough and had no flavor..it tasted a little like rubber.

BUT....and that's a big but, but, everything else was epic! This is one of the places that lives up to its hype; most all the fish was fresh and tasty! We came in a group of nine....a hungry nine after a long hike from Utah...that's like having 9 honey badgers come up to your mound if you're a cobra! 

They give you the option of paying the dinner price for additional items during lunch time, so we took advantage of that. It was about 30 bucks, typical AYCE price. 

Service was excellent. The girls waiting on us never tired out and they did an excellent job, alongside the kitchen, with keeping everything consistent. 

My recommendations is to try out as much as you can. 

Can't really point out anything that stood out more than the other; but they were generous! 

Ice cream included; definitely try out the red bean ice cream. OH YEAAAA"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is the sister restaurant to Goyemon, which is one of my favorites, so Sushi Mon is definitely a 5-star in my books as well!

Sushi Mon is on the West side of town, and my family and I love this place. We used to go about once a month to this location when we weren't going to Goyemon across town. We would go for either lunch ($21.95/person) or dinner ($26.95/dinner). Since the menus are essentially the same between the two, I want to call out a lot of the same reasons why we love Sushi Mon. 

Firstly, there are some advantages to going for dinner - 1) they serve salmon belly nigiri, which is way better than getting regular salmon nigiri and 2) you can get 1 order of uni (sea urchin) and 1 order of amaebi (sweet shrimp). Other than these two things, you can pretty much order everything else, including the AYCE dessert, during lunch. The major differences between Sushi Mon and Goyemon is that Goyemon has grilled fish items for dinner, as well as ramen after 11pm, so if you want those items, check out Goyemon instead.

Anyway, our typical order when we go for dinner at Sushi Mon includes the following items: 
1) nigiri - salmon belly, hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), super white tuna, uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp), snow crab meat, unagi (fresh water eel), and ikura (salmon roe)
2) rolls - Sexy Girl, Hurricane, Sushi Mon Style Lasagna
3) side dishes - steamed gyoza, yakitori, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sashimi salad, miso soup, baked green mussels, udon
4) dessert - lychee sorbet, green ice cream, strawberry mochi, green tea creme brûlée

Just like Goyemon - this is one of the easiest 5-star ratings I can give on Yelp. The only complaint I have about Sushi Mon is that the wait can be long as well, although we've noticed that the wait isn't as long as Goyemon. The restaurant is not all that big, and if you have a group bigger than 4, it can take about an hour to get seated. 

If you ever go to Las Vegas (and you are still reading this review), promise me you'll go to Sushi Mon or its sister restaurant, Goyemon. Ok? Cool, thanks!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently found ourselves in Las Vegas late one night and we were hungry. I asked our Valet for a good sushi place close to our hotel that was also all you can eat, and after some thought they called for a stout guy also working the valet who is supposedly their go to guy for sushi joints. Once I started talking to this guy i knew we were cut from the same cloth, so we looked up Sushi Mon and headed out. We found Sushi Mon quickly, it was only a few miles south east of the strip in a nice sized mini-mall. The wait was about 30 minutes for dinnertime on a Friday night, and it wasn't long before we got our seat at the bar. We immediately ordered and soon after the sushi rolls started (pardon the pun) rolling in. O.K I am not gonna describe each and every roll, since we ended up having a lot but here are my highlights. The menu and specials boards had quite a lot of choices, I went for the slightly different examples for myself while my wife started with sashimi. Most my rolls were good, especially the ones with the orgasm sauce on it. It was so good we ended up getting a couple sides of the sauce which seemed like mayo and ponzu with a couple secret ingredients to boot. The sashimi was a whole different story, the tuna and tuna belly both had a very nasty metallic taste that worried us so much we refused to eat it the rest of the night. We also ordered a couple real crab rolls that came to us 90% frozen (crabsicle) I also ordered the takoyaki which was o.k and the udon soup which also was just o.k. I guess it is hard to keep everything at a high level when doing such a high volume at an all you can eat place, so next time we are just sticking to the rolls. Service was pretty good on a busy night, prices were fair and food was o.k as long as we stuck with rolls and appetizers, Aloha"}
{"text":"This sushi house is awesome! The food is amazing. I have been to a lot of sushi restaurants and by far Sushi Mon is one of my favorite sushi house, their fish is fresh and they make it perfect! Except for the salmon skin, they somehow failed on that one, it tastes burnt and served sloppy. The restaurant is small, wish they would expand the dining a little bigger. Other than that, no real major complaints. Definitely recommended to sushi house goers."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying as a dedicated sushi lover this place is amazing! I try to go here at least once every 2 weeks, and it is by far the best bite for your buck! The all you can eat is definitely where its at at only $30 per person, and endless possibilities. I have been here over 10 times now and still finding things that I have not tried yet. The sushi chefs really take their time with each persons order and are always attentive to what/when you are ready to order next. I strongly recommend the New York Girl in Vegas roll and the squid AWESOME!!!!! Its like an orgasm in your mouth I promise! I would gladly drive out of my way to get to this favored spot over any other closer possibilities! Please just keep one thing in mind tip the chefs they are great at doing what they do and very dedicated, they deserve it!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review a while back hailing how they had great lunch specials here. Alas, they switched sushi chefs again and the hand rolls have gone from hefty to mini. Sad."}
{"text":"tldr

Some people swear that this place has some of the best sushi but I came in for the lunch specials.
There's an entire section of lunch priced foods that are under $10 and comes with salad and miso soup.
And they serve you orange cubes post meal.
Tough not to go with the AYCE option but this actually filled me up.

Get:
- beef lunch special (teriyaki beef, 4 pieces California roll, miso soup, house salad, scoop of rice)"}
{"text":"Fish is fresh and has great color,  The service is good the restaurant is always packed.  Everytime we have gone we have to wait 20-30 mins till we get a table.  

All you can eat with a stamp card.  10 visits and the nexty time is on them.  I am down.  Every time i have sushi i start out with 10 orders of Super White and 5 garlic tuna then i tell the sushi master to keep it coming and let him choose.  Always a good time with a shot!!!  Kanpai!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the other reviewers are right when they say there is a long wait around peak hours such as dinner time, which is expected. All you can eat sushi at good places normally have a wait. 

The quality of the fish:
I'd have to say this place can be a hit or miss. I've been here numerous times and I've maybe had one or two times where I've felt that the quality was a little sub par, but to say that 80% of the time it tastes really fresh is a good sign for an AYCE sushi place.

The service: 
90% of the time, great service! I usually sit at the bar and the chefs are very attentive and fun! They Get your rolls out at a fast pace and if they have time, they usually converse with their bar guests! 

TIP: The only thing that may confuse people is that when sitting at the bar, know that all appetizers & desserts or drinks are ordered with the servers and all the rolls, nigiri, and any sushi are ordered through the sushi chef at the bar! :)"}
{"text":"I am only reviewing the Sahara Ave. Sushimon. As far as I'm concerned, this is the only Sushimon to check out. The sushi quality and variety of food is great especially for an AYCE joint. It's an awesome deal especially if you love nigiri like I do. I always get the salmon, garlic tuna and cajun albacore. AYCE includes their hot and cold green tea and desserts too. So save room for some red bean ice cream or mochi.

The staff's great! Friendly and usually on top of things. They have a great system where all waitstaff attends to all tables. Basically, everyone waits on you and you get your food quickly."}
{"text":"1 star because you can't put less but I will say service is pretty good..
Halibut and Snapper had texture of octopus..
Albacore sushi had texture of shredded tuna tasted like fish bait nearly rotten had to slam some sake down to get it down. Should have left then but I got one more roll with yellowfin tuna (maguro) because my first roll with spicy tuna wasn't terrible this also had. Terrible muscle texture obviously they don't know how to cut fish.. all the fish was served on warm-hot temp. Rice - terrible! Your fish is being cooked by the rice it was hot enough.. 
By far worst sushi in vegas I've had yet other than grocery store sushi.. go to blue fin or Osaka or really anywhere else.. 
My favorite thing about sushi Mon is that it is PACKED!!! Such a shame we live amongst so many Mammalukes.."}
{"text":"The baked rolls here were really filling and the prices were reasonable. I think some of the tastes/flavors can get really repetitive for people (with the mayo and the \"special sauces\" places tend to have), but I still enjoyed it. They are very explicit about the rules and expectations of their buffet option, so I wouldn't try to do anything shady if I were you. The servers are very attentive and can pretty much spot anything going on. I liked how they asked early in the meal how we'd like the check split (since most places in SF don't want you splitting the check at all or limit how you split it). While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I had the Green Tea Dream Smoothie, it was really good, but it could have used a more smoother consistency. One of the best things about this place is that when we were done with our meal, we could conveniently walk over to Nothing Bundt Cakes and pick up dessert."}
{"text":"smells weird inside, but the sushi was good. Very quick for togo orders, wish they had delievery though."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. The best AYCE sushi place I have been to anywhere! (Now if only J-town has aYCE sushi) A bit of a drive from the Strip, but very very worth it. 

Our seat at the bar placed us right in front of our sushi chef, who made our orders fresh right when we ordered it. All the nigiri we ordered tasted great -- especially the seared ahi tuna and the super white tuna. The cut rolls were delicious, especially for an AYCE place. We also tackled the Sushi Monster Roll -- a roll cut into 5 pieces, which is the size of your palm. It takes a while to make so order that first over the nigiri rolls and other rolls so that you aren't waiting a while for it. However, one thing we didn't realize was that everything under the 5-piece roll section are just as big as the Sushi Monster Roll. We ordered the spider roll and that was super huge too! 

The AYCE menu also includes side orders, such as edamame and gyoza, as well as dessert. After all the sushi, I ended my meal with a bowl of creamy green tea ice cream (they also have tempura ice cream, but that would've been too much after all the food I ate). Great food, great price, great place! Sushi-mon is on my list of places to go every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My brother in law and I stopped here for dinner after overshooting our turn for another sushi place. Walking in the door, nice ambiance. Sat at the bar and ordered the all you can eat in which the customer is timed at 45 mins to eat. Dinner started off bad because I ordered a roll and the sushi chef drowned it in a sweet sauce. And when I say drowned, the bottom of the plate showed no white. I told the sushi guy that I didn't want the roll because he drowned it in sweet sauce. He accused me putting too much soy sauce. Really!? My meal was ruined, I ate the most basic califorrnia and philly rolls, had my plum icecream and peaced the place out. Truly, truly disappointed. Not to mention, the fish was not well kept."}
{"text":"On a last minute late night sushi adventure, my husband and I decided to try Sushi Mon. We've tried to come here a few months ago, but it was a 45min wait so we passed.

It was crowded at 11:00PM, we took that as a good sign. We were sat right away since most of their tables were finishing up. 

We opted for the AYCE option, at about $25/PP that's a decent price for us. We started with some nigiri and apps- -  I always order ikura (salmon roe) and my husband orders amaebi (sweet shrimp). The waiter mistakenly brought me over an order of  ika (squid). Honest mistake because I do have a Jersey accent and both words sound the same. I tried it  since it was AYCE, but really didn't like it. It was really tough like old bubble gum. The ikura came out after a few minutes, and it was good, not great though. it was very briny and almost too fishy. My husband said the sweet shrimp was very tasty. The salmon, garlic tuna and green mussels were good. All cut extra thin, but we expect that from local AYCE spots. 

We both tried their Spicy yellowtail handroll, it was really spicy and delicious. Not too much rice and the fish was rolled to the very bottom of the handroll. 

The hurricane roll (Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado topped with salmon tempura, smelt eggs & green onion drizzled with eel sauce spicy yum yum sauce & mayonnaise) was icky. It was drowning in mayo. I didn't see that at first, so my first bite was brutal. It's $13.45 on their regular menu. That's not $13 quality. The mayo to roll ratio was overwhelming. I scrapped it all off, while the waiter watched. It was the worst part of dinner. And to think-- that's one of their \"special rolls'. yikes. 

The Orion roll (Spicy tuna and cucumber wrapped with cajun albacore drizzled with garlic sauce) pretty good, not overly impressed though. The cajun seasoning was barely there and the albacore was paper thin. 


The Tempura icecream had soggy/raw tempura around it, It wasn't cooked long enough so that resulted in a sloppy and unappetizing mess. 

With sake and two AYCE the bill came out to $80. The price is good but I'm not sure if we will return. Although some was good, there are too many restaurants that exceed our expectations here in Vegas. There's no reason to settle for sub par food. I think a 3 star rating from me is fair."}
{"text":"Came in here with friends and by far the best all you can eat sushi restaurant I've ever been too. The selection is vast and the quality of each item is top notch. This is how sushi is suppose to be done right."}
{"text":"We normally go to Sushi Goyemon but decided to give this sister company a try. It was a night and day difference. The food was okay but nothing spectacular. The service was a big dissappointment our server didn't bother to check on us or even just to refill our drinks. 
Hope they can improve but I can always take my business somewhere better."}
{"text":"Love this sushi joint. AYCE for $26 really worth it with the fact the food is so fresh. I personally love their tako (octopus) roll. So yummy. Service was quick. Prepare to wait if it's busy but they do have seats outdoor while you wait for your table. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I returned often and the quality is a little lower than before. A little less fish on the sushi for example. Still rally good and has interesting specials nigiris and side dishes included in the ayce."}
{"text":"Great place to have AYCE sushi on the south side of town. 
The place has a friendly atmosphere and food here is fresh and good quality. 

Service can use a little help, but overall, the experience was good."}
{"text":"Fresh food and great service. I love love love this place! 
I have never had a bad experience at this Sushi Mon. The staff is kind and welcoming. 
The menu is off the chain! Even if you don't like sushi, you can enjoy the hell out of this place. Even the all-you-can-eat menu is worth it for non-sushi eaters!!
Price is just above an average going-out meal (based on what you buy) but it is all completely worth it!
My favorite roll is the lemon roll & I always \"splurge\" for some green tea icecream at the end of my meal (seriously, it's like $2). 
I'll always enjoy lunch or dinner here with any picky or non picky eater!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! Service is the top worst soon as you walk in to when your seated. To top it off the have a sewage fish smell that no one knows where it came from. It s horendous!"}
{"text":"Hi, what's going on over there? So many new servers, so much turnover. If we have one hour for AYCE, the servers need to come refill our water and drinks without being asked each time. I ate half my meal recently sitting next to dirty dishes left in an empty spot. I noticed the special Creme Brûlée is no longer served, just Mochi Ice Cream and Ice Cream. Still nice, but did you lose a vendor or are you cutting corners. No more Blue Fin, so sad. We used to eat there every Sunday. When there is high staff turnover and a need for training can you leave a manager or someone who can run the crew and maintain consistency? It's like a free for all over there now. Hope someone replies to this review just to explain. We were very loyal customers and really recommended SushiMon highly. Right now it seems most front end hosts and servers are very very disorganized or left untrained. I would appreciate a reply here. Too bad Arpi doesn't work on Sundays or another manager. Things are definitely slipping and we come for Tomo but could eat at Osaka or Hiro Sushi instead"}
{"text":"This has now become my go to sushi place. EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!  Very accommodating and friendly staff.  The AYCE is worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good, I ordered the Teriyaki Beef lunch special. The situation started when I finish my meal and decided to eat the 1/2 orange (dessert). The taste was not sweet and rather bitter, then I realized the orange was rotten on the bottom, and you can clearly can see it from the outside only when you turn it around. Well, this can happen to any restaurant. I guess the reaction of the waiter was more disappointing than the rotten orange, once I show him my plate he never offer to replace the orange, simply reply with \"I'm sorry about the orange\" I was not looking for a free meal, I only expected the waiter to care a bit more and asked me if he can replace it. Well... I was charged full price; but they got $0 tip well deserved.

Suggestion to the restaurant:
If you fell most people don't eat the 1/2 orange at the end of their meal, simply add a plastic one just for looks.

Train your employees to \"show\" appreciation for your customers no matter if they don't order your \"All You can Eat\""}
{"text":"So tasty. Love the ayce deal.  Fresh and great service. A staple on the west side for sushi."}
{"text":"I love it good sushi, but the place is way to small....if you arrive after 6pm good luck finding a place to sit."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon on Eastern used to be my favorite place when I first moved to Vegas a few years ago, but I never had the opportunity to try the one on Sahara. For what it was, it was OK. The AYCE sushi is good but nothing to rave about. The interior decor is decent and the staff is friendly.

The fish are relatively fresh and the overall meal was enjoyable. We had rounds of the shrimp, sweet shrimp, yellowtail and tuna that I was content with. The Dragon Roll was also nicely made, not too saucy and a lot of eel, just the way I like it. It takes a while for the orders to roll out if you aren't sitting at the bar, but that's like every sushi place. For the side of town that it is on, I think it is a good destination. It's relatively close to the CSN Charleston campus so it might be ideal for students."}
{"text":"This ain't no \"Todai - leave - all - the - seafood - out - all - dai - everydai - since yesTodai\" Seafood Buffet. 

How or why I took so long to remember to Yelp this place is beyond me. This is our \"Go-To\" restaurant everytime we're in Vegas visiting my parents. If you've eaten here, you know why, if you haven't...well let me tell you... 

THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANTS YOU'LL EVER GO TO IN YOUR LIFE. 

- First of all, the fish is flown in FRESH, from the west coast, the Gulf and sometimes Hawaii, daily. 
- They don't 'skimp' on their portions. (If it's too much, you can place 1/2 an order upon request) 
- For $26.00 / person, you'll definitely get your money's worth! (If you know how to order)
- You can also order from the kitchen menu (hot items) You're not limited to ONLY sushi. 
- It also helps if you haven't eaten much (or at all) all day. But try not to \"over order\" since you must finish what you order. 
- You can share within your party, as long as whoever you share with ordered the buffet as well. 

Some of my \"Sushi Mon favorites\" are the Garlic Tuna (nigiri), the Sushi Monster (huge) & the Toro (1 order / person). Other than those, I'll order the usual: Hamachi roll, Tekka maki, 9-1-1 roll, Rainbow roll...etc... 

Can't forget dessert either, oh yeah it's included...I usually go for the Tempura Ice cream...make that 2 orders... 

Like I said, if you know what / how to order, you'll definitely get your money's worth... But hold on...there are some drawbacks.

- Wait time can be horrendous!!! Show up as soon as they open, preferably with a party smaller than 6.
- You have to finish what you order. They're really anal about you eating the rice that goes along with the fish.
- I think they're only open for dinner now (5pm - 2am) They still might serve lunch at the Sahara location.

Either way, I'll stick to my guns and name this place the best sushi spot I know of...and being born and raised on an island, I know my fresh fish."}
{"text":"Good food. Good price. Good service. Too packed at some times and servers may get a little busy. Overall, good place to grab sushi on any day."}
{"text":"Moved from Vegas 4 years ago to Orange county and still have not found anywhere even close. I literally take their roll menu with me and point to the Sushi Chef to make a roll off their menu, and it's not even close. I can't wait to go there everytime I am in Vegas. Love the 1/2 rolls on EVERY type of roll. Wait staff reviews by others were kind of a raw deal. The wait staff is attentive, most places purposefully leave you alone so you won't stay so long for AYCE sushi. Love my Sushi Mon....."}
{"text":"This place is da bombz.. Recommend by my friends.. The fish is very very fresh.. You can't go wrong with AYCE.  Well worth the price for a buffet.  The service is excellent and the chefs are nice to you.  I lost count on my dishes but I was stuffed.  Once your done, order a plum ice cream.. OH yum!!!   If your in Vegas.. this is the place to go.  

Awesome!!"}

I loved the excellent service and attention to both Detail and special roll requests.. I love this place period!!! The sushi is always fresh and top notch!! Those 3 chefs keep me coming back for their awesome creations!!! Get the all you can eat cause its   Fantastic and made fresh right in front of you"}
{"text":"Open late and all you can eat sushi at reasonable prices!

I religiously went here in 2003 when my boyfriend lived in Vegas. We went so much the cooks new us. We loved the sashimi and special rolls!

Went back 2007, food quality wasn't the same and service went down a notch.

The wait for a table was the same, it's a small place so be prepared to wait.

Disappointed, as we were excited to eat here after so many years. 

3.5 stars....not the same, but would go back."}
{"text":"Can't even believe the management here! We had an incident here where the server dropped the tray of ice cold water on my 11 month old son. The tray, the cup, and the water on his head. He was soaked from head to toe and in tears. Now, I know accidents happen but first of all it could have been prevented by not holding a tray over a baby's head. Second, when something like this happens, I would have thought the manager would have come over to make sure my son was ok... Nope all we got was a sorry from the waiter and then he started to clean the water up. So I went back to the restrooms which were both taken at the time, waited there for a minute and just decided to take my son out to the car to change him and calm him down... Once again waiting for the manager to come up to us. So by the time I got to the car I was just livid. All I wanted to do was leave. I knew if I had stayed I would have ripped someone a new one. 

On the way home I called the manager and spoke to him. He was no help what so ever and was claiming that the reason he didn't walk up to us was because \"we were in the bathroom\"... Which we weren't... And \"we walked outside\"... Which he still could have came to check on us and make sure my sone was ok. Excuses excuses! One he started to talk over me and would listen to what I was saying, I hung up. 

Needless to say I will never come back and neither will my family and friends."}
{"text":"The fish quality is still spot on but the service has been lacking recently. We have to ask more than once for our sides and don't get refills on beverages. The sushi bar gets weirdly vacant and the chefs disappear. I'm sad to say we may have to actually venture out and check out some other options for our next sushi date."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly a sushi expert, so if you're reading this to figure out if the sushi is as good as _______, then you're reading the wrong review. However, I've been here more than 5 times and I really do love the sushi. I usually get the all you can eat option because you can order as much as you want and you can choose half (4 pieces) or whole (8 pieces) orders. My mom's favorite is the Pastel, mine is the Moon. My boyfriend likes spicy things so he really enjoys the 911. Their sauces are amazing, though I like the non spicy kind much much more than the spicy one. You can order sauces on the side. I suggest ordering two orders of sushi at once because they do take a little while to make. You can flag employees down whenever you want to order more. With the all you can eat, dessert is includes. Their mochi is really good and I also like the green tea icecream. My mom enjoys the red bean icecream. I gave three stars because the restaurant is very cramped, the wait times can be really long, and there's no waiting area (or if there is it's very small because I did not see it). I also sometimes feel like the employees are annoyed with me. However, I come here for lots of friends birthdays or dates. The sushi is good and the all you can eat price can't be beat."}
{"text":"Lets just say this place is probably the best and freshest ayce sushi I've ever had in my life and trust me I've tried pretty  much tried most of the ayce sushi in LA/OC area.

The decor in this place was pretty fancy going for the modern look esp at the sushi bar .. this wavy texture on the wall lol like ocean wavy! pretty cool!

We ordered salmon, super white tuna, baked mussel some sushi rolls.. They are all good n fresh! Make sure to order the super white tuna!! i didn' know they carry white tune so i was pretty excited about it and hey good thing i ordered it!  Probably the best thing you'll ever try in acye sushi!!  Veryy good!

This location was pretty far from the strip (It's actually before reaching Vegas, like between M resort and Vegas)

{"text":"I've lived around the Silverado area for a long time and just finally tried this place for the for the first time yesterday, and I can honestly say that I will not be coming back here again. Out of all the AYCE sushi places I've frequented, this one gave me the worst first impression. 

The service wasn't the best as I felt like my friends and I were rushed to ordering right away after not even being seated for more than a couple of minutes. It was irritating to say the least; the server never bothered to ask us if it was our first time, nor did he do any sort of recommendations for rolls to try.

Everywhere I go, I always get salmon nigiri to see if the place is worth coming back to, and this establishment had the worst one I've ever tried. The salmon was seriously so hard I felt like I was chewing on some cold steak. The rice was too cold as well. I also tried their takoyaki and a little advice, don't even bother with it. Their lasagna roll also fell apart way too easily unlike some other places I've tried. It's also a bummer that their agedashi tofu is not part of AYCE menu. I do however like their steamed gyoza, it was really delicious, soft and fresh. 

I cannot with clear conscience recommend this place to any of my friends, and I definitely would rather drive a little out of my way to get better quality sushi."}
{"text":"We order for the kids the waitress never ask what we wanted . They bring soup and salad for the kids walked away after 10 minutes later we finally get to ask for forks  then 15/20 minutes later the kids rolls come then and We finally ask the waitress if she would take our order"}
{"text":"Came here for sushi on a Saturday night. Busy, but not so busy we weren't able to be seated quickly. Reasonable prices for the quantity you receive; their AYCE deal is especially good! I ordered the nigiri, assuming there would be 4-6 pieces, as is standard, but there were only two. Bummer. No complaints on the hand roll and the rock 'n roll I ordered, but a note on the edamame: it was dried out and pruny, with way too much salt on top. It looked like they baked it instead of steaming or boiling it! Just a small annoyance, but it took down the overall experience, especially as I love my edamame."}
{"text":"I was told there's an amazing sushi all-you-can-eat restaurant off the strip in Las Vegas and I did my first visit in Feb 2009. That was such an awesome experience. Came in around 12pm and ordered lots of half-order baked rolls and fancy sushi. The raw fish, esp. the yellowtail, was very fresh. The strawberry mochi was also very impressive as a dessert. 
Based on my previous experience, I gave it a second try last week during lunch time. However I found that there must be something different... I can tell the sushi was made differently, although all the chefs were the same. When I pick up the sushi, the rice fell apart easily. I was not sure if it's because the chef did not make the roll correctly, or the rice was not made for sushi at all. But with the price they charge, it is not supposed to happen (especially it's made by Japanese chefs!). The chef lapsed our order several times even when we were sitting at the sushi bar. Even if the raw fish was still fresh, I was feeling so different that I have to gave it only 3-start this time. 
C'mon sushi mon, you fish deserves 5-star, what happened to your sushi rice??"}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving this place 2 and 3 stars. Would say 2.5 if I could. Only the extra half because the first time I ate there, I got a very nice lunch special with a good variety and everything tasted fresh. But we went back for AYCE and it was pretty bad. 

The sushi chef seemed new, the cuts to the nigiri were amateurish and he was veeeeery slow, despite having parts, like the California roll, the basis of most of their rolls, pre-made. Nothing tasted fresh and we actually sent a roll back because it tasted really fishy. That was spicy tuna. 

If I ever go back, and it would be shocking if I did, I will stick with the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Love sushi-mon we try to go as often as possible because food is fresh and always soo yummy!! You have to get the baked green muscles and the salmon belly. Also the hurricane roll and the tiger rolls are soo delicious. This is my all time favorite sushi restaurant in vegAs ohh also love the yellow tail collar yumm-o!!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not as great as the last time we went but still good. Still love the appetizers and that you can get more than one desert :)"}
{"text":"This is my sushi place.  If I'm not scoping out a new place, this is my old-reliable sushi place.

Sushi Mon is a small privately owned sushi restaurant in a rather nondescript shopping center on the corner of Maryland and Silverado.  It's also very popular, so be prepared to wait for up to half an hour or even 45 minutes on busy nights.

That being said, it's totally worth even an hour wait to get in.  The sushi chefs are fun and talkative, and really help you out, and will make you custom rolls if you ask for it.  The fish is always fresh and flavorful, and they have a lot of specialty rolls, and are always adding more.  In addition, they have a large selection of nigiri, and will always have a special of the day posted on the wall.  The wait stuff is quick and efficient, though they don't have as much personality as the chefs.  And the manager is the best guy ever.  

Personal favorites are the jala-jala roll, the sushi-bon, Pete's roll, and the must-have Dynamite.  

The all-you-can-eat is $26.95, which is a little daunting for newbies, but it's the only choice for a Sushi Mon-ster like me.  Keep in mind, too, that you can get half-rolls as well, so you're not stuck eating a huge roll that you wanted to try but didn't like.  This is a social experience, so don't go alone, it's just not fun, is it?  

Also, they have an all-you-can-eat punch card.  Eat 10 times, and you get your 11th one free.  I've made use of this 3 times in the last year.  Here's a secret:  Take friends from out of town!  You can have their stamps and add to your card! :D  

Finally, this place is just plain consistent.  I've been to other sushi places where they were good one day, and not good the next.  The service would be worse, or the fish would be less fresh, or some thing.  Sushi Mon has always been good and delicious and has never let me down yet, and I've been here more often than those other places combined.  

Don't look for fine dining, just fun, over-stuffed sushi dining!"}
{"text":"What a meal! Not only was it all you can eat, the food was delicious, and the staff were extremely friendly! From start to finish our time was fantastic. All three of us highly recommend this place! If you like sushi and want a variety at a reasonable price, this place is it! As for the desserts...everything was tasty, but the lychee sorbet was out of this world!!! Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better time or better service."}
{"text":"This is one if the better places in Vegas for AYCE. What I like most is that you can get half orders of most rolls, leaving you free to try out a variety of menu items. Cajun albacore and super white tuna are a must. Additionally, tempura ice cream is on the dessert menu included in AYCE price! Service is excellent, and sushi chefs are very friendly."}
{"text":"Pros: super white tuna nigiri is bomb. Service is good. Water is always refilled and always greeted when walking in or leaving. Service can be fast with orders.
Cons: tiny. Gets way too packed. Would not recommend big groups. Depending on whose working food can take a while to get served even though we can see it sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Our go-to-place in Vegas when we want comfort food. Food and service is great.  The place is open late for that late night fix."}
{"text":"One word: SUSHIGASM.

Okay okay....so it's not a real word.  Before I go on with my review, I have to say I was a bit weary dining here.  My last experience of AYCE sushi was HORRIBLE.  I never felt so sick in my life and had to hang out in the bathroom for the rest of the night. Yeah, you can say I was scarred from AYCE joints from that experience.  

With that said, my brother told me he loves this place and takes all his visitors here for dinner.  My brother has a waaaaay more sensitive stomach than I do. If he loves this place and doesn't get sick from it, then I'm sure I can tolerate it.  

$28 is not a bad deal for AYCE sushi.  Originally I thought this place was going to be buffet-style but get this: they make it fresh for you once you put in your order! Ummm how great is that??  So I felt a lot better once I found that out.

I tried to sample a variety of dishes served at Sushi Mon.  Between my brother, his fiancee and I, this is what I remember ordering:

Seared salmon nigiri
Every time I dine at a kaiten restaurant, I always order a few plates of this.  I thought it was interesting how they presented this dish because they sear the underside of the salmon.  And yes, I thought the the texture and taste was good.

Garlic tuna nigiri
The only other place I can compare this to is Genki Sushi and Sushi Mon does it a lot better.  I like how there's enough garlic to compliment the taste of the tuna, rather than overwhelm it.  

Ecstasy Roll
This roll contains chopped albacore, avocado and tempura crumb wrapped with tuna, smelt eggs & seaweed salad drizzled with orgasm sauce. Yeah, you heard that right, orgasm sauce.  I dunno what orgasm sauce is (or if I wanna know) but that with the entire roll was delicious.  I liked the texture the tempura crumbs added to the roll as well.

Supreme Salmon roll
Salmon wrapped with rice, nori and...more salmon!? This was an instant hit with me but I had to deduct a half star because I found a fish bone in one of the rolls.

Baked mussels
These were pretty good, although I thought there was a little too much mayo and cheese topping it.

Sushi Mon Lasagna
To clarify, this contains scallop yum and cucumber spread with yum yum sauce & cream cheese.  All I can say is there was way too much yum yum.  This roll was a bit rich for my liking.  I'll pass on this the next time I visit.

Saba
I thought it was ok and it seemed like it didn't taste as \"oily\" as I remember it to be.  I hope that makes sense to you all...

Uni
During dinner, they only allow one order of uni per person. I can totally see why...this tasted so fresh!  I was tempted to have someone order me another round but we still had a lot of food to finish.  For those of you who wonder what this tastes like, it reminds me of the fat of dungeness crabs (aka the best part of the crab).  If you still think it sounds gross, you are so missing out.

Grilled yellow tail collar
Cooked to perfection! The meat easily fell off the bones and I enjoyed the tenderness of the fish and the crispiness of the outside.

Lychee sorbet
Best lychee sorbet I've tasted.  This also contained chunks of lychee fruit in it. Mmmm...

Strawberry mochi
Most of the time when I had this at other restaurants, this is frozen rock hard.  Sushi Mon's mochi was nice and soft while the ice cream in the inside was slightly firm.  Another good choice for dessert.

I apologize if this review was ridiculously long.  Anyways, I personally think it's worth the trip to dine here at Sushi Mon."}
{"text":"Always love coming to this place, the quality of Fish is amazing. IT is the BEST in town. The only downfall on this is the wait is usually 45 minutes to an hour and half almost all the time and they do not take reservations. 
SO Great Food and Service just A Long wait to get in. But the wait is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place was a good deal! I liked the fact u can do all u can eat with appetizers. It's flavorful & pretty filling  I normally go to Oyshi, but def will come here again due to their fast service"}

{"text":"THE BEST QUALITY of Sushi I've ever had in U.S.! Very affordable too. Luch spacials are only $8 and all you can eat for $21. I wish they open one in California. Another reason to come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"BEST AYCE sushi in Vegas. Not fancy (save that for the over priced hotel sushi  joints), but fresher and actually more fun!  Fresh fresh fresh fish. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a must stop now everything time we're in Vegas.  A good friend of mine introduced it to me and my boyfriend back in Oct and we've loved it ever since. There AYCE is a great deal. It gets pretty busy so the service can be much better but as long as you know what you from the form it worked out okay. If you wanted something that you didn't write on the form...good luck trying to flag a waiter down right away. 

Overall fresh sushi, wide variety and for an AYCE place they don't pile on the rice!!  I hate going to places that piles on the rice and sauces. I can't wait to go back when I'm in the city again."}
{"text":"Good service and good sushi.

I've been here twice, the 1st time just sitting on the table ordering from the menu. And the second time me and a few friends did the whole buffet thing which was only like 30 bucks for all you can eat! This was the best deal since I love uni, hamachi and just sushi in general! The workers where always on it, with getting things you needed (lemons) and filling you're water. 

The reason for the 4-star was because the wait is incredibly long! and I got yelled at for hiding and not eating all my rice....apparently they don't like to waste! =/"}
{"text":"When I read about their $10 all-you-can-eat promo a few weeks ago, I made plans to attend with a big group of friends. Sushi Mon isn't our favorite place and we figured the wait would be pretty long, but since they clearly advertised a no reservations policy we figured it would be worth it to go and wait; We were severely wrong. 

When we arrived there were a few people gathered outside and the restaurant was full, but it wasn't too bad. When I went to the hostess to put our name on the list, we were informed they were booked solid until the end of their event and we couldn't be served even though our whole party was present. So much for the \"no reservations\" policy. 

Save yourself the trouble, there's all-you-can-eat sushi places nearby with better flavor and similar prices--we won't be returning."}
{"text":"The sushi is great, nice and fresh! I do wish the place was bigger because there is always at least a 30 min wait. There is a line that goes out the door sometimes. But the sushi is a good price for the quality!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and every time the service gets a bit worse. They have a waiting list, they take your phone number and leave empty tables open till everybody shows up. We've been looking for a whole row open for half hour while people waiting outside. Food is getting worse, chefs are getting more rude"}
{"text":"Came here again this past weekend at around 9PM.
We had two groups of 6 people.
Wait was about 40 minutes long -__-

Service wasn't great but the sushi is amazing!
Dinner all you can eat is about $25. 
They have so many things to choose from. I wanted to order the chief's special I heard so much about, but the server said they ran out =(

All the sushi is fresh and delicious! They have so many rolls to choose from and they were all so yummy. But I liked my salmon, albacore, and scallop the most! So yummy =) 

And lychee sorbet is the best!! I love this place! My boyfriend has been to sage sushi and a few other AYCE sushi places and he really liked Sushi Mon =)"}
{"text":"Service was great. Fooooood was okay tho I honestly couldn't even tell you what I was eating like that salad was not the best but hey I'm like chicken wang type of girl so maybe I just dont understand what I was eating. It's a cute small place but I've had better food other places like this."}
{"text":"If you're a sushi lover do the buffet amazing price and for delicious sushi! Everything was great quality and the selection was very extensive from side dishes, to specialty rolls and even desserts. The Tiger roll was great along with the fresh nigri rolls and the sake shooters were YUMMy too. All in all this was a great find and I would go back many a times if I had the opportunity. Forget eating on the over priced strip, this is where its at."}
{"text":"Amazing. The chef was so awesome. Helping us try fresh delivered sushimi and the sashimi salad is so Hiro amazing...the best I have EVER had in the world."}
{"text":"1. Go to sushi-mon on maryland
2.  Go to sushi-mon on sahara
3.  Come back and comment

Big difference.  Its disappointing cuz brought mom n dad... told then that sushi-mon is top.  Surprised didn't have to wait at the sahara location now i see why.  

We craved the sea urchin... parents took a bite n told us not to eat them.  Asked waiter if can perhaps ask chef to look and exchange for us.  Without notifying chef nor manager waiter told us urchins come in the same box.  We just let the poor kid slide.  

At sahara, u get way too much rice.  Suggestion:  refill drinks for customers.  Waiter shouldn't  argue with customers; call manager.  Customers are more likely to come back if u treat em right."}
{"text":"Love this place. We're here all the time but pls bring the previous Asian guy manager back. New American lady manager is not nice. She should get training from her staffs"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place. Here is my opinion on the rolls I had. 
Sushi monster-a tourist roll, bland, don't bother
Baked 428- chicken?? Well it's amazing!!
Pete's- ok
Sunrise- the spicy Cajun albacore makes it very good
Andy-bland
Calico- wow, really good, the Cajun albacore on top makes it so good
No name- above avg
Jala jala- bland even with the jalapeño
Ecstasy- very good...not orgasmic but very. 
The best part of this place is how small & therefore, fast they are, with a great quality food."}
{"text":"Made an obligatory stop @ Sushimon last week during my Vegas trip.

Another satisfying meal indeed. mmMMmmmM!

My newest favorite app has to be the sake shooters!! I always thought they were gross because of the raw egg yolk inside...but I decided to give it a shot since I didn't know when I'd be back.  SOOO GOOD! I looove the addition of siracha at the end.  Amazing!!  And the sake wasn't bad either =p

More secret menu items:
- White tuna
- Sweet shrimp
- Uni [sea urchin]
- Toro [fatty tuna] 

Oh, & don't forget to get a stamp card.  After 10 AYCE, you get one free!! It helps when you go with a date that way you'll get there twice as fast!"}
{"text":"omG I love this place! It is freakishly delicious. No matter what you order, its good.
The all you can eat is truly that... ALL you can eat. 

The staff is really good, so the server ladies are fast to bring your food. The timed AYCE is a little weird, but understandable. There are, after all, some extremly large americans that can eat a whole cow in 15 hours....

I think this place made me gain about 15lbs in the past 2 months. But hell.. its worth it!"}
{"text":"Food ok,prepared fresh in front of you. However they have a time limit on dinner(60min) and lunch is even shorter(45min). Now giving the fact that this is all you can eat,you not gonna eat as much as in makino for instance bcs it takes lot of time to prepare! Also the sushi is not as described on cards. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas. Pretty much everything I had here was good, so I guess I'd recommend trying a bit of everything! Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't go here. They don't care about customer service. Food is not fresh, chewy seaweed. The wait is NOT worth it. Just horrible. I'm disgusted."}
{"text":"So, we live on the complete opposite side of town from this fine Sushi place, however recently our favorite Sushi Chef made a change and now does his thing here!  

Aside from it being a bit of a drive, we've now got our new favorite Sushi restaurant!

They have great portions and the fish is incredibly fresh..which is what you want when you sit down at the Sushi bar.

Could not be happier!  Mike, Haru and the rest of the Sushi masters were fantastic and we left stuffed not wanting to eat for days!  We'll be back, just perhaps not as often as we normally would."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Got to do the all you can eat. The quality is way above any other all u can eat sushi or even non. The staff is super nice too."}
{"text":"Main sushi chef is gone, heard they changed the ownership. That's why they serve sushi worse then ever. Their fish are too dry and most roll came unrolled. Crappy skills. Their customer service got worse as well. The lady at front (maybe new owner or manager?) seemed nice, but she's not even paying attention to the customers. I understand when it's busy I don't complain this much. Our group didn't get refills or orders unless we asked. I miss the good chef and the previous management. Go to Goyemon instead."}
{"text":"Always eat here every time I visit Vegas. Drinks, gambling, and food. Sushi....AYCE? Good sushi....AYCE?! Where do I sign my soul over?

Desert is AYCE as well....oh god. I have no idea why I'm capitalizing AYCE?! Guess I'm just really excited about the thought that I'm going there this month (was there just last month) and I have a filled rewards card with them....mmmm...free AYCE! Ok bye."}
{"text":"The sashimi lunch special is the best in town... They do not scrimp and serve large quality cuts of fresh fish... Check it out and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"GOSSIP UPDATE

I haven't been back since my last bad experience, but I did get some gossip from a reliable source.  Apparently, a little while back - right around the time I noticed a significant decline in the quality - they lost their head chef.  Word is he went over to the other Sushi Mon in Henderson.

And I also found out that it's not entirely correct that the two Sushi Mons are not related.  Apparently the old manager of this Sushi Mon on Sahara started up the Sushi Mon in Henderson - there may have been like some sort of payment or franchise type agreement.  

Currently, the two are separately owned and run, but there is a little bit of a relationship there as you can see.  However if you ask them they will say they are not related.

Anyways, if the head chef's gone over to Henderson then I guess I'll have to check that place out again."}
{"text":"After hearing that the sushi chef from Sushi Mon on Sahara had moved here we had to check it out.  I do enjoy their fried oysters and dynamite.  However, the quality of the fish is just so-so.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the high quality of fish I've been eating at my new regular spot, Naked Fish http://www.yelp.com/biz/naked-fishs-sushi-and-grill-las-vegas

However about halfway into our meal, we were shocked when we saw them clean the inside of the glass sushi display case with a big blue bottle of windex.  Yes, the case with all the fish in it.  

We walked out.  That is wrong.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi place I've ever been to.  You can sit at the bar or the tables, I've done both and there isnt a huge difference because the staff is great and attentive.  What I love about this place is virtually everything on the menu is fair game.  You can come here without even loving sushi and be fine because staff rushes out orders of gyoza, shrimp termpura, teriyaki chicken, shumai etc.  If you're at a table they also take your sushi orders, but if youre at the bar, the chef does of course.  The sushi is amazingly fresh and does not disappoint.  The chefs are fast and give a good fish to rice ratio (unlike other all you can eat places).  For dinner, you also get one order toro and amaebi, which you will probably never get at any other all you can eat place.  The nigiri is extremely fresh.  I order a ton of that.  But they also have hand rolls, your basic cut rolls, and even specialty roles.  Yes an all you can eat place where you can order a huge variety specialty rolls.  Try their  achi chi roll ( salmon on top of shrimp tempura roll with a spicy sauce) and mambo roll (yellowtail on a lettuce spicy tuna roll) and of course volcano roll. Additionally, you can order half rolls (4 pieces) allowing you to try lots of different rolls.  This place is so far beyond any other all you can eat sushi restaurant its amazing.  The only downside is lunch is only 45 minutes (dinner is an hour) and its a good 15-20 minutes from the strip.  Even so, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite sushi place, due to the variety and desserts. (Tempura ice cream yuuuum) but their service became slow and it was always too busy .
The sushi is not really wow to me , it's just yummy"}
{"text":"I think this place stinks because of the absolutely horrible service.  Let me explain:

Went there Dec 26th at 7:30PM.  I expected there to be a wait which is no big deal.  However, after standing around for 15 minutes at the counter and having some rude people cut in line to get a table, I went to the front to ask the host where I can write down my name.  He just answered that the wait was 40 minutes to an hour.  He was quite rude and didn't even make eye contact with me.  When I asked how the person that just came got a table, he just repeated that he was very busy.  

The sushi bar had 5 chairs available so I asked if I could sit there.  He then looked at me and said that there are tons of people waiting.  I look around and there are 3 others.  Oh yeah, there were three others that were waiting before me and when they saw the line cutters get their seats, they left immediately without saying a word.  I on the other hand left using some expletives. 

The fish might be good but I don't need to be mistreated and will take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Considering one of the strips all you can eat buffets to stuff your face like a wild person? 

DON'T DO IT!

Come here instead.

The fish is fresh, the rolls are unique, the chefs are experienced, and the whole place operates like a well oiled machine. 

I also should mention that I am extremely skeptical when I hit an AYCE in terms of quality of food, and the tendency of joints to serve your as slowly as possible. I dIdn't have a problem with this at all!

Sushi Mon is on point."}
{"text":"The sushi selection is EXCELLENT here. You can find a lot of fish and it's nice and fresh. They also cut big pieces of fish unlike some other places. This is one of the better AYCE spots around town! 

All in all great quality for AYCE. Obviously you will get better fish at a non-ayce place (as a general rule, not always) but these guys are still have really really decent fish! and the chefs are actually JAPANESE (not korean) though there was a Caucasian chef, but he knew his shit. 

My new fave spot after Umiya went downhill a bit."}
{"text":"Like LA, a lot of good places are located in strip malls. Sushi Mon was recommended to me by friends but my first time eating the food was takeout and therefore not the all-you-can-eat everyone talks about.

Maybe I'm a little spoiled but the appearance of my sushi lacked uniformity. You could see what pieces were the end of the rolls because they were short on stuffing/ fish. The rolls fell apart in my chopsticks and in my fingers. This was definitely finger-eating sushi but for the wrong reasons.

Quality was good though. I did enjoy the flavor of the sushi rice and the fish was fresh. I'll go back again because it's my local joint.

I must add though, the dining room is small and don't be a fool like one guy I saw who came in thinking he could get a table for 10 without a reservation. \"Sir, it will be an hour and a half wait.\"

\"What?! Why's that? This is a special occasion for us!\" He retorted scanning a packed room with not one empty table.

\"Well sir, all of these people here are ahead of you and waiting for a table,\" said the hostess gesturing to alllllllll the people waiting inside and outside...."}
{"text":"Okay this is about the only thing I miss from Vegas...All you can eat sushi (usually that would make me run)  but not this place, the sushi literally melts in your mouth.  Sooo good, cool chefs too, very insight full.  If and when I go to Vegas again, I will definitely visit this place."}
{"text":"We just got out of the Convention and were rolling 4 deep with a serious craving for Sushi , So we rolled to Sushi Mon an AYCE Sushi Joint. We rolled in got seated in the Sushi Bar . We all ordered the AYCE . We started machine gunning in our orders and the Sushi chefs were keeping up. Fish was fresh and tasty. Decor was nice and they take Discover Card.Great Ayce . Open till 2AM."}
{"text":"They have stupid rules about combining tables, instead they let us wait and let everyone who came after us sit!"}
{"text":"Great All You Can for my afterhours sushi craving.  Nice place to check out when all the other sushi bars are closed. Open till 2am."}
{"text":"So I recently moved to this side of town and Sushi Mon is walking distance from the new pad so its no surprise that I quickly became a fan of such a great AYCE place. I enjoy coming here because there's lots of good choices and tempura ice cream is on the AYCE menu. I had one experience here where the fish was just average but overall it has been consistently great. I will continue to come back as often as possible."}
{"text":"We are unfamiliar with this side of town so we decided to give this place a shot. Upon arriving we were greeted and seated almost immediately... which we absolutely appreciated because we were *starving*. The staff was always checking to see if we're okay and that if we needed anything. Loved the customer service. Wasn't too big of a fan of their appetizers, aside from the shrimp tempura. The sushi was just okay. It wasn't something I would crave later down the road nor would I take the trip down here just for this sushi spot. I've had better but this place is okay for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Love it love it love it!!!  One of the only places that has the All YOu Can eat Option and In addition allow you to eat at the same time spider roll and dynamite roll!! Ive been to a lot of all you can eat places.. and none of them allow you to get the fat toro or the expensive dishes.. so what does this mean?? 
You get good value for your buck.. 
If you want to enjoy.. come here.. its in Vegas.. and let me tell you .. it was hard finding good japanese restaurants in vegas!
Also the food is quite fresh!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst sushi buffets I've had by any standard. We went on a late Friday night, and here are the problems:

- already slightly pricey, and all the limited quantity items (uni, clams, etc.) were out
- can't get the orders right and kept bringing us random stuff
- that seafood salad thing is huge - looks impressive, taste is okay, but it's just a bunch of leftover fish chopped and drenched in soy sauce...not too impressed.
- bad/not very nice service but speed was okay
- can't really taste the fish...which makes eating sushi pointless.
- nigiri had tons of rice

Okay, there are a few good things:
- the special rolls on the menu are pretty nice, definitely try the wet dream and what some of the other yelpers have mentioned
- plus points for some of the good looking waitresses

All in all, I won't be heading back to this place anytime soon. There's gotta be better sushi buffet in Vegas than this one."}
{"text":"Great price, and great service! Sometimes at AYCE places, the waiters have attitudes because of the large orders, but here, it seems they really want you to eat all you can, if you are not being wasteful. They are happy to have you try everything on the menu, and recommend half orders so you can fit everything in. They even have some \"good stuff\" that are not on the menu of AYCE places, like toro."}
{"text":"All you can eat fresh, delicious sushi for $27 in the hot desert in Las Vegas?  Is this a mirage?  Am I hallucinating?  Nope...it's real.  Sushimon is a must go for me everytime I am in Vegas, EVERYTIME.  

Each time that I eat here, I can't believe that i'm actually eating fresh raw fish that doesn't make me hit the can later.  The sushi rice here is perfect...comes out a little warm with the right amount of vinegar taste that sushi rice should have.  I like that the fish to rice ratio is proportioned right.  Some AYCE's have too much rice, in hopes to fill you up.  Not here.  I love that the AYCE menu is double sided with nigiri, appetizers, dessert and for all you sushi lovers who think you like \"sushi\" (cooked, battered, fried, saucey rolls) they have a whole side dedicated to you.  They also have specials of the day. Toro, fresh scallop, super white tuna, even mirugai have appeared before so remember to ask your server before you miss out.  The servers are hot and cold...sometimes they are super nice and sometimes they seem like they really hate their job.  It depends on how busy they are i think.  

There are a few items that are limited to one order per person...the uni, amaebi and hamachi kama.  This is understandable considering it's more on the expensive side.  If you love these items, go with someone who doesn't that way you can have their share too!   

Save room for dessert because they have tempura ice cream and it is delicious!  Just a hint of tempura batter so it doesn't over power the ice cream...i wonder how do you fry ice cream?  

If you are a sushi lover and want a great all you can eat experience, you have to come here.  I wish and wish that they would open one up in SF and HI so I don't have to fly to Vegas just to enjoy good quality AYCE sushi.  

TIP:  No reservations and the line can get long so come early or just place your name on the list...they call your phone when your table is ready!"}
{"text":"We had all you can eat here last night.  It's a small place with not much seating so unless you call ahead you will likely have to sit at the bar.  The dynamite is delicious along with the tempura ice cream.  I would say the quality is average as well as the price.  The location is convenient but for all you can eat w/ a good quality I would probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Waited for about an hour because we had a large party, but the food (all-you-can-eat) came out really fast.  There was a lot to choose from on the menu and their desserts (especially the strawberry mochi) was so good. The downside really was just the wait and their suggestions of the new sushi rolls which did not taste good."}
{"text":"My husband and I ventured away from \"The Strip\" in Vegas and found Sushi Mon. 

The service was amazing. The sushi chef welcome us with open arms and explained everything to us about the \"All You Can Eat\" Sushi menu and let us order one roll at a time to ensure we would be getting the best \"bang for our buck.\" We didn't need the AYCE menu, though -- if I ate more than three bites without getting full, it would be an amazing deal. 

We got the takoyaki, spicy tuna hand rolls, and octopus salad. The octopus salad was absolutely delicious. The takoyaki was a little much for me. The spicy tuna hand rolls just weren't what I was used to, but the fish was extremely fresh. The food I ordered wasn't my favorite, but I think that was more my error than anything. The man next to me was ordering the most amazing food and I wish we would have just tagged along with him. If I could go back, I would have definitely ordered the salmon collar. It looks beautiful! The lychee sorbet made my heart smile as did the service. 

I would be happy to try this place again! Their prices are definitely fair and their food is good!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I took an edible before I went here with friends, who were also pretty high, but it didn't hit until about halfway through our all-you-can-eat meal, so I'm about 80% certain that you can still trust my judgement.

The sushi is made fresh to order, and it's all pretty incredible. I tried Uni and raw eel for the first time, and they were both a little different but overall very enjoyable. Their deep-fried rolls were savory and sweet, perfectly crunchy, and somehow still had beautifully raw tuna in the center. The nigiri were simply perfect, where I'm from a lot of the sushi places coat their fish in lemon juice to hide whether or not the fish is fresh, but there was nothing on their fish and it was very good.

I don't generally do desserts when I eat out, but I tried a taste of someone's lychee sorbet and I couldn't help but order some for myself. It was very smooth, and probably the only fruit-flavored frozen dessert that I'd EVER describe as decadent. 

The service is VERY quick and friendly, we didn't have to wait between courses.

Overall I would say that I'd love to go here again!"}
{"text":"I visit about 2-3 times a month. Great rolls, awesome service, seated immediately each time, & I love how fresh everything I order is!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the low ratings with this place, because I believe this place is still the best ayce sushi joint in Vegas. Their fish quality is far better than the other ayce places around town, and I love how they have different daily specials. They might not have the fanciest nor most creative looking rolls, but they do their nigiri right. They had Kobe beef nigiri the second to the last time I was there, and it was uhh-maaay-jiiing! I also love their tempura and hamachi kama, which are all included in the ayce. I've heard people say they got charged extra with leftover rice, but if you sit at the sushi bar, you can request the sushi chefs to go easy on the rice. 

Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95 (with the dinner price you can order uni and sweet shrimp with a 1 order limit per person). Service is always attentive and accommodating. I have been a fan of Sushi Mon since day one, and I will continue to keep coming."}
{"text":"We 've been to this place many times and it used to be our 1st sushi recommended restaurent in Las Vegas. It's been about 4 months since last time that we's dissapointed with the fish. We decieded to come back to try again and hope that it'll be good like it used to be. But we's dissapoint again. Hard Soft Shall Crab, sushi rice was not stick together, rice over fish above sushi rice, salty salad dressing."}
{"text":"Looks like they have a new manager at this location.  We tried to eat dinner here tonight with the family.  It was half full at 7pm and we tried to get a table for 5.  She said it would be 30 minutes.  There were a few empty tables that they could've pushed together.  There was a huge open area in the sushi bar that could've easily accommodated our group.  

I brought this up to the lady...this new manager.  She said that it is their policy NOT to move chairs or tables.   LOL.  Seriously?!!  I asked why is this a policy?!?  She had no explanation but said it was their restaurant policy.  

The sushi chefs...most who we know...just watched and shook their heads.  Probably because we tip the sushi chefs $20 on each visit. 

THANK GOD FOR THIS INCOMPETENT MANAGER.  We left and went to the new Sushi Loca in Downtown Summerlin.  Service, Food, and Price was perfect.  

We will still support sister restaurants Monta and Goyemon, but we will NOT return to this restaurant until this new lady is gone."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh sushi! I'm usually skeptical about where I eat sushi but this place was really clean! They have a lot of sauces also to choose from which I love.. The yum yum sauce is a must try.. It's like a sweet spicy mayo sooooo good. Another cool thing was they had a picture for every roll they serve so you can get a look at it before ordering"}
{"text":"They have a great menu. Small dining area, practically sitting on each other.  I only went once and when I have bad service I won't go back. The rudest waitress. I only ordered 3 times due to her ignoring me but each time she asked me if I planned to eat it. Then it took 15 mins. The ladies next to me were served 7 times and I was there 20 mins before them. Island Sushi is my place of choice. Amazing service and sushi."}
{"text":"terrible customer service!!! ever!!!
They do not care about your business at all, because they are very busy. Even the owner is rude, how can the waiter can be take care the customer.
 the food was great, how ever, It does not worth it to make make upset after a meal!!!
never come back again.
So bad lost a favor sushi place."}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi with amazing service and definitely amazing good! They were quick with there service despite going there when it was quite packed, but I enjoyed every minute."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable, considering that it's Japanese food. The food is really good."}
{"text":"All you can eat menu is almost perfect, its affordable and you can order all kind of side dish and desert included to the price. I did compare if I were to pay all you can eat vs. a la carte: all you can eat deal is much better with one flow: the rice part of the sushi is too thick but this is almost standard in all sushi restaurants. Staff is friendly, food is fresh and above average. they just need more room at this location. overall, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food ....HORRIBLE SERVICE!! I started a birthday tradition that only lasted 2 years after last night ....and keep In mind I never said it was my birthday because I wasn't expecting any special treatment .

Stay away from the short Hispanic girl with long black hair ( in a ponytail ) she is so rude ! 

I first called to ask if I can make a reservation..... her response was \" we don't do reservations over the phone \" so i asked how I can make a reservation, her response was \" come In and if there is a wait then out your name down and we can call you \" THAT IS NOT A RESERVATION ...facepalm ......


Then we get there and it was not busy at all , there was a total of 4 of us , but only myself and my partner had arrived . Naturally we ask to be seated because i was super hungry , the same girl who answered the phone told us she couldn't seat us until the entire party was there ...... I can understand if there was people waiting to sit down and they were slammed .....they had at lease 4 open tables ! We had to sit in the hot parking lot waiting for the rest of our party .

Our server was decent , but left halfway through our dinner and didn't even tell us . No one checked on us the entire dinner . Our bus boy basically became our server .....

Before getting the check my friend had a free meal to redeem and they wouldn't honor it because it was expired last month ....any small business should honor a free meal especially when it goes to show that someone has been there at least 10 times.... but did they no ! 


Lastly ....we asked the so pleasant girl/ host from earlier if we could get our check ......and that it would need to be split by couples ( and we did hand motions to show how to split the check ) well we get the check and she just split it down the middle ! This was a problem because my other half only had one roll and we had some drinks ....so it wasn't a even split .......I kindly ( even though I was completely over this place at this point) brought it to the host attention ......she replied with \" well you said to split it \" ...THAT IS NOT WHAT WE SAID  and not only that don't argue with your customers! It then took about 20 minutes to sort out the check fiasco .....I will find a new all you can eat sushi place from now on"}
{"text":"Worst service I have EVER experienced at  sushi restaurant.  Got in and it was half full.  We ordered and got some dishes and then everything just stopped.  All the baked items came out so you know that the sushi items were backed up.  Still waited and no one said anything to us.  We had to ask multiple times for them to check on our order and finally they asked us what items we were waiting for.  Once we told them,  the waitress left and then came back 5 minutes later asking us again what we had left! We are now leaving hungry and angry to a place we will never come back to again.  We will be sure to tell everyone to not come here again if they're craving sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi quality is really good! Depending on when you go it can be a bit busy but they are normally very quick with getting you in. The service is good and quick and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good sushi place!"}
{"text":"It took me 2 years to come here and MAN it was worth the wait! 

The nigri is sooooo good and fresh!

Yellow tail Collarbone (Hamachi kama): THE BEST THAT I'VE EVER HAD.

The rolls are pretty big as well.

Dessert wise
- Tempura Ice Cream: I believe it vanilla ice cream in side (YUMM)
- Lychee Sorbet is really good too

This place is a little pricey $26 for dinner and a few dollars less for lunch but SOOOOOOOO WORTH IT! I will come here every time I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I can not explain why one of my favorite Sushi place is so far from the water...Esp when I live on the water. But Sushi Mon is the Man! --OK that was lame but really this place has the best value, it is so cheap and the sushi/ sashimi portions are LARGE. Wine by the glass is $3 (prob not a recognizable vintage but who cares? -its 3bucks!) The sushi chefs are entertaining and its open until 3AM. I've been coming here for years --every visit to Vegas means a visit to Sushi Mon, I've been looking for something comparable in my hometowns. Still looking...."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time, started to get a little worse each time. Last I went I asked for a side of spicy mayo with my 3 rolls, they wanted to charge me $1 extra. I understand charging extra for things... but not when I'm purchasing $30 worth of sushi. Also, every time I go in, it doesn't have the most pleasant smell either. Maybe have a plumbing issue? Anyway, they do have a great lunch special and the sushi isn't terrible. I do will go back when I'm in the area, but probably wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"My husband and I stop by here whenever we're in Vegas and their sushi is great! I'm not talking about teriyaki chicken or non sushi items. 

Their fish is always fresh and their fish cuts are always bigger than their rice portions.

I highly recommend this place and I usually don't leave reviews. I just felt like there were many people giving poor reviews on non sushi items, but you go to an all you can eat to order sushi, not chicken."}
{"text":"The ayce here is pretty decent. We came on a busy Saturday night and we were sat at the sushi bar. 

I don't usually sit at the bar bc there are pros and cons. The chef is busy most of the time so it's kind of hard to ask him to make something for you when he's working on other people's orders. Seems like our server only took kitchen orders, so felt bad asking the chef to make things all the time.

The calamari here was one of my favorites. Other then awkwardly asking our chef to make something every 5 mins everything was pretty good. Sushi and rice proportion was pretty good. Smaller pieces, but at least not stuffed with rice. 

Will come back if in the area. Not bad but not the best:-) recommend this place as one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Food is decent but service is ridiculously bad. Our order was given away to the table next to us and we know for a fact that we ordered first. We've been here for over 50 minutes and our first order still isn't complete WTF!"}
{"text":"Always great service with a friendly atmosphere. All you can eat Sushi at a great price."}
{"text":"I normally don't go to AYCE sushi, but the quality of the fish was actually pretty good at Sushi Mon. We had a party of 9, so we had to wait a little for a table. We basically ordered lots of rolls and sushi to share. We went there for lunch, but they let us pay the dinner price, so we could get some of their specials for dinner, like the ebi, uni, carpaccio, fresh oysters, oyster shooters, toro (was not good). 

My favorites were the super white fish, albacore, uni, all the carpaccios (albacore, salmon, red snapper)

The servers were really sweet. They were pretty tentative, they were patient with our bigger party.  We went way over their time limit, but they didn't rush us out."}
{"text":"I've had severe food poisoning from eating here. I lost 12 lbs after full recovery. This establishment is more about quantity then quality. I don't recommend anyone eating here."}
{"text":"Great deal ($23 lunch) for what you get: decent quality, made-to-order all you can eat Sushi.  They have a variety of nigiri sushi and rolls, and many cooked dishes/appetizer as well. (Too bad no sashimi in the all you can eat menu)  I've been there a few times now over the last couple years.  You are allowed one order of sweat shrimp and sea urchin nigiri per person.  The nigiri pieces are smaller than typical, but since it's all you can eat, you can actually try more variety this way.  The rice to fish portion is reasonable, although just a tag more than I would like and they do require that you eat the rice as well.  But I usually leave small amount of scattered rice pieces here and there and they never said anything.  The quality of fish is suprisingly fresh for an all you can eat place, but of course not as good as the pricier sushi restaurant.  They also have some good rolls there.  It also include dessert so that's nice.  I haven't tried any other of the similar all you can eat sushi place in the vegas area, so I'm not sure how it compares.  I just know I wish there's a place like this near where I live."}
{"text":"decent quality sushi for Las Veas.  The only catch is for the \"AYCE\" You have to eat everything-- including the rice.  I do love the sake shooters though. :)  They also have a huge variety of rolls to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh and that's the problem

Called ahead and checked wait time and was informed there was no wait. Showed up 20 min later and the wait was over an hour

There is always a long wait one hour plus last three times we went both week nights and week ends

Service was slow but that was due to how busy they were"}
{"text":"Service was crap, sushi was blah. Too many better sushi places in town."}
{"text":"Had the ecstasy roll and the baked 428 both so delicious! I like the fact that they offer half roles so you can get a variety of options."}
{"text":"Damn you sushimon, you got me good!  Was it the language barrier or you couldn't hear me behind the glass at the bar?  I specifically asked for HALF orders of 4 different rolls as my last and Final order of an hour long, sushi binge.  But what do you give me? 4 WHOLE rolls.  OMFG #gag#barf.  How am I supposed to finish this?!?  I wanted to cry, really.  Another hour and a half later or so, I slowly consumed everything...you did not defeat me this time around but I dare not challenge you again."}
{"text":"For an AYCE (made to order) I really like this place. They give you a stamp card, and I've been able to redeem 2 this year, that means I got 20 meals (not all myself, i brought guests) so I'm officially hooked. There are a lot of AYCE sushi places to choose from in town now. The new management has taken the food quality up a notch. The high end stuff is back, Toro, Uni, Salmon Belly and Amaebi. The hot dishes are very tasty, tempura is fluffy and crispy, salads are fresh. But do NOT share if you are not paying for All-You-Can-Eat, the make it really uncomfortable for you if you try to slide one by. Mochi for dessert is the best."}
{"text":"Really? This place got 4 stars? I wont never come back to this place period!
The fishes are not fresh at all and too much rice. Miso soup is salty. Baked mussels are not fresh. I ordered Ikura and they gave me tuna. The rolls are mediocre."}
{"text":"If you like nigiri sushi, give it a try. Yashi, sushi chef, kept it coming. Honor the master and have him choose the selection. You can't go wrong. Drop the chop sticks. Eat it with your fingers and drink green tea. It's the right way."}
{"text":"This was out first time here.
My bf & I were in town from HI. We heard about this place from family, so we figured we'd check it out...
The service was fast and friendly & their fish was fresh, like back home.

I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"No matter how many other sushi place I go to I keep coming back here! Their Sushi, hands down are the Best! Chef Mon is also the best sushi chef ever!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi mon is the best!  I knocked down one star since the two owners split and when they did, they decided to even split the menu! =(

For an all you and eat place, this place takes the prize!  For a little less than $30, you get a wide variety of special rolls and sushi!  The sushi is really fresh surprisingly for an all you can eat place!

Like every other sushi places, the waiters and chefs are always nice and friendly!  The rolls that they have are really big!  They also provide the option of getting half a roll if you don't want the whole one!  When I say they have a wide variety, I really do mean they have a wide variety!!

They have mochi which is of course always great and they have friend tempura ice cream!

This place is a must go to place if you're in the area! It's not on or near the strip however, it's more of a local place!"}
{"text":"The first time I ever came here was many years back and where there was only 1 sushi mon!  But now that they have split up, they also had split the menu!  

I would say this sushi mon got the better menu!

I came here, it was about $35 with tax and tip for ayce sushi!  No sashimi but they do have nigri.  Very good selection and their hamachis are delicious!  

All their rolls were great especially the 911 roll!  Very spicy and tasty!  

They say it's ayce for 1 hour but we ended up staying for 2 and no one said anything!  Also, 1 hr is a long time to eat!  We stayed for two because we were talking but we weren't eating the whole time.

The selection here are pretty fresh and I wouldn't say at all that it was low quality sushi!  

People here are friendly and don't make faces or anything when you order and order!  

My favorite spot to go to in Las Vegas when I come visit!

Also, they have tempura ice cream!  Always a delight! =)"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!! I came here for the first time and it was all you an eat sushi. What a deal, and it even included desert. I will come back when I'm in town forsure."}
{"text":"Oh.
my.
balls.

I really want to end my review with just that, but I can't. Because some omnipotent authoritative figure will strike me down and put me 6 feet underground. Because Sushi Mon deserves a damn good review. Because this place is FAWKING. AMAZING.

I've been to Oyshi (http://www.yelp.com/biz/oyshi-sushi-las-vegas) a few months back, and now i've got my chance to feast with a few good friends at Sushi Mon. These two restaurants alone dominate the AYCE sushi game in Vegas. And they are both dericious. But a good friend said \"Oyshi does Rolls really well. Sushi Mon does sushi really well. so it all comes down to what you like.\" 

I couldn't have said it better myself. Anyone who's been a long time fan of AYCE sushi knows that these type of places sacrifice quality for quantity. C'mon pal, it's all you can eat sushi. In a perfect world... amirite?

THE SKINNY: 
ironically, if you come to Sushi Mon, you won't be leaving very skinny. There are REALLY BAD all-you-can-eat sushi places, and there are REALLY GOOD all-you-can-eat sushi places. There is very few in-betweens, and really, why would you want to settle for less? you're better than that. LET'S HAVE SOME SELF RESPECT!
Sushi Mon is one of those REALLY GOOD ayce places. I know most of my ayce sushi reviews have been 4 to 5 stars...but have you ever wondered why? because I don't settle, and neither should you! But after going to sushi mon, i dont know man. It's really raising the bar. (Although nothing beats Kami. http://www.yelp.com/biz/kami-tustin R.I.P Kami.)

The Food:
Okay so for your sake and mine, I will keep this brief. Fish quality, yeah it's fresh, real fresh (makes you wonder how they do it...i mean, they are in the dessert afterall...) They have specials that i assume changes daily, and they are amazing. Yellowtail belly? keep em' coming! Conch? hell yes. 
Sushi mon have some sushi items that are not on any list i've ever seen.  
although be warned: they put a small, small bit of wasabi to hold the fish to the rice. If you hate that...well...um...
THEY HAVE DESSERT! :D It's part of the all you can eat menu. now that's amazing. I think that's what all my girlfriend ate...

her: \"baby can you order me red bean ice cream?\" 
her: \"baby can you order me another green tea ice cream? oh! with strawberry mochi ice cream please!\" 
Me: \"excuse me miss, can i get another strawberry mochi ice cream please? and an order of tempura ice cream for myself-\"
her: \"oh i want one of those too!\" 
me: \"...make that two.\"
Story of my life...by the way, lychee sorbet, talk about a home run. and i don't even play baseball. 

They have an extensive appetizer menu, that's all on the list for all you can eat, which really sets them apart from a lot of places. Salmon Collar? bring me like 20 please.

To really go the extra mile (which is also ironic because we drove 200+ miles to get to vegas...I think i'm using irony wrong) , they have this topping menu that you can order from to accompany any of your orders. Quail egg, masago, orgasm sauce...dont ask. I didnt. 
(Just like my underwear, this section wasn't really brief, now was it?)

*notice i didn't really talk about the rolls. :x my buddies went at that, i stuck to the nigiri. beause i'm a hipster. whateeeever*

The Service:
I'm more use to the aptly named \"southern california\" version of all you can eat sushi, which refers to a checklist that you can give to the waitress. Why Sushi Mon or Oyshi never adapted to this is beyond me. It makes life so much easier! But in both Sushi Mon and Oyshi, their waiters and waitresses will go up to you and write down what you're ordering. Needless to say, that poor lady was standing at our table for a good 10 minutes taking our orders. 

You come here. Come here now. Oh what? you can't decide between a vegas-style buffet, Oyshi, or Sushi Mon? 

FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS."}
{"text":"This place has much choices to choose from.  The price is a bit pricey for one hour of sushi and desserts, because by my 3rd dish I was already stuffed not even 15 minutes.  The choices were awesome though, warm sake was great, and never can go wrong with kirin beer.  The food was delicious except when I tried their spicy ahi, DANG, that was spicy."}
{"text":"i wouldn't think that an all-you-can-eat sushi joint would be any good, but this place surpassed my expectations. can't say it was the best sushi i've had, but they were good, and had other dishes as well.  the fried oyster, baked mussels, and sake shots were terrific.  nigiri & rolls we devoured.  i agree that the price could be a bit less.  

they do charge for unfinished food."}
{"text":"Average AYCE sushi, just as another reviewer said.
sushi is AYCE quality. not better, not worse than any other place. probably not returning again...

but just so you know what i mean by average AYCE:
-shrimp tempura made with anemic shrimp, not in panko but regular batter
-it's a plus they have uni but minus that it's not good quality
-plus that they have the raw shrimp. also plus that they deep fry the head, but minus that the deep fried head is very oily and a bit soggy. perhaps oil not hot enough?
-there's a 1hr limit
-white tuna and hamachi is decent quality

i've definitely had worse but i've also had better. meh."}
{"text":"Finally tried Sushi Mon recently and it was pretty good. Busy busy, but we got seated right away, lucky I guess. Lots of young people for the most part and some hoochie mamas came in wearing those tight slinky dresses, no other comment other than \"what the hec?\". We both had the All you can eat and for some reason the waitress kept asking if we would like 1/2 orders, not sure what that was all about, but we declined and got full rolls. Overall pretty good, but I was kind of suspicious when it took just a few minutes for our rolls to arrive. I know there is a whole lot of Sushi guys behind the counter, but how could several rolls with different ingredients come out in a matter of minutes? Pre-made? Say it ain't so! I can't confirm this, but it was kind of odd in all my years of eating Sushi. Some rolls were kind of oversized and you couldn't eat it in a single bite. We had a Spider roll that was softshelll crab on the ends, but the middles seemed to be unrecognizable and oversized. I really like UNI but seems it isn't a popular item and many places are usually out of it. Sushi Mon had it, but the flavor was just a bit off, maybe out of season? I don't know but other Sushi Bars never get UNI as good as it should be. Overall good value for the price. Didn't really have a roll that stood out above the rest and my next visit will be just random ordering since none of the rolls were truly memorable, but still a good effort and we'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and my family was staying down the street over at South Point. My dad found this before we left for the vacation and decided we wanted to try it. 
Originally, he was going to do a la carte instead of AYCE. He definitely does not regret his choice. 

Sitting at the bar is a better experience in my opinion because you don't need to order thru any of the servers. The chefs were all Japanese except one and even though Yoshi, the chef who helped us, didn't look Japanese, he's from the same city my dad is from. Yoshi made our experience better because he made sure to check up on us every once in a while, while still attending to other people at the bar. 

As for the other servers, some were good and some weren't. The younger ones were friendlier and had better attitudes and I learned to ask from them. 

Food wise, everything comes out quick, even when you order items like takoyaki or baked mussels that are prepared in the back. This may be because we sat in front of the chef who would hand it to us but even the fried items came out quick. 

The rolls are mediocre. What I like though, is that you can order a half order instead of the whole thing to avoid getting full and allowing you to try more food. Where I go in LA, they don't have that option so it;s best to go with a big group or you'll get full off 2 orders of rolls. 

My absolute favorite thing about this place,though, is that dessert is included as AYCE. I don't know if it;s a Nevada thing but dessert is always a la carte at other AYCE sushi places. And the dessert is good. They have tempura ice cream, mochi, creme brulee, and sorbets. The lychee sorbet was definitely my favorite but we also tried the yuzu sorbet and the green tea creme brulee. 

Overall, it was a really good experience and I wish LA had this place. Thank you Yoshi, and the three servers who were kind."}
{"text":"I must say the food is usually good. However, the service is terrible. The servers are not attentive at all. The bussers obviously are not aware of the fact they should be picking up plates etc. throughout a persons entire meal instead of letting them pile up. 

Service at the sushi bar is okay. Servers don't seem to pay much mind to those eating at the sushi bar.

The few times I've ate here I've received the same horrible service. So sad.. Management should have a meeting with staff in regards to service and what it should be.

Think I tried for my last time as it's always disappointing...."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time we've eaten here and the sushi is always fresh. It's a small restaurant so there can be a wait. It about 15min outside of the strip but it's worth the drive. They serve sweet shrimp sushi and white tuna which are my favorites here. I only order sushi so I don't know about the other dishes. The last time my wife and I came here we waited about 20min which wasn't bad. If you enjoy fresh sushi this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Finally, an AYCE sushi spot that has variety, fresh sushi, great service, and the whole menu is included. It's a bit of a drive from the strip but worth the trip, especially for their sweet shrimp, Toro, and salmon belly sushi.

The best part is it's only $26. For what they serve its totally worth it. You'll spend that inside a hotel/casino cafe easily."}
{"text":"MMmmmmMMMMmmm!!  

First time here. From what i heard from others, I think they raised the price up a bit. Is it because it's NYE weekend? I'm not sure. From $26 to $28...still a bargain for AYCE sushi. You can also opt to do a la carte. But really, who wants to do that? 

It's a small intimate space with a sushi bar. We sat at the sushi bar to get to know the sushi chefs and watch them make the sushi and rolls. Basically, you get to order from the entire menu...AYCE. So many to choose from. My mom who doesn't eat raw fish went for the special rolls and cooked items...she was in heaven. 

For those of us who are fans of sushi and LOVE fresh fish...all I can say is YOWZAH and MORE please! Each AYCE patron gets one order of Toro and Uni. Unfortunately, the night we came, there was no Uni left. But the Toro was delicious. I have never had Toro before so I was surprised that it resembled fresh meat. Is that fish? Wow! So fresh and so good.

My fave is salmon so I ordered it in bulk. It was so fresh, no smell and no sign of fishiness at all. I am so against not so fresh fish...that the freshness of the fish we were served here competes with more expensive a la carte sushi locations I have been to in the past. My experience here was amazing. 

I had lots and lots of special rolls, hand rolls, nigiri sushi, shrimp tempura, mussels, dynamite etc, etc, etc that I was bursting at the seams. I barely could breathe when walking out of there. 

We all had a wonderful time and this was the first time I have ever been to an AYCE sushi where I can say that the fish is fresh and tasty. Great experience for sure and even the chefs and the servers were friendly, quick to serve and the sushi chefs kept asking us constantly what else we wanted.

I will for sure come back here again with my appetite in tow. Until we meet again...."}
{"text":"CONS: Busy, busy, busy, and you'll always be seated crammed up against other people.

PROS: It's busy because it's delicious, the fish is fresh, and while the wait staff is busy, they've always been really cool. The AYCE is fantastic, and they have great combos that are yummy as they are affordable. I judge a sushi place on their nigiri, and this place has yet to let me down."}
{"text":"Hrm... Have to update my review as I'm not sure how I feel about this place anymore... 

Between  November 2015 and now (January 2016) my boyfriend and I have gotten AYCE here about 5 times. Our last two times were not as great as the first three, so we will probably be finding a new sushi place ): 

Our first bad experience - We came with our friends in the middle of the day and sat at a table instead of the sushi bar like we usually do. The service was slower, some of the rolls tasted a little different than usual, however, overall, still a good experience! Until they brought the check out before they even brought out our friends ice creams. We reminded them that we only received half of the desserts we ordered, so they cashed us out and then brought the ice cream. OK, no harm, no foul. My boyfriend and I had finished our ice cream and our friends were still finishing theirs and drinking their hot green tea. However, since we had payed at this point, they asked us to leave so they could \"get the table ready for the next guest\" (!!) I was a little disappointed by this as we already felt rushed when they brought the check out before the dessert. Not to mention there was not a long wait at this point (only one family who had just walked in, and clearly we were about to be finished and leave, just finishing up drinks), and we would have gladly moved to the bar while our friends finished their teas and then left. The whole situation just felt rude and I was disappointed that we had raved about this place to our friends, asked them to come here with us, only for us to get kicked out at the end of our meal! It was pretty rude and we wouldn't have tipped so well if we knew they were going to treat us like that...

While that left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, we decided it was probably just a fluke on the hosts part and wanted to give this place another try, especially since we have never had bad service before! So we came around noon and went to the bar like usual, the place was already pretty full this time, even though they just opened. The usual sushi chef we have (I forget his name, but he is hispanic, very friendly man and super good at his job!) was not here this day. The chef we got was super slow and the rolls didn't taste the same as usual (fish wasn't as fresh maybe? or chef used different ingredients? I'm not sure). He also wasn't very personable, whereas the other chef was always saying hello, asking how you liked the roll, and cracking jokes! It wasn't all on the sushi chef, though, because our edamame came out from the kitchen burnt! The server, nonetheless, plopped it down in front of us. Even the nigiri tasted different, and sub-par, which is usually so fresh and my favorite thing here!

I will probably give this place one last try, however I don't have high hopes after my last two experiences here. Looks like we will just have to find a new sushi spot. /:




TL;DR -
Used to love this place, last two experiences have not been as great. Check came before dessert so we were rushed through it, then asked to leave to 'clear the table for the next guest' even though our friends were still finishing up. Gave it one more shot and sushi wasn't fresh, edamame came out burnt, and food was just all-around sub-par."}
{"text":"Ill be honest they have delicious food BUT THEIR SERVICE IS TERRIBLE! We waited 15 minutes until a server notice us that were still waiting. Yes 15 minutes bfore he ask what we wanted for drink! There are 3-4 servers walking around lookin at every table but ddnt even bother asking us. I understand its busy but even the two people in their front desk didnt call a server to get us started with our orders!"}
{"text":"Great first impression! We were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess as the rest of staff greeted us also. 
My husband and I each ordered the all you can eat dinner.  Great selection and variety, even the desserts! Definitely not disappointed!"}
{"text":"What's for lunch? So on the day I visited Sushi Mon, I wasn't sure what to have for lunch, so I mindlessly drove to the plaza where Sushi Mon resides. As I pulled in, I remembered, I've never been here. So I gladly pulled up and parked in front of Sushi Mon. Came in and it was nice to see that even though the restaurant had just opened up a few minutes ago, people were already inside with their orders coming out.  Good sign so far.

Since I was there by myself and only two open tables, I thought it would be okay to sit at the bar. Got the menu and I was glad to see they had a bentos on their lunch menu. Btw, lunch menu is reasonably priced. I chose the simple chicken katsu and CA roll meal that was nicely priced at $7.50. Yay, that means lunch is going to be under $10, including tip.

Everything on my plate was tasty from the salad with ginger sesame salad dressing, my all-time favorite japanese potato salad and CA roll.  Because it is a lot of rice, I wasn't able to finish up the CA rolls which is fine because that meant I could have it later for dinner.

Good customer service, clean restaurant, nice atmosphere and just as important, great price! 5-stars for this lunch experience."}
{"text":"Granted, I was extremely hungry when I ate here for a delayed lunch on a day full of celebrations, but this place made quite the favorable impression on yours truly.

The four of us gallant fellows all opted for the AYCE deal for maximum value. This also allowed us to pool our various orders and get the most variety while we also got the most bang for our buck. Sitting at the bar is advisable if you want to get straight to business. Obviously, lunch will deliver a better value.

The miso was a boon to us dehydrated souls. The Nigiri is all very solid. Their garlic tuna is a delicious standout, and you can't go wrong with the yellow tail. The mackerel offers that ever so distinctive fresh water taste-- may not be for everyone.

You could just as easily fill up exclusively on their specialty rolls and definitely not go wrong there. The Hurricane impressed me most of all-- so many flavors dancing on the tongue that I couldn't even describe them to you. Ecstasy roll = solid. The Flying Jason, while delicious, should be ordered with caution. It's one of the cooked rolls and contains melted cheese with a distinct, mustard like aftertaste. Great stuff but it is very filling and should probably be ordered right before dessert if at all (if you care about maximizing your value). The same goes for the Baked 428-- yummy but oh so filling. 

The tempura ice cream-- I don't know how many sushi places do this but this place definitely does it RIGHT. Perhaps the most guilt ridden dessert per gram-- it is a serving of mochi covered in a doughnut like tempura crust that creates an absolutely heavenly experience (and one that can be enjoyed with chop sticks, nonetheless!) You must order this, at least once in your life.

If you are in the mood for gorging on quality sushi and don't want to shell out the cash for a place on the strip, I can promise you that Sushi Mon will lull you into a peaceful food coma."}
{"text":"usually i go to sushi mon's sister restaurant, Goyemon, but this place is much closer to my house so i go when i need a quick sushi fix. Its a pretty small restaurant, but they don't get crazy busy. 

I like the fish to rice ratio for their sushi; they don't add a ton of rice to each piece of fish to fill you up. I recommend their monster roll. It's pretty good, and its huge!"}
{"text":"My in-laws wanted to get all you can eat sushi and this place had the shortest wait time.  We were skeptical at first but compared to the other all you can eat sushi places in Vegas, we really liked it here.   They give you a very small amount of rice without the overpowering seasoning of Yuzu on the sushi.  The choices for appetizers and daily specials are very abundant compared to the other places.  Fish tasted fresh and pretty good for an all you can eat restaurant.  Our server was excellent and always had a smile on his face despite the numerous times we placed our orders.  The only disappointment was their dessert.   But after stuffing yourself with so much food, there is barely any room for dessert anyways.  The more popular all you can eat spots in Vegas will have you waiting for over an hour.  I think this place is less busy but offers better food.  Definitely worth the price!  Free sake when you show Facebook check in!"}
{"text":"I was looking for an AYCE place close to my house, and decided to give Sushi Mon a try. The interior is small but nicely decorated, and service was prompt. I had no wait when I went for dinner, but I also went after 9PM.

The food itself was tasty and consisted of standard AYCE fare. I don't remember anything particularly standing out, but it was all decent quality. Prices were comparable to other AYCE sushi places in town."}
{"text":"The best option at Sushi Mon is of course the all you can eat.  You can eat as much as you can for 45 minutes or so.  I love this place b/c the sushi is super fresh and well prepared.  You can tell by examining the cuts of salmon -- Sushi Mon's salmon is some of the best I've had.  If you're not w/ a big group, I would suggest sitting at the bar b/c you can request orders directly to the sushi chef w/o having to tell the waiters/waitresses.  Sushi Mon has the special rolls, but I love the plain sashimi on nigiri rice rolls.  You have to try the salmon, tuna, and surf clam.  A specialty this restaurant has that no other place has is the sea urchin and sweet shrimp on rice.  These are only served at dinner and you can only order one order per person per all you can eat check.  It's sooooo good mainly b/c the cuts are so fresh.  If you are a newbie to Sushi Mon, please come at dinner time to request the sea urchin and sweet shrimp -- you will not regret it.  Another dish I recommend is the baked mussels -- phenomenal.  You have to try this!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure I understand all the glowing reviews for this place but it just didn't do it for me. It may have been the boiling rage I had just experienced in finding out Kan Pai no longer offers AYCE that sent me into a sushi rage. Luckily, Sushi Mon is no more than a quarter mile down the street so we decided to give it a shot.

At $26.95 this place was HOPPING. One of my main issues with this place is that it is very small and when it is busy it can become extremely cramped looking at their gigantic menus. Couple that with busy sushi chefs who only occasionally look your way and waitresses that have to be stared down for even a glass of water and I was already a bit perturbed even before trying anything.

The rolls were subpar and their special mango mesquite roll just had some funky flavors going on and I couldn't figure out if it was tasty or disgusting which is a first for me. Their nigiri menu was plentiful and tasty, and the best roll is definitely the chubby roll. I would HIGHLY advise anyone against ordering the 9-1-1 roll as it is legit painful to eat. Normally when I order the roll elsewhere it is a bit spicy but nothing compares to having to eat about half the ginger in front of you and having to guzzle 3 glasses of water and STILL having the burning sensation on your tongue. I am going to have nightmares about that roll and each of us could only muster one piece. Eater beware!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth all the hype! The quality was great and we stuffed our faces.

Favorite rolls:
Ectasy
Seared salmon!!!

Less favorite:
Snow carb GROSS, stay away!

Tips: 
-get your name in because there will be a wait
-come with multiple people so you can split stuff and try a lot
-my favorite place about this place is that it allows half orders so u can try different things, so take advantage of it!"}
{"text":"I thought it would be like sakana but guess not. Sushi mon doesn't specialize in rolls. But overall it was alright."}
{"text":"OMG. i think i Have a new favorite buffet sushi place! too bad it's in Vegas!!! 

So this is not your typical buffet. it's all you can eat, but they take your order and serve it to you. :) Awesome for us lazy bums. 

decently priced too! under 30 bucks for lunch or dinner. 

Uni- this is the first time i've enjoyed Uni. yummy buttery goodness 

fresh Scallop sushi. omg this was sweet and amazing! 

Miso soup was also like it was home made and the perfect balance of salt and miso. 

will definitely try to talk my friends into coming her our next trip out to vegas! :)"}
{"text":"Not a fan of all you can eat places, particularly when seafood is involved. Often it is an indicator the a la carte is going to be sub par. That being said, seems many of the LV sushi places are all you can eat. Sushi Mon is close by so have tried 2x. It did the trick for a few mediocre rolls of average construction.  Tried the softshell crab tempura which had a funky been sitting in the freezer too long taste.

The service is average as well. Am unsure why this place has gotten such rave reviews. Agree with some other yelpers this place is over-hyped"}
{"text":"Sushi here is good - not as extensive as some other places in town I've seen, but enough to provide plenty of variety to all but the most extreme of sushi snobs (of which I am not). 

I tried the seaweed salad, several different nigiris, and a few rolls during my AYCE experience. All was very good, and came out quick too. Bonus for AYCE is you can do half rolls... Allows for more variety so why not?

The service was pretty quick and the sushi chefs were super friendly. I can't say that it's the best sushi I've had in town - but it seems pretty darn good for a strip mall in Henderson. I'd definitely be up for sushi mon again, not sure I can fill up their buy 10 get one free AYCE card though, that just seems a little implausible to me... But hey, you give it a try."}
{"text":"Came here twice for lunch. The first time had the bento box with salmon and the 2nd time we sat at the bar but I ordered the veggie bowl. It was good, but not amazing. I have this dream of this amazing bento box but I dont think it exists. I love the idea of a bento box, but I havent found one that blows me away. 
So, if you come here for the AYCE, I can't vouch for it. I generally dont do AYCE. I have a few pieces, and I'm set.
Both times we were seated quickly and food was quick too."}
{"text":"Tried a few other AYCE places here in Las Vegas and this Sushi Mon is still the go to spot.  I've introduced many of my friends from So Cal and they always make a special trip out here when they are in town.  The fish is fresh and the cuts are amazing.  Very friendly service each time and they don't balk if you go over you 1 hour.  I highly recommend this place and I'm upgrading it to 5 stars because of the consistency of the staff, food and portions each time I come to Sushi Mon.  I has not changed in the 1 1/2 year that I've been coming.  Keep up the great work.

**Not to mention they have a frequent eater card, buy 10 get 1 free**"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped by last weekend for dinner and we are probably the only people who have not done the AYCE option. We decided to go a la carte. Neither one of us were in the mood for rice so she ordered some edamame and tuna sashimi. The edamame was blah but the tuna was fabulous. 3 huge cuts of fish that were so rich in color and soft and buttery in texture.

I got the sashimi dinner ($17.95), which came with miso soup (very good) and salad (nice, crisp lettuce with a peanut sauce drizzled on top). The sashimi consisted of 5 different types of fish, each with 3 generous slices. And by generous, I'm talking about half an inch thick. The tuna was clearly the best of the bunch, with the yellowtail not far behind. The salmon was also delicious and the white fish was decent. But the disappointment of the night was the albacore. It had a weird after-taste to it. The dinner also came with 2 pieces of crab. Before I ordered I wasn't sure if the dinner would fill me up but it turned out to be plenty of food. I didn't even have room to try the strawberry mochi.

The service was a little spotty. It took a while to get our drinks and they forgot the edamame, so we had to remind them. Then after we finished eating we waited and waited and finally had to flag someone down to bring the check. But, the fish is good enough to warrant a return visit.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved closer, I have been coming back more often.  I think every visit, it has gotten better and better!  I am glad I can update my review, because the staff and chefs deserve the five stars.  Keep rocking sushi mon!"}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 * but I am feeling a bit generous since they have the lychee sorbet, so am rounding it up.

I have been feigning for raw fish and the last experience at Goyemon (service was lackluster, out of uni, out of lychee sorbet) and at Tomo Sushi (service was wonderful, but uni didn't taste fresh, the sauces on some pieces of nigiri wasn't great, desserts were not good), were not good.  Finally, we decided to give Sushi Mon a try.  I know it is from the same Goyemon family, so I was hoping that they have all the same items, but may be better service?

We dined at 6pm yesterday and we got a table right away.  I was excited to see salmon belly, toro, Hamachi kama on the specials board.  I was so excited that I couldn't contain myself, and spilled soy sauce on my place mat.  A lot of sauce.  But, the waiter didn't care...business as usual.  Didn't offer napkins, another place mat, nada.  As soon as our orders of nigiri came out, I didn't care as well.  The toro was not bad, conch was not sweet, but the salmon belly and super white were delicious!  We ordered a total of 6 orders of salmon belly and super white, and other (hotate was not as fresh and sweet as the ones we had at Goyemon before, saba was ok, didn't care for the meintako, the ikura with quail egg is good, Hamachi kama was yummy, ameabi was small but sweet).  I ended the meal with 3 scoops of lychee sorbet.

I was quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Late post (First time here was January 2015) but:
Good service, great food, pretty fresh fish. And LADIES, they have purse hooks under the bar!!! Lol

Sushi chefs and waiters/waitresses are very attentive and consistently check in with you to refill drinks and take your side dish orders.

My boyfriend & I were on a huge sushi kick after trying this place we came to eat AYCE here for 3 days in a row... Now we're sick of sushi for like a year but next time we want some we are definitely coming here!"}
{"text":"By far, my favorite sushi restaurant here in Las Vegas!  How they manage to serve quality tasting fish in the middle of the desert is beyond me!  I normally tackle the all-you-can-eat menu, which allows me to try everything in small portions (great when trying new items, or just enough before you call it quits!). The nigiri is great, as well as their house specialty rolls, which I suggest ordering later so you don't cork up your appetite so soon. Don't forget to save room for dessert(s) which is also included in AYCE- the tempura ice cream and lychee sorbet are my favorites!  For smaller appetites, the \"screaming orgasm,\" curry and udon are delicious \"regular menu\" options.  The staff is always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is casual and fun. Being such a popular restaurant, you and your party may not be seated right away, but it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The Sashimi Lunch is one of my favorite meals in Henderson. The Sushi is always fresh and they slice it thin for me. The Miso Soup and Salad come with it. A healthy and affordable Lunch!"}
{"text":"When ever I visit Vegas I try to make it a point to visit this place once before I leave. Great staff. Food comes such with the ayce. Great taste. I will constantly repeat."}
{"text":"I prefer sashimi over special rolls. A la carte over all you can eat. And eating sushi in non-landlocked states. But I absolutely love Sushi Mon--I love it so much that I forgot about my distinct preferences and had both AYCE lunch ($24) and dinner ($27) here in the same week.

There are dozens of items on the menu, everything made to order, including nigiri, special rolls, side dishes and rice bowls. I assumed the 45-minute limit for lunch and one-hour limit for dinner would be insufficient, but the human body is superhuman under pressure and  service is so fast it redefines fast food. 

The baked green mussels are out of this world. I must have had five on my first visit. I also can't get enough of the special rolls like the spider and volcano. The best part is you can order half rolls, so you can try more rolls. As if the menu selection wasn't enough, there's ice cream to complete your meal.

Creative, delicious sushi. Great, friendly service. Excellent, unbeatable value. I'm a big fan. Soon to be the fattest fan."}
{"text":"I love sushimon! In fact I even had my birthday here ! If you have your birthday there, they give you a free t shirt. And it's really convenient because a nothing bundt is right next door so that's where I got my birthday cake from. I have also been for their lunch sushi special which is only $9. It comes with California roll and sashimi sushi rolls. It also comes with miso soup and salad! I love it here and love coming back!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would, I came here years ago and it used to be my favorite sushi place. I moved and haven't came back since, BUT was in the area and came to try it again yesterday with a girlfriend and I have to say it was the worst experience and sushi I've ever eaten... it took us 15 minutes between each roll to actually receive our sushi rolls! The sushi was DISGUSTING , full of fat and every roll tasted the same, Like they covered it with salt, they were all extremely salty. It was busy and everyone was getting there food on time but my table, only got to eat two rolls each because we were almost at our time limit ! Slowest sushi makers and service ever . Thank god I never came back when I moved until yesterday... get your restaurant together !"}
{"text":"In this first visit to this wonderful establishment, it has easily become my favorite All You Can Eat sushi place. The food was fantastic. I highly recommend the Red Dragon roll, the Athena roll, and the Spider roll. I also enjoyed the Yakitori chicken, the Steamed Mussles, the Poki Tuna, and the Shumai. I definitely recommend this to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"The guys that deliver water are very nice and the sushi chefs are totally awesome!  The waitresses never have a personality and won't speak to you at all if you don't ask them a specific question.

One of the sushi chefs recently went way out of his way to help me out when my bill was like $30 more than it should have been.  Without his help I don't think they would have ever gotten it right!

The sushi is great. The chicken is not.  The lunch specials are a great deal!"}
{"text":"Every time anyone asks about sushi or wants to know where to get good sushi, I always refer them to Sushimon. 

Now, don't get me wrong, this place is not perfect. However having tried more than a few spots in town, and seen the many gimmicks put up by other places, Sushimon remains my favorite sushi spot. 

All the negatives that people mention about this place are technically  true

- This place is not close to the strip.
- The wait time can be long(sometimes topping out at 1 hour +
- The restaurant is smallish.

However, if you're visiting Vegas, and really want good sushi, is it  that horrible to drive an extra 10 minutes to not have to deal with casino parking, not have to walk a mile and a half to get to the place, and not deal with the absurd prices you often find at restaurants on the strip?

I've often found, that any restaurant, be it big or small that can produce a full house and wait, is doing something right.

Sushimon doesn't offer you fine dining service. It's not going to blow you away with it's superior service.

I don't know about you guys, but I really don't think that matters.

If you're getting AYCE Sushi, you already have an idea of what kind of sushi you want, and what your preference is.

All the server's I've seen at Sushimon are good at getting the food out, and keeping the drinks full.

You could go to some dirty place in the middle of a bad neighborhood and get Sushi for $4-5 cheaper, sure.

But Sushimon offers almost their entire menu on their AYCE and All-you-can-eat Dessert as well. 

I know a lot of places mark off menu items and only offer you one dessert.

Things I LOVE from Sushimon

Nigiri:
- Hamachi (Yellowtail)
- Salmon
- Super White Tuna
- Unagi

Other offerings:
- Hamachi Collar(most places don't offer this, and they sometimes run out, but if they have, order it!)
- Salmon Collar
-All the rolls(and 1/2 rolls for almost all of them if you want to try the roll without getting too full, again something most places don't offer)
-Uni(Sea Urchin) (one per person)
-Ama Ebi(sweet Shrimp) (also one per person)

Dessert(AYCE)
-Mochi Ice Cream (Strawberry/Vanilla)
-Green Tea, Red Bean, and Lychee Ice Cream
- Tempura Ice cream

Sure you could in theory find a cheaper place than this, in a more \"glamorous\" location, but if I'm gonna shell out $20+ for a meal, I don't mind paying a little bit more knowing that my meal is going to be good. Sushimon offers you a large menu to choose from, speedy service, and most importantly, consistency. I've been here at least a dozen times, and haven't once had a bad experience. 

In case anyone is wondering, they DON'T do call ahead seating, so you have to arrive in person to get your party on the list."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good. Nothing extremely memorably delicious but I remember leaving very full and happy. It is a pretty small restaurant. They have a menu that you can order from and the sushi chefs make it to order so you know it hasn't been sitting around. They have Asian flavored ice cream (red bean, lychee and green tea) as well as strawberry mochi. The desserts are the reason I'm giving them the 4th star. Lychee sorbet and strawberry mochi is a must. Had 2nds of both. Definitely a good alternative to all the buffets at the LV hotels."}
{"text":"We had the absolutely worse experience here!!!! I can't even give them any stars. The hubby & I decided to go out for some sushi & live right up the street. We've been here a lot. This Thursday night it looked like they had large party so we stood at the door for about 5 minutes waiting patiently & no one acknowledged us. So after a while my hubby see see to open tables at the bar & so we decide to sit. They bring our drinks, we put in an order & after about 10 minutes one of the servers come over & asks us who sat us. My husband was like we did. Now at this point we've been seated for about 10 minutes & I need a refill on my water. The server tells us that we have to get up because there is a waiting list. While this is going on the people behind us were also arguing with a different server because they sat their party on a table that does not really fit his party.
Anyway, my hubby is asking the guy if he's serious. The server looks at the owner and says yes but we can add you to the waiting list. My mouth completely dropped.  I could not believe as we are enjoying our dinner they want us to stop & step out but still want us to come back. We will never come back. Never did they say sorry. We are so unbelievably shocked at their service & attitude we will never go back!!!!! My husband has just about told the story to everyone he knows!! He's in sales & it's now a part of every conversation he has. It's too bad. I use to like it there. And the only reason I'm giving one star is because I USE TO like it there!!! Shame on them"}
{"text":"Not the best. There are cheaper places with happy hour and better quality foods. This place is definitely a place for a quick midnight dinner after a long day. The sushi is pretty good and the noodles aren't that bad either. I say it is a pretty typical sushi bar."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised to see all these mediocre ratings for sushi mon! My experience today was far from those low reviews, if anything I'd say that the quality and service was probably one of the best I've had from any sushi place in a long time!!! My boyfriend and I did AYCE as usual, and at $27 we thought it was pretty pricy, but stayed anyway since it had been a year since we'd last been here. We love to order nigiri, so I'll try to remember everything: 

-tuna
-garlic tuna 
-tako
-salmon 
-blue fin toro 
-euro sea bass 
-poki
-ebi 
-yellowfin 
- 1/2 911 roll
- 1/2 a chi chi 
- 1/2 sexy girl 
- 1/2 crispy rice 

I can't go into detail describing every dish since it's all pretty self explanatory and the last 4 specialty rolls I forget what was in them :(  I will tell you this though, the quality of the fish was superb, especially the salmon belly and toro (it melted in your mouth!) but the best part was the quantity of fish!!! Some places they give you a huge chunk of rice with a thin later of fish... Not here, not this time! Thick ass pieces!! Excuse my language, I'm just that excited!!! And our chef, BEN, was super nice, explained every kind of fish, their delivery dates, and even made us some nice nigiri pieces that were not on the menu. This totally made the price well worth it, and the staff weren't awkward when we ordered half their inventory, like we usually do when we order sushi.  We also arrived right after the lunch menu, 4pm, so it was not crowded and noisy, and had all their attention!! 

Great place, friendly staff, superb service, and superior quality and quantity of fish. Shout out to Ben once again for the service!!! 
Thank god I wore my stretchy pants today!!!"}
{"text":"Came with some co-workers who have never eaten here...Boy, were they in for a treat! We waited for about 45 minutes but as always, its worth the wait.

Got our usuals with all the specials of the night, which included

Aji
Amberjack
Conch
White Clam
Kobe Beef(American)

Honestly, I don't know how they profit, but also I hope they don't ever close...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from both our server and the sushi chef. We came in on a Wednesday night and all the tables were full but the host got us a nice little seating area at the sushi bar. I honestly think sitting at the bar was the best way to do AYCE. You order your side dishes, rolls and desserts from the super attentive waiter and order your nigiri dishes directly from the sushi chef.

The seating time is limited to 60 minutes but the food comes out so quickly that 60 minutes is plenty of time to get your grub on. 

I loved the huge selection on the menu and really enjoyed the ikura, salmon belly and super white tuna. The regular tuna wasn't the best though so skip it here. Loved the selection of desserts and side dishes. Baked mussel was delicious as was the seaweed salad. I wanted to try so much more but I was stuffed. I'll have to go back to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"I visited this sushi restaurant with a friend for lunch. I got the sashimi combo which came with a side salad and miso soup. The sashimi was tuna, yellowtail, some white fish and salmon. The side salad was actually quite disgusting. I had one bite and was done. My sashimi was overall okay. The white fish had an unusual texture that threw me off. I eat sushi quite often & will pretty much try anything but this was just not good. The prices are very reasonable. I would probably not return."}
{"text":"I came in here on a Thursday night with my brother. It was extremely busy & took about 30 minutes before we were seated. we ordered AYCE and it was delish! It's a bit on the smaller side. the fish was so fresh and tasty that I would definitely come back. price for the dinner AYCE was expensive @ $26. overall, very good!"}
{"text":"This Sushi-Mon is in my hood and recently was purchased by the Mon group, should be AWESOME right since Goyemon is the businesssssss. A decrease in the hour wait time, some delicious grilled pork belly, and various other delicious appetizers.

To echo Jen S. this is a goyemon-lite. They have some of the same appetizers, some of the same specials, and some of the same desserts. They also probably have the same quality fish assuming its the same supplier, but its definitely not the same here. The fish cuts are weird, the assembly of the sushi is different, and the rice is cool. When I say cool I don't mean cool like the button you're gonna hit after reading my review, but cool temperature. Perhaps they don't have the same rice warmer as Goyemon, but to eat cold uni and cold rice, blehhhhh.

Better than some AYCE places, but I will be continue my travels to Goyemon land."}
{"text":"The sushi here tasted like grocery store sushi, which really bummed me out because we drove pretty far to eat here. The service was excellent and everyone was very friendly. I had a roll called gone with the wind which was supposed to have avacado, but there was no avacado, it was substituted with asparagus, which I did not care for. All the rolls I ate were dried out tasting"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with the Mister for Valentine's Day weekend, and there was this Japanese girl who worked at the Fashion Show Mall (Coach Store) who recommended Sushi Mon to us if we wanted AYCE Sushi. Before visiting this place I use to be in love with Hikari because sashimi is included in the AYCE; but after discovering Sushi Mon, I now have a new love because this place has a HUGE variety of specialty rolls to choose from (even if sashimi is not included). 

Priced at $27.99 per person, I tried to eat as much as I could but I somehow failed that day. (I knew I shouldn't have eaten before dinner). I did the best I could though, the few rolls and appetizers I had spoke for itself - it was divine; the creativity, the fish, the rice, every ingredient that was used in the roll was so good and so fresh. Will be back for sure when in Vegas since my Honey is a \"Sushi Freak\"."}
{"text":"This is good... that is the simplest most correct way of talking about Sushi Mon... scratch that this is REALLY good.

I was suggested this place by a friend and I have been back 4 times in 2 weeks (alright I do have a sushi problem).  The fish here is fresh, the chefs have great suggestions as to new things to try and it is AYCE!!!  I even drive down from North Las Vegas for this sushi.

I am a big Uni (sea urchin) fan and have been consistently impressed with the quality.  My father (who used to go to Japan for business often) said that it was some of the best uni that he has had in the US.  The problem is they do limit you.  The other fish on the menu has consistantly been fresh and delicious.  Don't be afraid to try new things along with the gold standards (yellowtail, tuna, salmon) as they are all good.

Like most of the AYCE sushi places I have been to you can order anything on the menu including appetizers and dessert.  The menu is a good size with a nice variety of fish and rolls.  Another positive is that if you are the only diner for AYCE you can order half rolls.  This sushi place didn't try to fill me up on rice or give me a paper thin slice of fish.  I would rate this sushi place high for the AYCE AND the sitdown sushi places.

I guess that they have another location but I haven't been there.

Seating can be rough but I haven't had to wait long... for even less time sit at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I had to try this place for myself. After arriving and seeing a nearly full restaurant, I was surprise to see how quickly they sat us at the bar. Service was consistent and faster than I would expect from a restaurant that busy. Quality of the sushi was on par for the price. Atmosphere was lively and my favorite part of the evening. We soon found ourselves amongst friends as people chimed in either suggesting something for us to try or inquiring about certain rolls we had ordered. 

Wonderful food, great atmosphere, decent price. Will be back."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this place because it was recommended by a friend and also because of the 4 star yelp rating. I was a bit disappointed. 

Overall Rating: 3.5 Stars 

$26.95 for AYCE at dinner (60 minutes to eat) is not bad considering the tremendous selection they had available. They have the good stuff like toro, uni, amaebi, ikura (limit of 1 per person for the toro, uni and amaebi). There was an extensive list of nigiri, hand rolls and cut rolls and the list of cooked stuff was not too shabby at all. They even have dessert on the menu! The best part of my meal was the 2 natto hand rolls. I love natto and they rarely have natto anything at restaurants. A major plus is that they do not overload your items with rice. I know a lot of AYCE places stuff you with rice and then make you wait forever for your next item, but not this place. 

The downside? The good stuff wasn't actually that good! It was just average and not very consistent. My sister told me that her first order of salmon nigiri was good and the second order was dry. Huh? My uni was not fresh, the ikura was flavorless, the amaebi was a bit slimy and the toro was not bad but it wasn't exactly melt in your mouth. Also, other random pieces of nigiri that I had were just average. I am so torn! I really wanted to like this place but it's only just ok. Even though my natto hand rolls were da bomb, I know it comes out of a box so how hard is it to screw that up? 

I wouldn't mind coming here again because I love the selection. I just hope that I came on an off day and that the next time I come, I will be luckier."}
{"text":"This place has been consistently awesome since I was in college.  I feel that it is a Hawaii go to spot, and the food and service is always on point.  The all you can eat lunch special is a great deal, I just wish they had Hamachi Kama."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night that wasn't very busy. There were a couple tables open, and it didn't take long for someone to acknowledge me and place me at a table. However, it then took a full 20 minutes for someone to come up to me and ask me if \"I had already been helped,\" to which I could literally only shake my head \"no\" at her. I damn near stood up and walked out the restaurant. 

Shitty service aside, the food was ok, but you can easily do better than this place."}
{"text":"This review like a number of my other reviews is long overdue. For 4 years now Sushi Mon has been my quick, neighborhood go to spot when I'm in need of my fix. I'm literally down the street. With the exception of one incredibly gross, gut-wenching moment a few years back where me and some co-workers found a roach scrambling on our table as our waitress handed our bill, its been smooth sailing.. I'm glad because its said if you find just one of those mofos then its fairly certain theres an infestation. In this case I'm gonna chalk it up to a momentary lapse in unsanitary food practices and thankfully theres been no sight of those suckas ever since.

 It still gets busy during their peak times, prices are on par with the rest of them AYCE but I still fu*k with this place and the rest of the spots belonging to the Mon group."}
{"text":"Called and asked if they were still open at 10pm... they said last seating was at 11pm so told them we will be there asap... got there at 1040pm and walked in... they all gave us the death stare and told us they already finished last call... lol... i work in this industry, how are you going to lie and say such shit when even the posted sign says last seating is ar 11pm and last call is after that? Lame."}
{"text":"Say yes to:

Yellowtail
Amber jack
Baked mussels

Yakitori

Vegetarian:
Tamago sushi
Seaweed salad

Dessert:
Lychee sherbet
Green tea ice cream

Service was really quick and efficient. The wait was not too long on a Sunday night. AYCE dinner is $26.95 for an hour of eating.

The lychee sherbet and green tea ice cream were equally delish. The lychee had real lychee pieces and was really refreshing. The green tea ice cream was more like matcha green tea, very great. The mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream were not worth it. Food wise, the fish was pretty decent and fresh, the portions are small so you can try it all. Overall a really great deal!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I make sure to stop at least once for their AYCE sushi.

Why 5 stars?
-Place is open until 2AM! 
-Japanese sushi chefs
-small nigiri so you can eat more!
-fresh, fresh, fresh
-can order half rolls (get the OID roll!!!)
-daily special nigiri etc salmon belly
-bomb ass uni and amaebi (1 order per person)
-tempura ice cream
- Hamachi kama is amazing!
-$26.99 for all this? best value in town"}
{"text":"My favorite location for Sushi Mon. 
MMmmmm.

I miss this place.

I live in the bay area now but I still crave this place from time to time. The sushi is pretty average, honestly, and I've had fresher and more generous cuts in other places, but this place has an atmosphere that I miss. That neighborhood spot-type of atmosphere. Also, I've always found this place to be most consistent with taste/quality in their All-You-Can-Eat menu for both sushi and apps. It's also nice that when you do All-you-can-eat, your nigiri rice isn't packed in so big/tight that it's basically a rice cake under a thin layer of fish. 

Aaaaannnnddd you can eat here till like 1 or 2 am. OH, I miss Vegas & I miss Sushi Mon."}
{"text":"Definitely my FAVORITE place to eat. The service is great, the atmosphere is lively and fun and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Miso soup is a bit too watery...
Do not have much flavor...
All you can eat Sushi works for growing men...

A lot of rolls... Definitely not traditional or authentic
Japanese food, but... Overall is GOOD"}
{"text":"Such good food! And really good service! The all you can eat is probably one of the tops in town! The service is really good and their desserts are bomb. It's a pretty long wait for a table on the weekends around \"the dinner rush\" though, so just call ahead in case. I could LIVE on their baked mussels."}
{"text":"Me and my husband come here once a week. The food is nice, especially the fish is fresh, and the staff are very friendly and kind. You don't have to wait really long time for your food to come out comparing to other AYCE place that we've went. The staff always work with smiley face! You should try this place."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place in Vegas. Great date night spot without breaking the bank. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas. Sushi chefs are great. Hiroshima is so nice. And fish is fresh."}
{"text":"So yummy and great service.  Staff is always friendly and the sushi bar gents are great.  For the all you can eat dinner they have a fantastic dessert selection including green tea creme brule and fresh made chocolate mousse!!! Icing on the cake to all their amazing fresh sushi,  I even just gave them a list of stuff I liked and asked for a sushi roll that incorporated that and they did without flinching.
I took off a star for the wait time... word has gotten out how good it is."}
{"text":"Came here for the $10 AYCE sushi event for Sushimon's 10 year anniversary and it was awesome.  The fish was good and they were ultra-fast!  We ordered 4 orders of 6 types of nigiri and it was sitting on our table in 5 minutes tops.  I really enjoyed the garlic tuna nigiri and the cajun albacore nigiri and make it one of my frequent orders that day.  Didn't want to order any rolls because I was more focused on hitting up the nigiri and making sure to get my monthly nigiri fix.  My buddy ordered 5-6 orders of uni sushi (usually one order per person at other sushi spots) as well and got it just as fast as I did!  The food was pretty fresh and my group and I left super full from definitely stuffing ourselves with all the yummyness we could.

On a side note, we had to wait for 4 hours, but with the AYCE price this low and one hour of AYCE madness, I wasn't suprised or mad BECAUSE IT'S $10 DOLLARS!!  Just because some people don't have patience and/or didn't make an effort to come down earlier does NOT mean that Sushimon deserves a 1-star for not catering to you.  They took the price cut to give the public a nice treat and were simply overwhelmed with the response.  Yet, they turned up the production to 11 and kept the event going as best as they could.  No one was entitled to the $10 AYCE price and I definitely didn't feel like I was.  I came in as soon as possible, waited my turn, and got to enjoy the event as intended.

I give them 5 stars for dropping their price low, good foods, and giving us the best service they could while dealing with snooty ungrateful people.  Definitely stopping by again; Sushimon has made a customer out of me."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!! If you get all you can eat then you better order all you can eat first round otherwise you'll be waiting quite a while for the waiter to come back! Even when they are slow they always take forever to get to you. Best advice is to sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Sushi: prepare to not be seated edition. You will be bumped and told to wait well over an hour if a bigger group wants to be seated. The signs about not being seated if you don't have your complete party? Those count for you, not for them."}
{"text":"We decided to give sushimon a try for the first time.  We had a punch card from Goyimon/Sushimon where we get a free meal. I called before we went while I was at work to verify if they take the punch card for both location and the receptionist said yes. We drove from the north side of town to wait a long time to be seated for party of 4. 2 all you can eat and 2 that wasnt.  When it was time to pay I presented my card with a free meal and the waitress said they dont accept that cuz its a different owner now. WTF? I just called. After explaining, I asked for manager and explained again. Asked for the owner and was told she's here but she will tell me the same thing.  I even mentoned the card itself has both locations on there and that's why I called to very and on the same day Im being told it's owned by two different people now.  The waitress says its been for months that way...  All they did was apologize and denied me the free meal from the card.. Basically, we drove all the way from our side of town for nothing cuz we couldve had sushi just as good at Sushi Tachi and didnt slap a lot of rice on their rolls.... Just saying.."}
{"text":"If you love all you can eat and you can really eat that much sushi (meaning with the rice), then this is the place for you. Not only is everything fresh, but you get a menu where you can choose from. Of course the really expensive stuff you get limited to 2/person, but its totally worth it. 

The price is again, like buffets, per person so don't bother brining people that can't eat a lot or else it's not even worth it. The sweet shrimp is awesome and make sure you tell them to fry the head and eat it, caz its a delicacy. This is definitely the place I'm going to when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I liked here sushi quality.
Perfect amount of rice.
Chefs were very friendly.
Clean and good atmsphere."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time, so had to have Sushi Mon again while I was in town.  The price has not changed and they still have the stamp card (10 meals, 11th free).

For the most part, nothing has changed with the food.  The reason I'm giving them three stars is because of the knife work on the fish and the inconsistency of the nigiri.  Some of the fish, especially the four orders of salmon belly we got, looked like the chef took a box cutter to it.  Horribly jagged cuts at weird angles that really changed the taste and texture of the fish.  I usually really enjoy salmon belly since it has such a large fat content that it feels so soft and almost \"melts\" in your mouth.  Not this time.  The cut made the fish tough and stringy.  We had similar problem with some other cuts.  And it was weird that a lot of the nigiri were different sizes.

The best thing they serve here is the grilled hamachi collar.  Don't miss out on it!  And get the salmon collar as well, even though it's not as good.  We missed out on the salmon collar as they ran out around 5:30pm.  Goyamon does not have grilled fish collars and instead has pork belly, so these fish collars are why we come to Sushi Mon instead.

Few tips:
-Their best nigiri is not on the menu.  It's salmon belly nigiri with yuzu, a slice of lemon, and a slice of jalapeno.  Ask for it and they'll make it.

-You can order hand rolls too.  Get a salmon skin hand roll.

-The best apps are the calamari and the grilled mussels.  Order lots of these.

-Don't get the chicken skewer.  It's always dry."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?! Came in with my two siblings and three kids - all under the age of 7.  Was told that there was an hour wait for a party of six when there were two empty tables right in front of us.  After suggesting he combine the two, the greeter (Taku?) said the best he can do is to separate us - three ayce at the bar and the three kids at a table.  Are you kidding me?  How much does a little common sense cost us now a days huh?  They're kids for crying out loud!

Why I decided to stay is beyond me.  The service here is painfully slow.  Ordered two chicken katsu combos and a chicken teriyaki bowl for the kids and seriously, it took them 15 minutes to come out with the miso soup alone!  You can just imagine how long it took them to come out with their food.   Also, the wait time for our sushi was just the same if not longer.  Seriously, waiting more than 30 minutes for food is just too much.  Chop, chop!

So ayce... You can't share food, I get it.  But when my 5-year-old nephew wants a bite of my ice cream, gosh dang it, he can have a bite of my ice cream.  The need for our server, Jean, to act like it's the end of the world is just crazy.  Relax girl, just charge me an extra $3, not a big deal.  

The service here could be much better.  Shame.  One star for the food and another for the all you can eat ice cream that comes with it."}
{"text":"went here for sushi, yesterday. the food was pretty okay. but what really got me was how my friend and i were treated by our waitress. she forgot our water and we waited 15 minutes waiting for water until we had to call another waitress to get our drinks. then they also forgot our dessert, so we had to remind them again. i dont plan on going here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We had a delightful experience. The all you can eat sushi was full of great rolls. We will definitely be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"We're here usually once a month, never had any complaints, the service is prompt and excellent, not what you usually get with AYCE places. Food quality is always great, excellent value for money, creative rolls as well as tried and trusted standard. Always some fun specials you should be sure to check out on the boards. Parking is easy, great location, in particular if you're living on the west side."}
{"text":"NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE! Theres lots of sushi places in town to choose from, not worth being treated bad. I had a party of 13 with me and we were all present and there is a sign on the door that says 80% of your party must be present before being seated. There was a section for us to be seated but there was a party of 2 waiting on 3 more, that was hindering us to sit as a family. I asked them to have those 2 to get up and wait but they refused, I asked for a manager but no manager present. Now we were forced to sit at the bar, now I couldn't talk to my cousins on the otherside. It was supposed to be a wonderful family outing which turned horrible as we couldn't catch up with each other and couldn't communicate. At The end of the dinner, they were 3 extra rolls because we all couldn't communicate of who is ordering what and our servers couldn't tell us what was coming. So the server decided to charge us for the extra rolls. I asked them that why you made an exception for them breaking the rules but not us? I've been coming to this place for years and I'm always bringing 10-16 party with me. If not a large party, it's just my family of 3 or 4 and we eat there 2-3 times a month. I'm always in good hands with Ulyiss as be is always making sure our drinks are full and empty plates gets removed. But with this experience, never again and now I'm aware of all these social media review, I'm making sure non of my friends or family gets treated that way. I even had the server agree that I had all my party preset but sat a different party that WAS NOT 80% present."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place, and my bf goes here every time he comes to Vegas.  It's $23.95 for lunch and $28.95 for dinner for all you can eat. Dinner is the  lunch menu plus a few extra items, including the snow crab nigiri, fried oyster, and sake shooter.  I personally think that it's better to go for the lunch all-you-can-eat, because it's just a few extra items different for dinner.  
I'm all about the hamachi and the maguro, which are higher priced items.  So make up my share eating plate after plate of those items.  I love how their nigiri is very Japanese style, little rice.  I also had some of their rolls, which were good.  Their spicy tuna is good and spicy.  You can go there and order off the menu as well, but that's no fun.  Well my bf calculated how much we would have spent if we ordered all those items off the menu, and we at about $85 worth of food.  Good Deals!"}
{"text":"We sat down around 12:40 when the waitress sat us down, it took about another 5 minutes to get water and order our food I receive my food in about another 5 minutes so at 12:50 I got my food but the waitress forgot my other orders for my friend and we patiently waited for a while till we asked someone when it would come out. They said they would make it as soon as possible but the cooks just started watching while we waited. Then Zach came
Over and apologized and gave us our food, I'm really disappointed with our waitress and the cooks for wasting our time."}
{"text":"If you have never been here, then make sure you save your stomach for ALL-U-CAN-EAT SUSHI & Japanese Food!! YUMMMMMM!!!! definitely worth the 5 stars for fresh sushi and great tasting japanese food! The slightly bad part is NO RESERVATIONS, but you can get away with it if you come like an hour or two earlier than your \"reservation\" time, tell the hostess how many people are going to come, then it should cut on the wait time..never come last minute with a large group, thats just silly -- of course a great restaurant is going to be busy. and sadly sushi-mon is not a very large restaurant, so theres limited dining space. Okay, onto the food -- definitely get ahi poki, steamed gyoza, sushi rolls (it depends on your style, but avg people - if you want to try more rolls, ONLY ORDER HALF ROLLS instead of FULL ROLLS because you are required to eat everything you have...save your stomach and be smart). 9-1-1 roll was not very good, I warned you - but now you probably want to try it for yourself...lastly, save room for dessert, because i love green tea icecream and strawberry mochi! :)"}
{"text":"AYCE places can be hit or miss.  I highly recommend this place.  I have been here over over 10 times, and it is consistently good.  Yes, they do hurry you along, but this is not a romantice candlelight dinner.  It's a whirlwind of food that is thrown at you.  45 minutes later, you don't konw what hit you, but you are full and satisfied.

Their fish is fresh and their rolls are good mixture of sauces and flavors."}
{"text":"Beware!!!!!

It pains me to write this review, but if I can get one person to avoid the mistake we made tonight, it makes this yelp review worthwhile.  This place used to be a staple for my wife and me every Vegas visit, but we will never come here again.  We are disappointed that we have to find a new sushi place to come to, but this place is definitely not it anymore.

Sushi Mon changed ownership recently, and it really shows.  The cute Japanese lady is no longer at the cash register.  The new ownership charges the same price, but everything good about this place has gone.

The nigiri now comes with huge pieces of rice.  If you are a rice connoisseur, this place is for you.  It's a shame what the new management is trying to pull.  On top of that, the fish is not fresh.

My wife ordered a spicy scallop handroll, and it was overflowing with imitation crab.  I argued with the sushi chef, and he opened the handroll up and showed us the 2 pieces of scallop hidden in the bed of imitation crab.  Really??

The presentation of the salmon skin handroll looked like a kindergarten art project.  

The sushi chefs are inexperienced and can't get the sauce right.  The rolls are either too salty or falling apart."}
{"text":"Lots of good reviews on here so I went. Also kudos from co-workers. I am on the fence. Not very fresh, fish was warm and so was some of the rice. Sushi rollers ( would not call them chefs) not that friendly. Wait staff was okay. Tasted something funky in the Alaskan roll. Good thing they give you half rolls! I don't think I would try this one again."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi for a all you can eat restaurant. However the owner doesn't look very friendly and the service of the waitress is just ok."}
{"text":"We came by here again after a one-year hiatus.  Pretty much everything I wrote in my first review stands, the only reason why I'm taking a star away is to keep myself from overinflating my review scores.  So from now on, when I put something at five stars you know it'll be super mind-blowing!

Anyways I digress.  

Lunch and dinner prices went up a few bucks, to maybe $25 and $28.  We sat at the sushi bar this time, but didn't have good service from the chef - then again, they're probably used to people barking huge lists of food to them all day long instead of making small talk.  

I'm satisfied that this place still delivers good quality and value.  Look forward to stopping by next time I'm craving sushi - and lots of it."}
{"text":"Been here so many times, but on this occasion...

-The cuts of nigiri were horribly done.  My salmon had skin on it.
-Our waiter said, \"The ono needs to be unfrozen.\"

Ugh... frozen?  Did not live up to past dining experiences here.  And while I am a loyalist... Strike one Sushi Mon."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch specials with a friend. This restaurant has been consistently good   I had the sashimi plate that came with 9 pieces of fish, miso soup and a salad. My friend ordered 2 specialty rolls that also came with soup and a salad. Oh and slices oranges at the end. Perfect meal"}
{"text":"So we gave Sushi Mon another try and I must say  that it was better. The sushi is still not as cold as we would like it to be but it was better then our previous visits a few months back. So I am giving them 4 stars. The sushi tasted fresh and the mochi was frozen n not soggy we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great Sushi Spot. Love the food, presentation of the food, and the staff is great. I have been to this Sushi mon a few time now and it is always great. I will be back! Yummy"}
{"text":"Been trying a lot of different AYCE sushi joints after I moved and so far I've been unimpressed with the quality and selection of their rolls. Sushi Mon has both great value and product, the salmon and tuna tasted very fresh and the servers were quick and attentive. We sat at the bar and were attended to within the first minute (despite being mostly full) and were eating 5 minutes in. Normally I have to wait 30 minutes for a table, then another 10 minutes for an appetizer.

The selection of rolls and appetizers were varied enough, not the most eclectic I've seen but we loved almost everything we ordered, especially the Cynthia roll. Their baked mussels were pretty good as well. Didn't try the nigiri or sashimi so I can't review them but I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"My favorite AYCE restaurant in Vegas. I make it a goal to eat here set least once every time I visit. 

The rolls are tasty and I love that you can get 1/2 orders so you can try many different dishes and not have to waste food.  I used to always order rolls until I discovered that their nigiri is surprisingly fresh. My usual order consists of uni, sweet shrimp, shrimp head (tastes like shrimp chips and its not on the menu), yellow tail collar, 6 x super white tuna (I'm salivating just thinking about this buttery goodness), 5 x albacore (the Cajon albacore is also delicious), 4 x scallops ( giant Japanese scallops, not the dinky ones mixed in mayo), tempura ice cream, and lychee sherbert (the mochi is good too if you' re a mochi fan).

I eat like I'm preparing to hibernate for the winter. It's cheap and soooooooooooooo good. Mmm."}
{"text":"It's like experiencing a break-up, ate there tonight and upon entering the restaurant; I felt \"off\"  - something wasn't right.  The sushi chefs were wearing hats, they were new chefs, new waitstaff and later find...new owner.  

The owner, the sweet lady at the register, sold the business.  So sad!!  The food was still good, service was great but again ... it didn't feel the same anymore.

I'll still visit, I just hope that the new owners do not take away a lot of the old charm that the former owner built."}
{"text":"What a deal!

The place was pretty packed at 2 PM on a Sunday; our local friend said that lotsa people like Sushi Mon and it seems so from the reviews. 

We went for lunch and saw the lunch special: 2-roll combination comes with a side salad and miso soup. Our waitress was courteous and came back several times to take our order (I need pictures to decide!).  
I ended up ordering the spicy shrimp and Unagi roll. 

The food didn't come out all at the same time, but when you're busy, you're busy, and she brought the food out as soon as it was ready.

I thought they'd serve half (4 and 4) roll portions to make one roll but they actually served a 16-piece lunch.  Oh. Emm. Jee.  That was too much, but the rolls were good; soup was good (Miso generally tastes the same to me where ever), salad was fine (too much dressing for me). But it was a steal @ $8.50  :)

I would definitely return with an appetite and with or without a limited budget.  :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, But lately my dining experience there have gotten worse and worse.  Sushi is sliced paper thin, the rice is hard and dry, and service is terrible..  For the money that was spent it would of been better spent for sushi at Walmart.  But a few streets away SIN CITY SUSHI (Eastern/Serene) is superb but only open til 11.  Sushi Mon R.I.P"}
{"text":"Sushi mon is a great deal for an ayce. They have a great variety of rolls and sides that you can eat along with your sushi. I love sitting at the bar and being able to order as I go along. However, Depending on the time that you go, service can be a bit slow. They only down side to sushi mon is that uni is limited to 1 per person for the ayce."}
{"text":"The sushi was not all that great. The volcano roll #2 was disgusting. It was way too creamy & smelled funny. The only thing I liked was some Hawaiian roll. 

I only went there because my sister had a coupon but they didn't even honor it. 

The service was horrible. Every time my sister asked the sushi chef a question, he never acknowledged her. Nothing special about Sushi Mon. Bottom line..never coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome All You Can Eat Sushi!!
Traveled from Hawai'i and came to Sushi Mon for the first time with family. Decent price ($27) per person, all-you-can-eat dinner and dessert.
Although we came while it was busy, the wait to sit wasn't too bad.
The service was great, the waiters/waitresses we very attentive. The food was excellent- hands down ;)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi joint in Vegas. I've been coming here for the last 8 years whenever I'm in town and have a chance.

The main menu is pretty basic -- you can get almost any kind of sushi, rolls, and side dishes you can imagine. But the best part? Their special blackboard menu for the day, where you can order (sometimes limited) uni, sweet shrimp, toro, snapper, pork belly, salmon belly, and more! And as a bonus, ayce dessert including ICE CREAM!!! For the price, it's extremely great value.

Service is always superb and efficient.

Honestly, I wish they would open one in LA; I would go almost everyday."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon, yum yum (AYCE)! A friend told me sushi mon in Vegas, this time we were in vegas and planned to try out this unbelievable place.

{"text":"Visiting Nevada and stumbled upon this spot. There was a 45 minute wait for 4 on a Sunday night at 7. We barely waited 25 minutes and it was worth it! $27 all you can eat dinner. The fried calamari was the show stealer, definitely try it. The Pixie roll was delicious and the gyozas were pan fried heaven. Ate a healthy serving of sashimi and it was all fresh and tasty. Servers were attentive and food was great! Perfect spot for our last dinner in Vegas."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon has the best sushi ever! ALL YOU CAN EAT!!  Literally, all you do is sit there and they serve you! You get to order however much food you want and you can just sit in your chair and get fat!

The food is so good! You must order the FRIED SHRIMP HEAD and Ahi Poke!! I love this place!"}
{"text":"This must be the easiest, more informative review I will ever write; here we go!

All you can eat sushi + 2am close time + good quality + fair price + excellent service = Hell yeah!!

See? Easy!"}
{"text":"If you're gonna come here...YOU HAVE TO GET A SEAT @ the SUSHI BAR. TRUST ME! The chefs are just GREAT! Order the \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\"  Just tell them what you don't like...and they will keep making you the most delicious rolls ever! YUM! Never been let down here before. Every time I go to Las Vegas I have to stop by Sushi Mon....*drools"}
{"text":"Bad management, Bad Service! They advertise a special for 10.00 but when we got there they told us they weren't honoring that deal any more because too many people showed up!! Ummm not my problem. Instead of offering an apology for the wasted gas and time,they rudely just said no more. Don't bother going here."}
{"text":"http://www.ktnv.com/news/dirty-dining/dirty-dining-sushi-mon 
 *Look up Sushi Mon dirty dining!
Not only is the quality of sushi not fresh its sub par. The people making it weren't even Asian, I thought they were gonna bring me out an enchilada roll and horchata. What the hell????? I left feeling robbed of my $33.70 I spent on dinner AYCE. Came home to tell my mother the horror story of poor quality sushi only to be informed further more that sushi mon was on dirty dining. I'll go throw up now...
I WILL NEVER BE RETURNING EVER AGAIN IN LIFE!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi. Fast service even when busy."}
{"text":"It's just A-Right, over-priced for what you get. I'd still rather go to Yama Sushi down the road. http://www.yelp.com/biz/yama-sushi-las-vegas 
Cheaper and better quality!

The names on the menu is not as cool! You know that's really important, Being cool! especially in vegas! The rice on the sushi was cold and hard, not sure what that's all about. The fish was ok, nothing spetacular. The best one on the menu was the Salmon Sushi, you have to get that!

$22.95 for lunch is a bit steep for what I got..."}
{"text":"This place was the #1 for AYCE Sushi until they failed their Inspection. To those that still eat here, I give you 5 stars for a good stomach. http://www.ktnv.com/news/dirty-dining/dirty-dining-sushi-mon"}
{"text":"The sushi here tastes really fresh especially for a all-you-can eat sushi place.  The prices are the same as anywhere else.  The service is pretty good too.   I really like the cucumber salads here.  There's just one problem, it's so popular at this location, and the building is so small that there is a long wait line many of the times which can be a burden.  Sometimes the wait isn't worth it, but I do think this is the best all-you-can eat sushi place around this area."}
{"text":"I love the all you can eat sushi here. Word of advice know your limits and once you do order all at once, because sometimes the waiters tend to \"forget\" about you. All around I love this place and go at least once every 2 weeks. O yeah don't forget to leave room for the tempura ice cream its amazing."}
{"text":"UGH. BEST AYCE SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD!!!!

RIDICULOUSLY good sushi.  Best part is, EVERYTHING on their menu is AYCE.  for 1 easy payment of $27.  I easily ate more than that.  I don't want to keep rambling on with how amazing the food is, but they have so much variety, that I don't see how someone could dislike this.  

O btw, they're open til 1AM (well technically 2, but stop seating at 1).

O. O. AND they have dessert as a part of their AYCE..."}
{"text":"This is an all you can eat place, it's a little small thus doesn't have the largest waiting area. We waited outside a bit for a table, they were nice enough to bring us water as it was so hot outside. Once seated we ate a lot of food. I usually stick to nigiri, salads, and cooked dishes. The quality of the fish was okay, not as good as some other places. I did like the poki and seafood salads. My friends liked the rolls and tempura. Service was good, but as with all other ayce places, food is also forgotten. Maybe places do this on purpose if they think you've had enough. Anyway, great options on dessert, I like the option of having ice cream Mochi."}
{"text":"Omg this is the place to get your sushi fixing, lunch is $21 and you get anything on the menu, u just have to make sure to eat all. Unlimited supply of sushi and desserts! It's so good that my stomach was about to burst! This has been a the best sushi experience I have ever had by far. I walked in hungry and walked out happy! Great job sushi mon for satisfying my craving!"}
{"text":"There are so many places to choose an all you can eat sushi restaurant in Las Vegas/Henderson...the best I have tried so far has been Sushi-Mon!  

Every time my family members visit Vegas, that have to get a fix of Sushi Mon.  

Why is it that they crave this particular restaurant?  

*their awesome and fresh quality?
*their quick service and friendly staff? 
*their myriad selection of delicious sushi combination and original master pieces? 
*great price?
*not only do you get to choose from a extended selection of delicious sushi, you also have the option of ordering appetizers including gyoza, seasame chicken, miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura, hamachi kama...do I need to say more?  

What I love about this place also is that the sushi to rice ratio is just right!  (meaning they are not cheap and do not overload their sushi rolls with rice) haha.  

One of my pet-peeves regarding sushi is the rice quality and boy does Sushi Mon meet my standards.  

My opinion, check this place out!  

Don't forget to save room for dessert! =)"}
{"text":"Yum, I love Sushi Mon!!

Sushi Mon is definitely the best 'all you can eat' sushi restaurant!  I came here for dinner with a group of friends, and we all decided to enjoy the sushi buffet for $26.95/person. 

We ordered some rolls as soon as we sat down.  The rolls came out within 5 minutes, which is really fast.  Everything tasted fresh and really delicious.  I love how there isn't a lot of rice on the sushi, too.  Its great that we can order half rolls, so we got to try more items.

My favorites were the following:
1. Grilled Yellowtail Collar - the fish was cooked to perfection.  The fish fell off the bone and it was juicy.  I really liked the dipping sauce which gave it more flavor.

2. Seaweed salad - tasty

3. Lychee Sherbet - I've never had this before, but it was really good.  The sherbet tasted like lychee, and it wasn't too sweet.

4. Spider roll - The roll was pretty big, and the soft shell crab was good.

Overall, service was great.  Even though it may be a bit pricey, its definitely worth it!  I can't wait to come back when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"My husband has been coming here for years on his yearly visit to SEMA. I'm glad I finally got to try it. I was amazed at the service and quality of the food. If you are a sushi lover All you can eat sushi is the way to go . Although I would have preferred sashimi I settled for nigiri . I definitely over stuffed myself but it was so worth it."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and Arturo is great with recommendations. I would give them 5 stars, but in the evenings the wait time can be pretty long and that can be a pain but they're good at calling when tables are ready and the staff are friendly.
Tip - I love the Cajun albacore best! It has a lemon hint to it and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't think I'll be going back here again. The food was SO bad. I was practically forcing myself to eat. I ordered 2 dishes and couldn't take anymore. My friend, who I apologized to multiple times afterwards for agreeing to eat here with me, kept getting evil stares from the waiters and chefs. I could tell they didn't like him because they would ignore him or never give him respectful eye contact when talking, but would turn around and smile brightly at me and give me almost flirtatious looks. Creeped me out!"}
{"text":"Got the AYCE sushi for dinner which was $26.95 per person. Sushi quality and selection were both excellent. Our order came fairly quickly during the 1st round but lagged a bit afterwards. Unlike other sushi places where all the sushi rolls taste more or less the same, the rolls here maintain their individuality. 

Get the mochi ice cream
Get the mochi ice cream

They  have something called orgasm sauce. I'm not really sure what it is but it will probably blow your dirty dirty mind. 

Had to dock a star for speed and one of the waiters accidentally spilled soy sauce on my friend's pants. They gave us wet wipes though. =)"}
{"text":"my favorites: 
- white tuna
- fresh scallops
- salmon belly

consistently great quality!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the rice to fish ratio! Some AYCE sushi places put so much rice in their sushi that you get full super fast! Here, you'll be able to try more sushi in one sitting cus you won't be as full after several orders of nigiri or a couple rolls. Also, you can do half rolls so you don't have to worry about finishing it all unless you're with a big party.

Besides the rice to fish ratio, they have a wide variety of appetizers, sushi and dessert; great service & sushi chefs; plenty parking; but limited seating. We arrived around 9pm and was able to get bar seating right away. 

For all you garlic lovers... the garlic edamame is a must try!!

Overall, everything tasted great and satisfied by AYCE sushi on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Staff was great. The all you can eat is the way to go! You must try the hamachi collar and savor the moment because you are only allowed one."}
{"text":"Way way worth the price. Honestly the fish quality was middle of the road. Not bad, not great but lets be real. If you want to stuff your face for 27 bucks it dont get much better! The green mussels were excellent and the udon soup was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was here last night. One of, if not my favorite sushi place in town. Friendly staff who helps you if you don't what what fish is what. With a great selection of rolls, including the Spider and the Dragon. The sake wasn't my favorite, but overall a great place."}
{"text":"Will not eat here ever again! Had a very bad experience here because of the server Jeffrey. Very disrespectful!! If you do plan to eat here request not to have the server Jefferey. And to the manager of this place please talk to Jeffrey and teach him how to provide good customer service. If he has a problem with the customers be PROFESSIONAL and not to show some attitude especially  use of foul language to paying customers. Definitely not a place you want eat at. Had the worst service, food was NOT even good and Manager is not available when needed."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Sometimes the sewer smell inside is really bad. I have not been there in a while so maybe they fixed the issue they had. I would almost do take out all the time. It's not the best sushi but not the worst. 

I usually get the lunch specials if I'm working near by."}
{"text":"Wow, first of all, I'm from Socal and I didn't expect to find a gem of a sushi joint like this in vegas.

Didn't feel like paying big bucks for overrated pricey sushi joints on the strip, so we decided to hit this place up as a recommendation from a friend.

I was blown away by how many items they had on their AYCE menu. Suppppper thrilled to order every single item possible to try.

Their nigiri was superb because the fish was really fresh and sweet. The best has to be the white tuna! The sweet shrimp and uni definitely had to be my favorite, and it sucked that you can only order it once.

All their rolls were very unique and each one satisfied my tastebuds. The best part was that they allowed half orders on the rolls, so you can try more!

The icing on the cake was the selection of ice cream at the end. From tempura, to mochi, to red bean... It was heaven

Can't wait to come back to Vegas in 2 weeks and hit up this spot again. BEST AYCE sushi I've ever had, and that's coming a lot from someone who's had multiple hot spots in socal. 

THUMBS WAY UP"}
{"text":"So yummy! Had a dinner date with my girls and we so amazing. You definitely need to get there early they are really busy around dinner time! The conch was delish! Ayce is a must then you can try a bit of everything! They also do half rolls which makes it easier to taste everything. The strawberry saki was very good as well! Will definitely be coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Since last been there 3 years ago, the management has changed and the food was no longer as good. The establishment had been expanded and added a sushi island and the all your can eat price is cut in half. However, if the food quality and selection went down by half, I don't know why I would take that extra time to go away from the Strip just to visit this place.

This had been my all time favorite in the past and this time, it let me down big time. I will no longer be visiting this restaurant. I miss the meal I had in 2011."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that Las Vegas can have super fresh seafood. Sushi mon is definitely ranked tip top in the list of sushi places to go. Food is made fresh to order. Even though there is limit on the pricey items such as uni and fish collar, but try to eat everything on the menu. That'd be a challenge. And just for fun, order the monster roll. It is huge. Try stuffing down one of those at the end of your meal. Overall, super delicious."}
{"text":"Food was acceptable but the service was not.  I've had better sushi here in Vegas, from a few places, but everyone raves about sushi mon.  I thought the menu was rather inspirational and the rolls were just so-so.  Hopefully, if I ever go back, they will have been brave enough to think a little outside the box."}
{"text":"The fish was fresh and the service was excellent. This was not my first time here but my first checkin with Yelp."}
{"text":"I love this tiny place!
Far away from the strip, but located in a strip mall, this is a veritable treasure in the city of sin.  
Any time of day, for $25.95 per person, you can eat all you want - anything you want - on the menu.  Though there is a sixty minute time limit, I have never been kicked out after an hour.  However, after eating sushi for an hour you are done!
Especially after eating their deep fried or monster rolls, you won't have much room left.
I advise sitting at the sushi bar.  You can tell the sushi chef directly what you want, you can have half orders of almost all the rolls, so you can sample a wide variety.
Here is a sample of what I ordered on my recent visit, just to give you an idea:
Dynamite (scallops baked with mushrooms and onion, a creamy mayo sauce, into a scallop shell) 5.25
Baked Green Mussels 5.95
Cajun Albacore Sushi (this is my favorite) 4.00
Salmon Sushi 3.50
Seared Tuna 4.00
Salmon Roe 3.75
1/2 order of Mingus Roll (deep fried spicy tuna, cream cheese, and avocado) 4.25
Pixie Roll (deep fried sot shell crab, spicy yum-yum shrimp and cucumber, avocade, wrapped with soybean paper and topped with smelt eggs) 10.75
J.J. Roll (crab stick tempura, cream cheese, avocado, asparagus, topped with eel sauce) 
Of course I sampled my friend's dishes as well, and they were all delicious.  Though only the sushi is all you can eat, there is still an extensive Japanase cuisine menu, from which to sample.
Drinks are not included in the all you can eat, but the desert is also included. I love the green tea ice cream and the plum sorbet.
Curious about the 50 rolls they have? Go to the website for their complete menu and photos and descriptions of all the rolls."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years.. Really loved this place for all you can eat sushi. It only takes one bad experience to run off good customers!! They have a sign as soon as you walk in that if all your party is not present, that seat will be given to next customers.. So was not the case today.. As they left 2 open seats empty for 15 minutes to wait for another person to join a party at sushi bar as other people were waiting for seats. When I asked employee for a manager, she paused for a few seconds and said that they were not available!! One star because I really liked the variety; but we ended finding something better and less expensive without all the \"rules\" and \"time limit\"!!"}
{"text":"I like this location much better than other.. It can get pretty busy at times.. You give them your phone number and it gives you updates of the wait time.. The staff here is very nice and prompt. I love the tempura ice cream!!"}
{"text":"We had never been to this Sushi-Mon location, but it's our friends favorite and right down the street from their home, so we said 'why not?' 

We sat at the large table just inside the door, it seats six, and that was the size of our party. We spent almost an hour in the restaurant, all ordering AYCE, and were only able to order twice. Once upon arrival, and once for dessert. What a sham. We kept trying to flag down the waiter (this place is tiny, so there shouldn't have been an issue) and he was just too busy for us, apparently. We requested a hot tea refill 3 separate times to no avail. The nigiri that I was able to get to the table was great, fresh scallop had a pine flavor to it - strange. Our friends had many rolls - they ordered everything they wanted in the first order, and asked later on why we ordered so little. We explained that with AYCE, you're supposed to order little by little so you don't over-order. They have clearly eaten here so often that they knew you only really had one solid chance of getting your order in. Sad. 

We won't be back to this locaton. We'll stick with the other Sushi-Mon and Goye-mon along with other faves in the valley."}
{"text":"The fish here is fresh! Me and my sister do the sushi & sashimi dinner. It's $25. Not too bad. For AYCE is $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner. We'll try it next time. I gave them three stars because of the location and set up. We got sat right by the door. There is no waiting area. So people's butts are right near your food! Request one away from the door. But, there's not many tables so you'll have to wait. The service isn't too bad. Not the friendliest but attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi. House salad is extremely salty, teriyaki chicken is dry, and the sushi doesn't \"WOW\" me. A plus side is that their lunch specials are great sized portions for not so great sized prices, but you compromise with the quality. Sashimi doesn't appear to be fresh. Potato salad tastes like nothing... is it supposed to be a palate cleanser? Tempura tastes fine, but the onion is impossible to eat and the sauce is extremely salty, overpowering the tempura. Staff is nice, we got free oranges. yay."}
{"text":"I've come here twice, once with my s/o and the other with my cousin. When I sat Bar side the orders were made very promptly! The fish was absolutely terrific and it none of the items seem overloaded with rice. Staff is polite and quick to check on us, the sushi chefs are great jokesters! Tricked my cousin into eating a piece of the 911 with me, the chefs gave him some cream cheese on the house to cool his mouth...and jokingly asked if he'd like the habanero sauce with it  

I would urge to order the uni, however when I dined with my s/o i believe I came across a bad batch. We ate the exact same items, save for the uni and I ended up becoming ill and blowing chunks once we arrived home 

Other than that experience I love the place and would come again for sure! I wouldn't blame the staff over that incident."}
{"text":"For ayce sushi, this was a very excellent experience.  I tried to order a lot of different nigiri and determined my favorites were negi toro, barracuda, and ikura.  All the others were good but the negi toro really stood out."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short.  I've been there once, but never again.

Pros:  All you can eat menu
            Open late

Cons:  Rubbery, old fish even on the day they supposedly get deliveries
             Service is horrible unless you are friends with the waitress
             It's tiny for being so packed all the time....the wait time is bad.
             My boyfriend saw mice and their babies fighting and running from under the sushi bar into the bathroom


Enough said."}
{"text":"Great spot for all-you-can-eat sushi!  They don't skimp on the list of nigiri your can order, and I'm always happy to get some yellowtail and unagi as part of my AYCE.  Also, they give you one delicious sake drink and a few other higher priced sushi items as part of the package.  I especially like that this place is open until 2am.  I just wish they didn't raise the dinner price to $25.95 recently.  It's getting expensive!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite all you can eat sushi bar. Went there last Sat and we were the only customers at the sushi bar at 2pm. Chef Jilson served us with nicely cut fresh sushi. Some photos are uploaded. Lunch is $21.95 + tax per person which is reasonable for the quality of fish they serve. Thanks! And I added 20% tips for the excellent experience."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite sushi restaurant and has amazing food and service. The staff is super nice and it's all you can eat sushi!!! That is amazing and plus the place is super nice. I love coming here and will be returning almost once a week. You should try it out if you love sushi!!!!!"}
{"text":"If there is anything less than 1 star I would have click it.  My first time entering a review as this place has the WORST (when I say worst I CAP on it) management ever.  The manager at the front desk has the worst service as it was a cold night out we had kids with us and he rejected us a seat stating we could go somewhere else if we cant wait.  It took us 60 dollars in taxi fee to get there to try it out and he told us we could go somewhere else if we dont want to wait for him to feel the mood to let us in.  The night was busy but he was letting in 2 to 3 people but not reserving table for us.  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Anytime I wanna just get away and get myself a nice meal this is my go too!! Food is always great and great customer service. And fast. Also very fresh"}
{"text":"It was my birthday and I wanted Sushi. I had come here once years ago and didnt really remember the experiance but I figured if I didnt remember anything bad, then I must have enjoyed myself. I was not disappointed. Let me say that every selecion I made was delicious. The staff answered any question my wife or I had. The food came quick and the staff was attentive to our needs. Now for the best part. Due to the fact that it was my birthday (I let the waitress know) when my icecream dessert was served, it had a candle on it and a chorus of happy birthday began. If that wasnt enough as we were about to leave my waitress asked what size I wore, and she presented me with a shirt for my birthday! What a way to finish the evening. I shall return."}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time was not too bad, second time for dinner was not that great, maybe it was a off day. Sushi not bad, service is not bad too, so you can get your sushi fix here. This is 100X better then Sushi Yama, which serves spoiled sushi. Go here instead if you want AYCE."}
{"text":"This place was so crowded! We went on a tuesday night and it was absolutely packed, not just at the bar but at all the tables as well. My wife and I decided to give this place a try since it is just down the street of our new apartment and we were hoping it would make for a good alternative to our usual sushi place, Yama. Afterwards we decided it was an OK place, but the extra drive to Yama was worth it for the better quality food. 



Ok, so the good parts first I think... first, all you can drink soda was a plus, most sushi places will just give you a can of soda but this place gave nice big glasses. Servers were also very quick on the refills, and since I can down a glass of soda or water very quickly during a meal I kept out waiters busy, lol.

We both got the AYCE at the sushi bar and once we got the attention of our sushi chef started ordering. Most of the food was OK, the baked green mussels were about average while the garlic albacore was delicious. My wife absolutely loved their special \"Sushi Bon\" dish, one of their new specials. For dessert my wife and I also recommend the lychee sorbet, very tasty. Sadly this just about ends the positive portion of this review.

Ok, now for the problems. Other than the refills, service was slow as hell here. It took the chef about 20 minutes per item, longer if it was baked. At first I thought it was just because of the crowd, but even once it started emptying in the restaurant it remained painfully slow. This is despite the large number of sushi chefs on duty at the time as well! 

As for the majority of the sushi itself it was nothing all the great. We tried a number of different items and found most of them to be a bit bland. Also, they all seemed to be variations of the same thing (and not a good thing at that). Presentation was a bit lacking as well, nearly every dish we had looked rushed and fell apart while we were trying to eat it. They had an item which was a variation of a dynamite roll that we ordered, it looked like they had skimped on the toppings, then when we went to eat it the thing turned to mush before we could take a bite. Most of the food was like this, either it fell apart or didn't seem to be cooked right or something just wasn't right. Really a let down for the evening. 

All in all it was an OK experience, the plain sushi was yummy and I enjoyed a small number of the rolls, but the bulk of it was just not what I would consider quality sushi. How it got this busy and such a good rating is a mystery to me. But they do have a huge selection and if you are willing to brave some of the more interesting rolls then give it at least one try, you might find it is more to your tastes than my own."}
{"text":"I use to visit weekly. 

Average Sushi, poor service, and inconsistent quality. 

Do not recommend visiting on the weekends. Wait time is not worth it."}
{"text":"Lots of choices and the sushi was fresh...nothing like the conveyor belt type.  Service was fast once your seated, but if arriving during peak dinner hours, expect a wait as the dining area isn't a huge space.  Definitely would come back again if visiting Vegas.  Beware...the 911 roll is hella hot."}
{"text":"What's that? All you can eat sushi? SIGN ME UP. Coming from Rhode Island, then living in San Diego for years, of course I was hesitant about sushi in a desert. WRONG. It was absolutely AMAZING. Being the little adventurer I am, I of course ordered the usual favorites, but then started venturing off and trying things I wouldn't have tried in a million years. Was not disappointed by a single. one. absolutely stellar food."}
{"text":"I love the all you can sushi here! I stop by this place every time I go to Vegas. 

The sashimi is pretty fresh and you get two orders of uni and sweet shrimp included in the all you can eat too!! (I wish they allowed more..) They have a huge selection, ranging from nigiri, sushi rolls, hand rolls, to cooked food like yakitori and dynamite (which i looove but don't recommend for all you can eat because it's very filling and prevents you from eating more sushi and sashimi).

One of my favorite sashimi is salmon, and since it is not one of the limited quantity ones, I tend to order a lot of it. But what I've noticed is that, the first order is always REALLY FATTY and tasty, but as you order more and more, it just gets less and less fatty, to the point where the taste of salmon is gone. I don't know why that happens, but I have noticed that every time I've been there (about 5+ times).

In the end, I still go to this place every time I go to Vegas because it's just such a good deal and it's good quality sushi for the price you pay. Good variety, fresh sushi, great price, can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"I came here with 4 friends after hiking at Red Rock Canyon and we were all really hungry.  4 of us ordered the AYCE and 1 ordered off the menu.  I have not had much experience with AYCE sushi--I've only been to one other sushi place for AYCE.  

We placed quite a few orders of various Nigiri sushi with some extra things like miso soup, shrimp tempura, and a few other things (I got a 4 piece Mexican roll).  The fish was fresh and tasty.  

Service was good.  There was a misstep or two when something ordered was not brought but given the amount we ordered, I guess I could expect this.  

My biggest issue with the place is that it is so small.  5 people at one table and with all the plates that were brought meant that our table was quite crowded.  This made for good conversation and sharing of what had been ordered, but I was amazed I didn't elbow one of my dining companions during the meal.

There is a 45 minute time limit for lunch and an hour for dinner but the way we scarfed everything down, we almost had time to spare although we weren't watching the time and I don't think they were either.

The red bean ice cream for dessert was very good.  I wish they had mochi on the AYCE menu.  Rather, they just had three ice cream flavors.

I will come back and sit at the sushi bar--my wife is a hater of fish (raw or otherwise)--and I'll do the AYCE.  Maybe I'll go slower and really enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the mood of all you can eat sushi dinner experience. We absolutely love this place.Talk about Fantastic food all worth for $28.00  for dinner price. The quality, the presentation, was far from expectation. We tried tems that we haven't tasted in any AYCE place.

Must try on our list: 
Calamari just burst of flavor

Mahalo Roll: If you like Spam you won't be disappointed, order the Tuna POKI and you feel like you back in Hawaii.

Finish the meal with Tempura Mochi ice cream and Call it a Night!!! Can we say \"Carry me Out Service\""}
{"text":"Whenever I get the sushi bug, this is where I go. 

Let's face it. Sushi is expensive.  $2 or 3 per piece is a bit spendy IMO, but hey, that's pretty much average cost for nigiri.  And I am a hungry boy.  I am there to taste the fish, so I generally don't order rolls, much less dip my fish bits in soy sauce.  That said, I usually do all you can eat ($28-30 dinner, 1 hour), and for that price I think the quality of the fish is quite good.  

For starters, I usually get about ten pieces yellowtail (which is my fave and always good here) and 6-8 pieces garlic tuna (also snacktastic!)  That alone pays for the AYCE.   Other faves are tamago, the grilled eel (unagi), and salmon.  

They also have a nice variety of sides included on the menu, and I usually get at least  three or four things including shrimp tempura, gyoza, miso soup and sometimes a seaweed salad or ahi poki.  

To satisfy my sweet tooth, I get a green tea ice cream and a lychee sherbet, because honestly, why make tough decisions when I can have it both ways!  Sometimes a mochi too.

When I finally put the sticks down I've generally put away about $80 worth of food.  Cuz that's how I roll.  (Get it, ha!)  Not bad for $30...

I always sit at the bar and the chefs are attentive and speedy.  The waitresses, even though they are focused on waiting tables, are usually pretty good about getting your drinks, side orders, and clearing empty dishes.  

The place is kinda small, little decor and you may wait a bit on the weekends

If you are looking for the BEST sushi in town, this probably isn't the place for you.  If you need a fish fix and want to save a few clams (another ha!) I say charge it."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious sushiiiii!!! Of course get the all you can eat and order half rolls of everything...the sushi chefs will make you amaziiing rolls. Super friendly staff. Fast service. I'll have to go back so i can recommend the ones i loved :)"}
{"text":"This is places all you can eat is out of this world! great service and open late. Quality food as well!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Sushi Mon.  All-you-can-eat is winning.  I cannot believe that uni is unlimited!  The quality of the fish blows my mind--am I seriously eating this in the middle of the desert?!  the increasing prices make me apprehensive, and worried.  For this little restaurant, there are way too many servers, which might be why the price keeps going up.
Make sure you eat all your food (or try to at least be incognito in your method of disposing your rice) because they will charge you ala carte prices if not.  **Order half portions if you think you cannot handle!
My faves: 
Nigiri - Uni, hamachi, salmon
Special rolls - Athena (spicy hamachi, cucumber & avocado wrapped in shrimp), No Name (spicy tuna & asparagus, wrapped in hamachi), Dragon (California roll wrapped in unagi w/ unagi sauce drizzle)
Sides - Grilled hamachi collar, dynamite!, baked mussels, ahi poki (reminiscent of Hawaii)
And my all-time favorite... Quail egg shooter.  A shot glass filled with hot sauces, quail egg, and tobiko (fish eggs).  Mmm!
Try to get out of your element and try new things here at Sushi mon, because if you do this at another restaurant you will have to pay per plate."}
{"text":"Considering this is location is now a member of the Mon Restaurant Group, I guess it would be easiest to compare this place to Goyemon.

Not as many choices as Goyemon. Appetizer items such as kama, gyoza, yakitori, and even takoyaki. But you won't find any udon or ramen, grilled pork, spicy tuna on rice crackers, etc. There is a blackboard with daily special however.

The quality of the fish is similar to Goyemon or any other AYCE sushi restaurant, not Sushi Dai, but definitely not shark chum. The service was above average, but sometimes the chefs were a little distracted with the tv or chatting with each other.

I guess you can describe this Sushi Mon as \"Goyemon-lite\" or a little brother to Goyemon. It is a solid AYCE sushi addition to the west side of the valley for anyone who doesn't want to drive all the way to Sushi Mon's \"older brother.\""}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars.....ONLY if they were a little bit easy on the hawk style watch over you when you eat \"all you can eat\" menu with people who are eating a la carte.

They literally watch you like a hawk and no one likes to be watched like that when they're eating.  I have witnessed a really bad scene once where a man stated he was too embarrassed to finish his meal because of they way they were watching him and accussing him of sharing his all you can eat menu with his family.  It was ridiculous on both Sushi Mon's part and the mans part.  

But all in all, all you can eat sushi..is bomb.  Their sushi tastes fresh and they have an awesome side menu to order things like seaweed salad, miso soup, tempura shrimp, yellowtail collar, baked mussels, beef teriyaki, and shumai which is all also all you can eat.  This is the place to go when you are hungry and its open pretty late.  Last call is at 1:30am.  Price is about $27 per person.  To me...good deal because I can eat way more sushi over that price.  

Plus you have all you can eat dessert ;) green tea ice cream, mochi balls, red bean ice cream.....man.  Whats not to love?

They even have those stamp cards for frequent customers.  Free 11th all you can eat meal.  HOLLA!"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi meals I've ever had, and it is the first & only AYCE sushi bar I've sat at where the food would come out faster than I can order.
Their ayce menu consists of a bunch of nigiri sushi, special rolls, and some appetizers/side dishes. 
The gf & I ordered mainly the nigiri: Yellow tail, Salmon/seared salmon, and Albacore/Cajun albacore. The shrimp tempura was really good too.
Although their nigiri pieces were sometimes small, I was never unhappy about the fish to rice ratio. It also didn't matter if the pieces were sometimes smaller - we sat at the bar and whenever we wanted to order something we just yelled it out, like \"3 more salmon!\" and in less than a minute the chef would hand us the plate of our order.
Usually at any decent or good ayce sushi bar, you gotta wait a good amount of time in between orders, plus you're given a limit on the amount you can order at a time, and sometimes they even pack on the rice to try to get their customers full. Sushi Mon doesn't do this. They say that they give you a 60 minute time limit which sounds not cool at first, but when you are constantly handed plate after plate of whatever you order, I guarantee you'll be full within half an hour. At the end of our meal my gf & I had a 15+ stack of empty plates in front of us, I'll post a picture of this soon. Highly recommended you sit at the bar.
A good 20 minute drive off the strip, but totally worth it for a very satisfying meal with friendly and attentive servers & chefs.

Notes:
*They don't put a full wad of wasabi like authentic Japanese sushi bars, but they do put a little smudge in there. I loved that they did this, since most American Japanese sushi bars don't make their nigiri with wasabi in it. My gf didn't like this, so she requested that they don't put any wasabi in the nigiri sushi and the chefs gladly did this for her.
**There is another Sushi Mon more south of the Strip. We asked a chef if this Sushi Mon and the other were acquainted and learned that they once were, but not anymore."}
{"text":"When it comes to ayce this place is ok but they did have toro and uni which was great and really fresh a+ for that.  We sat at a table and service was great till it started filling up waited for 20 minutes for my last order and didn't feel like waiting any longer so we paid and left but hey that can happen at any one of these places.  If I would have got my last order I'd give them another star.  

The sushi was fresh and all but my last order was correct and timely doesn't always happen at tables.  Good selection of nigiri I've seen the special rolls at most places now.  Nothing seemed to set them a part from any other place but they 5 minutes from my house will I be back probably."}
{"text":"Toro!  One of the few places to publicly tell people they have this item on their menu.  Most places would hide the fact they have fatty tuna.  

I wouldn't call Sushi Mon the best sushi place out there but it is certainly top 5 in Las Vegas.  Not only for the quality of food, attention to service, but the hours!  I would hope they have everything I listed above because the prices pinch the wallet.  I don't care too much for special rolls, I've always been the rice on the bottom and fish straight up on top type of person.  And the quality of fish they serve here is fresh and good.  I had one bad experience with their uni but they replaced it with the quickness.  

If I do order special rolls, I usually order half rolls if available just so I can try other special rolls without getting full too fast."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is my all time favorite sushi restaurant!!!  Despite there's always a wait around dinner time, the sushi is fresh and they have the best tempura ice cream.  I'd recommend to get the all-you-can-eat to take advantage of all of the appetizers, sushi and dessert.  Trust me, you have a lot to choose from!"}
{"text":"Sushimon has always been the go-to spot for sushi. The sushi rolls are always good but what I really love about this place is that their Nigiris are amazing for AYCE. I have been to many sushi restaurants, and most of the time the nigiris are gross, but Sushimon gets them right! They make their rice really small and the piece of fish large, so you're not overwhelmed with the sushi rice. The service isn't always the greatest and they do have ups and downs when it comes to the fish or sushi chef, but sushimon for me is the best place to come for AYCE."}
{"text":"5 stars for the sushi which my girlfriend loved.  3 stars for the limited selections of food for the non fish eating people."}
{"text":"Has something changed?
I was a huge fan of Sushi Mon when I lived a mile away...going at least once a week for their superb sushi.  
When I recently flew in to town from my new home in Salt Lake City, I called in from the airport for a large take-out order due to my craving for some great sushi.
I didn't recognize the food anymore.  The fish was different...muted colors, strange unrecognizable cuts in my sashimi, much thiner portions too.
Not sure if I will try it again...I was quite disappointed that an old favorite let me down."}
{"text":"the service here was above and beyond. our waitress was very friendly and offered us some good suggestions based off of our initial order. she came by frequently to see if we wanted to add more food to our order. food came out fast even though they were busy. other waitresses came by and topped off our drinks. this place would have been a perfect 5star if the price was a tad bit lower and if all the fish came out fresh. get the plum ice cream, stay away from the over creamy green tea."}
{"text":"Summary: Disappointed

Cons:

-Probably the worst fish to rice ratio at an ayce sushi place I have been too. I have been to almost all of the ayce sushi place in orange county and only a handful of ayce sushi places in LA, but I have never seen a worse rice to rise ratio for both the nigri pieces and the rolls. Actually some of the rolls were ridiculous large, especially the 5 piece rolls. The biggest rolls I have ever seen. When the menu states that you will be charge for extra rice, and then the rolls comes out a gigantic and filled with rice. Should have taken a picture of this. 

-Service. Our server was new, but overall very nice and did the best he can. We asked him if we can get a spider hand roll and he wasn't sure. My biggest gripe is that we have a kid. Most AYCE places have a different price for kids. He failed to mention this. A kid that is 8 years old should not be charge the same price as an adult, if everybody is charged the same price the restaurant should let customers know. 

-From the rice to fish ratio, to not disclosing the price difference, can't help but feel a bit of disingenuous on part of the owner. At the very least it is a lack of disclosing information that could easily enhanced a customer's experience. 

Pros: The freshness and quality of the fish is above average in comparison to most of the ayce places I have been to. Too bad you only get to get a thin slice/small piece of it. If it wasn't for the quality of the fish, this place would really get one star."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place?!?!? It's amazing! A vegas gem my only complaint they need more of them I don't live on this side of town anymore :( put one in the southwest PLEASE:) if you haven't been here go now and your welcome :)"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. It's my go to place, very affordable and very clean. The bathrooms are awesome as well. Food there is Grade A and some of the best sushi I've ever had. The chefs there are so nice and friendly, there's an older Japanese man who is just the cutest! And he always makes my rolls perfect. 10/10 always. The staff is also very friendly and helpful with every question I have."}
{"text":"All-You-Can-Eat & High Quality Sushi are normally two things that I wouldn't associate together. Until now. Their full menu is available for the AYCE price, and it's a very wide menu. The rolls and cuts are made to order and the fish was very fresh. I love that you can order half-rolls so you can try lots of different ones. I had my doubts as to how good this place would be after my friends had talked it up so much, but I was not disappointed. I must've tried at least 9 different types of rolls, a couple of handrolls, tuna poki and we finished off with a refreshing lychee sorbet that cleaned the palate wonderfully. 

Service was definitely on top of it and the sushi chefs behind the counter seemed very enthusiastic and were having fun being there. The place isn't very big, so even full, all of our food came out very quickly and our table waiter came back frequently to find out our next orders. It took some effort to control myself from ordering everything on the menu, but I believe my heart appreciated it. 

I think a return to Sushimon will be a must for my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They said last call was at 1:30. Drove 20 minutes to get to the location and got there by 1:30 and they refused to give me service! Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sushi Mon ever since they opened and honestly it is my favorite sushi place! I never want to go anywhere else if my friends say lets get sushi I always tell them I won't go unless it is Sushi Mon!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and I love trying new places so when I was trying to figure out where to meet a friend for lunch, I went right to Yelp to find a new place that would be in a good location for both of us. Between the 4 out of 5 star rating, and remembering that I had heard good th8ings about Sushi Mon, we decided to meet there for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. 

Most of the tables were full when we arrived so we decided to sit at the bar. After a quick glance at the menu it was clear that AYCE would be the best way for us to go so we started out with some edamame, miso soup for my friend and drinks while we decided on a few rolls. 

I love that they offer 1/2 rolls, it allows me to try things that look yummy but I am not sure about. I also love that ACYE included nigiri sushi, and the fish was nice and thick and tasted very fresh. We started with an order of tuna, salmon and yellowtail to start and ended up having seconds and then thirds of the tuna as it was just delicious. 

As for rolls, we started with 1/2 orders of Caterpillar and Philadelphia rolls. These are my basics that I almost always order, and Sushi Mon did them well. We also had the Frying Jason roll which was a baked  roll that had scallops and yum yum sauce. A little heavy on the sauce but I would certainly order it again. We finished off with a Spider Roll because my friend wanted somethign with soft shell crab. This was made with soy paper and was large so I had a hard time eating it. This was my least favorite of the rolls we had...

The only problem I had was having to ask for water refill. Otherwise it was an extremely tasty lunch. They charge a little more for AYCE then some places but the quality of fish makes it worth it in my book... Sushi Mon is definitely on my go back ASAP list."}
{"text":"This is where I lost my sushi-virginity. The place that made me overcome my aversion to raw fish.  The place where most of my paychecks were spent when we lived in Vegas.  I think it's obvious: I LOVE this place.  The quality is fantastic... by far the best I've had in Vegas and in LA. Plus, they have AYCE (all-you-can-eat) for around $26.  That's pretty hard to beat. Service is friendly and quick. And they're open until 2am.... Just when I thought it couldn't get any better.
 
My favorites:
1) Miso Soup
2) Albacore tuna
3) Yellowtail
4) Super white tuna
5) Shrimp tempura
6) Tiger Roll- shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, spicy tuna
7) Rainbow roll- California roll wrapped in tuna, shrimp, salmon,  yellowtail, & white fish topped with smelt eggs
 
The tiger roll is a must. It's texturally balanced and has an awesome flavor combination.  The super white tuna is dressed with the most amazing ponzu sauce....  I have yet to find one that comes close. Sadly, they don't serve strawberry mochi anymore which was one of the best I've tasted. All in all, this is my favorite sushi place and I'm happy they were my first ;)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years prior to my yelp career.  Time to pay respects to Sushi Mon...man!

Service: You're greeted immediately upon walking in, and the sushi chefs at the bar have always been friendly. Wait staff keeps the drinks fresh every time I've sat for AYCE. The sushi chefs keep things moving and I've never had a problem with the wait.  They're moving quickly to get you full af asap so they can clear more covers with their limited seating.     

Food: The Nigiri has always been fresh and on point with a great rice ratio.  Check the specials board because it's never failed me.  Great place to find something new to try. My particular favorites have always been the salmon belly and the fresh af Uni.  Everything is good quality and a good time.

Value: $26.95 for dinner ayce sushi.  Pretty good value for getting you a lot of good quality sushi in a short amount of time.  We rock the miso soup and dessert (Ice cream, mochi, and deep fried ice cream) that comes with the ayce option.

Ambiance:  Casual decor for your typical sushi place in a strip mall area.  Not a first date sushi place but a casual date sushi place.  There's flat screens strategically placed for diners and is brightly lit.  The tables are placed rather close to each other which I don't mind but may be an issue for others.

There's limited seating and it's a hot spot.  I'd never consider going here on a friday or saturday because I'd there's going to be a wait.  It's been my sun-thur late night ayce sushi craving go to the past 7+ years.  They close at 2 am and my visits have been usually around 10 PM on a sun-thur.  Sometimes even then it's been a 15 minute wait.  The wait is worth it, and Sushi Mon is one of those great restaurants that makes it hard to move from Vegas.  I know that at 12 AM on a wednesday night, high quality sushi is only a 15 minute drive away. Thanks for providing me a solid late night weekday sushi option Sushi Mon!"}
{"text":"This place is to die for !I recommend you do the all you can eat it's reasonable and really worth it ! I love the roll sexy girl and hurricane ! There my favorite !(: sit at the bar they make then faster you have 45 minutes for lunch in 60 minutes for dinner!"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  I enjoy the options and that I can try whatever I want for the one flat price."}
{"text":"Awesome plce to get AYCE sushi if you are in Vegas and dont mind the 5 mile drive from the north strip. Believe me it is well worth it. The fish was very fresh and tasty, great service and very clean inside. I like the fact that the place is run by Japanese people who really seem to take pride in thier business. i would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves good fresh sushi and lots of it!"}
{"text":"Man I ate at this place around 2010 2011. They had this all you can eat deal where you could basically eat all you wanted as long as you finished it and the sushi was delicious. I was hanging out in Vegas with an ex who turned out to be a total pig and  could totally knock down tons and tons of sushi and keep going . So I guess what I'm saying is I wouldn't recommend dating any women from Vegas but I definitely would recommend all you can eat sushi at this place if you are dating or engaged to a total pig like I was."}
{"text":"Came as soon as it opened and it was already busy. Visiting from Hawaii so this was our very first time. Service was great. It took a while to get our orders but we weren't in a rush so we didn't mind. Great quality food!!!  We did the all You can eat for lunch which is 21.95 dinner is $26.95. So we made sure we Ate it's worth. Will return next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent, high quality, fresh sushi. Good variety of sushi choices. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love love love the quality sushi at SUSHIMON!! Have been won over into the sushi world by this small suburban gem!  However, since it is such a small restaurant you almost ALWAYS have to wait for a table. 
We always get AYCE because my husband loves his sushi.... Definitely worth it if you get more than 3-4 items when you eat sushi. ($28 dinner). 

My favorite Nigiri = Cajun albacore 
Favorite rolls= JJ and (basic but delicious!) 007
I love almost all of their appetizers, buuuut the green tea creme brûlée is definitely FABULOUS! 

I would give it a 5 if it wasn't for the wait time."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite sushi places in Vegas!! The food was amazing and the staff was very friendly! I opt for the all you can eat and what a great lunch price! Only $$21 before 4pm! I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place I've eaten at in the US, basically.

I love Sushi Mon to the point where I'll leave the strip and go several miles out to this place, stuff myself with almost 60 pieces of sushi in a sitting and feel as sick as I can afterwards. Well, it happened once, at least.

There hasn't been a better place that combines all-you-can-eat sushi with quality that I've come across. The balance is great, there is no slack on the variety you can choose from. Same with the dessert. 

I write this review with some hesitation, though, since I don't want to see any of you waiting in front of me to get seated the next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and do not plan to come back again. First time I came here w coworkers for an outing. Service was great but food was not all great. I went back again but this time brought my bf to get his opinion. 

The cons:
Tako and tuna poke is very bland. Miso soup barely has any tofu and the seaweed is paper thin. The takoyaki is frozen as it's quite mushy when bitten into. Had quite a lot of hand rolls and it was quite bland so I decided maybe it needs to be rolls instead but it was still bland. I noticed for basic rolls, they add a bunch of other ingredients in which, imo, ruins the taste of it. For instance, Phillip roll should only have avocado, cream cheese and salmon but they add eggs and cucumber. 

The pros:
Nigiri sushi are yummy. They actually put less rice just like at Sushi Neko. They actually have salmon and yellowtail belly which is good. Tako wasabi was pretty good too! Green mussels was flavorful. They can pretty much make all rolls into handrolls.

So all in all, both experiences weren't that great.  IF I wanted only Nigiri, then maybe I might go there."}
{"text":"of course i go overboard here but its worth it. my newly discovered favorite rolls are the sunrise and the moon river roll. its always good, get good service, and open just late enough if you ever get that late night hunger that fast food isnt going to cure."}

because, they changed owner so now they are changed staff and owner.
i go this restaurant for 5-6years. 
and today i had so so dinner all you can eat. 
after all you can eat i just asking to manager, what's your name? because of my college project i need your name, and he was scowl his face say to me NO. and waving his hand. what make him upset? did i do something wrong?
in my opinion  manager should have their name tag on their shirt don't they?
and also manager is their restaurants face. what's wrong? don't go their you can feel with horrible service."}
{"text":"I've ignored this place in favor of sister restaurant Sushi House Goyemon for too long. It may be an equal or superior experience.

Sushi Mon on Maryland is one of my favorites from back when I did AYCE (all you can eat) sushi multiple times a month if not a week. In case you're not familiar with Las Vegas, the AYCE sushi scene is huge and prepared to order, not buffet style. Goyemon and this older restaurant have identical menus (including AYCE dessert - that 1 per person limit at many restaurants is a pet peeve), but I always recalled Goyemon having a larger offering of special nigiri and appetizers.

Sushi Mon has almost caught up in specials variety since my last visit a few years back. I don't have a photo, but the nigiri included a hefty array of nigiri, including yuzu tobiko, seared bonito, and other ignored options. I tried and loved the blue fin tuna, salmon belly, yellowtail belly, and masaba (a variety mackerel that's far less salty). A full meal of those would've been more than satisfying.

From the aforementioned specials menu, I also enjoyed these nigiri: Japanese mackerel, toro (1 per person), young yellowtail, red grouper, and asari rayu, asari being Japanese littleneck clams and rayu being chili-infused sesame oil. The Japanese mackerel was rather salty like regular saba, the toro wasn't substantially better than the blue fin, the young yellowtail and red grouper were similar to regular yellow tail and red snapper, respectively, and the asari rayu was a bit more spicy than I would've tolerated if I'd eaten a full piece (but it does taste pretty good).

I don't recall Goyemon favorites such as spicy tuna rice cracker, sashimi salad, grilled pork belly, and fresh \"wasabi\" (I'm told it's not actual wasabi, but it's similar) being available at Sushi Mon before, but they were available and at least as good if not better. The pork belly at Goyemon has actually been significantly overcooked almost every time over the past year, but the pork belly in this meal was fatty, juicy, and only slightly overcooked on edges. Some grilled items which I missed from Goyemon are cajun salmon, miso salmon, yellowtail, and super white tuna, but I was more than willing to overlook those after having the best yellowtail collar from either 'Mon. (Salmon collar was also available, and both were 1 per person.)

The standard menu appetizers were also as enjoyable as usual. Dynamite (bay scallop, \"crab\" filling, onions, cream sauce) and atypically large mussels were great. As for standard nigiri, I enjoyed the super white tuna, hotate (sea scallop), and amaebi as much as I have at Goyemon or other AYCE establishments in town. Uni was slightly subpar, but I've had far more unpalatable experiences at similar spots.

As far as dessert, standard menu green tea was as awesome as usual, although some unusual ice was present around, but not inside. This stuff actually has matcha, unlike some competitors. I also had pineapple sorbet, which is as delicious as you'd expect, and a cream puff, which was enjoyable and packed full of vanilla cream. That's the first time that I've seen those desserts available at a 'Mon.

Wait was about half an hour for Friday night peak dinner. Dress accordingly for the weather if you're not able to come here during off-peak times. Cost for AYCE meals is $19.95 for lunch, $26.95 for dinner. Time limits are written as 45 and 60 minutes respectively, but still aren't really enforced except for special occasions. Most rolls are available in half orders, although I completely ignored rolls this time as I often do.

Sushi Mon remains in my top tier of Las Vegas's AYCE sushi (along with Goyemon and Sushi Koma), but I may be naming it as my new favorite soon enough if I experience enough delicious meals. I do hope to visit more often because it's more convenient for me than Goyemon is (although the latter is still 4.5* at least, so make no mistake about my opinion)."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi restaurant in Vegas so far.  They have an ALCE option which is usually the best way to go.  **if you order a la carte and  decide to spend more than the $28 AYCE price, they will let you just pay that flat fee and go to town!!! sunrise roll and seared tuna nagiri are my faves!"}
{"text":"It might be our 10th time here and it's the first time in my life that I don't have to speak to order the chef Sung already know exactly what I am looking for me and my girlfriend. Very good quality awesome ambiance, great service and best food. Well done !!!"}
{"text":"Went here on St. Patrick's Day, decent rolls and great service!   

If you are getting AYCE I would recommend:
-Ecstasy Roll
-Supreme Salmon
-Sushi-Max
-Garlic Tuna Nigiri

Warning: We also got the 9-1-1 Roll and it was VERY HOT...SERIOUSLY.  It has a habanero sauce in it that makes it extremely spicy.  Our whole entire table enjoys spicy food, but this was hot.  We couldn't feel our tongues for a minute.  Luckily our server was nice enough to take away the remaining 4 sushi pieces without any trouble."}
{"text":"Definitely has become somewhere to stop before leaving each Vegas trip. Forget the $50 hotel buffets. 

We come here for the all you can eat sushi. Everything's made/cut fresh. The quality of the fish is on point. For lunch all for $21.95. It also includes their choice of appetizers (which includes such like edamame, Takoyaki, shrimp tempura, veggie tempura, poke, cucumber salad, seaweed salad, miso soup, etc.) and DESSERT (Mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream, and other more ice cream haha)! It's not close to the strip but worth the drive, trust me. It's a long list of choices for their rolls and sushi, actually quite a bit of reading. And allllll so yummyyyy! I wish there was one near home :( 

It's better if you sit at the bar for the all you can eat. Cause you can order for sushi right there instead of bugging the waitresses that are serving others. But do be aware you do need to eat all the rice that comes with the fish too or I think they charge you extra."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place to anyone! The best sushi I've had in terms of both quality and price. I got a salmon roll and salmon nigiri and my girlfriend got an avacado cucumber roll and an avacado asparagus roll. Each roll comes with eight pieces, the nigiri comes with two pieces, and they were all delicious."}
{"text":"This used to be our main All-you-can-eat sushi place where we'd go twice a week. It all changed when they got new owners. It's okay, but not the same service -- probably because our regular sushi chefs went to Goyemon. 

They have the same menu as before but the quality is different. I know you're thinking, how I can tell, but if you've gone to the same place for years and the fish doesn't taste the same, then I have to say the quality is different. 

On the other hand, compared to many of the other sushi restaurants, I think it passes for OK. The new service is friendly.  If you're nearby and you needed AYCE sushi place, try it. It might not be the best, but probably a good value."}
{"text":"walked in and the place was about 1/3 full. not one person greeted us. the sign says \"wait to be seated\". 2 employees looked at us and didn't say anything still. after a few awkward minutes I asked... should we seat ourselves? one of the employees looked surprised that I asked. another employee seated us. the menu had several options and we opted for all you can eat. our waiter took our order and someone else brought it to our table. our waiter was busy watching a game on TV. the food was delicious... I've been here before and the service was good..  I'll give them the benefit of doubt... it was after 9pm. maybe they were tired. a simple smile and welcome would have make this a better experience."}
{"text":"They always serve freshest fish! I love the variety of rolls, ecstasy roll is my favorite!! They also have amazing service."}
{"text":"One of the few sushi restaurants worth a short wait. The food is always fabulous and the service is attentive."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE sushi before heading back to Los Angeles and it was soooo good! This place is unlike other AYCE sushi joints where there is a set price for the weekend the entire day. There is still a lunch and dinner pricing. I don't remember what the dinner price was but for lunch on Sunday it was $22. They also don't give you a paper to write down your order, there's a server that comes to take your order. 

There is a lot of things to choose from in their menu. My group got a few rolls and then mainly stuck to nigiri the rest of the time. Don't forget to look at the daily special menu because that is included as well! 

The sushi that definitely stuck out to me and was soooooo good were the fresh scallops, negi toro and the blue fin toro. I have no idea what was on the fresh scallops but it was my favorite! I could've kept eating that for the entire time! For their special rolls the ecstasy roll was BOMB. Def recommend trying those 4.

They also have really good desserts! A variety of different flavors for their mochi ice cream and the lychee sorbet was AMAZING!

Service wasn't bad. Well at the beginning service was great but towards the end of our meal it kind of got pretty slow but we didn't mind it. 

I will definitely be back here on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very rude! Kicked us out because our 4 year old doesnt eat sushi or anything on their menu so we got him a happy meal to eat while we could enjoy a meal together and be able to eat sushi. Kabuki had no problem with it and that is where our future sushi outings are going from now on. I also have a facebook mom group of over 1400 moms and plan to share this story and a kid friendly alternative to here."}
{"text":"My daughter & I were in the area and were in the mood for Japanese food. I remembered that my good friend and fellow yelper, Edith S recently ate here so we decided to give Sushi Mon a try. 

Upon entering we were greeted by the friendly staff, then seated. They have AYCE, regular priced menu items and lunch specials. We decided on ordering from the lunch specials menu. 

We both had the 2 Roll Lunch Combo which comes with 2 Sushi rolls of your choice (from list), salad & miso soup. All this for $8.50! 

Items tried and liked (so far): 
Miso Soup comes with tofu & wakame. 
Salad with Ginger Sesame Dressing
California Roll
Spicy Tuna Roll
Avocado & Asparagus Roll

Everything tasted fresh & yummy!  Service was quick & friendly.  We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Cmon now. This is place is not good. I think the location works and that's how they are busy, but there are so many places that are better. I felt like I was eating Walmart sushi or maybe sushi at the dollar store. Nasty. The service was arrogant? I can't think of another word for it. Here's the rules, what do you want, see you when I see you. 
Oh thanks for bringing me my nice dull looking tasteless nasty raw fish. Oh and can you bring me some more tripe looking beef for my daughters teriyaki bowl, thanks. Ordered all you can eat and after a round it was all I could stomach. Maybe it was a bad night, but how much could quality improve. Maybe I'm spoiled because I usually like food to be edible, hard to say. 
Pass on this. Matter of fact drive in the opposite direction."}
{"text":"3rd time in this place.  Its so good! 

This time I visited there during lunch.  Even better.  No Lines, Food came in fast.  Since this is an all you can eat restaurant, you will not worrying about \"left over fish\" issues like other a la carte sushi (yes, in Japanese culture you may get to eat the fish from the day before during lunch).

Everything is fresh and their fried stuffs are actually quite yummy (Shrimp tempura, fried shumai).  Ahi Poke salad is good too.  I didn't like the grilled yellowtail cheek too much. 

Make sure to save rooms for desserts!  Yummy lychee ice creams!"}
{"text":"Great All You Can Eat Sushi Joint in Vegas.

Located in a shopping plaza.  Easy to park.  

The restaurant is not too big but staffs are very efficient with orders.  During non-busy hours, you can actually eat longer than the regulated 60 mins but usually people are full before they hit an hour landmark.  

Fishes were fresh.  Make sure to check their daily specials!  I like their fresh scallop (its previously frozen, however) but still pretty good for AYCE standard.  Uni melts in your mouth as well.  Sweet shrimp is better than typical AYCE place too.  I also liked their salmon, yellowtail, amber jack, albacore sushi.  Their tempura shrimp and seaweed salad is good too.  One of the best I have had in the AYCE restaurant.  Thumbs up.   They also make pretty good rolls, including 1/2 order rolls so for those who can't consume the whole spider roll, this is the place to go.

My only gripe for this place is that their sushi rice is bit on the firm side.  It wasn't  very \"sticky\" when I was there.  Maybe just one of the bad nights?  Their Ikura (Salmon Eggs) weren't that salty too so if you don't like fishy stuff, try to avoid that.  Other than that, its definitely worth to make a trip here if you are very hungry and loves sushi!"}
{"text":"Never going back.

We did ayce & were only able to order twice, while flagging the chef down because we were sitting at the bar. They were two feet in front of us and wouldn't even look at us to order.  For like two hours. 

Half the time the order is wrong (I've gone here 3x and they always bering out other things besides what we ordered, or not the sushi /roll we ordered at all.)

\"Hospitality\" doesn't exist here. Ok there was one kid and he was really nice. Really it's like fishing. You just sit and wait and maybe you'll get to eat. And pay the 25/person bill. 

Sushi isn't bad. If you want to bash your head on the table trying to get it in front of you."}
{"text":"I had AYCE sushi a few nights ago and sat at the bar with a friend. When we sat we were greeted by one of the chefs who was extremely friendly. We ordered one of every roll and the two that stood out the most were the hurricane and ecstasy, both were excellent with flavors that complimented each other perfectly. Other than food the inside was clean and the staff was friendly. The only reason I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 is the menu is a bit small compared to other AYCE sushi places in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is deliciously amazing. Everything is made to order. There are prices listed for those who want to order dishes individually.  We opted for the lunch buffet which includes everything on the menu.  I appreciate that you can order rolls in halves because we would definitely not have been able to try the many other dishes.  The down part is, if you don't finish everything you have to pay for it. Thus, half orders are a great way to prevent waste.  The lunch buffet is about $24.99 and the dinner buffet (with the same options) is $26.99. 

Baked Mussels: WOW WOW. I don't even like mussels but these were so amazing! Make sure you are careful though, I grabbed the shell right when the waiter brought it out (because I'm an impatient pig) and boy did I burn my thumb, it was red for the rest of the day.

White Tuna and Uni (Eel) Sashimi: AMAZING AMAZING. The only negative part is that every slice of sashimi is over rice.  And you have to eat all the rice or else you will get charged.

Monster Roll: They make it sound like it was a ginormous roll.  The size and taste definitely did not meet my expectations.  Definitely a PASS. Don't even bother or think that this is a challenge. It is full of rice and does not taste good.

Besides that, EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"We ordered two dinner special and fired shumai..Quick and taste good.. Price reasonable. Service also good. Will come back."}
{"text":"When you just need some quick and affordable good sushi:  I love this place and its prices. And did I say it's fast?  Great place for all you can eat. Packed with tables and chairs and other diners, the atmosphere is busy and electric. Great place to bring a group of friends and just have a good time.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Not bad for an ayce sushi joint in Vegas!  We were lured in by the notion of limitless salmon, tuna and Uni.. But please note:  the Uni is not all you can eat!  We went in for lunch service (lunch-$21.95 and dinner-26.95).  I didn't read the menu thoroughly and so after I ordered 2 orders of Uni, the bill came and we realized that they charged us both for dinner price.  There is a limit of 2 pieces of Uni per person.  



Regardless, they still had my all time fave white tuna and salmon.  Restrooms were clean and service was friendly.. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Fresh nigiri was good. The baked rolls had way too much cream cheese; it was overpowering. The rice was overcooked and burnt. The wait was too long and there were not enough sushi chefs working."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place my husband and I have raved about this place for years it's been awhile since we've been in so I decided to have lunch there with my mom I ordered three rolls of California rolls when I got them I could barely taste the crab and the roles were very small the Cucumber normally has the peel outer skin shaved off but they kept it on making it very hard to chew when the rest of the scroll is soft it jabbed me in top of the mouth every time the avocado was so thin I didn't even taste it definitely would not recommend this place to anyone and do not plan on returning back I also ordered vegetable tempura it was definitely supersaturated and oil and cooked very quickly as opposed to them being dried and the tempura overall looking a lot better I just peeled off the outer breading and eat the vegetables no big the cucumber salad that we ordered once again was 50% skin and 50% cucumber not yummy will you have to chew the crap out of your cucumber salad I ordered two drinks two dr. Peppers they were a buck seventy-five apiece not bad I was done eating my three orders of sushi - 3 small bites and I asked the lady for a to-go cup she told me I'm sorry we don't have to go cups I don't understand how I can pay for a drink and not take it that's not right I paid for all of my stuff alicart and it was not all you can eat there should be no reason why they shouldn't offer to go cup I don't think that is good service at all so I sat there and extra 30 minutes while I drink my drink and that time I stared at the check and realize they forgot to charge me for the drinks mind you I was upset that they didn't have a to-go cup I thought that was rude but I wanted to make sure that they didn't offer the drinks because if that was the case I had no right to complain about not having a to-go cup the lady said to me oh no she forgot to charge you so me being the nice person I am cuz I could have said that's your problem not mine I had her fix the bill to charge me for two drinks but seriously there was maybe four people in that shop and you forget to add the bill correctly I definitely will not be back and I will make sure the people know my opinion when it comes to Sushi Mon I will definitely be returning to Sushi 21 on Flamingo and Decatur it is worth the drive because apparently nothing close to me is halfway decent"}
{"text":"Exe lent food. Good service. Only negative was there isn't a lot of seating b"}
{"text":"We decided to come here after learning it was part of the \"mon\" chains and we love goyemon! It's a smaller establishment and I used to come here a bunch when it was owned by an previous owner. We were seated right away and they told me that it would be $3 bucks for my one year old to eat. That irked be a little bit, because 1. how much can a one year old really eat and 2. I was feeding my child food that I had brought at that exact moment when they asked. 

Overall, the sushi quality was decent. Like other Yelpers have said the selection isn't as large as Goyemon, but the main thing was that the sushi quality was good and I actually did enjoy it. Halfway through the meal it realized one of the sushi chefs was a chef I knew from before.  Chef Tony is awesome! If I ever get a chance to sit at the bar I would want him to make my sushi. 

Service was a bit slow, but the sushi came out fairly quick.  It just takes awhile to get their attention to order more when you are at a table. I will be back for some more sushi one of these days!"}
{"text":"Sushi mon used to be my all time favorite place to go to back in the day which was like 7-8 years ago which goes to show you that they've been in business for awhile. We decided to stop by on a Saturday for lunch. 

First thing I noticed when we walked in....it smelled like sewer! Yuck! It wasn't too busy but there was only one sushi chef. We started to order the normal nigiri....everything that came out was just alright....nothing too fresh.  95% of the rolls had spicy tuna and a ton of rolls had cream cheese in it. I personally am not too big of a fan of cream cheese with fish.  

Overall, service was ok. The dessert menu only has ice cream included. This place is pricey for lunch and I just wasn't impressed. Sorry sushimon, but you are last on my list."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this is by far the best AYCE sushi joint to go to.
well this and SUSHI tachi but i think they have the same owner or something cuz their menu is the same. 

   but but but... this place is BOMB you cannot go wrong with this place. Most of their rolls are to die for especially the moon river roll!! and they have really fresh nigiri everytime i go there. Their salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and albacore are super fresh and they give you nice cutsss!. 
  They dont try to gyp you either i mean your paying 28 dollars now?they kind of raised the price but great quality AYCE for an hour so its all worth it:] and they have all you can eat ice cream tooo!! and the chefs are really nice and they keep on asking you what else you want:] thats if your sitting the bar so sit at the bar if your serious about eating alot of sushi!!!

This place could get packed at night and the weekends but you have to try it if your looking for a good sushi place."}
{"text":"Good is delicious but on the days my family & I decide to go it's super packed but the just means the food is worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Clyde is the best Chef! He makes my favorite sauce for dipping my fish! He spoils me with fresh fish I only eat sashimi, I don't do rolls that much! I walk in and don't even look at the menu, I sit down order a nice cold Kirrin draft beer. Clyde starts bringing out all the fresh fish of the day!  One of my favorite fish is the Salmon Belly!! Yummy 

Love love this place! Try the Creme Brulee for dessert, sometimes they make green tea Creme Brulee its different! 

Great service, great food, great prices! Clean & healthy food! Win win situation! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"had sushi mon last night with a friend.. amazing selection for all you can eat sushi including appetizers (I had seaweed salad) and includes desserts like lychee ice cream and Moshee! sushi was fresh and came fairly quickly even though they were packed wall to wall."}
{"text":"Just got my daughter home from the ER.  She has been a regular customer of this particular Sushi Mon for some time, and went in this afternoon for lunch, ordering Salmon Rolls.  Unfortunately, this time...she ended up with Scombroid food poisoning (which if you don't feel like looking it up - is specifically caused by ingesting DECAYED fish.  Lovely.

When she (and her husband) attempted to call to speak with a manger to inform them, they're response was to HANG UP ON THEM?  Probably not they're smartest move.  Already submited a complaint to Clark County Health District.  

I'm not a sushi eater myself, and can only hope this was an isolated incident, but it's extremely disappointing that any establishment would hang up on a customer, especially when it could end up backfiring on them!"}
{"text":"I am going to agree with the review of Juddi L. 

This was a must for my entire family, visitors, business associates, and I  would sing it's praises for years.  I felt it was as good as it gets.   Then, it changed owners.

The new owner, a Japanese lady, watches every serving and every thing the Chefs do. One by one, the good chefs left. Things got worse;

I was living in Maui, and used to fly back on Hawaiian Air every six weeks. I would send the crew from Hawaiian Air and every Islander I knew, to this place. 

One night, I came in and the owner thanked me for all the people I sent. To reward me, I asked if I could substitute seaweed salad for my Miso Soup, with my Sushimi Dinner. She said, \"That's expensive, and I would have to pay extra\". 

Bottom line; My son's girl friend called Sushi Mon \"the Mc Donald's of Sushi\".  She was right.  Read my review of Jjanga Japanese Grill. It's better quality, a little less money, and superior quality and service.

Also, you won't have to wait long for a table or seat at the bar. 

This place has seen it's best days, and now rides on past reputation."}
{"text":"This guy is a dick. Very very very rude!! Sitting at the bar kindly calling orders to him when he's directly in front of me... getting zero acknowledgement is disrespectful. I'm unsure do I call it out again?
This is my second visit and the same service as my first time with this guy.
Since I'm not getting what I called out I asked the waiter to take my order.. the salmon comes... but it's missing the halibut, albacore and white tuna. 
We wait for 15 min... then ask the waiter again and I see him hand the chef the paper.. but I still don't get it. Unreal"}
{"text":"Thank you Sushi Mon for running such an unorganized event you single handedly overloaded all the other sushi restaurants in Henderson...(I'm sure that they appreciate you're stupidity) on the contrary to the person below me, they were very UNORGANIZED... I arrived with three friends at 450pm, they told us at the door that it was going to be a 7 to 8 HOUR wait.. and he \"hoped\" that it would only be that long... Not only has Sushi Mon lost three potential customers from trying them for the first time they have lost 3 customers for life... good job!"}
{"text":"Well..I'm bummed, I've been one time prior and remember it being supa-doopa!!  The sushi chefs would hoot and holler, play with you and have fun..and the food was great!  It was always packed and it was a pain in the arse to get a table.

We went last night and the customer service twas LAAAAME, they were burdened by us asking questions & attempting to get their attention.... And the food was ok-ok, total let down. 
Japanese Lasagna is one of my secret favorite indulgences and their \"version\" is a mayonnaise vomit overload!!  YUUUUCK!  I couldn't finish it.  I will say however, that the miso soup is a delight, but everything else I had, MEH, I'll pass.

Not sure what happened Sushi Mon, you were the sh*t, but now there are much much better places around. 


Eh. :("}
{"text":"Well, I've been to a ton of sushi places, but a few reasons why me and my gf seem to always come back to this place. Sushi Chef Soto, or as we call it now, the Soto experience. Come and sit at the counter and have him make you all the great specials share some great knowledge about sushi. 
Everything is so fresh and there is a great variety of rolls to choose from.  Scallop with yuzu is my personal favorite nagiri. Don't leave without trying the orgasm salad and don't forget about that Mochi Ice Cream. 
Get the all you can eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"This is the BEST SUSHI restaurant in Las Vegas.  And it's very afforadable, sushi buffet for $27.  It offers all the traditional nigiri and sashimis, but it also offer a variety of rolls.  As part of the buffet, you can also order hot dishes and desserts.  Everytime I am in Vegas, I will at least visit twice, and I am usually there only for 2-3 days.  It's a must visit like the Bellagio fountain."}
{"text":"Is it weird that an AYCE sushi place off the Vegas strip is better than any I've had in SoCal? Come on, we're losing to a land-locked state!

I wish my friends hadn't overhyped this place though, it made the experience less enjoyable since I was expecting my wallet to beg me to make it come back. 

My favorites: desserts, yellowtail collar, super white tuna, salmon nigiri

Their uni tasted rather funky though, but perhaps it was just our sitting."}
{"text":"I brought my boys (3 teenagers) here for lunch last week and we were pleased.  Everything was pretty good and tasted fresh.  Our servers were attentive and pleasant. We ordered some sashimi, a few basic rolls, and some of thier specialty rolls.  They allowed us to modify (one of my boys doesn't do avocado) without any issue. We went on a Thursday afternoon, around 3pm and there was no wait."}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant. It's that good. But it's small, so if you want to avoid the crowd, get there early. I was introduced to it by a friend/former boss. I've been to others (Sushi Fever- overpriced) but this place is the best!  If you're visiting LV,  and you want to try a sushi place, come here. I raved about this place to my husband, and when he finally had it, he agreed. At first, he didn't like the time limit, but he fould out that it's not so bad after all. There is a punch card (buy 10 get one free) available. You can order half rolls (except Spider Roll). 

There is sushi bar seating (where we sit) and tables lining up the walls, but again, this is a small place. It's got a good reputation, so I imagine that there are regulars. (Note: there is a funny smell near the bathroom, so I am mentioning this if you are particularly sensitive to smell, do not sit in that area.)  Anyway, once seated at the bar, the waitress takes your order for the side orders/appetizers like seaweed salad, edamame, soup, etc. (Note: the list is huge so pace yourself.)  
The sushi chef asks you for your sushi order soon after. Try the specialty rolls like Mexican, Caterpillar, Hawaiian- seriously the sushi roll menu is two pages long (front & back). Once I tried the Spicy roll and it was al little much for me. The chef kept looking at me to see if I would finish it and I did! It may feel overwhelming at first, but remember, you can order half- rolls. The fish is so fresh. It's so good. The service is excellent. Note: if you're ordering something that take more prep time than usual, order that first, rather than last. For dessert,  I like green tea ice cream. There were a couple times that I had so much sushi that I didn't have ice cream (And I love love love ice cream!). Lunch AYCE is $23.95 and Dinner AYCE is $28.95.

I've been here for lunch several times. I ordered a lunch special which was pretty good and very reasonable ($9.95 or less). My friend ordered the chirashi bowl ($12.95) which she always has for lunch."}
{"text":"The best all-you-can-eat sushi in Las Vegas.  Everything is fresh and flavorful.  The AYCE menu includes side dishes and deserts.  They also allow you to order half orders on most items.

The chubby roll....it's the second biggest roll i've ever seen (the biggest roll is also at sushimon, the monster roll) and is an explosion of flavor.  A must have.

The only downside is the number of douchebags and hipsters at this place.  There can be a bit of a line on weekends."}
{"text":"A few years ago Sushi Mon was one of our more highly regarded joints for AYCE. As we have since expanded our search to other local spots around town, it's taken a serious hit on the sushi meter as it just cannot compare anymore.

While their nigiri remains high in quality and freshness (albeit the portions have gotten noticeably smaller), their rolls are not particularly interesting. A great deal of the rolls contain crab stick which irks me. A lot of \"crab,\" a lot of cucumber, a lot of tuna. Nothing different or special. They are also very dry. This negatively impacts the experience if you're not feasting on AYCE nigiri alone, as I've sometimes been tempted to do. 

Our chef didn't seem too enthusiastic either. I hate sitting at the sushi bar feeling like I'm bothering he chef. I'm aware the chef-customer dynamic is different in AYCE than in traditional and authentic sushi settings, but maybe a smile when we order? Perhaps asking once or twice if we'd like anything else? 

It's nice having a choice for all those late-night sushi cravings, but Sakana still wins in my book for best AYCE in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"sushi Mon is our go to Sushi place. Food is consistent, always fresh and yummy. chef's are passionate with what they create- sushi rolls are eye catching and dekectable. the bus boy Ulysees is forever sweet, friendly and customer service is exemplary. the waitress are all pleasant and friendly. location is accessible with ample parking. cleanliness is consistent! this is one place to add to your favorites!"}
{"text":"It saddens me to give this joint 3 stars because this was my favorite AYCE spot in town. They offer an AYCE menu, which is $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner, but you can also opt for a la carte sushi. Prices vary for a la carte depending on what your order. Just remember, if you do a la carte, you're not allowed to share with an AYCE patron in your party. If you're hungry and want everything and anything on the menu, AYCE is the way to go. 

Throughout the years, their quality and flavors have gone down. Their service is a hit or miss depending on the time you come in. I live down the street so this was our spot to go to. On our last visit however, things were lacking.

The seaweed salad has gotten really watery and salty. This is usually my favorite appetizer to order, but this time it was hard to eat. The garlic edamame was awful. They overcooked the garlic and now our edamame was just bitter. My bf ordered the tiger roll and his reaction to the presentation was \"it's not made with love anymore.\" The avocado looked like it had been smeared over the top of the roll instead of cut nicely and placed on top. And it was an overkill with the imitation crab inside. Same thing with the lemon roll. Really sloppy presentation and too much imitation crab. The nigiri we ordered was really good though. Not too much rice and the fish was nice and plump. And I love their yellowtail collar. If it's on the specials menu, order one!! It's tender, moist and grilled to perfection. 

All in all, this isn't a bad sushi joint. I'm just hoping that we just dined in on an off night because I really do like this spot."}
{"text":"Ok , so my Sushi spot has always been Yamasushi. Because they had set the standard high from the very first time. Today I decided to try this place out because it was closer to where I live, and let me tell you , This place is AMAZING!!! I think I might have found a new spot. The only n hat I've thing about this place is that they don't have the \"no name roll\" that Yamasushi has. That's why they got a 4 Star from me. Lol other than that this place is well worth it!! Specially their AYCE!!!!!!! Winning!!!!"}
{"text":"They bumped up their prices a little. Its now $22 for lunch and $27 for dinner. But I calculated I ate well over $40 worth tonight. By myself. I'm gonna throw it all up anyways. jk. I tried inducing vomiting after a few large meals and could never get it to work out. I just dry heave. 

Speaking of dry heaving (unrelated), I bent over today to pick something up and close-mouth burped. I TOTALLY puked in my mouth. My stomach was pretty empty so it was like, pure bile. GROSS. I cried. 

Anyways. My circuit: 
two orders of salmon 
two orders of hamachi 
hirame with shiso 
half Moon roll (to satisfy the whitey in me) 
half Frying Jason (to satisfy the glutton) 
baked green mussel 
white tuna 
otoro 
green tea ice cream 

If you pay item by item, it averages $5 per for nigiri and $8 for rolls. 

You have to strategically order your items. Get your nigiri started first. Then order a roll during round two because it takes longer. There is a science to AYCE sushi. You must optimize your time. The chefs can get busy. And don't be a douche because the chef's mutter indiscretions about you under their breaths in Japanese if you piss them off. 

I also get a hot green tea. But that shit is piping hot. I have to let it cool off for like 10 minutes before I can even think about sipping it. I can't even hold the damn cup. 

I'm bummed they discontinued the anago. There aren't many places in Vegas where you can find anago. They also don't have Spanish mackerel. (Ichiza has it sometimes! Carpaccio) 

They also have uni. Its not on the menu. Neither is the white tuna or toro (I think). 

A big bonus is that they're open late, 2a. Wait, is that a bonus? Because I always gorge myself then want to go straight to bed. I went tonight at 1245a. It looked like the crowd was winding down. Then at like 115, three parties walked in. Last call is at 130. Normally. Unless three parties walk in at 115a. 

Sushi is aways good with a beer and sake. 

They always have the tv on ESPN. Sound off.

{"text":"I give this place 3 stars only because the food was good, as for the service the workers need to work on their manners as well as bringing the food out slightly faster.
It took a good 10-15 mins for our server to bring out food we had ordered, so my gf and friends were just sitting there drinking the green tea float (which was really good until the ice cream melted lol)
Long review short, if you want good sushi and don't care about service all the much give this place a shot, but as for me I enjoy having great service as well as great food."}
{"text":"Had a few rolls, miso soup and Sake. The food was pretty good, but the service was non existent! 

No one asked if we wanted more hot tea or cold Sake. When I asked for fresh wasabe, the sushi chef said 'it too expensive for our clients'. 

We'll go to Naka Sushi next time."}
{"text":"Love, this place great super fresh sushi, family friendly  though a little small they make it work !! Try pastel and lemon rolls amazing! And the best are their salmon belly and scallop sashimi!!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. I would rate it 4.5! We had a party of 11, so the wait was long (approx an hr!) and the place is small. The sushi tasted fresh, just the way I like it! Some of the rolls I didn't really like, but some were delicious! Great service as well! For an AYCE sushi place, I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"All You Can Eat (LUNCH) - $21.95
All You Can Eat (Dinner) - $26.95

We went to the Sushi Mon for all you can eat lunch. I didn't realize that something I love is only served during dinner hours. It is a little pity. The quality of the fishes can be better. People are always talking about the buffets of Las Vegas. This one is just OK to me."}
{"text":"This place is back on my list, they must have gotten new management or something. But their fish quality is really good and I like how their rice portion to sushi is smaller than other AYCE sushi spots. Although they don't have torro I can settle of them and they also do half rolls not like other AYCE sushi spots where your last roll is a half. They also have a stamp card :)"}
{"text":"Slow, inattentive service. They forgot our first sushi order and won't make any eye contact when we were trying to get their attention to order more. Had to follow up on our order twice. One server took our tray for wasabi and never replaced it although we weren't done eating yet and didn't even asked us if we wanted anything else. None of the servers asked us how we were doing or whether we wanted to order more. Oh no, wait! One person did ask when she was giving us our bill which we haven't even asked for yet. I guess that's one thing they are really attentive with. Never, ever coming back. Worst service ever!

Nothing special about the food either."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi is the best bang for your buck when you're able to consume more food than a starving college student. Now that i've been finished with school my ability to consume half the oceans supply of fish has greatly diminished but nonetheless I still can hammer time quite a fair amount of sushi.

Atmosphere/service: Fairly busy with an attentive sushi bar but as for the male wait staff it could be much better.  The decor resembles that of an older sushi restaurant that's been in business and Sushi mon has definitely been one of the lasting pioneers for sushi.

Food: I only eat nigiri and will share a roll with a friend. That being said, the quality of the fish is more important and essentially thats what sushi is, is the nigiri. I'm a yellowtail fiend and typically the first 2 orders are incredibly fresh with a beautiful dark pink to clear color. The chefs here are Japanese trained and cut the nigiri with just the right amount of thickness and low rice to fish ratio. They have implemented a new white chef who (no offense) cuts the nigiri poorly.

Overall: Quiet nights when I just want to enjoy sushi alone, this is the place I choose. Fresh nigiri, professional sushi chefs, and proximity to my home makes this a winner"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing sushi and decent service. All you can eat is the only way to go, make sure the whole group gets it so everyone can share. Great miso soup, baked green mussels and an interesting dynamite, which is served piping hot and in a mini cast iron. 

Friday and Saturday nights are always slammed so prepare to get there early and maybe have a coffee next-door while you wait for your table. More patrons than seats is always a good sign!"}
{"text":"I like the all you can eat. So much more authentic and tastier than todai. The sushi is okay.  Can't say I had better \"all you can eat\" sushi but I had better sushi."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we hit Sushi Mon and are never disappointed! Great selection and awesome prices. My husband gets the AYCE and I order the Taylor roll. Tried the garlic edamame this time and it was so delicious that I was sad it was my first time ordering them! Can't wait to come back in May and take two orders to-go :)"}
{"text":"Customer service is great. The sushi is good, not my favorite, but they do have takoyaki; so that's a plus. They have some pretty interesting and yummy rolls. The O.I.D is slightly sweet a savory, the chubby roll is very very crisp and super refreshing. The 911 has spicy tuna and habanero sauce so it is extremely spicy almost too much to be enjoyable. But overall with the decent food and great service it's a must try at least once"}
{"text":"One word! Dynamite!! Get it, you'll thank me! AYCE here is worth the drive/wait. Try spider roll. Baked 428 is really good. And try something I call Hawaiian thunder! You'll need to order a Mahalo roll, a dynamite and 4 orders of unagi(fresh water eel 2 pieces an order). On a piece of the Mahalo roll, you put a spoon full of dynamite on it. Then grab an eel piece from the unagi and place it on top of the dynamite. And enjoy your Hawaiian thunder!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot. I used to come here every time I was in Vegas when I lived in Cali. Now that I live in Vegas, I cant get enough of this place. I love sushi and this place offers all kinds of yummy choices. There yellow tail collar is one of my faves!  

Only bummer is that space inside is kind of small so sometimes you are waiting a while for a table. Also, if you have a large party, its hard for them to accommodate."}
{"text":"Never been to a sushi place like this and I enjoyed it. Good service and they were packed. I'll try them again, hopefully when not so busy so I'm not afraid to get feedback on dishes.

Part 2: came here for supper and ate off the menu instead of the All You Can Eat Sushi. Wow good food great price and decent service. Added a star to my original review."}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi is a great deal here. Excellent fresh sushi. I was trying to keep to my diet and I ordered the California Salad. Super tasty and amazingly filling. It was kind of weird to have crab meat without rice but the avocado was a perfect touch. I also ordered the dynamite appetizer. Food takes some time to come out but it's a great place to get good sushi. Just gotta be patience and learn not to fill up on the rice"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened. I'll keep coming back. Top notch sushi, sides, and entrees. Fish is always fresh here. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I probably came to try this place at a bad time. Came here at midnight to eat their AYCE. The fish wasn't that fresh. I ordered the sweet shrimp nigiri and the fish was frozen but I didn't want to complain to our chef because I figured it was late and they probably was ready to go home. Ordered some other items and wasn't too impressed. The place was pretty small and not much decorations."}
{"text":"Super white! This is a great little AYCE sushi place to stop at on the way to Vegas. There's almost always a wait here, so be prepared to build your hunger even further for 30-60 minutes. Once seated though the food comes pretty quickly. I get mostly nigiri, the Super white is my favorite! The uni wasn't really good here and there was way too much rice on this one. You can order 1/2 rolls for my variety. The crispy rice is really good. Tempura ice cream FTW, I wish I could have different flavors (like green tea), but the tempura only comes in vanilla. I just order a green tea ice cream on the side and mix them!"}
{"text":"I love this All you can eat sushi spot. Its a must to go whenever I'm in the 702. For about $27 per person it's not bad. We usually order half orders of sushi to have lots a variety. You can even have order teriyaki chicken, shu mai, desserts, etc because it's included with the all you can eat selections.

It's open late and does get pretty packed during the evenings, but it's worth the wait. I so wish they had a spot like this back home. Its okay, because it's a place I look forward to eat at when I come visit."}
{"text":"Once upon a time like 10 years ago this used to be the spot to go,  especially late at night for all you can eat sushi.   As I've gotten older all you can eat sushi has lost its appeal, but late night sushi is still a very real need.   The last two times I have given in to the craving  and not wanted to drive more than a few minutes from the comfort of my home, I had come here and been severely disappointed.   

Don't get me wrong I have lowered my expectations for a place who does all you can eat,  which I personally don't do.  I just get a roll or two, and had remembered they had some rolls I really liked.  However it was just just barely passable the first of the two times I went back,  and the last time I went hoping it was a fluke it was basically inedible. 

This past time just walking in to get my order the place had an old fishy smell hidden under the scent of the oil from the fryer. I got the hurricane roll.  The rice was dry like it had been sitting for a while,  the fish inside it might as well have been cat food,  the salmon tempura was almost like dehydrated salmon that had been coated in a tempura batter that had no crunch at all.  It had just soaked up all the oil and become soft and spoungy. To make matters worse it was like 13 dollars for this sadness in a styrofoam container.   They also put the sauces meant to be on the roll all in different places.  One was on top,  another in the container on the side,  and the other I realized after forcing it down my throat (I felt bad my boyfriend got it for me, and didn't want to waist it) ,had been stuck in the bag itself away from the roll completely. 

Honestly right across the street is Albertsons. They are open late too,  the rolls are cheaper, and even though they aren't the most amazing in the world, are still 10 times better than what I  consumed last night.  Supermarket sushi at a non Asian market should not be better than a sushi house with chefs making things to order.  This is basically a travesty, and the nostalgia I had for this place is not enough to get me to come back ever."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi in town. Service, food, ambience, everything. You won't find another AYCE sushi as good as this."}
{"text":"ayce!!! sushi is good everytime i come at least 2x a month. Only if their service could be just as good as their sushi."}
{"text":"Love it so much the people are grey the sushi chefs are amazing and nice they give you really good service as well just make sure you call ahead and reserve a spot or you might be waiting."}
{"text":"Great sushi with fast service. You can't go wrong with all you can eat sushi. I had a great time with the friends and family a must if you are looking for a great environment."}
{"text":"Perhaps the friendliest sushi spot in town, Sushi Mon also offers a staggering variety of sushi rolls and traditional Japanese dishes (don't miss the shrimp tempura appetizer).
All-you-can-eat sushi costs $23.95 per person and is a pretty good deal, considering you can order anything off the menu, including their delicious plum ice cream. You can also order any roll a la carte, either half or full orders.
A tiny, neighborhood joint with friendly staff, great chefs and a relaxed atmosphere, Sushi Mon is one place not to be missed."}
{"text":"i went to sushi mon in sarah a few months ago and I'm finally writing a review for them so that I can tell you all of the bad service and treatment I received there.  

I went about 11:30 pm since I was straving for some sushi.  I went for the all you can eat and ordered the standard nigiri of tuna salmon hamachi unagi and tai  with some apps like yakisoba, gyoza, poke salad and curry rice,  when i got the sushi it was all good until i took a bite of the tai (snapper) which had a big ass bone in it which stuck all the way in my teeth.  i told the waitress of the situation and that my mouth and teeth was bleeding from the bone which i showed her.  and she went off to tell the chef.  what I noticed was appauling.  he was surprised that their was a bone in the sushi for one.  then nobody came out to say sorry or anything to me..  the server came back and said that the chef was going to make me another order of snapper sushi.. as if that was going to solve everything.  i guess they thought a new order of snapper was going to stop my mouth from bleeding...  well the chef never came out to appologize and after 30 min of waiting i got tired and asked for the check thinking that they would comp my meal and stuff.  Well I thought wrong.  they brought my bill for the full price.  this is when i really got pissed off.  I went over to the cashiers counter and I told them if they was going to give my a discount at least for causing my mouth to bleed from their incompetence.  Since they didn't even say that they are sorry or anything.  i then asked for the manager or owner.  the server said that they didn't have a manager and the owner only comes on the weekend. I then asked who was in charge of the restaurant cause there has to be someone in charge.  the server said no one was in charge.  I then asked to speak to the owner on the phone.  the server said that she can only call her at a certain time and she can not give me her number.  so I gave her my number so the owner can call me.  

I have yet to hear from her.  so I will be calling her soon.  I have contacted the better business bureal and advised them of this situation.

Oh!! and the worse thing is after I paid the bill the server has the nerve to ask me if I wanted a stamp card where if I eat there 10 times the 11th time is free.   I laughed so hard at them and told them do you think I would come back after all that??"}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good. I like their AYCE. If you like bananas and smoothies, you have to try the hanging monkey drink. It's addicting!"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place. Good food. It is a little loud, but it makes up for that by being open late. It is hard to get a table most of the time because it is so popular."}
{"text":"I gave my opinion when i checked in. Not the greatest sushi place. I just ate here coz it's close to my house.  Should have had pizza instead"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Sushi Mon is as good as I remember it from two years ago. You know how something is always better in your memory. It's $25 for all you can eat, made to order sushi. We had that for lunch and although she told us that she would probably have to hold us to the 45 minute rule (they have you cut you off after 45 minutes), we didn't feel pressured at all the entire time we were there and we were definitely still eating after 45 minutes. We probably got by with an hour and then just hung out and talked after that. 

Everything was good, and what I like about this place is that you can order almost everything off the menu, they don't limit you to a certain section or items because of AYCE. You can get rolls at half the size, so you can try things you normally wouldn't order. They have a variety of different rolls, with surprisingly good combination of ingredients. The quality of fish is good, not great, but definitely slightly above average for the price. 

We had all the different nigiri sushi, including the cajun albacore which I really liked. Had a little bit of kick with the ponzu flavor. The No Name rolls was pretty good, and I think we had the Athena as well. I say, just go for it, and if you don't want a roll, sometimes they can just do a handroll for you with the same ingredients. We also had a couple of yellowtail collars, edamame, a cucumber salad, and to top it off, we had lychee sorbet (super yummy with lychee jelly mixed in), and tempura ice cream which was made with vanilla ice cream. It was coated in what looked to be pound cake and then deep fried. Or attempted to be deep fried. Either way, I would not get it again. 

Service was great, and they carefully explained everything and happily took our order. They never made us feel like we could only order the cheaper items because of the AYCE, and service was great throughout. I hope to come back on a future trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is definitely a spot that I would hit up all of the time if I lived out here.  I do wish it was closer to the strip where all the action is.  We happened to eat here for their lunchtime AYCE special at 23.95.  IMO it's a great deal and it not only includes sushi but also hot appetizers, tempura, and even ice cream!  This place has its fair share of innovative rolls to appeal to the not so adventurous sushi eater and plenty of the classic nigiris for the traditionalists.

I tend to stick to the nigiri sushi to start with and it was actually surprisingly better than I expected.  Don't get me wrong, its not the fresh from the fish monger, like blue fin tuna from Japan or toro, but its better than a Todai or most other AYCE places.  They even allow you to do individual nigiri or half rolls so that you don't waste!  What a great option.

I have to say that I enjoyed the yellowtail, albacore and seared tuna here quite a bit.  The lunch special is almost identical to the dinner one and cheaper.  I guess the big bonus with this place is that they are open late for those late night cravings."}
{"text":"the foods are great but the service... well it is ok. 
The servers are little bit slow and take so long to just get my order. I understand they are busy but some times it irritates me."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get ayce because as much as I eat it's worth it. They have a good variety of appetizers that come with the ayce I always get baked mussels and garlic edamame. My favorite nigiri is garlic tuna and Cajun albacore. The Cynthia roll and spider roll are delicious!!! This is my to go spot and even when it's busy we still get great service."}
{"text":"Awesome all you can eat sushi. I have been there a few times and I still cannot comprehend how good and affordable this place can be. All the food is fresh with good presentation. Service is outstanding too. There isn't much I can say but GO THERE and check it out. Pay attention to the specials for the day since that list usually has some higher tier items that have a limit on number of orders. My favorite is the Fresh Scallop (Hotate)."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually love going here to eat and enjoying their all-you-can-eat options. Last night both of us went there to eat. He had the all-you-can-eat which I believe included in a sexy lady and a Dragon Roll, I ate a half roll of Athena and sunrise or Sunset I can't remember which one it was one of those names though. And after we got home from eating, about 4 hours later, my husband got extremely sick he threw up everywhere. I then followed suit. :( it's still really early in the morning so I'm sick this morning but first thing I'm going to do is call the restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome, great service, friendly, fast and the best sushi and seaweed salad ever."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi here. Service is friendly.  AYCE.  I'd avoid all the baked stuff because it is pretty heavy.  Well, if you want to try something, order a half portion.  Other than that, can't go wrong here.  Like everybody else is saying, it's good!  Appetizers and dessert included!  I'll be looking forward to coming back here again next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This review probably more to do with what Sushi Mon used to be and less about what it is now. Since new management took over, there no longer is Uni (which I actually don't like but feel like it added some value to the AYCE), Toro, Sake Shooters or unlimited sake Mon-Thu. I am not sure if it has actually gone up in price but it feels like it has and the value isn't as good as it used to be. 

The fish here is still pretty solid, there is a crispy rice and tuna roll that is probably the best thing we had there. Also the chefs don't seem to be as heavy handed with the yuzu which was one of my main complaints in the past. The one thing I didn't like was the Ahi Poke bowl. It used to be a nice starter of just fresh pieces, now it has a lot of other things in the bowl which I did not appreciate. Still a place that is probably worth the AYCE price, and the food is good but it used to be better so I think I am comparing it to that"}
{"text":"My buddy Wo Z. recommended this place to me and the fellas. He's a big time eater so he deserves some credit & I trust his judgement. This place is no where near the strip, you're going to take a lovely drive on Sahara before you reach this place. it's easily missed in this plaza since it's kind of hidden in the corner so keep your eyes peeled.

We were warned that this place gets packed so we actually arrived at 5pm for dinner on a Saturday during Memorial Weekend. It was probably a good idea to eat early anyways since we were planning to tear it up later on that night. The 7 of us all sat at the sushi bar. The restaurant isn't that big in general.

We now had 60 minutes to play man versus food. For AYCE, that's the time limit. On a good note, they had unlimited hot sake free with the AYCE too but we passed on it to concentrate all our efforts on the food. Anything and everything on the menu was a green light. Wo said keep en eye for the items on the boards but I never saw the boards.

I honestly have low expectations for Japanese AYCE period. Todai was great the first 2-3 times then you realize how whack it is. Fortunately, Sushi Mon wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Plus they pumped out our orders with a mad quickness (made to order and not already rotting out). They have everything from sushi (cajun albacore is note worthy) to crazy rolls and you can even order ice cream (green tea, plum, and red bean) for dessert. I don't think the AYCE is mandatory but if someone in your party decides to go with it, I believe everyone on your table needs to be on the same page. Nah mean?

Be warned though that some of the rolls are rice and kewpie (Japanese mayo) heavy and that's going to put a major road block in your appetite. For some of the crazy rolls (8 pieces) you may ask them to make it a half order. If the roll is 5 pieces like the spider roll (soft shell crab) they will not make a half order for it. Every creation on the menu sounds crazy but stick with what you know first. Play it safe before you venture out too far. Certain rolls like the lasagna or volcano rolls are way too rich and heavy. Those are under the baked rolls. I'd keep away from those.

All in all, the place wasn't too bad. I wouldn't say I need to come back to Sushi Mon everytime I am in Vegas but if someone was to ask for a Japanese AYCE joint, they would be mentioned. The quality was decent and the waitresses were friendly. With drinks, tax, & tip, we ended up paying around $30 something each. Not too shabby. Bring that appetite if you come here for some AYCE sushi. Get in mahhh belly!"}
{"text":"Love love love love this place! I used to eat here a couple times a week until I was kinda spent on it. Needed a break. =)

Their waitstaff are super friendly and bust their asses to keep you happy. They always remember me when I walk in too, which makes a huge difference to me. Restaurant is always clean as well, including the bathrooms.

Everything here is delicious. I've never had one thing here that wasn't, and I've tried pretty much everything on the menu. However, they changed their menu pretty recently and got rid of a lot of the dinner specials. This makes me sad. Their \"love boat\" dinner special was the best! They still have a lot of dinner specials though, like the salmon special, which is so good and such a great value.

I don't think they have their volcano #2 roll either, which was amazing!

I've never done the all you can eat sushi here, so I can't vouch for that."}
{"text":"Recommended by Lisa C. and Jacob H. ... came here for lunch during my Yelp Spring Break weekend  and all i have to say is WOW, so good! Lunch price is $22, Dinner is $27.

AYCE nigiri, sushi rolls, appetizers, side dishes, and desserts! The fish was fresh and the service was pretty fast. The day we were there, they had salmon belly nigiri.. oh man, i don't know how many pieces I have ate. 

onto the dessert, we had a choice of fried ice cream, black sesame mochi, lychee sorbet, and green tea ice cream. The lychee sorbet was so refreshing! the fragrance of the lychee was just unbelievably good! Each bite i took was so delicious, and it had lychee jelly in them too! I had two of this dessert .. i could have eaten extra scoops if i wanted to... but i stopped myself, cuz i shouldn't be greedy. Gotta let other customers have some! Man, thinking about it now is making me salivate. I want to go back! 

If you come during dinner, they also have many more special side / appetizers dishes and sushi.  Also you'll get to order uni and sweet shrimp! 

Although it is a little out of the way from the Las Vegas Strip, i wouldnt mind visiting Sushi Mon again. Maybe I'll come here on the way to vegas before i check in ... or on the way back home.

Nonetheless, Sushi Mon, YOU will see me again! Next time.. it'll be for dinner!"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon for me is hit or miss. There have been times when I've had excellent sushi and other times not so good. Staff is very friendly and welcoming which is why I keep going."}
{"text":"YUM!  sushi was the perfect thing to eat after getting my teeth cleaned down the street.  soft food that won't hurt your slightly sore teeth/gums.

small place...probably only seats 50 people (including the sushi bar).  service was excellent.  probably not a place to come to if you're staying on the strip (as it's about 20 mins away), but i have family here and i love that they take me to the off-the-strip places.

all you can eat lunch for $21.95.  came here with my cousins and i let them do all the ordering.  there were two large full pages of sushi, rolls, specialties and sides to choose from.  we didn't get any rolls, because of the \"too filling\" factor.  i liked that the cooked items such as tempura and calamari came in servings of 4 pieces so it was enough for each of us to have one and move on to the next item.  the sides (cold salads) are a very good accompaniment.    

i never find the quality of fish to be that spectacular at AYCE places, but sushi mon was quite good!  the white tuna (that i'd never had before) melted in my mouth!    

end your meal with the plum ice cream.  with many pieces of actual plum in it, it's so yummy!  then again, since it's AYCE, get the red bean and green tea too!

(ROTD #4)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a ling time and I don't really write reviews but I have to say this is one of my top sushi places to go to, hands down!! I have not had any major let downs from this place from past visits. I did go to Sushi Mon last night and a few nights before and both visit were pleasant. :)


Restaurant
A bit small but it is worth the wait if you go with a group. Price is a bit more than most places but worth every single penny. :) Family oriented and clean kind of. The restrooms did have a smell but what would you expect, people do their business in there. Lol 

Service
Is on point, my server was very friendly and suggested a few other food items that weren't listed on the menu. She also tended to my table before the food was done/finished so waiting for the next orders wouldn't take long to wait. 

Food
Nigiri was awesome. Came out quick and the salmon belly is mouth watering. You just have to ask since they do run out quickly. Lol The baked mussels are fresh unlike a few other places where they get precooked mussels. :(
Pork belly is good but not the best that I have tried at a sushi restaurant. They also do half orders on most of their rolls, so if your not to sure if you can finish just get half order or hand rolls.

Cons
They don't  serve fresh oysters and the
steamed gyoza was burt at the bottom of them :(


All in all 4.5 stars :) good job Sushi Mon."}
{"text":"Finally....Kuge HAS STEPPED FOOT...into the Sushi Mon establishment.  After being devastated from the news that Kan Pai no longer had AYCE sushi, Kuge was able to find Sushi Mon about 1000 feet away.

When Kuge arrived, he noticed Sushi Mon was more packed than the his Smackdown Hotel.  But luckily Kuge and two of his friends were greeted instantly upon walking in by the friendly hostess and were placed at the sushi bar.

It was as if a double rainbow appeared in front of Kuge as he gazed at the AYCE menu and what Sushi Mon had to offer.  With a great selection of sushi and nigari, Kuge knew he had to try many different kinds of rolls to get the full Sushi-Mon experience.

Some rolls The Great One ordered:

Chubby Roll - Phenomenal,  it was only a 5 roll count but it was a great size and Kuge had no problems with the roll.

Sunrise Roll - Since Kuge isn't a great sushi elitist, nor is professional food reviewer, he is stuck using generic terms without much description.  But other wise, Kuge believes this roll had a variety of flavors and was decent.

9-1-1 Roll - The Great One never takes spicy rolls seriously since he loves to pretend to be Mexican and believes he can handle spice.  The 9-1-1 roll completely destroyed Kuge's tastebuds with insane spice he never expected to happen.  Unfortunately the spice overcame any flavor Kuge would try to find.  

Fresh Water Eel - Alright

There were a few other \"special\" rolls that Kuge ordered, but he is sadden that they were only average at best.

The service from the cooks and speed of the order Kuge received was great.  The staff was friendly, although the friends of The Great One complained that they didn't have that good of service which displeases Kuge.

No worries though, Kuge acknowledges that he strives to create perfect reviews but even they are long winded.  So in order to please his fans:

TL;DR - Kuge was saddened that most of the rolls he ordered were average (with an exception of chubby roll) and even though the service was good for him, he cannot give Sushi Mon  no more than 3.5 Rock Bottoms out of 5.  He definitely prefers Sushi Mon over Hakari for AYCE but that's as far as he'll go."}
{"text":"How I rate is would I come back. Would I? Yes. 1 because of the options. 2. The nice workers and Yoshi, definitely coming back for him. 3. Quick to serving and attending me. 4. Sushi was good! 5. They have Lychee Sorbet. Uhmmm, YESSS!!!

I want to tell you about my sushi chef though. I'm not too sure his name but on his apron it says Yoshi. He is the reason why I'm giving the extra star on my review. Super nice, always trying to convince you what's the days special and new items. Convinced me so well I got a new item from his suggestions. Very smiley and I love it. Tries to keep a conversation with you. 

Currently eating their AYCE. I've been to multiple multiple AYCE. I usually vary by options and prices. Option wise they have a handful, not as much as the ones I usually go to near UNLV but this their options are decent. Prices are the same as any other one. By the way, I am eating for 1, so sitting at the bar was my best choice. Thursday night at 10 pm, not so crowded. Music playing, not too loud not too low. Servers, I'm at the bar so they don't really serve me but are attendant. Better than others in my opinion. 


The reason why I wanted to give 4 stars in the first place was the small size of nigiri that they serve. A lot smaller than anywhere I've been. Even in San Francisco. And because, I'm guessing a new chef that he was mentoring behind him, kept staring making me feel uncomfortable. Not going to name names and leave it at that. But Yoshi was so polite and courteous to me, I had to give the extra star."}
{"text":"Very good sushi!. Went there two days i a row for lunch. The second day I went for lunch I asked for dinner price to eat Uni. It was worth every penny to pay 5 dollars more. 

The service was great. Easy to call service all the time. Also recommend sitting at sushi bar. It is easier to order when you sit in front of the chef.  The sushi chef remembered me from yesterday and started to make sushi for me after asking me if I want similar sushi/ portions from yesterday. The dessert green tea ice cream was kind of lacking, but the tempura ice cream was very good. 

Overall I would recommend anyone to eat here. I would personally come here regularly if I lived around the area."}
{"text":"Really great AYCE sushi with a lot of selection, including kitchen items and desserts."}
{"text":"My husband always buys me the miso soup here, and it's really delicious! He calls and orders, so it's ready by the time he goes pick it up.
So we came for dinner the other day and the place was packed, which I thought It was a good thing, meaning it's a good place with good food. 

And it really is! They have \"all you can eat\" option, it's not super cheap but their menu is amazing, so it's fair. If you like Japanese food you'll go crazy here! And you can have more than one dessert if you pick \"all you can eat\", how awesome is that? The food is amazing, seriously.

The service is good too, the lady taking care of us was really nice and knowledgeable. They bring everything considerably fast and I got everything I ordered.

The only bad thing about the restaurant is that the tables are very close to one another so you don't have privacy and can't help but to listen to others people's conversations. 
I'm going back for sure, asap!"}
{"text":"So my fellow yelper and Vegas kama'aina Liza L. highly recommended this place on my recent trip to Vegas. I wanted reasonably-priced sushi and this place did not disappoint. For $27, you get an all-you-can eat array of nigiri, rolls, side dishes (edamame, calamari, poke, oysters, etc.) and dessert.  Also, in addition to hot tea, hot sake was also part of the beverage selection. Crazy! The quality of the fish was very good. Staff were very attentive. I appreciated the sushi chef asking if I wanted anything else when he saw that my plate was empty. Too good. Supposedly, there is a one-hour time limit but they weren't very strict about it when I went. I will definitely make a return visit the next time I'm Vegas-bound! Thanks, Liza L. for the introduction! :D"}
{"text":"I've had Sushi Mon on my radar for a long time, but since it is not anywhere near my house, nor is it around anywhere I tend to go all the time it has been collecting dust on my \"Bookmark\" shelf. Luckily lunch with a friend who works in the area happened to arise, so my reason to waste some gas to come here was justified at last!

First off we arrived right when they opened at 11:45 AM and we were not the only ones waiting. About four other parties walked in the door at the same time as us. We were seated immediately at a two-person table and we let them know we would be doing the AYCE lunch special. 

I've heard really great things about Sushi Mon so I was hoping it would not disappoint. The restaurant itself is on the smallish side and decor is pretty much minimal and non-existent. Oh well, as long as the fish is good right? 

I skipped appetizers and went straight into the sushi. I figured I wouldn't fill myself up on anything but fish. Our server quickly took our order. 

Nigiri:
Garlic Tuna
Yum Yum Scallop
Salmon 

All were good, but my favorite was the Yum Yum Scallop. If I were to go back, this would be on the menu for a return trip.

Rolls:
1/2 J.J. Roll - Lovely roll, really enjoyed the addition of asparagus and avocado.
Lemon Roll - My friend ordered this one and I had a piece, it was very fragrant and refreshing
Chubby (5 pieces) - Good roll, nothing spectacular, but well put together, the soybean paper around it is a nice change.

Hand-Rolls: Per usual I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll. I always do a sushi places. This one was tasty, so I actually had two. =o^-^o=

Other:
I did order the Poke bowl. It was okay, nothing special, but at least it was not overly-salted. I ended my meal with strawberry mochi ice cream - yummy! But so cold it hurt my teeth. But. That's just because I have sensitive teeth. Tee hee.

Overall: 

I believe the \"hype\" is true. This place serves up GOOD, QUALITY sushi. And that is what matters when you are eating raw fish. Nothing tasted strange or wrong to me. The fish was the perfect temperature. The presentations were simple, but the rolls were made well. I would reccomened Sushi Mon and I would love to go back sometime if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I have been going to this sushi mon location for years and there is no comparison in town. Always the best quality rolls and always a pleasant experience. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"My bad for falling for all the Yelp hype on this place. Maybe if sushi scraps were in high demand this place could be king... service is good***, just beware of what you are getting. Our sushi chef was oh so talented at serving up thin slices of scrappy fish (that most sushi bars would trash) on large clumps of rice and big rolls with more hidden waste. Gristle and black stuff on old limp albacore (not worth the risk). So sorry, but this is not the place to dine on quality morsels of delightful fresh fish."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a Christmas dinner and it was amazing! It was my first time having made to order all you can eat sushi. A few people in our party had been to this spot before and it exceeded my expectations. We arrived about an hour and a half before we were hungry to put our name in. I was surprised the wait was so long but after going I could see why and plan to bring friends to try this place out the next time we are in Vegas :]

The service was great (I compared it to busy KBBQ spots) and the sushi was so fresh. We ordered a lot of the sashimi but surprisingly the sweet shrimp and ecstasy rolls were really good. 

The prices were also great. The bento box we ordered for the youngest person at our table was $9.95 and included miso soup, salad, tempura, white rice, California rolls and teriyaki chicken. 

The all you can eat the rest of us had was $27/ person."}
{"text":"Amazing AYCE sushi!!! Great flavor and great service. The sewer smell is very off putting, but after awhile you don't notice it. The sushi makes up for the weird smell."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Sushi restaurants in Las Vegas area, fish is always good, and fresh. Garlic edamame is the best, deserts are delicious. Hot Saki is super yummy..."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today after reading bunch of reviews on yelp. Now, I wish I can give this place negative stars, but unfortunately, lowest I can go is 1 star.

First off, the food is just average compare to ayce sushi restaurants in socal. I would give 3 stars just for food. What really took all the stars away from my review was their service. First round of order that we put in went okay, but our second round we had to wait 25 mins! The chef who took our order wasn't even making our food. They only had two chefs working to serve the whole restaurant, which was filling up for dinner at the time we went. I am usually a patient person, but this place just crossed the line. One of the waitresses came by to ask if we were doing okay, and I told her we've been waiting for 25 mins and all I got from her was a sad face... seriously? I wasn't expecting to get trolled by a waitress during my Vegas trip, but it happened today. So sad to see all these people going crazy over this restaurant because this place doesn't deserve any stars."}
{"text":"Service and food were good. They have all you can eat,  but not a big fan of the 1 hour rule. Not sure if they enforce it. Last night,  the complementary salad was overly salty. Overall, the sushi and tempura were good."}
{"text":"For all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas you can't beat Sushi Mon. The restaurant is not too big so sometimes there is a long wait, but if you don't mind eating at the sushi bar you are good to go. I recommend the Pastel and Spider for cut rolls. Cajun albacore is a delight as well. If you don't do the all you can eat the pricing is very reasonable. If you do the all you can eat do not leave without ordering the Yellow Tail Collar. It is a delicacy and I highly recommend it. The dinner all you can eat is only $26.95 and it comes with sides a plenty. Will come back here over and over again."}
{"text":"Great AYCE place that my sister took me to. She insisted on going to this place when we were in vegas for a couple days and I have to say it was well worth it. The restaurant isn't that big, but it just shows that great things come in small packages! :)

They have a great selection of sushi and specialty rolls for you to choose from.  The staff is friendly and seated us right away. I normally don't opt to sit at the bar but the decision turned out to be great. We were able to order directly from the chef. The fish was fresh and rolls had a little bit more rice than I'd like but the flavors of the rolls made up for it. I ordered the Pixie roll. It's a play on the spider roll and was so delicious. If I still had room after all the different rolls I tried, I probably would have ordered myself another Pixie roll. 

They offered a wide range of appetizers as well as desserts (not many places includes dessert in the AYCE menu). For you seaweed lovers, they have seaweed salad on the menu, we each ordered a bowl. They also offered baked mussels, miso  soup, calamri, and much much more! I ended my meal with a generous scoop of green tea ice cream, and my sister had a strawberry mochi ice cream. I will definitely be going back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I was thinking to myself , \"No wonder this place has long lines sometimes ..it's tiny! The size made me uneasy but by the end of the meal I thought it contributed to it's charm. We sat so close to everyone that we shared conversations with the other tables about our Sushi and everyone was offering their Sushi to one another to try. I thought it was a fun and a unique experience in that way. I liked that the all you can eat sushi included desserts and appetizers for 60min. The menu is hard to navigate for a Sushi Simpleton like me . I don't order any sushi that has raw fish in it ..I mainly stick to the rolls with the fake crab . One side had the descriptions on it but the other side of the menu ...you are on your own! We had the Royal California Roll which was deep fried. I tried something similar before and I wasn't to crazy about it so we started with a half order. I love that you can do that because I hate when you're forced to eat the whole order just so there will not be an extra charge! I loved the Royal California it had a nice crunch to it. I also tried the J.J. Roll which had Asparagus and cream cheese in it ..that was also good. I ordered one of my regulars The Mexican..nice and spicy. We tried the Snow Crab roll (limit 2 per customer) ...thank goodness there was a limit! It was hard for me to eat it because it just didn't taste good. I was let down that they had Chicken Terayaki but no beef I know this is a sushi place and not a steak house but it would have been nice. The chicken was tasty and tender and the sauce wasn't too sweet. I ended my meal with green tea ice cream ..I was so stuffed I could only eat half of it.. I'm glad I found this AYCE Sushi place that is opened till 2am on my side of town ...it's comforting to know a place I can go when the craving strikes!"}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time when my sis lived here. I think it was way beforeYelp days. We came into town & my sis happened to remind me of Sushi Mon so we came back after maybe 10 years to see if it was still good ... And it was! We did the all-you-can-eat dinner. I ate a ton of hamachi nigiri without worrying about the bill being racked up. The salmon was a little tough though. the new thing was a time limit and signs saying you'll be charged if you don't eat everything but I think that was mainly for people who just eat the sashimi & leave piles of uneaten rice. I understand they don't want waste now to lose money so it didn't bother me too much. Service was great - not too often and not pushy on drinks or upsales. Good food & service for the right sushi price. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"My father and I cane here for dinner. The restaurant is clean. The chefs and waiters are friendly. The fish is clean. They serve accordingly. Major key (the fish taste very clean). The ambiance is happy and fun. I finished with a delicious green tea mochi."}
{"text":"Great first time experience! The rolls are so very good, and great Sushimi too. Lunch time prices last until 4:00 making this one of the best deals on this side of town for AYCES! And their regular menu has great deals too. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The only sushi I go to here in vegas, yes I'm sure there are plenty of other good spots, but my girlfriend and I just have such a hard time finding good restaurants here that we don't even want to risk going somewhere else, this place is just fine. Price is average for any ayce sushi. And get a stamp card, every ten stamps you get 1 ayce!"}
{"text":"Been to both Sushimon locations and they've left me with memories of sushi bliss. It'll cost about $20-ish and you have two hours to gorge. I've been here a few times with friends and we stuffed our faces like fat fucking Americans should. The amount of variety is off the chart and the quality of sushi is much MUCH better than your average buffet. TBH it's not even fair to compare the two. 

But you have to get the All You Can Eat. BEST DEAL HERE."}
{"text":"After a long night of work at a restaurant you're usually starving from looking at food all night! Sushimon took care of all of mine and my coworkers grumbling bellies. There were 12 of us and we went crazy ordering SO many rolls and appetizers and desserts. Being able to order everything AYCE was awesome!  Their menu is huge and the soft crab roll had to be a favorite of tge table. The cajun tuna was my personal favorite. The service was surprisingly good, the food came at a steady rate. Its nice that they were open late enough to accomodate us. I will be returning and will pay more attention to what I eat lol."}
{"text":"Second time here, there won't be a third.  The service was ok, the staff was kind of rude, if you are missing one person in your party they won't seat you.  Once seated they bring you drinks pretty fast but getting refills can be a challenge.

If you have empty plates on the table don't expect them to say excuse me before putting their arm in front of your face over the food you are eating and grabbing the plates.  You basically have to stop eating and move your head back so you don't get hit in the face.

My son in law said the menu was not the same as it used to be and as I experienced, if you want to order a meal plate, if you don't like teriyaki, then you have to order single items and pay more because they will not substitute the teriyaki for chicken or beef prepared another way which means you have to do side orders of soup, salad, chicken or beef, tempura, rice, California Roll, so what is a $9.95 dish with teriyaki comes out to over $20 if you can't eat teriyaki. They don't care...

The sushi rolls were good tasting but not wrapped very tight so you ended up with a mess in your dish when trying to pick up the pieces.  This place seems to have become a mill basically getting you in and out as quickly as possible, so once they decide to drop the bill on your table, don't expect anymore refills without asking even if you are not done eating yet.  They decide when it's time for you to leave without the offer of desert.  We were a party of four that will not be back to this place."}
{"text":"I don't get the 4* for this location - the other one near the Strip is very good, and we came here expecting the same. However, I had trouble believing they were even part of the same chain based on my experience.

The sushi chefs here are not Japanese (unlike the other location) and so while the quality of the fish were mediocre depending on the type, the cuts were very poor. Some were very sinewy and unchewable, others you can tell were scraps. Even the eel nigiri had lots of bones and it even hurt as I swallowed it down my throat!

The fish to rice ratio here was also noticeably lower than the other location. I don't get why they charge $2 more for AYCE but yet have a lot less on the menu? A handful of nigiri and roll choices were missing, and no mochi ice cream or tempura ice cream here. 

2 stars for quick service (less crowded here), and a couple of the nigiri were quite good. Otherwise, our party of 3 all agreed - don't bother coming here. There are plenty of other delicious AYCE sushi places in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great environment, fresh fish, lots of choices.

Oh, and that pesky 45 minute time limit? Don't worry about it, our waiter told us as long as we're in and out within 2 hours that it won't be an issue. 

We filled our bellies up with nigiri and half orders of rolls and still had room left over for 2 orders of tempura ice cream, 4 orders of green tea ice cream, and several mochi ice cream =D Not bad for 2 girls and a kid! All in all, we saved about half off the menu price by going AYCE - score!

P.S. Avoid the other Sushi Mon NW of Vegas, it's not the same in quality or taste."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of sashimi and specialties creations as part of the all you can eat menu.
Well thought out all you can eat menu with the consumers value in mind. 
They offer what most places in town try and either upscale or don't even offer. 
Very fast to the table even when it's busy"}
{"text":"The prospect of indulging in all-you-can-eat sushi is similar to weighing having sex with a person who's obviously taking it around to everyone like it was a church donation jar: you're probably going to enjoy yourself, but it's surely not going to be the best experience of its kind, you're not going to feel good about yourself afterwards, and you may hours later fear you've contracted something awful. In this context, Mon Sushi is still a whore, but one with a killer body, great technique and a vigilant prophylactic policy. I have no regrets besides the two pounds of rice-filler weight gain - score one for the whores?"}
{"text":"Gee...what a place to wasted money and time!!
We drove from LA and got there around 1:00pm and parked in front of the restaurant meant lucky? Hell no!!! We heard it's better to pay for all-you-can-eat lunch($21.95), which was really a bad start. We had about 10 sushi rolls there, then they(chefs waiters) pretend didn't see us at all. Foods showed up really slow and rice tasted kinda bad enough(hard and not stick together). Anyway, just save your hard earned money(gasoline $$ & $21.95 lunch or $26.95 dinner after 4pm), because there are tons of Japanese restaurant for just sushi rolls or sashimi in LA. Btw, they don't even desired tips($10) or a star from us. So I  highly don't recommended this place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of all you can eat Asian food, because I know the quality isn't there.  I'd much prefer quality over quantity when talking about food.  I must say though sushi mon is legit.  They make all the sushi fresh to order.  You just tell the waitress or sushi chef what you want and they make it right there.  The variety of different sashimi / sushi rolls / appetizers makes this place well worth the $26.95 for dinner.  

There are some sashimi's that you can only order just one per person because of how expensive it is, but at least you get to try it still.  

The people working there were really nice.  It wasn't too busy, but I herd when it gets busy that the food takes awhile to come out.  You have to make sure that you eat all your food along with the rice or else you'll get charged extra.  

I'll definitely come back to this place when I come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few sushi joints that I love and trust. ACE for 2 was $54. We also had 2 Sodas & a bottle Sake making our total $75 and some change. 

Great selection of sake. Servers are very nice to look at! :-)  They were also  knowledgable of the sushi and sake menu. Our waiter made a suggestion on a sweet sake and on The Chubby roll. Both great suggestions. 

I love Sushi Mon because of the fresh taste that their fish has. I eat everything from eel to octopus to tuna to just their appetizers. Everything is so delicious and fresh that it will leave you wanting more. Get ACE if you want to try everything. It's all yummy.

Next time I'll do a play by play on my meal here because I love it so much."}
{"text":"I've tried and tried to like this place but the best I can do is sort of say it is just ok. When sushi is served with warm rice making the fish wqrm, it's just plain unappealing. Waitstaff is ok, not great, not bad. It's all sort of average."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends a few nights ago. The food was amazing, great customer service! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"For an all you can eat, this place was unexpectedly good!! They give you a one-time order of amaebi (sweet shrimp). and the other sushi is really really good!! when I went, they had some special tuna and we ordered that like 6 times cuz it was so good
Anyways, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We do not usually go to other sushi places. But mine was closed and man I sure am glad it was. This might just be my new favorite place. The service was amazing. At one point we had three chiefs helping us. The quality of every thing was excellent. At one point I said how about you make me what ever you like every thing he made was awesome. This is now going to be my new spot."}
{"text":"This was my favorite AYCE sushi spot at one time. That was before the new owner started changing everything in here. The changes that really hurt this place is the staff and the menu.

There have been more changes since I was last there. Now there is a new sushi counter. I liked the previous counter better than the new one. The motor for the refrigeration unit seems to give off a lot of heat towards the end of the counter. Not to mention the counter was filthy where I sat down. Not only was the counter top filthy, but there was a bug in my daughters volcano roll. I handed the dish back to the guy behind the sushi bar and he set the plate down on the counter where they were preparing sushi.

I would also like to know why there are no Asian people working there anymore? This is an Asian restaurant, is it not? The other owner had Japanese sushi chefs. Now the new owner just hires anyone to roll up fish and rice. I'm not saying you have to be Japanese to make sushi, but come on man. Where is the authentic vibe that used to be here? It's just like a fast food place now. All they need is a drive through window.

Well, I can say after seven years of frequenting this establishment, I won't be back. I'm not feeling the new Sushi Mon. It use to be my favorite place. What a shame."}
{"text":"This place got me so mad.  They tell u 15m for a take out order & iv been here over a hour.  & they have mess up my food ones already.   The food is ok but the staff has no idea what there doing."}
{"text":"This was my very first sushi bar that I went to, and it was such a good experience!

This place is very clean and the people are so nice! However it does get quite packed so I would suggest getting there early.

but overall this is a very good AYCE sushi joint to go to, at least for beginners that have not had the chance to really get into sushi."}
{"text":"Yummy, since it was the closet around. The baked rolls were great, I believe it was the baked 428 roll, and the lasagna roll. I was curious to what they would taste like and they did not disappoint.

The volcano roll and stace roll were just as good. I subtracted a star for the prices. If I were to drive a little more I would off ate at Sapporo Sushi. 

The service was great, food was great."}
{"text":"This place is great for all you can eat sushi for $26.95 (dinner).  Ordering the half order was a GREAT tip since we filled up fast.  The rolls that could not be split in half, which contain 5 very large pieces, I wish we had ordered only one of.

The shrimp tempura was nice.  I can't remember the names of all the rolls we tried, but especially nice were the baked ones.

When it came to the dessert, we were slightly disappointed, not with the plum ice cream, but because we thought there would be mochi and fried tempura ice cream.  Possibly that's the other location??"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Horrible presentation, couldnt even pick up sushi without it falling apart. Boba was disgusting. Never coming back here. Orion roll was good though"}
{"text":"It took me a while thinking about write this review.
I'm crazy with sushi-mon. My husband always call me a sushi monster !!

I usually go to sushi mon around 2-3 times a month for at least 2 years. When I heard they changed the owner I wasn't care but somehow the feeling of enjoyment has changed too!
The food is 4 stars for me.

The new upgraded design was nice but the service is getting worst every time I go there. 

I've always enjoying the service and conversation with couple Thai ladies and Yuki ( I think that was her name ) They are seem very polite, give us attentions and make the place feel welcome, But lately I haven't seen them much ( maybe my schedule have changed ) I went there on Thursday night (3/13/14) it was 3 groups of people only and I still received a shitty service from them!
 
The waitress were so MEAN!! For some reason which is I do not understand at all. We are a customer who going to give you tips and pay for what we eat!  We are not begging you for a free food!!! There were No smile No Hello No goodbye  No thank you!!! Just a simple unhappy face like this :( 
When I ordered she do not give me and signal that she got it just walk away. When she brought the food she just drop it next to me not even in front of me then walk away. 
We have to waved to get their attention. It was horrible. 

We are hoping that the service somehow get better. Maybe I'll go back maybe I won't."}
{"text":"Good sushi, tasted fresh both times I went
decent prices, (one price for lunch AYCE, one price for dinner) good service, and easy parking (in a shopping plaza) 
off the strip, but worth the drive. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this location about twice every 2 weeks. We have been coming here since my daughter was born ( 4 years ago ) . The waitresses and staff are always so sweet to us and my daughter. We love this place because of the service and the food!

Yesterday we came to eat here and they were closed, no sign on the door nothing. We waited outside thinking maybe they were opening a little late? No big deal. A short blonde girl walks out from the back and tells us that they are closed for the day. I asked her why and she said because her staff is protesting and did not show up for work? I asked what they were protesting and she said the \" national immigrant protest \" . I then asked her well are they all legal immigrants? And she said yes so then I asked what are they protesting for then ? Her response was \" to support one another \"

Fair enough, so I then told her , you might want to put a sign on your door so other people know! ( me and 3 other people had been waiting outside 15+ minutes . ) her response was : yes we are working on that so how about you give me some time and I'll put a sign on the door for you. ( something in that context)

I told her listen, I come here ALOT , you don't have to be rude I was just suggesting to put a sign up.. , I then looked at my cousin and said let's go to island sushi. and she proceeded to then get into a pitty argument with me about how I was being rude, and how I can try to go anywhere else but all of the other sushi places are closed as well ? I called 3 within a 5 mile radius, all open. We ended up at island sushi.

Your staff doesn't show up for work, I get it you might be stressed. But treating a loyal customer that way is just unacceptable. I know that the waitresses and sushi chefs are awesome and always treat us so good, but because she went off on me for suggesting to put a sign on the door so other people don't stand around waiting, I will never ever return. No professionalism from that girl what so ever. I drive all the way from mountains edge to eat here not only because the food is good , but because they make us feel like regulars. I will never ever eat here again, my family will never eat here again and I will make sure all my friends on social media know the way my family was treated because you chose to close for the day, and take your frustration out on me. Your customers are the foundation of your business, and when they are spending hundreds a month at your location, and you treat them like that, you will go out of business fast."}
{"text":"One hour for all-you-can-eat sushi? Game on.

There's always a wait here, and for good reason. At less than $30 for all the sushi you can possibly want, it's certainly a fantastic deal, as long as you order right. We went for literally all nigiris. The uni and amaebi is one order per person max, but everything else you can place multiple orders of. My favorites were the yellowtail belly, the mackerel, and the super white tuna. There are also lots of appetizers (seaweed salad, miso soup, etc.), and desserts as well (mochi ice cream anyone?).

This place is a must-visit for me whenever I'm in town, if only for the sheer knowledge that I am having awesome sushi in the middle of a desert. Oh Vegas."}
{"text":"Definitely come to see Alfredo! He comes up with creative and mind blowing sushi items not even featured on the menu! He is very friendly and definitely makes the experience. I love that this place is open until 2am."}
{"text":"They don't take reservation. Always first come first serve and there is always a wait. If you have something planned after , be there early !! For a party of 3 and more the wait time is normally 30min. 

The food is yummy and fast. Personally I don't really like special rolls, I think Nigiri is the real sushi but the spider rolls here are really good! 

When it comes to service, some servers are really good at what they doing, friendly and welcoming, however some servers are not. Some of my bestfriends mentioned that they were treated very rude last time they were there. Some of the fish didn't taste fresh but the server basically said eat it or else he would charge them extra."}
{"text":"Worst experience today! We always come here (almost every week to be exact). Often we get the nice lady servers or the Japanese servers who were always so nice and funny! Unfortunately today we had this server who's fairly new compared to the others named Zac---- I don't want to spell his name out. But, the last time as well around November or so, I remember he only got 40% of our orders right which had led us to stop coming here. But then we gave this place a chance and came back from January until today. We were celebrating a birthday and my aunt, who doesn't know how to use the chopsticks very well, dropped two small pieces of rice on the bare table as she was grabbing sushi from the middle of the table. So tiny that literally if I can count the grains approximately 10 grains. So this server named Zac---- came in sarcastically implying that he was gonna charge us for those, pointing at those small pieces and rolling his eyes at the same time. My aunt felt so bad that she said she was just gonna eat it but he said oh sure don't worry about it. So what was he really implying? Never coming here again and just so you have an idea how many times we go here, we've used 5 of the stamp cards already! Note: if you're coming here and you want great service, avoid the one person with the Zac---- first letters! All the other ladies are so nice! But just avoid this one server! Ugh definitely ruined our dinner. What a guy!"}
{"text":"Last night, my boyfriend & I decided to take my sister & her girlfriend out on a DOUBLE DATE here! We did AYCE (60min timer for dinner!)

The sushi rolls we ordered were:

Alaskan - simple, yet tasty.
007 - we all liked this one a lot! Fresh, clean taste!
Orion - Fantastic!
911 - NO JOKE! So spicy. 
Stacey
Lemon - interesting taste.
J.J
Mahalo - Spam-tastic!
Tiger - my favorite! Fans of shrimp tempura!
Cynthia 
Royal California - if you like CA rolls, this is a must try.
Spider - we ordered plenty of this! Delish.

The side dishes we ordered were:

Edamame - YES!
Steamed AND Fried Gyoza - Eh.
Steamed Shumai - Eh.
Fried Calamari - So good! We killed three orders.
Vegetable Tempura - I wish they had broccoli tempura... 
Shrimp Tempura - A MUST HAVE!
Octupus Poki - First time trying this... not too fond of it.
Seaweed Salad - A MUST HAVE! So good.

For dessert, we had:

Green tea mochi - I didn't like the texture of the gooey shell around the ice cream. 
Green tea creme brûlée
chocolate mousse

The service was awesome! The Filipino server was very attentive and friendly. 

Our bill came out to be 127$ for 4 AYCEs (@27/person) and a small and large Sapporo."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years and it's been consistently great for all 10 years.  I've eaten here probably over 50 times and it's always good. I've tried other AYCE places and they never compare to Sushi Mon. Great selection of fish and the absolute best part is they will make any roll they offer into a hand roll and they'll customize it for you.  I've been to other restaurants that look at you like you're crazy for even asking.  They never pressure you about the 1 hour time limit,  and the service is very good considering how busy they are.  My suggestion is don't bring small children that don't enjoy any form of Japanese food, the place is super busy to have to manage a baby and frustrating for fellow diners. (rant over) can't recommend this place enough and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"bombdotcom lol
For real, pretty damn good AYCE sushi. tried a bunch of different rolls, all of which had amazing flavor. We went pretty late, so we were some of the only people there and service was fast. 
The \"rules\" posted on the little menus were kind of ridiculous, though. and the sewage smell was disgusting. 
That smell wasn't around the last time I was here, though, so I wonder if the plaza is having plumbing issues? Either way, fix that, cause it's overpowering and smells like straight SH*T."}
{"text":"this is the only all you can eat sushi place ill eat. anywhere. been going here for over a decade. it includes everything and desserts."}
{"text":"Best lunch special

The Lunch specials are great.. U get a big meal for your money.. I would recommend#1"}
{"text":"Very trendy.  They cater to a younger crowd.  The service and the atmosphere is young and now!   I got the impression that middle aged singles are not welcome.
The food is good. I had the tempura it was delicious."}
{"text":"this all you can eat sushi place was whatever...not a place i would go back to. the rolls were weird tasting and one of the waitresses looked like she was giving us attitude because we were slowly trying to finish the not so great tasting rolls they prepared for us. i think it is over priced for the quality of food we get. the only good think about the place is the all you can eat desserts of ice cream and mochi..but i wouldn't even go back for that."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here regularly. It started because I live down the street, but we became regulars because of the service. They are always so quick and kind. If there is a wait for a table, it is always quicker than they promise. The food is also amazing. It's very consistent, which can be difficult in sushi places. We love it here. Also, the server Mauri is our favorite"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place as our regular sushi restaurant is just not the same. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the Hamachi collar, (not easy to find and not easy to prepare correctly), dynamite roll, yebisu roll and albacore sushi. 

It was all yummy. The albacore was fresh and melted in my mouth.

Why not 5 stars? This service was not that great. Also, people outside, standing by the front door smoking really grossed me out. Normally, I would never go into a place where they allow smoking just outside the front door.

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good sushi dinner."}
{"text":"I used to go to this sushi place 8 years ago, and I just moved back to Vegas and decided to try it again. It is the best sushi place in all of Las Vegas... the deep fried rolls are so good:) this is my go-to sushi place. I'm glad to see that after all this time it is still delicious! Thanks for keeping it consistent! I love sushi-mon!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been regular customers since it opened, today's food was terrible.  Sweet shrimp was bad, uni was brown, scallops was sour to the point of burning my tongue, and rice was big.  Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and everyone working there were so sweet and attentive! 
I got the hurricane, ecstasy, Domingo, miso and a seaweed salad all yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon (Goeymon, Monta Ramen, etc.) and the other restaurants owned by this company used to be our favorite place to go. We've been here almost hundred times in the past few years. The food is definitely fantastic and the price is right. HOWEVER, my boyfriend got insane flu after we ate at Sushi Mon on W. Sahara on 12/26/16. One of the sushi chefs named Mike was sick and he kept wiping his runny nose while making sushi for us. He didn't wear any gloves either. Needles to say, my BF got sick with very bad cold/flu shortly after and couldn't get over it for 3 weeks. I didn't catch it because I already had had the same virus back in the fall. Now we don't know where to go for quality sushi but we definitely won't be eating at any of - Mon chain restaurants ever again. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Hit and Miss.  They have bento boxes, but the chicken is consistently dry."}
{"text":"Well I have no idea why this business has a good rating, the sushi was some of the worst I had in vegas.... The rice was falling apart in the soy sauce that I was dipping it into like i've never seen before.  My girlfriend got a tamago sashimi and she said it wasn't that good at all.  The sushi was prepared pretty quickly and the waiters were alright, although He forgot to refill my drink the whole time and we had to wait for the check for awhile... it wasn't even that busy also.   All these 5 stars are baffling to me, this place isn't even close to that.  

OH and also I got an appetizer and I didn't get it into I was done with 2 rolls of sushi.... so I wont be going here again, i'll stick to my regular places."}
{"text":"Went here assuming it was under the same ownership of sushimon on silverado ranch, which is a great place to grab some AYCE. This place was a complete disappointment. 

The service was bad. The sushi was below mediocre. I wasn't even sure if the rice was sushi rice; it fell all over the place. The rolls were either bland or tasted like its main ingredients were nacho cheese or mayonnaise. I ordered some oysters and they were luke warm and had a horribly fishy taste to them. I've never turned oysters down before in my whole life other than this time. We were also limited to one order of white tuna each. Lastly, we ordered green tea ice cream thinking they couldn't mess that up. Tasted exactly like pistachio ice cream lol.

Go to the Sushimon on Silverado Ranch. Completely different place, and MILES BETTER."}
{"text":"Revisit time. 

Quality at this place has dropped recently the last 2 visits. I'll do another revisit in a couple of weeks to make sure its not a fluke.

@ Uni - It doesn't have the same sweet creamy texture as previous visits. One of the Uni was not scooped out properly, so can still see what looks like the vein of the sea urchin on it.

@ Toro - This was a little disappointing. The fish didn't really taste all that fresh.

Other items that also seem to have dropped in quality is the shrimp tempura, gyoza, eel, yellow tail, albacore, and red snapper. 

This place does have fast service, but a little disappointing they do enforce their 1 hr time limit now. One of the cool things about this place was you had fast service and they would let you keep ordering way past the 1 hour.

Either Sushimon has let quality control slip a little or they've cut some corners recently. This looks to be a trend since Danica L. did report Sushi Tachi, owned by Sushimon has quality slipping as well. If its quality control, its understandable. If its the latter, its unacceptable with so many AYCE sushi places around. Still Sushimon has one of the fastest service and the most variety. I'll be keeping an eye on this place."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. The prices seemed great from veiwing online. Very helpful service over the phone very busy when I picked  my order up! Basic spicy tuna roll I did order seaweed salad awesome price for a large amount but the poke was nasty no flavor no juice just chunks of fish on some rice noodles. This disappointed me as I was craving poke and got my hopes up lol. Will order rolls from them again but no poke from this place!"}
{"text":"the best sushi buffet i've ever had... and it's so cheap! 

the quality of all the fishes is real fresh.. even though they limit some of the popular/more expensive ones to just one order, like uni & toro, the chef sometimes would pretend that he 'forgot' and gives you more than two orders!

they used to have yellow tail collar included in all-you-can-eat menu though, but not anymore.... still worth it! for either lunch or dinner, gotta try it!  it's a must stop for me whenever i go to Vegas :)

go there early though.. otherwise there's a LONG wait..."}
{"text":"Horrible service .. TOOK US FIVE TIMES to get a server so we can order. Now , on a normal day.. I wouldn't care. But the fact that they were up front so busy TALKING to each other is what bothered me . Never again ! Disappointed . I'd only come when I really have no other choice at all .. disappointed since me and my boyfriend have been coming here for 4 years"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Sushi mon it was at the Henderson location- which was pretty nice. Service was fast and friendly.
The second time was here at the Sahara location and I wasn't impressed.
Fortunately the service is fast and the sushi is good. I had the moon roll which tasted great with the scallops and the eel sauce. 
Their miles roll was kind of ordinary but the salmon was fresh as well as the cucumber.
The eel sauce by itself is pretty salty as well as the freshwater eel roll. 

The service was not too bad. It was about a 20 minute wait for the sushi. 
Their AYCE was pricey for how much variety they have. 

The decor was kind of old and a little outdated. When I came with my friends it felt like the space was small (especially when trying to pay for the bill) not a nice wait. 

Overall it was an okay experience. Maybe I came at the wrong time :/ 
If you decide to come order at the bar - the service is always faster!"}
{"text":"after two visits between my two brothers, auntie's and mom. we will not be coming back to this location. i have respect for restaurants so i will not be mentioning publicly what had occurred. plenty of other ayce sushi options in the area."}
{"text":"I come here often with my mom to do the AYCE special.
The employees are all very friendly, from the servers to the chefs. We like to sit at the sushi bar, and I always suggest doing so to get the best service.

There are so many options on what you can order. There are rolls, nigiri, side dishes, and salads. Don't forget you can order the special items on the board too! I did not know that my first time. 
I don't think the quality of fish really stands out. I've had a lot of sushi and this would probably fall under average. However, it is one of the best I've had for AYCE outside of Japan. I generally prefer to have a small, high quality meal when eating sushi, but when I am really hungry and rather go for quantity, I'd come here."}
{"text":"It took me long enough to make it around to trying their AYCE, but I'm glad I did (thanks to my sister Stella). We came for lunch during the week and luckily, it wasn't very busy. I got my usual sushi victims like salmon, yellowtail, and (spicy) tuna hand rolls (VERY good, great spicy tuna, fresh fish all around, and I love well-stuffed hand rolls) and specialty rolls. The Spider Roll and Dragon Roll stood out to me, very delicious. I really enjoyed my dining experience because I'm more about the fish rather than all the other stuff in sushi rolls (if I could just order sashimi for AYCE, I would in a heartbeat) and their fish is fresh and just really wonderful. I'm happy with a big plate of fresh hand rolls and it is absolutely worth $21 (or $26 for dinner) here."}
{"text":"So good....omlawd... the buffet is so worth it. Everything is fresh and high quality.  Even their yakitori (which is usually subpar at buffets) was scrumptious. I suggest that sexy lady roll and also the salmon skin hand rolls are bomb. End with some lychee ice cream and mochi and you're set! I'll be back, behbeh"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere ! Felt very welcome when we walked in ! Staff was very nice & friendly , sushi was on point . I loved it , definitely recommend this place , I love sushi , they even serve half sushi just in case your almost to the knock out point of falling asleep . But sushi tastes exactly like my job's sushi SUPER awesome !!!"}
{"text":"Every single time I'm in Vegas this is the place to get sushi! I love their specials menu and it's great that they're the only place that has yellow tail collar! Yum! Sushi is always fresh and I love ordering their Uni. Service is great as well, although they do get busy around dinner time so make sure you go at the right time! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is great, service was good as well. Fresh fish! Just a bummer that it's always busy, so sometimes it's hard to get a seating area."}
{"text":"Okay so after trying this place some more I would say it has definitely gotten better.  I would recommend going here early in the week like Tuesday or Wednesday cause the fish seems to be fresher. This is a very affordable sushi spot and quite good. Can't really go wrong with $27 all you can eat sushi and $22 for lunch."}
{"text":"So great! From out of town and gave this spot a chance. Really glad we did. All you can eat menu was PACKED! Not just a few basic rolls.  Sanchez the chef was the man. Super fast and with great recommendations. Joseph was also really helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"everytime we go to vegas we make it a point 2 eat here.  i especially like the tuna here and they even give u 1 time orders of the high end stuff l ike - fatty tune, sweet shrimp and et cetera.  worth checking out if u're in the area... but it gets crowded so be prepared for a long line."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch when I'm in a bit of a hurry. I've tried other places around town and always come back here. The sashimi lunch is so fresh and delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Fredo is no longer here but this place is still awesome.  I came with a couple of friends this weekend and we had such a great time.  The selection was abundant and staff was real nice.  I think the owner enjoyed watching our group love the food.   You can even get toro and sweet shrimp her.  Believe me it was so good.  I'm sad cause I live so far away from here.  I'm also kicking myself cause I forgot to use my frequent buyers card.  I'll be back though"}
{"text":"Finally had an opportunity to come down and see what all the flag-waving was all about. Came in to a packed room, shot a quick GPS-ish \"hey guess where I'm at, finally\" message to Jen K, and got a one-word reply: HAMACHI. Good looking out, buddy. From the sheer amount of menu items, I knew this was gonna have to be a strictly disciplined activity. No fucking about and getting gaijin rolls and teriyaki chicken appetizers. I followed the good advice given by sensei and immediately took down two Hamachi intruders, followed by a Toro bitchslap and 911 pounding. Even if it was just 2pm, I already was getting sauced by SAPPORO (big) and sake. I then hit up some Yellowtail action (forgot the name, by ordering up a crunchroll and throw in some \"Yellowtail Action.\" I then opened it up by going for omakase, and the chef working our section gave the veteran's smile/nod, as he glanced skyward for strength  before moving into the small kitchen area behind the ESPN-mime-TV with the saintly gait of Mother Teresa at an AVN convention.

One of the best times I have ever had at a sushi place. The alcoholic beverages negated whatever food allergies I may have had, and I was able to enjoy much drunken bowling later on that evening. Again, I salute you.

Oh, and despite our being there for a lot longer than 1 hour, they only charged my AYCE the 45-minute session fee. Not bad for a beginner."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sushi in Las Vegas. All you can eat for 28.00 for dinner. Best place for a balla on a budget! Forget about the overpriced Sushi places on the strip! I wish it was bigger tho."}
{"text":"So, I really wanted to love this place, one because it's right by my house and two because of the reviews on it, but honestly I don't know what kind of sushi the people who wrote good reviews on this place are eating because that's definitely not what I got. I'm not sure if it's the fact that I ate there at midnight or what but everything I ordered was not good. The sushi had a bad aftertaste as well as the seaweed salad, which I normally love...(my mouth is offended the whole time..this was said by my boyfriend whilst eating)..my reaction was just as bad, I kind of wanted to throw up when I got home to make up for what I put in my stomach. I paid way, way too much for what we both consumed. I will say one thing good about the meal...the wine and green tea was great :)"}
{"text":"This place has changed so it deserves a new review.

First off, they eliminated fountain drinks in favor of $1.99 (or so) per CAN of soda/iced tea/etc. This move was clearly about the money cause you can get pretty thirsty with all that rice they add onto the sushi (yes, a nice amount of rice with a slightly less proportioned slice of fish). 

Then, they replaced my Sushi Mon card with a location limited Sushi Mon card without my permission (meaning if I had most of my stamps from the other Sushi Mon location, say for example, because I live closest there and I frequent that location the most, I can no longer go to that location with my stamp card I'm forced to go to the Sahara location as it says it's limited to that location only). 

I've been coming here for over 10 years (that's right), and sadly, I've watched it decline from what it once was when i would first go there. My friend and I were waiting 10 minutes till we received our 5 orders of salmon, while the table who was seated 10 minutes after we were seated got their order of 2 rolls within 10 minutes of being seated. This continued until I complained to the waiter, pointing out how full their table had gotten with food ordered from the sushi bar, in comparison to us who have only been served a small amount of items within a larger span of time. It made me pretty unhappy but after I pointed it out we magically began getting 3-4 other orders to our table within 15 mins , much like the table beside us. 

The one thing that their menu has that no other AYCE restaurant has is halibut. The quality of the fish is good, the service is lacking... still. 

It's also extremely annoying when you're at the bar and constantly having to remind the chefs what you ordered, it'd be nice if they gave you a paper to fill out cause it can be hard getting their attention. 


This was a review and a rant at my bad experience from the other week. But here's my overall summary:


5/10 Customer Service (consistently)
8/10 Quality Of Sushi (some days there have been an \"off\" taste)

They fixed the rotten egg smell, woohoo !"}
{"text":"Fast service (from sushi chefs), and great food. I was so happy with everything I ordered. Took them only 10 mins to get about 15 orders of nigiri and rolls to me! Super speedy!"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon on Silverado  by far has one of the best AYCE places in the city. The fish is always fresh, the rolls are awesome and the hot sides are just as good.  The price is decent also. They have a vast selection of sushi rolls to choose from.  The wait times are often at minimum 20 minutes but so worth the wait.   Customer service they could be better but we experienced worst."}
{"text":"I am new to Vegas but I was really craving sushi. My friend took me here since it is her favorite. I did not disappoint! We came during lunch and ordered the AYCE, bonus there was no wait! The fish was so fresh it had a sweet flavor. With other AYCE places the rolls are small/skinny, but that's not the case here. This is my new sushi spot even though it is far from where I live. It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"AYCE 27.99!! MmMm guud!!  All sushi is made to order! Fresh frsh fresh! I loved the spider roll. Hamachi of course. Flounder! Eel! Fried oysters! Shrimp Tempura. I even asked for fried shrimp heads!! MmMm!! Service is excellent very attentive. Don't forget try the fried ice cream neat!! You have to make time to come to Suhsi Mon!!"}
{"text":"i think it's a good deal for all you can eat sushi for $27.
~A  few of my favs:

~No Name Roll: Spicy tuna & asparagus wrapped with a layer of yellowtail
~Spider Roll: I ask for it with no crab (less fillers, plus it taste better )
Sushi: hamachi, surf clam, raw sweet shrimp ( comes with the shirmp head deep fried! mmmm such goodness!!),snapper. 

All topped off with Green Tea Ice Cream!! =)"}
{"text":"fresh sushi and they were very nice.  ayce for $26.95.  try their carpaccio- sort of like sashimi with mango.  each person can also get two pieces of sushi- uni, toro, and sweet shrimp with the ayce.  that in alone is worth it.  my new fav sushi spot in lv.  remember to get their stamp card, too!"}
{"text":"I do love sushi and this place is great. It's smaller so if you plan on eating sushi for dinner, I would recommend getting here earlier or you will end up waiting. This time we came for lunch so there wasn't a wait to be seated. They have all you can eat for lunch and dinner ($21.95 for lunch / $26.95 for dinner) and there is a time limit. While I did not partake in the AYCE this time, I was pretty excited to get the sashimi lunch. Mmmmm!!"}
{"text":"Here ye! Here ye! Read all about it! Sushi-Mon is for real and there AYCE should not be doubted.

Went here with my friend, who is a rookie sushi eater but food aficionado and I was telling him how I like the sushi bar than getting a table. Sushi bar for me means instant sushi! A little faster than usual. I like to eat the nigiris asap once they are made.

My buddy sorta liked the uni but he did not try the ikuras that were lined up. Oh well! More for me! Yipppeeee! Ariel, our sushi chef, was attentive and knowledgeable of the entire menu. Their other servers were nice and helpful. 

Next on our menu was the quail egg shooters. Bottoms up Delicious! Then we chased it with Sapporros and hot sake. 

Overall, I recommend: 
-Sit at the the sushi bar
-Order the quail egg shooter
-Order lots of Nigiris
-Take full advantage of the specials! 
-Arrive early to avoid the wait.

Thank you Sushi-Mon for the delicious food and Thank you Ginny for drawing us the directions to get to Sushi-Mon!"}
{"text":"Not as good as they use to be. I really use to love this place. It's ok but it's just not great anymore ."}
{"text":"If you love sushi you will love sushimon on decatour off trop. The rolls are perfect and the nigiri comes with the right amount of rice (not loaded)"}
{"text":"Our go to spot for AYCE sushi but they have so much more. Salad, tempura, udon and so much different appetizers. Dessert is also included and you image AYCE Mochi ice cream. This place is totally worth it. 

Lots of parking. Only reason why they got 4 stars was that the service was a little slower than usual. Short staffed but still great place to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week for the first time. Tried the \"All you can eat\". My favorites were the Tiger and the Sexy Girl. I also enjoyed the miso soup and mochi ice cream for dessert. The staff was friendly, quick and efficient. I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great people and great food. So I walked in here not really expecting to much but wow...this please was great and they have an all you can eat sushi which included everything on the menu and dessert items too. Needless to say I may have ate too much but it was well worth it. 

I will be come back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi in town and has a great price! It does get very busy here during dinner time so I usually go around 5pm to beat the crowds. The quality of the fish is very fresh and they have an extensive menu for AYCE. My favorite items on the menu are the Uni, sweet shrimp and yellow tail collar! Too bad they limit each person to only one per order. Some must have nigiri are the super white tuna, hamachi & ikura with a quail egg. Baked items that I love are the green mussels and lasagna roll. Don't forget green tea & lychee ice cream & strawberry mochi for dessert. The service is excellent and pretty fast here, it's what keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the quality of fish and the service is prompt. I only wish that they served Toro. This place does get busy and they will not seat you unless your whole party is there. I probably wouldn't recommend bringing children who need high chairs for dinner since it does get really cramped and they also have strict rules about sharing foods with kids anyway. Over it's good."}
{"text":"If Sushi Mon could put on some makeup and a dress, I'd fuckin take her out on a night to town.  I love this place.  When you hear of a all-you-can-eat sushi place, you generally think of not so fresh, huge fistful of rice to fish ratio sushi.  At Sushi Mon, you get good quality sushi in unlimited quantity.  Unlike other buffet places, where the sushi is already made and set out for you, Sushi Mon makes everything as you order...the gluttonous hour begins.

Far off the Strip on the west side, Sushi Mon is always packed with a young energetic crowd.  The all you can eat menu extends not only to sushi,but literally everything on the menu from rolls, apps, teriyaki, tempura, salads,... the fried yellow tail head with ponzu and the seaweed salad are good starters.  You can only get 1 order of Uni per customer but I don't like that nasty orange puke anyways, so it doesn't  affect me at all.  Try the '911' roll if you dare, its got a huge spicy kick to it that'll wake up all your senses!~  No matter how full I get, I always end my meals with green tea ice cream, fried banana and strawberry mochi.  Be sure to get started on a punch card so you can get the 11th meal free!

I recommend you sit at the sushi bar so you can tell your order to the sushi chef.  There is usually a line out the door and no bar to wait.  There is a hookah lounge on the other side of the strip mall, but otherwise, but I like to take the time waiting, salivating through the window and mentally preparing myself for the hour of sushi chaos."}
{"text":"Wow this place is excellent best AYCE sushi I've had in the year I've been in Vegas. Sat at the sushi bar and let the chef choose. All was phenomenal will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I have this thing about all you can eat sushi. Usually it's a buffet. But really I LIKE THIS PLACE. I've only gotten take out from my employees going there and I get a bento or something....But I just thought it was ok. Average Japanese sushi. When I ate there. different story. So sushi is like a big deal now. Kind of a trendy thing. 
F*ck YOU all the kids in school that made fun of me for eating raw fish!!!!
Sorry I had to get that out. They don't only make the sushi in front of you and fresh. They put love in it. The all you can eat menu not only holds sushi. But teriyaki, sesame chicken, tempura, curry, SAKE,  sunomono - and all kinds of different kinds of rolls! So if you go - add up all the sushi and food you're gonna eat and make sure it hits 25 dollars. Don't waste food. Cuz that sucks. Get a stamp card!"}
{"text":"I've been to almost every sushi spot in Vegas and this isn't at the top of my list. The sushi is good, nothing different than what you get anywhere else. I always get Sashimi so it's fairly standard anywhere. This review is mostly about the service. We didn't care for our server. There are usually two people who wait on you; one who takes your food order and one who does drinks and brings your stuff. The young guy we had was very nice and acknowledged us. The much older short lady was rude. Got forbid she takes your order, she rolls her eyes at you as if you are bothering that you're spending money. 

I doubt we will return. This place is the sister sushi place of Goyemon and that place has MEH service, too."}
{"text":"Based on the rave reviews, I decided to stop by for the \"all-you-can-eat\" dinner during this trip.  The quality of the fish is mediocre and nowhere near fresh. Yes, I know it's in the middle of a desert, but I expect some freshness when I'm eating raw. The yellow tail roll looked like clumps of fish paste. the sweet shrimp tasted like it had been sitting out on the docks for days before transport to Vegas. It was a hard dinner to digest. As far as the \"all-you-can-eat\" deal, I asked for 3 orders of sweet shrimp but was limited to only 2.  I consider this a false advertisement as it's not  \"all-you-can-eat\", but rather \"what we are willing to serve you\".

I used to live here and there are other far better local  joints that serve decent fresh fish. Anyone who rated this place more than 1 star must be on crack or smokin' something  really good. Either way, I'd rather be doing that than gambling on my food."}
{"text":"Found this place on multiple friend's recommendation list and it does not disappoint.  AYCE sushi made to order is delicious!  The variety is awesome and you can eat anything you want from sushi to appetizers to dessert.  

For dinner at least, there are two dishes that are limited I believe to two servings per person.  The uni (which I think is sea urchin) and the sweet shrimp, neither of which I've tried, but I've heard they are good.  

They do not offer plain sashimi, and they require you to eat all the rice on your sushi else they will charge a le carte.  Not unreasonable as their sushi does taste fresh and good quality for an AYCE.  No real recommendation on which sushi to eat.  Try them all for yourself!"}
{"text":"Both Sushi Mon locations are good. This location has a little less seating and less busy than the other one. I prefer the other location to be honest.

$21.95 for their all you can eat sushi menu, a ton of options. Really a great steal.

Their sushi is always fresh and tastes great. 
Service is fast, food comes out as they are made and not all at once. 
Waitresses were pretty friendly.

Fresh sushi, great variety. 
Some of my favorites: salmon, salmon belly, yellowtail belly, ikura with quail egg, baked green mussels."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. 
I get so frustrated reading other reviews that say \"mediocre sushi and service.\" Come to New York City and you'll see mediocre sushi and service at Trump prices. 

This is a STEAL. $21.95 (lunch) $26.95 (dinner) for all you can eat menu that's so extensive? Yes please!

Now this place has a little more seating available compared to the other location but also gets twice as busy. 
Their service here is amazing. The waiters and busboys were all very nice and attentive. Our waiter (Archer, who's adorably cute) was very friendly, attentive, and fast. 

All the sushi tasted fresh. Salmon and salmon belly were deeeeeeelicious. 
Ikura with quail egg -- yummm!

I am ADDICTED to their baked green mussels. I could really have about 10 orders to myself and miss the taste about 5 minutes after I leave. 

I will be here any time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"The great sushi (and the great deal of $21 for all you can eat!) have made this place a lunch habit of mine. I really like that they offer half rolls as an option for the all you can eat, that way you try/enjoy a variety of rolls - they do have a lot to choose from. 

It's pretty small and does tend to fill up; that being said, I've never waited for a table. One more thing about the atmosphere, the music in the main restaurant is always top 40 blah. In the restrooms they play some throw backs. The last time I was there I heard The Humpty Dance, I think they need to switch up the stations and get that playing where the tables are."}
{"text":"Been a great place! 

Never gotten sick and they're open till 2am. 

Best advice put in a huge order or you could Wait a while to get things made up.  

Good job after many visits sushi mon folk"}
{"text":"AYCE for $30?! Yee-doggy! Toro-baby!! So yummy...waitresses were super helpful in telling us what to try. All fresh fish. Love that you can order just one piece so you don't waste. They are open super late - till 2 I think....and they have free beer & sake on some days. Also, they have good water (which is hard to find in LV)."}
{"text":"No breathing allowed! Do not pace yourself, just grind!!!
Sushi Mon in Las Vegas is a must-go stop every time I'm there. But make sure you are hungry so you can make it worth your $$$. I usually make it for the dinner AYCE $26.95 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=9_pI9y20Kn09CRshWLU6hg) and it is truly worth every cent. The food is awesome and there are a wide range of choices. Also, take a look at the specials (some are 1 p/p). Some of my usual nigiri favs are: fresh salmon, seared ahi, yum yum scallop, snow crab meat, salmon belly (special)(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=4gmQ0WpBwpKHKyaLykWCYA), negitoro (special), striped jack (special), hamachi, & cajun salmon (special). I love that the fish is wrapped all the way around the little bit of rice. Hot items I like are: dynamite, shrimp tempura, hamachi kama (special) & the mussels. For dessert, get as much in your tummy as possible, it's all good! From tempura ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=aqikDFl8ktJdqzKo1gPWaw) to mochi cream, you cannot go wrong.  Try and get whatever you can finish, but don't forget you must follow the rules (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=S1dW_5Y-w3NYn-efOyaQEg).
The service we had at both Sushi Mon locations was awesome, but I must give props to the Maryland Pkway location because they took our # and called us when our table was ready so we could shop around the area for a little bit. We sat at the sushi bar & Chef Mike was very attentive and helpful. There's a ton of parking and the one-person-bathroom is very clean. 
All in all, Sushi Mon is affordable, fun, delicious, and a winner. Banzai!"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is the closest AYCE sushi place by me, so I decided to give it a go. 

The food is pretty good in terms of AYCE sushi quality. The interior is small, and the service was quick with the water refills. I'll probably try this place again if I am ever craving sushi!"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood sushi! Love all the sushi i order and we've pretty much tried everything.  Nothing ever new on their menu.  Its all good though.  They also have the best baked mussels in town.  My niece loves their yellow tail...says its the freshest in town.  
Another draw back is the wait time.  You will always wait a minimum 35 minutes...every time."}
{"text":"This restaurant have been so far the worst restaurant I've EVER dined. The manager is extremely rude and got furious over their own mistakes and blown his anger on us. From our previous experience we called in to make sure they had conch tonight since it was the speciality dish. Since they guaranteed that they had plenty of conch we decided to head over. After waiting for an hour they seated us and took our order. As patiently waited for my order the server came back and said we only have one piece (we had 5 people) I was stocked we drove 20 mins from the strip to the restaurant and the tell us they don't have that anymore. After that the manager came and didn't even apologize and said if you are not happy you can pay and leave. I cannot believe this restaurant got such high review for such terrifying service. This restaurant do not put customers first and all they cared about was money the seafood is no longer fresh compared to the past. This will be the last time we go."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place in town. Most sushi places have decently-priced AYCE. Most have a huge selection of specialty rolls. This one has all that plus a cadre of fine, friendly chefs and wait staff that know us and have my wife's entire order memorized from appetizers to dessert. (But that also might speak to how memorable my wife is.)

We love it. If you're looking for a new sushi place, try it. If you already have your own local place that knows your name, then it's really just a lateral move."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here this past weekend (Sunday afternoon) during our Vegas trip. We usually try to make a stop here every time we're in town but this time the service was extremely sub par.

We were first seated by \"A\" who is one of the most INCOMPETENT servers/and hostesses that I have ever met or seen in my life. Just horrible mannerisms and cannot deal with anything on her own.

Anyway, she doesn't understand the concept of customer service. Why do I say that? Well we came in and she just pushed us aside even though she had a table open.

After we waited for a while, she introduced herself. We ordered. But time was ticking and we didn't get what we wanted. AT ALL.

She was just a horrible server all around who didn't own up to her incapabilities.

Our lunch lasted longer than usual because of her.

Besides\"A\"-the horrible server, we were also told we couldn't get anything unless we paid for dinner price. (it was lunch time though...) But apparently they changed the rules and now you can't order your 1order of Uni unless you pay for dinner price even during lunch hours. And also you can't order Mango Mochi unless you pay for dinner price, although you can order Strawberry Mochi (Totally don't understand that rationale, but whatever)..

OVERALL : Food was so-so, but service & rule-changes this time was BAD."}
{"text":"Buyer beware! We have come here for the past 5 years and yesterday my husband came home with terrible food poisoning! We have always loved this place and would brag about it to everyone we knew. This will be our last time ever coming to this place! I hope the Health Department keeps an eye on this place moving forward"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi places but this one has always been my favorite. Fast service and nice too. It's small but worth the wait for seating. 100% recommend"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't know why people rave about this place. I feel like they haven't been to an actual ayce sushi place before. This place isn't that great. Most my rolls fell apart. They don't have a lot of classic rolls that do many places have. Poke was literally 3 or 4 pieces of tuna with nothing else in it and little sauce. For the poke alone I would never come back here.  So many rolls fell apart too... I like that they weren't covered in layers of rice. But they still fell apart.  I ordered the yakitori but didn't touch it, it was dry, dry like a chicken gets when it's been left out too long, not from over cooking.  And the final thing was my table was completely empty before the server ever asked for another order.. still I guess I've had worse."}
{"text":"cant believe i havent written a review for this place yet! been here a few times before, a few AYCE and a few a la carte. all experiences were great!!! service is great! normally we go with really big groups (12+ people) and everything turns out just fine.

last night, my boyfriend and i went after i got off work. we got there probably aorund 11:30 or so. last call is @ 1:30 so we had plenty of time to do AYCE.

we get there, and sit at a table. the bar was actually packed. we order a few things, and food comes out fairly quickly. service was great as usual, and food was great. but...there was one thing that completely ruined our dining experience. not just me and my boyfriend, but everyone in the restaurant!

there was a party of 5 at the bar, and they were being completely inappropriate and loud as hell!!! everyone in the restaurant felt super uncomfortable and felt their behavior was inappropriate. every time they made some sort of outburst, everyone looked at each other in awe. theyre grown adults, who were drunk (they came in fairly intoxicated and had 2 more small sakes, so the sushi chef said after they left), and rude. 

after maybe 15 minutes or so, the manager asked one of the guys to ask the ladies to keep it down, and after the manager walked away, one of the ladies said \"keep it down? what for? we're paying customers!!! not gonna happen!!! our bill is probably gonna be $150!!!! some people just dont know how to have fun!\" and of course, insert a few curse words here and there. needless to say, they did not keep it down. i felt really bad though, it seemed to be 2 couples and one of the girl's dads, who looked really embarrassed to be eating with them.

when they left, they paid the bill. i guess the dad picked up the tab and threw in a $50 tip on top of whatever else the other 4 left on the bar. and of course - one of them screams \"you should thank him!!! he just tipped you $50!!! sorry for being loud and sorry you guys dont know how to have fun!\" and they left. 

please dont take any of the above story as a negative post about the establishment. i guess i just needed to vent about this experience. management handled it as well as he could have, and it definitely didnt take away from the great food and service."}
{"text":"Waited a million years to be seated. Food comes out slow thanks to slow service and wanting to save money on all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"I'm very torn about this place. The sushi is great in my opinion. I'm not sushi connoisseur but I like what I like and they do a pretty good job. It's clean and their late hours are very convenient. The service is average, nothing special but the GM is THE WORST. He is rude, impatient, and will ignore you for several minutes. Yes this place can get very busy and yes sometimes the wait is 20-30 mins. but he will quote you an hour long wait just in the hopes that you will leave! He is never pleasant when he answers the phone and lacks good customer service. I continue to frequent this place because I love the Pastel roll and I love the late night hours (he's not usually there too late) but if I have another poor experience with the GM I will have to reconsider how much time and money I choose to spend there."}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE sushi I've had.

The rolls are very good quality.  Get a roll with \"yum-yum\" sauce.  It's delicious.  There are a wide variety of rolls so you're bound to find some that you like.  Most AYCE places I've been skimp on the quality and usually cover all their sushi with the same mayonnaise sauce.  Each roll we had here was different, but still flavorful.  They give you a good amount of fish with each roll.  They don't have too much rice and the toppings are generous.

You can also order half-rolls so you can get a taste of different things without stuffing yourself on one.

The best part are the specials.  The specials are included in the AYCE and are written up somewhere.  My favorite was the Salmon Carpaccio.  Their sashimi was very smooth and generous! They also had salmon collar and hamachi collar along with uni, snow crab, sweet shrimp, and several others.  

There are a couple reasons why its not five stars:
- It's pretty small (we came with a big party and had to split up)
- The servers mixed our orders up with the table next to us several times
- They ran out of green tea  and plum ice cream.
- Our seat was by the door and everytime someone opened it, we got that cold Las Vegas air

I would definitely come here again.  The food is great and authentic and better than any AYCE place I've been to yet."}
{"text":"Good, fresh fish. Sat at the bar and received decent service as the sushi chef made eye contact often to see if we needed anything else. Deducted a star for the hair found in my ginger toward the end of my meal."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place gets such high ratings. I walked out of this place disappointed and not wanting to eat sushi for awhile (and this is CRAZY because I could normally eat sushi for EVERY meal if I could). 

This first round of sushi that we ordered, was... decent, maybe 3 stars, however when we ordered more sushi the fish was visibly lower quality fish (especially the albacore nigiri). I tried it anyway, knowing sometimes I can be picky about the way things look, and I had to spit it out into my napkin. I've never tasted such disgusting fish. My hubby even had to take one of his rolls apart because the fish on top wasn't fresh. The gyoza was awful. I think the best thing we got was the green salad with soggy tomatoes. 

In addition, this place is full of rules. They have a time limit of 45 minutes for their all you can eat menu - which is stressful and annoying when you are paying so much. Then, when you don't finish your CRAPPY meal, they have the nerve to charge you for the leftovers. 

And last but not least, Sushi Mon also gets one star less for decor - they had pieces of paper all over the walls with items you can order put up with scotch tape. I'm not super picky about decor, but it does matter some to me... SO NOT MY PLACE. 

ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK."}
{"text":"Salmon Belly and Blue Fin Tuna Nigiri..... yes please!  50 pieces? Wow!"}
{"text":"Small place. Fast and good service. I enjoyed the Kamikaze roll the most. Liked the Orion, Lemon, Spicy tuna rolls. I had some cajun albacore and salmon nigiri as well as a seaweed salad. All were made well and were tasty. I hear this joint is open late. I am sure I will be back as well."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas never have any issues when I come in and everything is fairly priced they also give you a stamp card so every time you get all you can eat sushi you get a stamp and after your 10th you get a free one!"}
{"text":"Always have a good meal here at Sushi-Mon.  They have a good price for their All You Can Eat deals and also have a frequent eaters card for a free all you can eat after so many visits.  Sushi has a great taste to it and they have a good variety.  Service is always good when I go in and the sushi chefs always recognize me and my girlfiend when we go in."}
{"text":"Sushi mon, is definitely the \"MON\". 

My boyfriend and I woke up around 2. We were starving and heard this place was the place to go when your hungry. 

Okay. 21.95 for all you can eat amazing ass sushi? That is freaking cheap! I swear, we ate 200 dollars worth of food here. I could not get enough of their salmon. We had like 10 freaking orders. 

Are you kidding me! This is so cheap and they do half rolls here!! So you can try everything here without breaking your bank and stomach. 

You MUST try their pastel roll and volcano roll. 

Honestly, I've tried a lot of sushi places. The best I've had was in Hawaii and this is pretty close to it."}
{"text":"was good. and there was a very beautiful Japanese waitress.

and at that time not too many people so, we did not wait to sit.

sushi is ok. I will go again."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi in vegas hands down! My husband and I frequent sushi mon at least once a month. Service is always good. The ecstasy roll is AMAZING! gotta try it. We have never been dispointed! Get AYCE you really get your moneys worth. Tempura icecream is awesome too!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there with some friends last night and it was good.  Nothing out of this world, but good basic sushi.  I had the JJ Roll and the Mexican roll and enjoyed both of them.  I would go back again, but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"Great sushi and good service!  We went with the all you can eat and ordered almost everything on the menu.

Tip: if you go with the all you can eat, order half rolls so that you can try more things on the menu.

The servers are very attentive and fast.  We will come back for more.."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Sushi Mon for the first time, many of my co-workers raved about it. 
My husband and I decided to give it a try last night.
Our server's name was George and from the beginning he seem to have a bit of an attitude he took our order and when he came to give us our plates he sort of tossed them to us, very unprofessional in my opinion we sat there eating for about 45 minutes before he refilled my husband's drink. We were very polite to him figured he was probably having a bad day the other server kept asking if we were ok and if we needed anything, unfortunately we didn't catch his name but left him a nice tip!
The food was ok but because of the poor service we won't be returning to Sushi Mon and I'll be making sure to tell my coworkers of my bad experience there.

***VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THE SERVICE***"}
{"text":"Hubby and I did the AYCE here last night and were sadly disappointed.  Hubby had been to the other location and spoke highly of this place.  This location being only a few miles from our house, I was eager to find a dependable neighborhood sushi joint.  The waitresses were nice enough when we first arrived.  There were no tables available so they told us to get started at the bar and that we'd be able to move to a table once one became available.  We ordered a few pieces of nigiri sushi while at the bar and then a table became available.  Once seated our order came out and we got all sorts of things we hadn't even ordered.  We ate them since we got AYCE and weren't being charged per piece but I was wondering if that was the norm?  After the nigiri we ordered a couple half orders of rolls and that's when the service slowed WAAAAAY down.  We were left alone for a good 15 minutes.  This is a small restaurant and we were sitting right by the register where the waitresses were constantly gathering.  There was no excuse for how hard it was to get any one of the three waitresses' attention.  I had no idea there was a one hour time limit (I just read about it on some other review below).  I was full way before the hour limit but what if I wasn't?  They wasted 15 minutes of my one hour by ignoring us!  The quality of sushi was so-so.  It wasn't awful but it wasn't great either.  The fish didn't seem super fresh but is anything super fresh in this desert?  At the end of our meal hubby said he wouldn't be back.  I don't know what other sushi joints are near Summerlin so I can't quite say never...yet.  I chose to give this place 3 stars but really I think 2.5 would be more accurate."}
{"text":"Great place, very well priced and great quality for the price.  Always packed usually have to sit at the bar.  It's our every Wednesday night joint."}
{"text":"Service horrible.  Do not opt to sit at the bar.   Service is even worst.  It was soo difficult and uncomfortable to know when it was ok to order from the sushi chef because he is also making sushi for other tables.   There were times I felt the sushi chefs were talking crap each time we were able to get in an order.  My patience ran thin so I didn't care if the sushi chef was busy.  I'd just loudly say my order and honestly, I noticed others around me had to do the same. I've been to many sushi bars and the sushi chefs were sooo friendly...but not here.  My husband and I regretted we didn't go to Sapporo.  Smh."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been to this place considering how much I love sushi, how much I've heard about it, and how close it is to my house.  To be perfectly honest, I have very mixed feelings about it.  It's a small space and seemingly always busy, but we were lucky and got two spots right away at the sushi bar.  Our sushi chef was quick and friendly, and the fish he served us  was beautifully cut and arranged.  We started off with a bunch of orders of nigiri: tuna, salmon, super white tuna, albacore, yellow tail, snapper, all of which were fresh and delicious.  I really wanted a roll with soft shell crab but they only had 2. I ordered the Spider Roll and I was sorely disappointed.  It was huge, but full of the imitation crab meat and a lot of rice and barely any soft shell crab inside.  Of course, I had to eat it all anyway since AYCE.  

Our sushi chef left to go on break so another chef took over. We went back to ordering nigiri and the pieces he served were comical. One small, one big, one cut in half in the middle...really, as a sushi chef, he should have been embarrassed to be putting out pieces like this.  The rest of our meal proceeded in this fashion, with very tiny ugly looking pieces of fish.  I know I know, it all tastes the same, but sorry, I expect my sushi to look pretty, too. Our last dish was the dynamite, which took forever and it was overcooked so the scallops were a little tough.  

We ended our meal with delicious mochi in mango, strawberry and vanilla flavors.  I would say that overall the service was great and the food was good.  Not my favorite sushi joint, but I'd go back because I like the atmosphere and it's close to my house."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've been to. Very friendly staff and you can tell the chefs know what they're doing cause everything tastes super fresh. Thanks to Ulysses and Zachary for the great experience and service!"}
{"text":"Until last night, this was #2 in my top 3 Sushi. I did discover an amazing place so Sushi Mon drops  into #3. However, they do have an outstanding assortment of special rolls and a very friendly staff. The prices are pretty darn good for a sushi place and you don't really have major quality issues because of it. I would highly suggest this place to friends and family over and over again. It is nicely located and easy to access."}
{"text":"A big group of us (16) made a trip out to Utah to do some hiking and on the way back to LA some people suggested we make pitstop at Sushi Mon for lunch. As an LA native, I tend to stear clear of any AYCE unless it's Korean BBQ because it's always sub-par in regards to quality and service, but Sushi Mon proved to be the contrary.

Some of my favorite items:
scallop sushi | salmon belly | yellowtail belly | salmon | white tuna | salmon roe with quail egg | albacore | seaweed salad | cucumber salad | custom handroll (spicy tuna with avocado and quali egg) 

Not only was the fish quality better that I expected, but the service was absolutely top notch. I was worried a party of 16 was going to be overwhelming, but our server (I forget her name) never flinched and got our ever expanding orders perfectly and it didn't take forever either.

I will definitely make a point to visit Sushi Mon the next time I'm in or passing through Vegas and you should too!"}
{"text":"After trying so many Sushi places in town and having a hankering for really good Sushi, I decided to bring the family to Sushimon as it is one of the best places according to so many people.  I wanted to try some excellent sushi.

Here at Sushimon, note:

1. The wait - You are gonna wait for a table.  We came at 1:45 and got to sit down at 2:35.  A bit of a wait, however, they use a really good waitlist system online to notify you when your table is ready.  Although we waited a bit over 45 minutes, it is what we were quoted and we were able to hang out at the Starbucks for a while, so that made the wait worth it.

2.  The food - Besides, the normal speciality rolls, I ordered the Black Tobiko, The Salmon Belly, and the Sanma (Pike Makerel) from their special of the day menu.  I decided that I wanted Amai-ebi, Uni and also hamachi kama so they told me I had to pay the dinner menu price which is 26.95.  I was good with that.

3. Very good food, no problems as it is fresh and tasty.

4. The service - This was a huge issue for sure.  I went with the dinner menu at lunch to have the Amai-Ebi, Uni and Hamachi-Kama.  I did not get the shrimp fried heads from the Amai-Ebi and I never got the Hamachi-Kama.  Since I did get part of the shrimpt and the Uni, they advised me that they would charge me the dinner price.  I get that, and no problem at all. i was full, they would have made the items for me had I demanded, however waiting 40 minutes for these items I got full and decided to pass.  I thought it was decent for them to offer to cook it even though we were there past the 45 minute limit for all you can eat. I did not care for the fact that they said that if I wanted the heads with the Amai-Ebi it is a separate order. I was kind of shocked at that as I don't believe that is normal. However, that is my mistake. If you want the heads, be sure to order it.

5.  The service again - What is not the greatest at this place is the pace of their service.  Wavering between 100% full and 75% full, the service is extremely slow.  The waiters you have to flag down, they don't check in with you often.  The serving of rice is quite a bit on the nigiri sushi and I think the only way you can get your money's worth is to order enough the first time.  If you want an accurate order, you will need to have them repeat it back and then confirm all the bits and pieces that you want to make sure that this is what you are expecting.

Good food, fresh food, mediocre to good service and oddities in their menu and what they include is what this place is all about. Overall, I probably will try out some other places or go back to my regular places. I was not as impressed as I thought for a quality place with a waiting list to get it.  I will for sure adjust my ordering the next time I go there and be very diligent to make sure I get what I ordered and paid for.

Good place to go, just be careful."}
{"text":"I'm usually hesitant when friends tell me of their AYCE sushi experiences because I never think I would ever eat enough sushi to make it really worth it, but we stopped by here for lunch before our drive back to LA and it made AYCE sushi a meal I will definitely have to eat again! Why did we choose sushi to eat while hungover, I'll never know, but it did not stop the food from being delicious!

We came right as it opened at 11:30AM on Sunday, it actually opened a little bit earlier too, which is also a plus. Came with a party of 6 for AYCE, so we were able to try a lot of their sushi & rolls. Their cuts of fish were thick and very good. Our favorite sushi was the salmon and yellowtail. The tuna also was not bad though I didn't try any of their other sushi. As for the rolls, we ordered the Vegas, dragon, rainbow, miles, and the Orion roll. They were all delicious, but would only recommend the Orion roll for those who like a more peppery taste. The ahipoki and baked mussels are also worth a try. I ended my meal with red bean ice cream; it wasn't what I expected, but was still a nice sweet, cold treat to end a filling sushi meal.

For the service, it was pretty good. Did wish the sushi and rolls came out a bit quicker. Water was always filled and our waitresses got every order we threw at her, & it was quite a bit. In a party of six, she was nice enough to insist on splitting our check 6 ways too! If ever in the mood for AYCE in Vegas again, this is the spot to be!"}
{"text":"My office eats here at least once a week.  Sushi Mon is the clear leader for AYCE.  The chefs, Hiro, Mike and Song are skilled and friendly.  You will love this sushi.  The nigiri is outstanding but the rolls are tasty as well.  Give it a try.  You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"If you ever get sick of the buffet breakfast/lunch/dinners and don't want to spend the big dollars on the fancy restaurants then you gotta come out here.

 If you ever go to Vegas and crave sushi, this is the place you need to be. You can't imagine how fresh the sushi is in the desert. Referred by my friend Kenny C, he was right on about this place. Sushi Mon is what it's hyped up to be. 

The 27 dollar all you can eat sushi simply put..............is phenomenal. There are some rules and limitations on your sushi intake. You have to eat all of the rice, there is a time limit of 45 minutes, and you will get penalize if you waste food. Fair enough!!! 

Each person is allowed to order one order of uni(comes in a pair nigiri style), one order of amaebi(comes in a pair, nigiri, and one order of the hamachi kama(half a cheek). These 3 orders by itself is well worth the 27 dollars. All three orders were excellent. You figure it would be lower quality uni, shrimp, and filled with a big glob of rice right??? No, it wasn't. There was very little rice and the uni and shrimp were extremely fresh. The hamachi kama was cooked perfectly, had that nice char from the grill that gives it that smoky flavor and it was seasoned well. 

The rest of the sushi were good as well. The halibut, tuna, salmon.........were all fantastic. I tried to get away with some of the rolls because I didn't want to get filled up from the rice. Believe it or not, they were also fantastic. I have absolutely no complaints about this place and will be sure to come back the next time I am in Vegas. 

Bookmark this place!!! This is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This was my first sushi place. I've been spoiled. I just havent been anywhere as good.

All You Can Eat is like $27 for dinner and $24 for lunch. Everything on the menu (I believe). I prefer to finish off with about 15 pieces of strawberry mochi. Can't do it much anymore because I engorge myself on everything. Red Snapper = Delish.

Octopus and Cucumber Salad, red snapper, miso soup, garden salad, and Jaelon rolls are the best thigns on the menu

This place almost always has a 45 to 75 minute wait after five on most nights. Sometimes lunch has a wait."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first night I have ever been to Sushi Mon..finally!!! The place is very small but it's open late which I like...it was about 10pm when we arrived and the place was full. We sat at the sushi bar and the staff was very friendly. 

I ordered 3 rolls..all very tasty and fresh. I really liked that you can order half of a roll if you don't think you can eat a whole roll..and for the price it was a great deal. For 3 rolls, 2 drinks and a salad it was $27. The only thing I didn't like..it didn't seem like they had a big selection of rolls without eel sauce..but that's just me being picky. Still liked it and would go back!"}
{"text":"Great stuff and prompt service. Second time going here while in the Vegas area. Had the all you can eat sushi and it did not disappoint. All the food was very good and I would stop back. Parking is strip mall like. Seating is promot and service is good. All items were delicious."}
{"text":"Passing by you might not notice this small restaurant, but it's worth paying attention. The staff are attentive and quick, and most important to me, they never let me run out of water.

Here's why I'll be returning to Sushi Mon in Summerlin:

- Prices are low but the quality of sushi didn't suffer, in fact it was quite good

- You can order half rolls with most of their specialty rolls, allowing you to try more without filling up too quickly

- When filling up quickly isn't a concern, they offer all you can eat, almost all day, for the price of about 2.5 specialty rolls

- Their lychee ice cream was some of the best I've ever had and a wonderful finish to the meal"}
{"text":"All you can eat is a great deal!!! So yummy, fast...clean environment... just gets busy and idk why they don't allow all you can eat to sit outside."}
{"text":"gotta visit sushi mon everytime we go to vegas...

Their all you can eat sushi is probably the best all you can eat sushi. 

Not that i'm talking about their fish is best in the world, but for all you can eat standard, it is pretty good!

{"text":"Craving sushi, but wanting to be off the strip, I was referred to Sushi Mon by a resident of Vegas.  
My dining companion asked if this restaurant had a time limit on how long you could eat there and I looked at her like she was insane.  Well, she was correct to ask as there was a time limit on the All-You-Can-Eat Sushi option.  (I had yet to have ever experienced an All You Can Eat place that had restrictions on time, and this apparently was going to be my first.  Were they going to be put a timer on the table?)  

Their menu selection is quite large and ranges from appetizers, to nigiri, to dessert even!  There are a few items that you are limited to (2 per person) and there were out of a few 'hot' items on a Saturday night.  We were told there might be a wait, but there actually was none.  We sat at the sushi bar so we could order directly from the sushi chefs.  Quite a few other patrons and the sushi chefs commented on how surprisingly slow it was that evening.  Despite the slow night, the chefs were too busy watching TV to pay much attention to the customers and we felt like we had to wave them down to get their attention.    

The food was okay - there were some good rolls and some alright items.  I recall not wanting to finish some cooked fish appetizer I ordered.  It wasn't all that great.  The spicy tuna roll wasn't up to par with what I had in mind.

Service was okay.  I think one of the waitresses didn't understand English very well, so she had to get her colleague to help us out a lot.  We were a little offended when we ordered our dessert and they returned with the check as well.  (Uh, we weren't done yet, and our hour wasn't up yet either.) 

Overall, I felt rushed watching my 'hour' time limit.  I think we paid about $25 each for this All You Can Eat but figured it was a good deal.  After all, once you order a couple of rolls and nigiri, you've spent that much money already.  If All You Can Eat Sushi is what you want, Sushi Mon will give that to you. And with the various choices from hot and cold items, it gives you a bigger range to choose from.  

Can't beat mochi and/or ice cream for dessert either!   

It also says on their website that they are open until 2 am!  Wow.

Side note: They also have a frequent eater card.  We like places that offer frequent eater cards. Be sure to get yours!

Update! 11/05/07 - Went back last night, and dinner is now $25.95.  Limited items on the all-you-can-eat is the Toro, Amaebi, Uni, Baked Oyster, and Sake Shooter.  They only have two ice cream flavors - Green Tea and something else, and only Strawberry Mochi.  The BF and the brother loved the Baked Mussels.  They also offer amaebi head soup, which is a nice twist.  Nigiri was pretty good with good slices of fish and small amounts of rice.  We definitely appreciate they aren't trying to stuff us with the rice!

Sidenote: They don't take reservations!"}
{"text":"Living in Vegas for the past few weeks, and I've stayed far away from the buffet lines.  However, I have also been missing out on my sushi runs and finally had the opportunity for some raw fish this past weekend.

Having been to their sister restaurant on Sahara, I was familiar with Sushi Mon's all-you-can-eat menu.  For $29.95, you have an hour to chow down on nigiri, rolls, appetizers, tempura, and dessert.  For those not wanting to participate in the race, you can order from their a la carte menu as well.  

For such limited items like Amaebi (don't forget to ask for the fried heads that come with them!) and Uni, it's only one order (a pair) per person.  Otherwise, diners like myself would have them running out of that stuff quick!  I also had some of their nigiri, and their specialty rolls - 9-1-1 Roll, Spider Roll, and Pixie Roll among others.  I had a better experience with their Hamachi Collar this time compared to my experience at the other Sushi Mon.  Order half orders on the rolls so you can try more out and aren't stuck with 8 pieces all to yourself! 

And for dessert - I like their Plum Sherbet, Lychee Sherbet, and Green Tea Ice Cream.  I never made it around to their Mochi this time unfortunately.

Update! 09/14/07 - I made the mistake of ordering their Spider Roll which is huge and filled with crab meat filler!  Blah!  Be sure to ask what their daily fish specials are.  They had bonito and live scallops when we went, and the scallop was pretty good.  Their scallop nigiri is cooked scallop, which is something I didn't really care for.  I got a chance to try their Mochi Vanilla this time, yum!  I think I did a good job of eating my fill!

Sidenote: They offer frequent eater cards!  Eat 10 times there and get one free!  They don't take reservations! 

Update! 03/11/08 - I finally tried their vanilla mochi and it was yummy.  Forgot to check what their daily fish specials were, which was probably a big mistake. Their ahi poke has nice cuts of tuna and seaweed mixed together, add a bit of soy to it though."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, I will always come here when I come to Las Vegas Nevada or Henderson"}
{"text":"I am usually weary of the quality of AYCE sushi, not wanting to get sick from bad fish. Sushi Mon blew any preconceived thoughts of disgusting buffets out of the water!

A double-sided menu of food that is made-to-order greets you, yay! My exact order (almost) every time is as follows: edamame, seaweed salad, cajun albacore, pastel roll, sexy girl roll, yellowtail collar and strawberry mochi. If I'm feeling a little frisky, I'll order the mussels as well. Did I mention I get all of this for $26.95?! Amazing, I know. 

Due to their amazing menu size, they do ask that you not waste any food and eat all you order (cue the forklift to get me home). When you order a roll, you have the option of ordering a half roll so that you can order more of a variety. 


The only reason Sushi Mon lost a star is for the size. The tables are sooo close together and I wouldn't dream of going here with a large group in fear of having to wait 45+ minutes for a table. 

Side note for parents: Your little ones can share the AYCE with you if they are young enough to sit in a high chair, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location lately instead of Goyemon for my AYCE fix.  My wife and I have dined here five times in the last two months and have never had to wait to be seated which is a nice change of pace.  Servers and Sushi Chefs are all very friendly and greet you with a boisterous \"Irasshaimase!\" Our favorites include the Hurricane roll, Crispy Rice roll, and Yellowtail Nigiri."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Slow service waiting about 10mins for an ice cream at a slow hour. The food has no quality. Every sushi they place tooo much rice!"}
{"text":"ALL YOU CAN EAT! For an AYCE place, I think sushimon ranks pretty high up there. The main problem is the deliriously long wait when you are starving and all you see is other people shoving food into their mouths. Do keep in mind that there is a time limit on the AYCE option.

It's pretty small so I would not recommend coming here during peak hours -- I've seen it get super busy after 6:30p so expect a wait. I've always come at odd hours or ordered ala cart to go. This place is good, but it's not wait-for-an-hour good (at least, not for me). Service was good, and sushi tasted fresh, so it's A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE sushi place I've been to. All of their fish is fresh and ready to eat. Sadly, when I came on a Friday night, they ran out of toro. But all of the other fish made up for it. We ordered scallop, tuna, white tuna, salmon, uni, masago with quail eggs, and more. They all tasted really good and flavorful. 

The wait took about 1 hr but they will text you when your table is ready so you can go do other stuff and come back. Service was amazing and fast. Price is reasonable for their top quality of fish. We paid about $129 for 4 ppl. Overall, I would definitely  recommend coming here for AYCE."}
{"text":"As much as I miss the Silverado location, it's great to have a Sushi Mon closer to the north. The staff is very friendly. Just with the nature of AYCE and random ordering, sometimes items are forgotten but with just a little reminder, you get it instantly. The dining area is small like any typical sushi restaurant, there's 4 tops, 2 seaters, and a good size almost wrap around sushi bar. We will def go back since it's so near to us and love the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and it really made me sad when we moved to the other side of town, but we always make the trek when we're craving sushi. The selections are great and food quality is always good. The staff has always been welcoming and attentive!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend coming here ever. The costumer service was absolutely terrible and even after complaining about uncooked rice they only gave us the option to pay extra for each piece or finish the rice. Don't waist your time. One star is generous."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I took a couple of friends to sushi mon over the weekend and their service was horrible.  Moreover, they served our table spoiled uni. When I complained to the waitress and cashier they both acted as if nothing was wrong. Fyi, when you complain coincidentally no one speaks English."}
{"text":"Sushi is good customer service horrible servers obviesly dont speak english or spanish they have noo knowledge ,they assume place a couple menus with there rules for ayce and your good to go! Never come around to check on you really rude servers ! Dont make conversation or try suggest any rolls waiting time is horrible place is small  i wont be taking my business here again!!"}
{"text":"I always come here when I go to Vegas. AMAZING sushi for a decent price. I highly suggest doing the all you can eat option since it's such a great deal. The only downside is that the wait for a table is loooong especially during dinner time. I've waited nearly an hour on a couple of occasions. Other than that, everything is great."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The atmosphere is nice. You can carry out at a reasonable time. They're open later than most. Their portion sizes are worth the money. AND. The all-you-can-eat is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Not very good service, but pretty good sushi. They didn't even greet us when we walked in/ up to the counter and our server was just okay. But it was very good, and the food came out quickly. I would still go back, but I have others closer, cheaper, with just as good sushi."}
{"text":"Normally I LOVE this place & I always recommend it. Tonight we brought fiends and the service was Horrible to say the least! In the hour we were there my friend got 2 of the 5 rolls he ordered.   Literally the WORST. So disappointed. It took 1 hour to bring 2 rolls, my husband kept trying to call the server and he would look away and not come over! DO NOT eat here!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place it was recommended by a friend i was debating how many stars to give but I end up with a 5 stars 
3 for atmosphere 
6.5 for service 
5 for friendliness 
10 for food 
3 for price 
We got the all you can eat but since  you can't order sashimi on the all you can eat they stuff you with the nigiri so for sure you will get full with the rice so you better come here with empty stomach"}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi for $25. 

There's a 45 minute time limit, but the servers say they don't really enforce it, not like you should be eating for more than an hour once you start anyways! 

The rolls here are amazing. There is a large selection and everything is fresh. The sushi is not drowned with rice so you can enjoy the fish. The miso soup to start is on point. The rolls sometimes break easily when trying to grab it, but for the most part are very well made. What really pleased me was the service. It is FAST! We kept ordering away and the food kept coming out without skipping a beat.

Ended my meal with green tea ice cream which was among the best I've tasted and I left satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"I enjoy their sushi a lot! Whenever I go with my family, we always do all you can eat sushi. You get your money's worth! Whenever we're really hungry and craving sushi, we come here! During the day, it isn't that busy but when you come during the night, it's quite the wait and a lot of people."}
{"text":"Green
Tea
Smoothie
!!!!

Hell yes!"}
{"text":"This place is the best for the AYCE. I live in California and I had to visit this place on the way home from Vegas.  It was one of the high points of my visit. That and seeing a casino in the Ralphs/ Smith's. I would come back here anytime. They had an amazing list of rolls and nigiri. It even included dessert."}
{"text":"Can't believe they handled our party of 16 (12 at one table and 4 at one table).  We totally demolished it - lots of nigiri, spider rolls, specialty rolls, baked salmon skin rolls, shrimp tempura, tuna poke, and more.  They did not add in an auto gratuity and credited us one AYCE meal on our current bill through their stamp program.  This place is small but they churn out the sushi."}
{"text":"Back again but this time with a group of 10.  Sometimes the waitress does not get a few orders to the chefs but no worries.  Just order more.  I still love the ability to order the whole menu at the AYCE dinner.  Sushi plus chicken teriyaki, shrimp tempura, miso soup and more.  Had the Chubby role late and wished I had ordered it earlier.  Kids discovered the dessert is also AYCE.  The one hour limit is really a one session of eating limit.  We were there about 90 minutes but were consistently eating, so no problem.  Don't worry if you order something you don't like.  No archaic leftover food rules.  Gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"all you can eat sushi is a great deal.
there's a list of all the sushi that you can order, rolls, side dishes, ice cream.  all for the low price of $30. 

their albacore is pretty good but not their cajun albacore.

the quality of the fish is not spectacular but it is good for price.
theres a 60 min time period for all you can eat.  
i think i got my money's worth.
i got two orders of ice cream. the red bean was good.

the service is not too great because there are only two servers and the place gets packed."}
{"text":"in my opinion, 
i think it's a good deal for all you can eat sushi for $27.
but i think the location on sahara is better than this one.
the fish didn't seem as fresh.

read the fine print.  it states that there are special fish/sushi of the night. 
kobe beef was one them the night we went.

the kobe beef sushi (i don't think it's real. maybe it's kobe beef style or american?) was really tough. it didn't melt in your mouth or anything.

the spider roll is huge. 
i liked the lychee ice cream.
they're open til 2am. last call at 1:30."}
{"text":"A long long time ago, in a land far away, there was an innocent small town cowgirl who had never had sushi...that girl was me.  Luckily, someone close to me was a bit more worldly in that department and so one fine day after smoking a lot of \"tobacco\" a hunger came over me like none I had ever experienced, so I agreed to try sushi.

That first experience was at Sushi Mon and my life has never been the same.

I think it's rather cute/funny/entertaining that they make you read the \"rules\" of all-you-can-eat before hand.  Some of the rules include \"your hour begins when you get your first dish,\" \"if you leave rice on your plate you will be charged the individual amount of that particular item on top of the AYCE charge\" etc., etc...

I see many people complaining about wait times here.  I have experienced that as well and yes, that is a pain but, that is also a good sign for any restaurant, in my opinion.

Now that I'm a bit more experienced in the sushi department, I can honestly say that I have yet to see a sushi roll selection that rivals that of Sushi Mon.  Who knew that such a great sushi establishment could exist in the middle of the desert!

Thank you, Sushi Mon, for making my first sushi eating experience a good one!!"}
{"text":"I have finally returned since writing my first Yelp review.  I really love this place and really wanted the opportunity to review them.  Tonight, I finally have that opportunity.  I suggested this place to a friend of mine for some drinks and Japanese food.

I arrived at the location and to my surprise, it was empty!  No line, no waiting, no headache.  SCORE!  I chose to sit at a table of two rather than the sushi bar.  the tables are a little close from the others, however, I've learned to deal with that from my frequent past visits.  The servers are clean, wear all black and really pays attention to the need of their customers.  I appreciate them coming around often to fill up my water, or clearing any plates and debris from the table.  Makes me feel special :)

Tonight my friend got a $10 Teriyaki chicken dinner plate.  Added was my meal:  A bowl of salted edamame, an appetizer of the Yellowtail collar, a bowl of the California salad, a larger Sapporo beer and a large hot sake.   Everything mentioned above came to $52.00 with tax and ample tip.  The edamame was lightly salted and not overpowering.  It came out so warm, I was in heaven!  My favorite thing, hands down, about Sushimon is the Yellowtail or Hamachi collar.  Literally, a grilled piece of the fish collar area, close to the head.  The collar is packed with fish meat, marbleized and full of smokey flavor goodness!  This dish is served with a lemon wedge, a little fish roe and a soy-vinegar dipping sauce.  I literally take my time on this dish.  It's so good!  Every bite offers such a euphoric experience for me, I became super sad on the last bite LOL. It was the first time I've tried the California salad.  This was AH-MAZE-ING!  Start off with a spring mix accompanied with a mustard/ginger dressing.  On the top of the salad is sliced avocado, yum, shrimp and crab meat-lots of it!  It was soo filling and so fresh.  This is a must try in my book.  The crab meat was everywhere, fanned out shrimp and long slivers of avocado.  Every bite was better than the rest!  

I had a great night here as I always tend to do.  Lots of great food, great service and an intimate space that allows you to really enjoy the company around you.  Definitely need to check this place out.  It's in the middle of a busy part of town and super accessible.  You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"How much sushi do you think you can eat within a 45 minutes time span? Up for the challenge?  Come hungry!

Go to Sushi Mon and test your lightening speed sushi consumption here.  

For $21.95, you WILL get your money's worth for all you can eat sushi. And yes, it's fresh.  

Let me know how it goes and how many of their 911 rolls you were able to handle :)  Thanks Jenn and Glenn for another new Vegas intro!"}
{"text":"After the owner sold this place, it really lost a lot of its quality. The new interior is confusing... And the sushi chefs are a bunch of ransoms. They have a new \"we can't seat you until your whole party is seated\" rule, and wouldn't let us sit because my mom was still getting the baby out of the car. The food was okay and the rolls are all the same and a small selection. My tuna poki still had fish scales on it. The eel was dry, and the uni was spoiled. The only good roll was the spider roll. When I tried to pick up my baked mussel I ordered, IT BURNED MY INDEX FINGER AND ITS NOW BLISTERED. I will not be back."}
{"text":"For an all you can eat sushi place in the middle of America, this was very good.  I loved all the rolls with unagi in them.  You have exactly one hour to eat all you can, but can order as many rolls as you want to begin with.  I was with a group of six people and we ordered 25 plates of sushi to start.  Within 10 minutes, the plates started to roll in.  Each of them was very good.  The waiter was really good.  

The only reason that it wasn't a five, is a good thing.  The place is pretty small, so we had to wait an hour to get in, even on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon was kinda my first date with the BF and we kept coming back We have come here so often that we really are burned out on it and haven't been back in a few months, but we've gone enough that it would be a drastic downfall for my opinion to change. 

Their appetizers I haven't explored too much of. I regularly get seaweed salad, poke salad (I mix them up together), dynamite and fried oysters. 

 Love that they do half rolls as I like variety and dont want to be stuck trying a new roll and discovering I don't like it yet have to commit to consuming it. Love their moon roll and sunrise roll! I'm not even a \"roll person\" but I enjoy those two.  I normally go simple though- am a sucker for salmon skin handrolls and can eat quite a few of these. 

The chefs slices nigiri thick-this place doesn't skimp on fish and do not pile on too much rice. The fish is pretty fresh and the bulk of what I eat is nigiri so I can tell when it's not. I have some days here where certain fish is just okay, but overall they keep a decent standard. There are a few things not on the nigiri menu such as Toro and White Tuna so be sure to ask the sushi chefs if there's off menu items that day. Both are my fave and not to be missed, there is a 1 order limit on the Toro, Amaebi and Uni though. Off the regular menu, I tend to grab yellowtail, albacore and their cajun albacore is nice to have something different. 

Usually places slow the service to pace you through your AYCE to eat less,some I think purposely put some of the expensive things til the end, some \"lose\" your order too- not the case here. They serve it pretty fast and as you ordered it.  We've been here plenty of times when there's few tables near closing and gotten great service. That standard of service still held when nearly a dozen are waiting outside for a table. To me, that deserve a lot of merit and is why I gave them 5 stars. Sushi Mon staff really works hard to attain good service- they work their butt off! Hats off!

Also the little old lady is so cute. She remembers our names and says it in her cute accent. Specially my boyfriends name....Scott is Scott-to. I appreciate and impressed she remembers us each time we come in and the chefs and servers know us too...but then again, we've been in so often it's hard not to notice."}
{"text":"This place was great.  I got the all you can eat sushi and it was fantastic.  I really like the fact that you can order 1/2 orders of rolls so that way you get to try more.  Everything was amazing (except for the saki shooter that had quail egg in it....that was a little weird)!  I will definitely go back here in the future"}
{"text":"love this place!
addicted to the lemon roll and rainbow roll!"}
{"text":"I'm partial to this place for their great service and food comes up really fast and they encourage you to order more.  This place is PACKED all the time.  Freshness is never an issue because of how busy they are.  They have a great to go menu as well (I love their mild curry over pork tonkatsu)   

This place offers a stamp card and allows you to order half rolls (which I like because I can order more of a variety)  Although their menu is large, it's starting to get out dated. I think it'd be nice if they introduced a few new rolls on the menu and added some salads like screaming orgasm and, salmon skin salad.  I'm not so worried about them needing to offer sashimi although it'd be nice but it's not necessary.  

In the past 5 yrs I've probably have gone to this place approx 80 times or more (I've lost track on how many stamp cards I've gone through lol)"}
{"text":"10 yr anniversary. So they are offering all you can eat today for $10.  The line was out the door probably 50 people standing outside before they even opened.  Since I was by myself, I only waited 15 min before they called my name.  

They definitely prepared for today.  They were staffed, food was comin out fast and lookin good, tasting good, service was good.  

The Ahi Poki was probably the only thing I didn't really care for. I love ahi poki, just not their version of it.  Otherwise....

Nothin to complain about :-)"}
{"text":"Great place. Staff and service was excellent. We were given soup and salad while we waited for our rolls. Rolls came out very fast and tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place! must have the all you can eat for 28$ it's time limited though you have 1 hour but that's enough time. Their rolls are good and love the shumai and the shrimp tempura. The only crappy thing about this place is waiting during busy hours its busy to where you would wait 30-1 hour well worth it though pretty cheap and its all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"We came for the all you can eat and we won't leave until we've eaten it all.  

We were a party of 4 at dinner time on a Saturday night.  This is a small space so there's usually a line outside for tables.   Luckily there was 1 table available and we snagged it. 2 of us ordered a la carte and 2 of us had all you can eat. 

The AYCE menu was quite expansive, and somewhat overwhelming. We ordered mainly nigiri for the AYCE for more bang for our buck.  The nigiris were on the mini side, but good proportion of fish to rice. Depending on how you order, rolls can come as half rolls or whole rolls.  This I appreciate because you can try a large variety of rolls. They also have a specials menu that included blue fin, bonito, and other Japanese named fish I can't remember.  The AYCE also included a dessert menu with ice cream, mochi, and deep fried ice cream. 

For a la carte, I ordered a niku udon because I'm allergic to seafood.  It came with a salad and CA roll. The udon broth was quite salty and I suspect made from some kind of concentrate. There was quite a large portion of beef, which was pleasantly surprising.  But it was A LOT of beef. I wish there was some kind of greenery, like spring onion, to cut through. 

The service was great. The wait staff were quite attentive to us and there wasn't a moment where the table was empty.  We never really waited too long to refill AYCE. and the orders came out promptly."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  But it seems like everytime we go the service gets worse and worse.  The sushi chefs behind the bar are extremely attentive!  But if you get a table, god help you.  Towards the middle of my last 3 meals there, my waitress just disappears.  We finally flag down a different waitress after giving crazy ample time, and they inform us our waitress' shift has ended.  So it was our responsibility?  I would be very forgiving if it only happened once, but that's not the case.  

I keep going for the food, it's just incredible.  And even though the service lately has been mediocre, I will continue to go there until they have pushed too many buttons...

I'm editing my review:  they have stepped up their game on customer service and it couldn't be better. Thanks Sushi Mon for continuing to be my favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here since 2004. We love it and enjoy waiting for a place at the bar. Sometimes it is an hour wait for the bar but it is always worth the wait. It is very busy because they have such yummy sushi. For being in the desert we are impressed for a Sushi place to have such delicious food! We always get the \"all you can eat\" deal and we really enjoy every morsel. Our favorites are the Cajun Tuna, White Tuna and Garlic Tuna just to name a few of the Nigiri. For the rolls I love the Calico Roll while my husband loves the Jala Jala roll and Domingo. Those are way too hot for me but he says they are his favorites. I think every baked roll there is amazing as well as the crunchy deep fried rolls. Now I am getting hungry! I am going to see if my hubby wants to go there tonight!"}
{"text":"The price has stayed the same, but the nigiri has way too much rice compared to before and the slices of sashimi is a bit smaller.  This is why I am dropping a star on the rating.  Other places like Yama and Oyshi has a better sashimi to rice ratio if you ask me.  They seem to not carry Toro anymore and I have not had the super white tuna there in awhile now.  They are definitely cutting back on the special sashimi with the down economy."}
{"text":"Overall, pretty good sushi for a reasonable AYCE price.  The fish cuts were generous and did not have too much rice.  The maguro, smelt and salmon egg, salmon, cinco de mayo roll, poke were all good choices.  The hamachi was not good, a little sour, maybe it was not a good batch.

The green tea ice cream in the end hits the spot and good way to end the meal.  The service is quick and efficient.  The location could be hard to find as it's tucked away in the back of a strip mall.

Recommended if you have a big craving for sushi."}
{"text":"Once I get off the plane in Las Vegas, I start to crave all the food. Including sushi. Not something I seek out normally, but Vegas does sushi right.

Only about 15 min from the airport, Sushi Mon gets the AYCE job done. Even if you're ordering a la carte. Then the pressure is off, since no one is spying to see if you finished one plate before moving on to another. So many rules with all you can eat that I can't handle.

What to order: seaweed salad, takoyaki, tuna nigiri, sweet crab nigiri, crispy rice roll, and rainbow roll. I had every intention of ordering tempura ice cream but that rice filled up my belly and there wasn't any room for dessert. Then again, a deep fried roll is kind of like dessert anyway.

Beyond sticky rice roll my favorite was takoyaki and tuna nigiri. Fresh, simple, and portions not too large. Just enough. And for the same price of AYCE per person, we got to eat exactly what we wanted without the hassle. Plus a large beer to share.

Yes there's a gazillion places to eat sushi in Vegas. Sushi Mon is worth the wait. It's done right and off of The Strip, so prices reflect the quality not the ambiance."}
{"text":"My buddy Will introduced me to this little place in South East of Vegas. I swear he defends this place as if he owns it! Luckily we were able to get in fairly quick since word on the street is that this place usually has long lines.  Stays open 'til 2 am so perfect for those who are craving sushi this late without having to go all the way to Chinatown where other restaurants stay open late as well.

All you can eat is a bit pricey for such a small joint.  I believe it was close to being $30 unlike the $20 I'm used too in other all you can eat sushi places.  You can never go wrong with baked mussels. They serve pretty big nigiris, but it's just ok on the taste factor. I highly recommend the volcano roll and jala jala roll. But if you ordered all you can eat, just order half the original quantity of the rolls so you can try all their other rolls as well which are pretty good too. And for deserts, tempura ice cream is a must for me!  

I like this place but won't be going here too often since I know other great sushi places that offer less of their ridiculous all you can eat price."}
{"text":"An all you can eat, made to order Japanese owned sushi restaurant. But ran by mostly non-Japanese sushi chefs. 

Came here for dinner( $26.95/pps) couple nights ago for the first time, ordered assortments of sushi and rolls ( ex: sweet shrimp sushi, uni sushi, smoked salmon, baked yellow tail collar, 911 rolls etc.) The qualities of the sashimi were alright, and the sushi rice seems to fall apart every time when I tried to pick them up. 

If you're big on quantity rather than quality, then this would be the place to be, but personally, I would rather spent few more dollars and have an authentic Japanese sushi experience."}
{"text":"We were turmed away at Sasa. Did us a favor, because it brought us back to our favorite all you can eat place!. Greeted right away, they honor what's written on door for hours of service. Drink and food order started right away. Sushi Nigiri a little small, but is the norm in all you can eat places. All seemed fresh, and all food, especially the grilled pork belly was good."}
{"text":"I work at a sushi restaurant but I come here when I crave sushi :D 
Service is great.
Food is great. Unfortunately, unlike most places, they do not have soft shell crab for AYCE appetizers :( 
I've been coming here for years. Still a royal customer!"}
{"text":"Considering that this is all you can eat, the quality of the fish is pretty descent according to my husband. He ate a lot of the special nigiri that they offer. I ate mostly appetizers because I am not really into all you can eat sushi. I do like how they do half orders.
I am not dying to come back though. I am willing to come back if my friends decide to come, but I definitely wouldn't come on my own or reccommend.
The server was nice though."}
{"text":"Tried a few all you can eat places in LA as well as Las Vegas, this one got to be the most unfriendly toward kids.  So, if you have kids, don't go.  

We went there on our last trip to vegas. Our party of 6 consistent of two grandparents (not big sushi eater), hubby and me and our two kids 6 and 3.  Both of my kids are skinny, the older one is 41lb and the younger one is 29lb.  You got the picture, they are not big eaters.  

First of all, on their menu, it says quite sternly that no sharing with children.  So, we ordered a chicken teryaki meal for my 6 year old and a separate california roll for my 3 year old.  All adults got AYCE sushi.   They brought up the miso soup, and my 3 year old wants some so I fed some to her.  The waitress who was not even our server gave us the evil eye and actually brought it to our server's attention and pointing fingers at our table.  Very unpleasant.  I over heard our server to her that they already ordered two meals for the kids then she walked away.  What a turn-off! 

All the servers are not very friendly, kind of stone face and got a feeling they really want you to be done with it ASAP.  

Maybe because I got too spoiled by a local AYCE place here in LA (sushi Joe).  They were so friendly and told us to order 1 cal roll for the kids and they don't care if they share.   On top of that, they brought out extra apperizers for my kids and made sure they were not spicy.   What a difference.   That's why they got our business all the time."}
{"text":"New listing?  New owner?  Not sure why it's \"new,\" but in the end, it doesn't really matter.  I put my trust in you....wait, got sidetracked for a second....

How's the food???  THAT'S what matters to me!!

Well, as you might have guessed seeing the 5 star review, it's better than good in my book.  It was surprisingly good actually!

I ordered about 15 different kinds of Nigiri.  Not ONE of them were disappointing!  All tasted fresh, but here are some noteworthy ones to touch on :

Uni : Very good Uni! Love the consistency...not watery/runny or overly salty!  I am SUPER particular when it comes to uni...it's the difference between thoroughly enjoying it, or slightly gagging on it at first taste.  Thankfully, it's the former.

Hotate : The Fresh Scallops were PERFECT! Super tender, melt in your mouth good! Buttery, with just a hint of citrus and wasabi of course...only thing I have found to rival it ANYWHERE is YG&S's LIVE counterpart!  And considering that it's not FAIR to compare it, this is the best I've found LOL :P

Amaebi : The sweet shrimp had a slight crunch to it, buttery taste, and smooth finish.  Great choice.  I did not receive the fried heads...you probably need to specify if you want them.

The Hamachi Kama was on the daily special...this is my most favorite part of the fish!  If you see it on the menu and don't mind diggin in for the good stuff, you gotta try the collar if you have been sleeping under a rock!  If you've had it before, you are gonna order it without reading this anyways LOL.

And for dessert, both the Chocolate Mousse and Green Tea Creme Brulee were on daily special.  If you see either on the menu, I would highly recommend both!  Chocolate mousse is a little thicker than their sister stores counterpart, but still that same great taste.  The creme brulee was perfect...strong green tea taste, and I love that crispy crust!

Service was very fast.  They were pretty slow on this Tuesday night, which got me worried about the quality I was to encounter, but I am glad it didn't affect my visit.  But because it was slow, my orders got taken promptly, food was prepared and served quickly, and I always had refills etc.

Only NEGATIVE thing I can think of...I got charged $3 for \"sharing\" with Little Foodie Dude.  He just turned two, and yes, he DOES have an appetite LOL, but it will mark forever in history as his first charge at an AYCE restaurant.  I'm not too mad though, considering he ate an entire order of Edamame, 4 pieces of unagi, ahi, salmon skin handroll etc lol.  He got his $3 worth :P

I hope it wasn't a fluke, but I much preferred my visit today than the last few times I have been to the Henderson location, as well as the G'monster himself!  All they need now is the Grilled Pork Belly and I'll never have to go back there again lol.

Keep it up Sushi-Mon...keep the ball rollin forward and never look back!

{"text":"I can't believe I have never written a review for Sushimon!

This was my go to place for AYCE sushi...when I lived on this side of town, I would come all the time, and even after I moved, I would make the 45min drive for excellent and fresh sushi.

I have ran into a new favorite though, which is still a sister company of sushimon, and a little more centrally located.

So what makes sushimon one of the best in town?

Fresh fish, fast service, and most importantly, YELLOWTAIL COLLARS!

Yellowtail collars are easily one of the best fish pieces I have ever consumed.  In the AYCE setup, you are limited to one, but it is what makes me drive all the way out here...it is seriously that good.  You HAVE to order it, especially if you go with the AYCE menu.  One of the most tender parts of the fish and packed with flavor.

I am a nigiri kind of guy, although we do order rolls every once in a while, but everything I have came into contact with is super tastey and fresh.  They have plenty of sides to order as well, such as tempura options and baked mussels.

They also have good deals on pitchers of Sapporo which is a nice touch.

Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group early on a Thursday night. Got seated right away and started ordering immediately. The service here was great. Super fast, great suggestions, and very pleasant to deal with the whole time we were there. We never felt rushed. For the first time ever, not a single person in my group complained. That's a big win in my book.

Everything we got was super tasty and good quality. Nice fresh fish. A good fish to rice ratio. The ayce menu has a terrific variety. We loved everything we got from the rolls, to the mussels, to the tempura, to the calamari and nigiri. As we were leaving we were already making plans to come back again. For me this place was darn near perfect."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon always has the best when it comes to all you can eat sushi.  Sure, it's not as good as the top tier a la carte restaurants, but it's nice to enjoy flavorful, quality, all you can eat when you are feeling a little gluttonous.

The service is hit or miss, especially when they are busier, but if you sit at the counter and buy your chef a beer, you'll be taken care of like a VIP all night."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi spot!! You'd never know tucked into a grocery shopping center would be this gold mine. My fiancé and I come here all the time and not only is the sushi awesome but the staff is amazing. Over two years of frequenting this place and have never had just an \"ok\" time. Do get there early as there is usually a wait for this small hotspot, but the wait is usually quicker than the estimated time and always worth it. Their all you can eat includes appetizers and deserts Our favorites include the Mantaiko, SuperWhite, lemon roll and yellow tail collar."}
{"text":"awesome all you can eat sushi spot, staff very friendly and fun, only thing I didn't like was the space, kinda small, but the food makes up for it, which is really why youre here"}
{"text":"Cheap meal? - check.
Great sushi? - check.
All you can eat? -  check.
Food made to order? - check.

What more could you want? I accidentally stumbled upon this place while driving around my work area looking for lunch. What a great find! I loved the selection of specialty rolls and sides (green mussels, MMm!)."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and everytime I visit Vegas I go here...I love this ayce made to order sushi place! Sushi is so FRESH and Rolls are so TASTY & many choices! I go here w/ lose clothing so I can fit more in my belly. I always leave HAPPY :)"}
{"text":"The best all you can eat I've had in Las Vegas.  Quality of the food is excellent. Wait staff is excellent.  And the value is excellent. 

the only reason I'm rating this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the long waits during dinner hours. Especially on weekends. Often times the wait is more than 30 minutes. 

I hope this place gets to expand and gets more seating!"}
{"text":"All you can eat options, typical price of 25 per person for 60 minutes. Overall, quality of seafood is pretty good, plenty of roll options as well as daily specials. Staff is really friendly and so are the sushi chefs behind the counter. They also have a stamp card (after 10 all you can eats, 1 free)  that you can use at this location as well as Goyemon, both really good all you can eat sushi options."}
{"text":"If you can get past the smell when you first walk through the door then have a seat and prepare for some good food.  

The ayce sushi for dinner is very nice.  They will do half rolls so you can try everything.  They also have fresh scallops which is a must for me if you wish to get more than a star rating.  

Went here for lunch too and the lunch special portions are huge.  Very tasty and well worth it.

Where they lose 2 stars is in the service.  And that is all I'll say about that."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this restaurant. We try to come for lunch or dinner at least once a month. The sushi here is so fresh, and we are both super picky. We moved over to this side of town and it is closer to us than our old place so we switched and we don't miss our old place at all. The sushi chefs are super friendly and serve it up with a smile. The wait staff is super attentive as well. I also love their rewards program! We eat there enough that it definitely makes it worth it. Recommended to all sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. 35 minutes to be seated on a Monday night, the sushi was okay. I didn't like the layout of the menu, and it took them about 20 minutes in the end to bring out my half roll (simple roll, nothing that needed to be cooked). Word of advice- sit at the sushi bar, they seemed to get way better service and have their rolls come out faster."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon has two locations in Vegas. This one here in Sahara, and another in Maryland Pkwy (South Vegas). The South Vegas location is the original. Both locations are one of the best AYCE Sushi joints in Vegas. Lunch AYCE is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95. You don't have to get AYCE and can just order like a normal restaurant. But I think the prices for the All you can eat is quite a good deal if you know what to order. The quality of fish is fresh and I never had a Nigiri or roll I didn't like.

Here's the Nigiri you can order in AYCE (not including the special rolls and appetizers you can also get. Each order is 2 pieces of Nigiri.) My favorites being: 1. Salmon ( A very fresh and clean tasting fish. I highly recommend this to first time sushi eaters as it doesn't have any fishy smell and is very smooth. My all time favorite.)
2. Yellowtail ( Classified as a \"Luxury fish\" Has a rich oily texture. The flesh is light red, A good piece of Yellowtail has very rich flavors. I used to go deep sea fishing for this with my late father. ) 
3. Halibut ( White meat of the sea, Hirame has a very light taste and is delicate. The meat has a soft and chewy texture and lots of flavor. Another fish I used to go deep sea fishing for. Quite an ugly fish if you ever catch one yourself. But one of my favorites by far.
4. Unagi (Grilled Fresh water Eel. Has a rich flavor and should be both crisp and tender. I recommend this fish at the end of the meal as the flavor is strong and may overwhelm your taste buds. You want to start off with the lighter tasting fish to fully enjoy the taste of Sushi.)

{"text":"The name pretty much tells the story. If you like sushi, you'll probably have a pretty good time here, mon, but only if you can really down the sushi. I am an occasional sushi snacker, but rarely can I get enough value from AYCE to go that route.  At $29 for dinner, the value is hard to obtain here, so this is a review of the non-sushi items. 

I have had teriyaki chicken, udon, and tempura, and they have been meh. The chicken is always dry. However, the value is pretty incredible. For $10  I get more food than I could ever hope to eat: miso soup, salad, pasta salad, 6 pieces of tempura, California roll and teriyaki chicken. Crazy! Even if you don't eat one of the items, you're still getting a nice deal. 

Service is always efficient, perhaps a little stand-offish, but with a little nudging, friendly. Solid effort."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi is like playing roulette. This one seems to be a winner. 

You can usually tell a bad sushi place when the list of rolls is 8 pages and comes in book form.. sushi (to me) is not crazy rolls with names like \"Oriential Delight\". Whenever you mix too many ingredients and then drown it in sauces you can't taste if the fish or rice is good or bad.

Maybe I am a purist but sushi should be good rice and good fish. this place has a full list of nigiri-zushi and sashimi and it is all really good."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place with respectable owners, chefs and waiters. The prices are really reasonable with over 50 different sushi options. The hours here are also perfect for people like me who are random. Overall great sushi shop!"}
{"text":"Their all you can eat sushi is a great deal, fast service, and delicious food. Will definitely bring some friends with me to try it out next time."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with All You Can Eat at Sushi Mon!  You get 45 minutes of pure indulgence for $21.95 at lunch time.  The sushi rolls are large and taste so good.  Not only do you get sushi rolls you also get hot food options like teriyaki chicken to shrimp tempura to steamed or fried gyoza.  There are cold salad options too.  The main \"rule\" here is that if you order it you better finish it as you will be charged additional for unfinished rolls.  They have a great half roll option so there should be no issues finishing what you order.  

The service is great and you don't wait long once you start ordering.  We placed our order and within 5 minutes our awesome sushi started rolling out.  The waitress was pleasant and didn't look at us like we were big ol pigs for ordering so much.

The gyoza was fresh with a great filling that included cabbage.  The teriyaki chicken wasn't the best, it's all up to how you like it prepared.  The sushi was on point and there were a ton of sushi rolls to choose from.  The JJ roll and the 007 roll were great and try the royal California roll too.  The supreme Alaska was full of tasty salmon.  Ohhhhh the spicy tuna is the perfect amount of spicy and the Cajun albacore nigiri is great!  Damn me!  I'm hungry for sushi again!!! 

Parking was easy and there is quite a bit of it.  This restaurant is just below Durango on Sahara.  It's in between Cimmaron and  Durango on the north side of the road.  It's in the same parking lot and just a few stores away from Nothing Bundt Cakes.  Paymons is in the same parking lot too.

We walked out beyond full ready to pop from this awesome meal!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in the world. The first time I was there they had Toro on the all u can eat, and they still do every once in a while...Toros is $12 an order usually! Hell of a deal. 

Now the problem with most all you can swallow sushi places is that every roll is on top of a cali roll, the lamest roll ever. Sushi Mon is not that way! I recommend you get a Sunrise, Jala Jala, JJ, Moon, and the sweet shrip upon sitting down. Also the sweet shrimp heads! DELICIOUS!!!! 

Also if you like Ponzu sauce, and if don't I hope you have nightmares, you'll love the Albacore, Garlic Tuna, and Yellowtail Collar. That right there should be enough for ya. 

Realize also get your Miso soup (if don't finish it you can hid rice in it...shhhh!) And some steamed gyoza. Because you have too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! We have been going here for about 4 years (since we moved to this side of town). The staff had always been very friendly and helpful. The owner in particular is very nice and remembers us every time we come in and actually tries to get to know us. The food is delicious, especially for the price. We bring all our friends and family who come to visit here. Only downside is that the location is a bit small and gets quite busy on the weekends but thankfully pick up orders are never a problem! Totally recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to say that this is the 2nd time I came and ate here and am just writing a review...I left yet again with a very full and happy belly.

The sushi is always fresh, my favorites are the Andy, the tuna is so fresh and it is a light creamy roll, loving the tuna poke and  the moment and then I order the dynamite for dessert as it is sweet and creamy.

Usually there is await so I suggest take whatever is available, bar or table...and don't be afraid to ask any of the staff for help because they seem to work as a team and that way you aren't ever waiting long for anything."}
{"text":"I love AYCE and this place does it perfect.  The food typically will come out quick, the fish tastes fresh even on weekdays.  Lunch at $21.95 is the perfect price and I'm sure I usually will eat WELL above that amount.  I want to give a long drawn out review of here but truly it doesn't need it.  I'm not a huge \"roll\" person but their Lemon Roll almost tastes like desert to me, the citrus kick you get at the end of it, just is a nice refreshing flavor to finish off a meal of WAY too much food."}
{"text":"This place has a large variety of specialty rolls. We tried half orders of most of the ones with tuna and crab (our favorite kind). The one that stood out was the 911 roll. It was spicy! Great flavor but took us a little by surprise. Try the spider roll also. 

Time limit is 60 min for AYCE but we went a little over and they didn't mind. We were busy talking so the understood. We only reordered once for more food and then of course for dessert. Service was really attentive."}
{"text":"OK.

I went back to Sushi Mon on Monday, and after the service issues I had before, I was very nervous.

Let me just say that my faith has been restored.

The fish was still wonderful, as it always is, but the big improvment for me was the service.

We sat at the bar, and the place was packed.  Our chef was Tony, who was an absolute pleasure.  

We had servers stopping by filling up our water glasses, asking if we wanted anything off the menu with the AYCE.  Everyone was polite and VERY quick.  

No more waiting for 20 minutes for our check!  

Also, they finally updated the website and took down the All you can drink ad that was up there forever.  
I'm a little upset that they still have not replied to the emails I sent them about that, but...it is what it is. 

I feel much better about going to this, my favorite All You Can Eat sushi restaurant since the service improved so much."}
{"text":"I had been craving sushi for a few weeks now...Thursday night after work, my fella decided that after cashing checks, we would hit up Sushi Mon. 
This location was closer to where we were, so rather than driving ALL the way over to the other location, we came over here.

In terms of service, it is hands down GREAT service.  I'd venture to say better than their other location, as I have NEVER had bad service here.   All of the servers were polite, and even joked around with us a few times.

There was one order of unagi that we ended up sending back, because it looked significantly less cooked/seared than the last 3 orders we had received.  The servers took it back with no problem, apologizing profusely, and asking if we wanted it prepared again.  They brought it back and it was perfect. 

Now for the fish!!

The quality of fish at the location, just like the Sahara location, is always good.  I've never had anything that was downright BAD, or off.  

This trip we had:

Super white:  my favourite of all time!!  It almost melts in your mouth. 
Unagi:  Yum.  We order this 4 orders (each order is 2 pieces) at a time
Cajun Albacore: Light spice, and very delcious
Ebi: perfect!
Sardines: These were on special, and I'm not a fan.  The texture was good, but there was a very fishy aromatic flavor that I'm not fond of.  Fella liked them. 
Negi-toro: weird texture, but good.  (blue fin tuna belly wrapped in seaweed.)
Conch: almost a lemon flavor...delicious.
Garlic tuna: My second favourite of the night.  SO flavorful!
Tako (octopus): My first time NOT having this in a salad.  It was surprisingly tender, and very good.

We also had fried gyoza (3 or 5 orders, or something like that), seaweed salad, and sake.  (Ok, I had a lot of sake.  It was delicious, I couldn't  help it.) 

I love the AYCE option here, as it includes anything off the appetizer menu, and also dessert.  

For dessert, I had the green tea creme brulee.  If you have NOT tried this yet, you must.  It is amazing.

All in all, Sushi Mon remains my favourite AYCE sushi place, and both locations are equally good."}
{"text":"I should give them one star for our most recent dinner.  Look, I don't necessarily look forward to bashing a business.  But I hate it when you pay good money and they provide you with crap.  I'm not talking about a $5.99 chinese buffet restaurant here.  It's pretty expensive.  So, based on my last visit and review of this place, why did I go back?  Because it was a cold rainy night in Vegas and this place was close by.  Believe me, I was looking on Yelp for another Japanese restaurant to try but couldn't find one w/ decent reviews.  The chicken cutlet was horrible.  It appeared to have been cooked once and then deep fried again just prior to serving.  The NY strip - menu describes it as \"...cooked to perfection\" -  actually it was \"overcooked to perfection\".  The thing was like cardboard.  Most of the dishes were pretty bad this visit, which I promise will be my last."}
{"text":"I called to check the dinner AYCE price for my 5yr old.  FULL PRICE!!!  Um, that's pretty ridiculous when many other places offer a discount or at least half price for kids.  Not sure I'll ever be eating here.  And all 4 of us eat at a lot of AYCE sushi places!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner, the Sushi was good, very friendly service,  clean, and cheap.
Recommended"}
{"text":"The sushi is not too bad for all you can eat but it's not great either.  It's better than Todai though.  They put too much sauce on most of the rolls.  And you only get 60 minutes to eat.  Are you kidding me?  I'm small but I can eat more than average girls.  I tried it a while ago and it didn't leave any impression so I tried it again and still nothing special.  Order 1/2 order so you can try the other rolls.  I like their grilled yellowtail collar and one other roll (incredible hulk roll??)  Their seared albacore, unagi and shrimp tempura were not bad.  Other than that........just average.  Don't get the uni..trust me..$27.99 for dinner (60 min).  Lunch is cheaper but you only get 45 minutes.  Service was great except for the cranky male host.  He was rude and he grabbed the menu from my hand when I was looking at it before I was seated.   \"Am I not supposed to see the menu?\"  He said \"yes you can see the menu\" Maybe he's having a bad day?"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in town. All of the sushi is fresh and taste amazing. I like sitting at the bar and watching the chef make all the sushi. I always get AYCE because I can't get enough of the sushi and end up leaving with a food baby. I love the miso soup to start me off and ending my mass consumption with tempura ice cream. It is hard for me to say there is one thing that is my favorite here. The only down fall is usually there is a wait before you are seated as it is so popular. But I am more than happy to wait with food this amazing."}
{"text":"The is my favorite AYCE sushi bar in town. The daily special board offers anyone some items not on their regular menu. One new special yesterday was Wasabi Crawfish and it was simply delicious. Mixed with tobiko, mayo and wasabi, it was a creamy mixture similar to their scallops or bay shrimp mix. Definitely should be a regular in their menu."}
{"text":"This location is not the same as Maryland location. Different owners. Ate here with my girlfriend. AYCE for dinner was $28.95 per person. Fish was not fresh. Quality not so good. The Maryland location is wayyy better. They're always busy so always fresh fish. My stomach was upset right after eating here. oh and desert not included in all you can eat:("}
{"text":"I absolutely adore sushi.  And no, I'm not snooty about my sushi.  I like nigiri along with sushi rolls.  If that makes me any less legit, so be it.  I love any roll with shrimp tempura and unagi sauce on it.  

Anyway, my friend told me about this place and it's an all you can eat (AYCE) sushi place.  (I only clarify AYCE because when I was reading reviews it took me a good half hour to figure out what it meant) So the bf and I went to get our sushi on and we were not disappointed.

You have an hour to eat all the sushi you can and trust me, it's enough.  We were seated at the sushi bar, always a good place to be, and we gave our orders directly to the head sushi chef. You can order any nigiri, rolls, they have specials on the walls, as well as anything from chicken teriyaki to shrimp tempura on their side menu.  I didn't wanna waste any time on anything but the sushi though.

One of the things I LOVE is that you can order half rolls, which was great because that way you can try more things without getting ridiculously full.  So my boyfriend and I dove in ordering some toro, sweet shrimp, yellowtail, and albacore.  It was all good.  I know you worry that all you can eat = poor quality, but that is not the case here.  They have great cuts of fish along with yummy rice.  Then we started experimenting with the rolls.  

I ate to the point where I almost needed to throw up.  I considered going to the bathroom and throwing up just so I could eat more. Then I resolved not to be bulimic and came back to the bar where my boyfriend was a trooper and managed to order dessert.  

I have to say, if I had only 1 meal in Vegas, I would spend it here.  I wish they had a sushi mon in LA, I'd probably get mercury poisoning from going everyday."}
{"text":"For the first time in 6 six years I have been to Sushimon, my bf and I did not do the AYCE! It was late after work and we decided we wanted something light, so we finally went to sushimon. We were really tempted to do the AYCE because they were running a lot of specials that night. But instead we got the tempura udon, s.s. dinner (with 12 pieces of sashimi), and a japanese lasgna. The dinner came with 3 pieces of tuna, hamachi belly, salmon, and red snapper, two salads, miso soup, and bowl of rice all for $13.99!! I think if you made your own nigiri with the rice and sashimi it would've been worth more then that price. Overall, we left stuffed and finally proved to my bf that we can leave sushimon with our bellies full and satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in Vegas! This place is clean friendly and yummy. Fresh sushi and fresh wasabi. Some of the best wasabi I've had! Great prices as well. Be sure to come early bc they stay busy!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was not impressed it smelled funky and decor looked old and boring, and servers  were eh, one of my friends had tried this place again recently and told me it was amazing! Because it was under new management, and I was hesitant but I trust her so we came here for lunch and it was amazing!!!! The salmon that I had  tried before was disgusting and now it was delicious! Whatever they are doing now they are doing it right! Keep it the way it is and I'll be a permanent customer"}
{"text":"First time visit, not impressed. The sushi rice was dry, no flavor and it fell apart as soon as you picked it up. The tempura was soggy and not hot so I'm lead to believe it's pre-cooked and not fresh. 
On a good side the chicken teriyaki was good and the service staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"RUN for the hills. Twice i've been here I've had food poisoning."}
{"text":"For an AYCE spot it is a must. Both Sushi Mon's are one of the best as far as AYCE goes. Also they get some stuff that the other guys do not and the chefs are awesome. Sit in front of Ben if you can."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! The server Zack wouldn't let me use the restroom because I technically wasn't a paying customer; even though they won't sit you down unless your party is all there. This is exactly what recently happened to Starbucks. I will never visit this location or any of their sister restaurants. Good job Zack, you are a great example of what's wrong with this nation."}
{"text":"My favorite all you can eat sushi restaurant in Las Vegas hands down.

Environment: The interior of the restaurant is not very big, but there are enough seating options that I rarely must wait a substantial amount of time to sit down even during peak hours. The sushi bar has more than enough spots but there are tables as well if you prefer that type of seating or if you are with a bigger group of people. Additionally, this restaurant has the same menu as Goyemon for those who want the same food but without the wait.

Food: This is where Sushi Mon can set itself aside from all the other all you can eat sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. They have THE best specials in town. The always have at least five different verities of special nigiri to try and each time I can try a type of fish I have never had before. Additionally, they have salmon belly and Bluefin tuna which are unlimited in orders which is great compared to most places which put a limit on such premium verities of fish. Additionally, the fish itself is always very fresh and the chefs are good about not skimping out on the cuts for the orders. Their selection of appetizers, rolls, and desserts also offer a fair amount of variety and I always leave full and happy

Service: Service is good as well as the chefs at the sushi bar make sure opt take our orders when necessary and the waiters are consistently checking up on guests to ensure that they have everything they need.

Overall I will be coming back here time and time again to satisfy my sushi craving!"}
{"text":"I miss this place! After living in Vegas for 6 years, it's truly one of the things I miss most. 
I used to go to Sushi on Rainbow when I lived on West Trop back in '99 and it was good. After I bought  a place in Silverado Ranch in '01, Sushi Mon opened up 6 months later and it was great. I believe it's Japanes owned and often the staff are foreign exchange students going to UNLV. 

The service has always been good, and the sushi a great value. Love the late night all-you-can-eat. Kind of funny how they have to over emphasize the \"rules\" of all you can eat, but I guess it comes with the territory.

I get back to Vegas 3-4 times a year and always make sure I have a car to visit Sush-Mon and the buffet and M Casino.

I have lived in Hawaii and now Seattle and I still think and crave Sushi-Mon in the desert of Vegas more often than the sushi establishments in these oceanside States."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you the greatest sushi I have ever had in my life. I lived on Japanese food for many years, but even I have to vouch for this place, despite its location in America, in the middle of the freakin' desert of all places.

When I say this, I am talking about the quality of the food, the system of pricing, and the accessibility of the restaurant itself. Everything is to the advantage of the customer, which makes me wonder how this place stays in business.

First of all, quality. I don't know how they manage to keep the raw fish that fresh this far inland, but they make it work. The fish tastes like it was caught that morning. The fact that they make everything to order and slice the fish in front of you certainly guarantees a product right at the threshold of optimal quality. I ordered from all over the menu, but after a couple bites of the salmon nigiri, I have to say that this is my favorite. It's a real basic menu item that was exceptionally tasty and needed little or no soy sauce to enjoy. The seared salmon is pretty good, too, in case you're in the mood for something a little more cooked, but definitely try the salmon.

Secondly, the price. Currently, the All-You-Can-Eat Lunch price is $21.95. Normally it ends up costing that much anyway for a full meal when you order over the counter for a fresh cut, so an all-you-can-eat for that price is pretty insane. There were a few things that I probably would have never ordered À la carte like the Mexican Rolls, but because I didn't have to worry about overspending on a gamble of taste, I was able to try an atypical variety of sushi adapted for the American palate. I never found anything I didn't like, however, and we probably tried a quarter of the menu over the course of two visits to the same Sushi Mon. Mind you, it is a big menu.

Lastly, the accessibility of the location. The Western Sahara Avenue location is far off the Las Vegas Strip, so it keeps the hoards of tourists away. On the two occasions my dad and I came here, parking was not an issue, and neither was seating. The only drawback is that for any all-you-can-eat order, you are restricted to a certain time limit. I suggest coming here on a weekday off-peak so that you can order without having to worry about long waits. When it gets busy, it can become difficult to flag down the sushi chef.

Whatever their secret is, I hope the same Sushi Mon will always be there whenever I visit Vegas (the last time I was here was in August of 2012). It tops my list of favorite restaurants and is certainly worthy of being my 100th establishment to review. Thank you, Sushi Mon!!

{"text":"the food is really not all that. plus, the service is HORRIBLE. came at midnight on a Saturday, decent amount of people in there. when we walked in, the hosts didnt notice us and for some reason sat the couple that came in after us, first?? so we had to sit ourselves....you'd think they'd apologize but nope. in the middle of eating one of the servers asked if we want anything else on the menu....in a very impolite way....no hospitality at all I felt like we were rushed to eat. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch during mid-week....about 2:45pm....and there was a 20 min wait...nuf said...food, presentation and service all very good"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousins who are Vegas locals.

They have an all you can eat time frame which was cool.  Waiters were attentive and food came out quick.

no complaints"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. And the sushi is amazing. But I'm giving this 3 stars only because of the new tables they've put in recently. They are now wider and I believe they've even added a table. At least if you sit at the bar you can lean to you friend to talk to them.So now basically you're sitting right next to strangers and I feel I can't talk with letting the adjacent guests know my business."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon was the best AYCE Sushi I've ever had. 

Fish quality was super fresh. 

Rice was not hard or dry as with other AYCE sushi places. 

My favorite was the lemon and salmon belly roll. So DELICIOUS, clean, and refreshing with the thin slice of lemon. I think I could eat this forever. 

Garlic edamame was also amazing. I've never had the edamame lightly blistered on the outside."}
{"text":"This is the usual go to spot in Vegas for AYCE imo. 

$26 for dinner & $21 for lunch. Quality is good with a lot of appetizers, desserts, nigiri, and so on to choose from. Not to mention all their special rolls as well for the AYCE menu. If you can eat a lot of sushi like I can, you can easily get your money's worth!

Location: Corner of a shopping complex with a lot of parking. Place is kinda small, but if you don't go during peak, you'll be fine. They have bar seating as well. Best part, they're open LATE! Vegas standards, 1AM isn't late, but for sushi/restaurant standards, it meets it amazingly.

Service: No issues with service. They were attentive, kind, and very quick to refill water and clean the table off.

This most recent trip, I just wasn't hungry enough to get my money's worth and ordered the S.S. combo. First time actually that I dined here without ordering the AYCE! Combo came with their salad, soup, and the main dish which included spicy tuna roll, 3 piece nigiri, and 7 piece sashimi for $16!

Overall: I'd say this is a great sushi spot outside of LA, where I live. For some reason, I always come to Vegas and crave sushi. If you're wanting AYCE, I would suggest this spot for sure. Def bang for your buck without the loss of quality."}
{"text":"I had the AYCE dinner which was ~30 on a thursday night. 

- Great variety. I enjoyed that I had the option of getting special rolls, baked rolls, hand rolls, nigiris, soups, appetizers and ice cream.
- Special rolls are average. Fuji's in Davis is better. Too much sauce. good \"meat\" to rice ratio. 
- Salmon nigiri was subpar. seemed thin and not fresh. Hamachi was tasty. 
- Service is friendly. I asked to watch the nba conference finals, and they changed it right away 

:)"}
{"text":"We were party of 4 and waiting for the last one to show up. They had free tables and we asked them if we can be seated. Host was very rude with us and without explaining anything, she said no we cannot be seated. We asked for a manager and he showed up couple mins later telling us that we cannot be seated because, if the last guy is late, we will keep eating more! What a cheap way of thinking!! They would rather keep us by the door, they do not have any seats for people waiting, than calculating that we would eat more...Sushi was okay, can eat anywhere else but the service was unacceptable."}
{"text":"First of all, I love sushi.  Feeding my bottomless pit a huge amount of sushi is beyond love.  After work, I'd work out at the gym across the street from here so I can feel not-so-guilty for over-eating.  

Though it's a small place, this is better than the one on Sahara.  They have fresher fish and better cuts.  Super white tuna!!!  Word of caution: eat super white tuna in moderation as they have a laxative effect.

If you're a lightweight or if you're not a huge sushi fan, they have a good regular menu.  By the way, Sushi Mon is on the 50 Must Eats in Las Vegas list."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok, service was ok, dessert was ok, nothing really memorable but I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch when most of the Japanese restaurants closed for day time on New Year's Eve.

They offer sushi buffet for lunch and dinner with pretty good selections. However, we didn't choose their buffet since we wanted some sashimi and hamachi karma. The fish was fresh and they did give us huge sizes on the sashimi. 

Overall, I think they are just an average level of Japanese restaurant, nothing has \"wow\"ed me but nothing bad. 

This is about 8-10 miles away from Las Vegas strip - kind of far."}
{"text":"Worste manager ever!! Went on a double date here and we walked in about 7pm on
a Sunday, we asked how long the wait was and he looked at us up
& down and said 2 hours! The place wasnt even packed. 

We were averaging about 3 times a week coming here so we asked to order food to go. In the order all we wanted  changed was instead of regular
Salads we wanted cucomber salads. The waitrsses ALWAYS do it for
Us with a small upcharge of $3. When the manager rang us up,
He tried charging us a extra $30!! We are not cheap what so ever, but the size of the salads can fit into the palm of 1 hand. We kindly explain to him that we never
Get charged that much. His answer \"no your lieing, we never do that!\" I told our friends \"f*ck this the food isn't worth this rude prick! & DEFINitly let's take our $$ elsewhere\"

No where is food good Enough for anyone to put up with DISRESPECTFUL people. My bf is a huge guy, this mother f**ker is so lucky he didn't pick up one of the bar stools and hit him over The head with it. WE WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN. 

If your looking for a AMAZING sushi spot where the cooks drink with you & are tons of fun go to SUMO SUSHI off warm springs & durango. They play all the top 40 hits & great hip hop :) they are never rude & the 25 min drive from our house is completely worth it :)"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight and there was a roach crawling on the sushi bar next to my friends plate. We told the waitress and she just looked at the counter and walked away. I am super grossed out and I won't be back. ever."}
{"text":"TO NIGIRI: this has to be one of my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant. I love the atmosphere here, it's a great place to hang with my fellow nigiri lovers. 
All the sushi chefs here are rockstars. Some are funny some are not. But they have a great sense of humor anyway.

Just bring your small group friends and give this place a try. The wait can be long during dinner and weekends. The bigger the party the longer the wait. But trust. They get chance."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good sushi place in town, and we found this place on Yelp...sounded good so my friends and I decided to try it.

Its a little far off the strip, about 8 miles, and when we got there around 8:30, we had to wait about 20 minutes.  It was worth the wait and drive tho!

We decided on their $29 all-you-can eat sushi and drink for 1 hour.  Usually I wouldn't consider an all-you-can eat sushi place, but the fish at the sushi bar looked pretty good.   Besides ordering Sushi, you can order their special rolls (Dragon Rolls, Spider Rolls, etc), hand rolls, side dishes (seaweed salad, miso soup, etc), and even green tea, red bean, or plum ice cream.   You can pretty much order any kind of sushi except for maybe some of the more expensive ones like Sweet Shrimp (ebi), and there's some items that you can order only 1 of, like Snow Crab Sushi, Saki Shooters, Fried Oyster and maybe a couple more.  Everything was very good and the fish was very fresh, almost melting in my mouth.  Probably the only thing I wouldn't recommend is the Yum Yum Scallop Sushi.  I love scallop sushi, but this was actually baked scallop with shredded imitation crab meat mixed with an orange colored mayo...wasn't that great in my opinion.  So other than that, the fish was great....salmon, albacore, tuna, etc., The Snow Crab and Fried Oyster were excellent, and even the ice cream was good.  And they didn't put huge blocks of rice with the fish to fill you up either :)

Service was excellent.  The japanese waitresses were very nice and prompt.  Sushi was served very fast and they didn't rush us out after an hour, even though they said there was an hour limit and we were stuffed by then anyway.  We easily ate over $200 in food (according to their a la carte prices). I was also happy to spend $38 on sushi rather than on a Vegas buffet.   I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for sushi in Las Vegas.  They also have a dinner menu so you don't have to order all-you-can eat if you don't want to."}
{"text":"Ate here the other day with my family and the service was horrible!!! Had a very rude server named JEFFREY. He kept rolling his eyes and mouthed \"oh my fucking God\" after we asked if we can order. Will not eat here again. The food wasn't even that good. I ordered the AYCE and the server hardly came to our table to take my order. VERY BAD SERVICE!!! Especially the server JEFFREY."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Mon after reading reviews that spoke highly of the sushi and service.  Maybe it was just the day we went, but the rolls all fell apart and did not seem to be made very well.  All of the rolls looked the same, and their was no presentation what so ever in how the sushi was displayed.  The rolls were small.  The fish barely hung over the rice on the sushi, and I have had better quality fish at other AYCE places in the past.  Perhaps I am a sushi snob. . . but I can't see paying for sushi that is not high quality.  The service was not what we expected either.  The waitresses forgot to put an order in twice.  We were there on a Saturday, but it was not busy. . . now I know why.  In my opinion, places like Sushi Mon give other AYCE sushi places a bad name.  I would not suggest Sushi Mon to my friends after our experience."}
{"text":"$22 lunch all you can eat? Even for a girl with a small appetite it was worth it. Even if you love the bushi Japanese restaurants and are used to dropping over a bill on some fish, this place is great for the value. The rolls are yum,fish isn't bad, and dessert is included!!! Only issue I had was that the spider roll was Stuffed silly with imitation crab on top of the soft shell...and were made the size of my fist...are you trying to max me out or what? No problem as I was not defeated!"}
{"text":"I used to satisfy my Niku Udon cravings at Shuseki but yesterday being desperate for food, I decided to give Sushi-Mon another try after my last encounter (did AYCE and found a hair in my food lol) 

I know last time, the curry dish wasn't too large of a portion and Bun got a tummy ache from the dinner specials we've stayed away for some time but yesterday it being 1am, we wanted actual food.

The Niku Udon sufficed what I was hoping for it to be, the portion was just alright. The broth wasn't bad but over time can leave a funny after taste. $9.95 was my meal before tax and tip.

I'll keep this place in mind when I need food and wouldn't like to drive so far it out - it is less than 5 minute drive from where I live... which means I can definitely walk there lol"}
{"text":"Went to this place coz I could not get a table at my fav sushi place on a Fri night. I love sushi and having had sushi all around vegas, I consider this to be the worst in vegas.

I firmly believe, I eat with my eyes first. So, if it looks appetizing, It makes me feel good.

- For starters, it was stuffed with rice.
- Size of few rolls were too big. It kept bouncing off of my mouth.
- Very unprofessional staff. Smile dammit!!! when food is ordered. Staff should be friendly even when they don't want to. U are a running a restaurant. So hire such people and make the guest feel invited.
- It gets worse now, I was sitting at the bar and some dude kept washing/cleaning the floor every 3 mins. I felt sick seeing a guy mop the floor while I was having food. This went on for the entire duration I was there.
-  Very disorganized. No system to track who ordered what. I was sitting at the bar, the chef could not remember my order multiple times. I was given 3-4 rolls that wasn't mine.
- Got a chance to peek at the back. The floor was covered with some white power that looked like flour.(Flour in a Sushi Bar?????) May be they think about cleaning the kitchen floor once in a while rather than cleaning the bar every 3 mins.
- Slightly overpriced, but I don't mind shelling out few extra bucks since I love sushi so much. But this place just Blows!!!

Bottom Line: I'll be back to this place only in their dreams and in my nightmares. I would rate it 0/5 but yelp wudnt let me :(

My recommendation:  Yama Sushi(Maryland Pkwy & Flamingo). This place is the best in Vegas. 100 bucks, you will keep coming back to this place for more. If you digg sashimi, definitely try \"Seafood Salad\". Its out of this world. Yummy :)))"}
{"text":"Love the food!  Love the crew!!! Hate the wait :-)"}
{"text":"This place had decent service I say that because they kind of forgot about our order at the end and then they didn't bring dessert for my son when he was done eating but him.  She said she thought she wait until all of us for dessert.  The service who have been perfect other than those two things.

They had blue fin tuna which was soooo good that alone gave them a 5 hen they had my favorite scallop and spider hand rolls.  We ordered all kinds of sushi look at our photos they were delicious you can't go wrong with anything here.

The ice cream and Mochi ice cream was yummy yum yum!!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Well I wouldn't know how it would taste because of how long we waited. 
The man at the front told us it was going to be a 40 minute wait, and we were definitely willing to wait, but once the clock went an hour and 15 minutes into our waiting time we decided it was ridiculous and left. Many workers came up to the front and didn't even acknowledge us. We thought from all the good reviews they would've offered us a glass of water or at least a \"sorry for the wait.\" It's a shame the people were so rude, I'm sure the food would've been great but unfortunately we won't be coming back due to the long wait time and rude people."}
{"text":"I am an AYCE beast that can demolish round after round of sushi, but I was not super impressed with anything in particular. Usually there are a few items that scream out to me to get seconds of, yet everything was just mediocre. 

The selection of nigiri had me reeling in uncertainty about what to order. I did find some of my usual items such as halibut, Cajun albacore, ika shiso, inari, red snapper, and a few others. Most of the fish were on the drier side. I did appreciate that they did not over sauce the fish to compensate for that. 

The service was spotty at times. When the girls were around, they took their time with our demands, but after the food was delivered it is difficult to find someone."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is a solid place for AYCE sushi, but not as creative as their new venture. Although some of the rolls are the same as Goyemon, Sushi Mon does not have the awesome appetizers and desserts that the other restaurant does. 

The quality of fish is the same, the service is better, but the variety is lacking. If you ignore these minor complaints, the difficulty in picking up the nigiri was the major problem of the night. The ones that had a sauce splashed on top fell apart too easily. Instead of drizzling it lightly on the fish, they put it directly on the rice which caused it to loosen up on contact. 

The rolls are nothing particularly special, so nigiri is definitely the way to go. The nice large pieces of fish placed on a proportionate piece of rice was perfection. 

I didn't know that they use the same stamp card as Goyemon, so if your waitress ask if you have a card give them that card. I looked at the one she gave me and asked if I could just get my Goyemon stamped, but they will not combine. Be prepared and just add on to your preexisting one."}
{"text":"My mom and stepdad's go to spot for AYCE Sushi. They always take me here when I'm in town visiting. This place is on the smaller side so expect a wait. It was December when we were stuck outside waiting. Luckily it wasn't too long and they did try to get the heater working outside. The food here is great! I'm always ordering tons of Salmon Belly Nigiri with lemon slices. I try to avoid the specialty rolls, I may order a \"half order\" and share. It's perfect if you only want 1 or 2 pieces."}
{"text":"This is by fair mine and hubby's favorite sushi spot. There is a huge selection of specialty rolls which makes it fun to try different things. I love the rolls with cream cheese! But the nigiri is soooo light and yummy. I don't know what the sauce they put on it but it is delicious. I would never go here and not do AYCI. It is $26.95 for dinner and I eat triple the amount of that so it is worth it! Even if you are super full at the end, you HAVE to try the mochi balls. Strawberry flavor is the best. I will always come back no matter what because the food is bomb. Sometimes it gets a little too busy and the servers are distracted and all over the place BUT they are always very friendly so it's understanding. Can't wait to come stuff myself again."}
{"text":"I still consider myself a sushi noob, but with the AYCE at Sushimon I'll be a pro in no time! Half-rolls so you can try new ones, chef specials with awesome names, very tasty fish, and the dessert was yum (tempura ice cream woohoo!). There cooked sides were kinda blah, but that might be because I was mesmerized by the sushi feast. Order as you go so you don't over-order and pay extra for what you don't eat. They're open super late (like 2am I believe) so, if like me, you crave your sushi at midnight this is the place to get your fix."}
{"text":"3.5 stars on this one.

Sushi and Japanese food here is decent, so I come here to get my Japanese food fix every once in a while.  I'm not sure why, but I think the food doesn't taste as fabulous as it used to, hence the 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The fish was fresh, however wait staff were the worst .  I had to ask for water to three different people and two of then twice.   I had all you can eat, I ordered the Tempura Shrimp and waited for twenty minutes I asked the wait staff four times, they said they would check they were not slammed with business.  After 27 minutes  I never got the shrimp I paid my bill and left.     Owen/boss didn't seemed to care!   I will not go back.  To many other sushi places to try.   They  failed me!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best AYCE sushi joints in town. I come here quite regularly when I have the taste for sushi. As soon as I sit down they have my drink order in front of me. The sushi is always fresh; never stale or slimy. Service from wait staff very prompt. Sushi chefs are very good at their craft to say the least.

If you come after 5pm prepare to wait for a seat. The place is always jammed with people. Several times I simply could not get in."}
{"text":"There are so many AYCE sushi places in Vegas and quite a few of them are VERY good.  Sushi Mon might not be as pretty, spacious, or friendly as some of the other spots around town but they definitely come through on the food.  Especially the specials.  The other night they had an amazing sashimi salad on the AYCE specials board.  The Striped Jack was so tasty and definitely not something you find at most of the AYCE places around town.  They had salmon belly and yellowtail belly on the specials board too.  AYCE Salmon Belly?  So yummy!!!  The nigiri was all fresh and flavorful.  I really like that they don't go heavy on the sauces that mask the fish flavors.  
Another favorite is their Salmon Collar.  A lot of places around town over cook their collar.  Sushi Mon's is always moist, lightly charred, and absolutely delicious!

They don't have a lot of dessert options but then I never have any space left.  And depending on what time you go, there may be a long wait.  We got there at 6pm on Friday and had a half hour wait, people who came just after us were told the wait was going on an hour.  Still, I give them 5 stars, and we drive past three other really good AYCE options on the way here."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I frequent this fine establishment at least once a week. The lunch time hours are usually very busy, but the numerous sushi chefs crank out the rolls as fast as you can order them. The volcano roll is one of my favorites, but I haven't had a bad roll from this place. The staff is very friendly and extremely attentive."}
{"text":"Great service awesome variety. I'm a picky guy and they met all my needs will and hey it's my birthday thanks for everything Staff!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. We try to go once a week. Everything is fresh & the service is quick. Only con would be the dinner wait time. Have waited 45 min before, sucks but totally worth it! For all that we eat, the price is right!! Rainbow roll is a fav."}
{"text":"This used to b my all time favorite sushi spot don't get me wrong everything they have to offer is great from the food to service ... But I'm disappointed only to fine this place on dirty dinning with a c grade after what I saw on the show dirty dinning I don't think I'll b eating here anymore even if they got there A grade back ...."}
{"text":"For the price, I was surprised by the great variety that Sushi Mon offered! Unlike other AYCE sushi restaurants, Sushi Mon had great quality rolls, each with a unique quality! You can opt to not do AYCE, but I think it's a great value, esp for the lunch pricez

They have a lot of different sushi that you can get too, and the fish to rice ratio isnt bad at all. The sushi tasted pretty fresh, and I had no complaints of any of the fish. All the rolls there were pretty great too. Cant remember the names of the rolls... But I really enjoyed them all! (Check out my photos!)

The service was quite fast, which I appreciated. Sushi Mon is located in a huge plaza, and parking is no problem. 


They also have dessert as part of AYCE so leave some room! Will probably be back when Im in the area again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We probably go here 1-2 times per month.  We have been to nearly every ayce sushi restaurant in town and this is a definite favorite.  They have great fish and portions, particularly for ayce. The fish is always fresh and served in generous portions in relation to rice.  Chef Mike is the best and makes a killer Tekka Maki. The volcano roll and steamed gyoza are also excellent.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"All you can eat is best deal in Las Vegas. I've been here many time,but I never had bad experience here.Good sushi,good service and reasonable price.They are always busy,but it's worth to wait."}
{"text":"Aww man, I am the luckiest man alive! I went to Sushi-Mon for all-you-can-eat with two lovely ladies that do not eat Toro, Amaebi, or Uni! So I had their servings (limit of two pieces per person of the special items) and boooyyyyyy was it deeee-licious! 

Just a heads up, the Sake Shooter has a quail egg in there. Kinda caught me off guard. lol

Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is what I usually get in order to maximize the $26 all-you-can-eat price:

-Sweet shrimp (limit one per customer at $7 a plate, so it must be good!)
- 10 orders of their shrimp tempura. One order equals two pieces at about $4 an order. Their tempura has the perfect texture---crunchy goodness! My boyfriend orders this much just to take advantage of it.
- 3 orders of each Nigiri: Yellow Tail and Salmon, and Mackerel (I love raw stuff, and rolls fill me up, so I usually stick with the Nigiri
- Sherbert: LYCHEE!!!
- Strawberry Mochi!!!
- Hot green tea (it helps with the digestion which means I can eat more. Yes, I'm hardcore)

Tip: Go with friends so you can sample everything on the menu without having to pay a fee for not finishing your food. YOU MUST try the Lychee Sherbert. If you don't have room, buy one to share."}
{"text":"Sushi Mon is my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas by far! The service is amazing and the food is even better. I love their philly roll!"}
{"text":"First thing first. Same owner as goyemon which explains why the menu is the same, but it's less crowded. I thought the food was delicious and the service was spectacular. I called several times for a table for 10 and they stuck to their policy and wouldn't put our name on the list. It worked out fine and we only had to wait 20 minutes. They are strict to their no sharing policy but are fine with letting some people order a la carte and others ordering all you can eat. It works out perfect if you have light or finicky eaters. I would definitely come back here! Delicious for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat light and came in before heading to the airport. service was quick and attentive and with AC it's the perfect escape from the hot Vegas weather. I thought the food was just ok. I ordered the special bento with teriyaki chicken and California rolls. The teriyaki chicken tasted like it was pre-cooked and then combined with the sauce. The taste was ok, but definitely not the teriyaki I would eat again. My bf had some sashimi and another role and the fish was definitely not fresh. My lunch experience was ok overall and I think I would skip this place if I have a craving for some Japanese food."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Mon for their nigiri sushi specials such as toro and salmon belly which I don't find all the time at other AYCE sushi restaurants! The medium toro and salmon belly are just so deliciously fresh and melt in your mouth. They're not always on the menu though so be aware of that and if it is, it might be limited to one order/person. The other nigiri sushi like salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna have been my other favorites as well. 

I love getting edamame and shrimp tempura here since it's pretty fresh but I've tried the takoyaki and fried gyoza and was disappointed by how soft and full of dough they were. 

As for rolls, the selection is smaller than other AYCE sushi places unfortunately. The only roll that really stood out to me was the Lemon roll which had yellowtail and salmon with sliced lemon on the top to combine the flavors. 

For desserts, you can pick more than one! The mochi ice cream is pretty good. I also love the specials they have for desserts - I recently got mango mochi ice cream and yuzu ice cream which were both delicious! 

Sushi Mon's AYCE price at $26.95 is great for the quality of nigiri sushi and fun diversity of daily specials but I still wish there were more selection for the appetizers and rolls!"}
{"text":"new owners, maybe? after my second experience of poor service and mediocre selection of fish.. i'll be parting ways with sushi mon."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and browsing to find my new go to sushi spot with my fiancé. We came in a week ago and were seated right away. Its a small location but it works. Unfortunately i wont be returning there was only one roll that actually stood out with amazing flavor, everything else had mild to zero flavor. Granted its sushi but some places tend to bring the flavor. There fried rolls weren't to our liking at all, the color seemed as if the oil may have been old and being we both felt very sick at the end of our evening and into the following days im for certain it was. Service is okay, and clean location. On to the next sushi place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a staple for sushi lovers, including myself, for a long time. I've been coming here for AYCE only so I can't speak much for the regular menu. But I can say their AYCE has always been solid and consistent which is why it seems to be always busy and which is why your service may take a hit. Be prepared to wait to be seated in the small restaurant during peak hours and to occasionally wait for your server or sushi chef during your meal because they are tied up.

They have extended hours for the late night cravings. For the novice sushi eaters, there are plenty of pictures on the menu to aid you. If you're sitting at the bar, the chefs are more than willing to answer any questions or fill any requests. Keep your eye on the chalkboard for any specials also.

This last visit I sat at the sushi bar just after opening on a Saturday and had a solid meal of appetizers and nigiri. The chef was busy but made sure my meal was flowing smoothly. I didn't get any rolls as all of the 30 pieces of nigiri were delicious and enough to satisfy me. They had two clam specials: Asari rayu and orange clam (I took pictures of both but they were pretty crappy so I didn't post them) which both had oil and sauce respectively that elevated the clam which is something I normally don't order.

Sushi Mon is not head and shoulders above the rest and they're location is not convenient for me. I am still a fan though and will continue to frequent there but it will most likely be only late night, or if I happen to be driving in the area and the wait looks reasonable."}
{"text":"Had the all-you-can-eat. Service was fast, the salmon belly was excellent, though the regular salmon nigiri was so so. They have punch cards so if you come in lots you get a free all-you-can-eat. The salmon tail collar was a little dry. everything else was great."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, the all you can eat sushi is the bomb! The Hurricane was sooo good"}
{"text":"pretty decent sushi place. recently came here on a tip from a local friend. love the all you and eat :D
we had a party of 6 and ended up ordering 6 orders of uni and sweet shrimp (the most expensive stuff on the menu hahhaha)  i didn't really like the uni all that much though some of the rolls were excellent :D"}
{"text":"would rank them at 1/2 of a star if possible
was eating there last night with a party of 7 folks.. food was ok and as we were getting our last round of sushi out we saw a cock roach walk by on the floor.  when we pointed this out to the waitress she did not seem surprised at all, on top of that she made no effort to get rid of it or kill it.  her and the manager decided to offer our table a free plate of desserts ( 4 mochi balls to a table of 7 people )  to shut us up about the roach.  when i went to pay the bill and speak with the manager he informed me that he was sorry that i saw a spyder.  i explained to him that i know the difference between a cock roach and a spyder and he spent 2 minutes arguing with me about what kind of bug it was ( mind you he didnt see it ) he refused to accept that this was a spyder and he also told me that i was lucky to get the free dessert as a Consolation for the spyder ( when in fact this was a cock roach ) very poor service and a very poor way to handle a cock roach infestation in thier food establishment, will never go back here again"}
{"text":"This is one of the better places (if not the best place) in Las Vegas for all-you-can-eat sushi, and I eat here most of the time when I want sushi.  The fish has always been consistently fresh and good over about a dozen visits for both dinner and lunch, generally a step above, say, Kabuki, but not as good as, say, Sushi Gen in Los Angeles.

About $24 (lunch) to $28 (dinner) gets you an hour to order from an extensive menu of sushi basics, a wide variety of rolls, and non-sushi items like seaweed salad, baked green mussels, chicken skewers, and fried oysters.  Beverages not included, so add a couple bucks more for that, plus tax and tip.

Service here is generally good, with everyone friendly.  It does get a little crowded on some nights, so if you go for dinner, be prepared for a bit of a wait as they don't have a ton of seating.

Tip: Rolls can be ordered as half-orders, giving you more room to try different things!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints :) always looking forward to this place when we fly in from Hawaii, and it's the guaranteed spot to go to on our list :) and the people remember us :)

Every time we went there we had great service :) this last time we went was the first time they got out orders wrong lol, we ordered Hamachi nigiri, but instead the lady brought us Hamachi collar x) wasn't a bad thing, cause we decided to just eat it, and now we have another favorite on the menu to order haha :D

Everyone should come here atleast once :) and you'll be coming back again and again for more ^_^

Thanks again Sushi Mon!!! See you guys again next year! :)"}
{"text":"Worst sushi place I have ever been to! Don't get me wrong, the food was good..but that's nothing if the service is terrible. The guy waiter that sat us down didn't even come back to check up on us. He didn't even take our order!! We had to order from the sushi bar. But even the guys at the sushi bar weren't very helpful. We had to get their attention to get something else..and they were standing RIGHT in front of us. It seemed like they were only paying attention to the tables with more than 2 people. Def not going back."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE but the only thing that knocks off a star is that the wait for this place can be ridiculous and they don't take reservations. I've waited and been happy with it, but it still sucks to wait over an hour for your delicious sushi. 

On the plus side, this place has so many rolls and they do a great job mixing and matching the different fish options and the sauces. They also do specials that have proven to be pretty incredible (check out the posted specials on signs throughout the restaurant). It's pretty tiny in there and it does get a little cramped at your table with your 10,000 lbs of AYCE deliciousness. 

As a HUGE bonus (wish I could give extra half stars!), dessert and appetizers are also AYCE so you can have as many mochi as your little heart desires. I once had a friend who came in and ordered ONLY mochi (no fish!) for the whole meal. No a lot of places can get away with that :) Also, they're open pretty late, so when the hunger strikes, you can get your sushi on. 

Favorite rolls include: Super white tuna (BEST EVER), Lasagna Roll, Crispy Rice Roll, J.J. Roll, Pastel, Rock n Roll, and the Moment Roll."}
{"text":"Friend and I are visiting Vegas for the first time. When we arrived, we both knew that buffet style was in our minds. He said \"you like sushi?\" 'My response was \"only if it's AYCE or cheap.\" Sushi Mon meets both of these criteria. But, the best part, is that it's fresh and delicious! Some buffet style sushi can taste cheap but not Sushi Mon. We had a magical experience and left hoot with our bill. Pro-Tip #1: Don't drink carbonated beverages. Straight water will get you the bang for your buck.  Pro-Tip #2: Order the Chubby and Volcano rolls. Amazing."}
{"text":"I used to love sushimon, but after the incident that happened the other night, I will never ever go back. My husband and I decided we wanted to have some sushi at around 930 on a Friday night. We go in and the hostess tells us there's a 45 min wait although there is one large table that's open (with a reservation). So we decide, alright, let's just take it to go. We order a few sashimi, a screaming orgasm, and 4 rolls, which came out to 80 bucks! I seriously contemplate just waiting the 45 min and having all you can eat for about $50 plus tip for the two of us. 

15-20 min later, they pack up our stuff and we drive home. We get home and they give us one roll that's the wrong order and then they're missing 2. So we give them a call, they say they have the food at the counter...we don't live a minute down the street so my husband asks the manager if he can just refund us what the two rolls cost. They offer to give him a 26 dollar credit the next time we go, + another $13 and not a refund. My husband insisted that we wanted the refund and they made him drive back instead of just putting it back on his card. So he goes there and gets the refund...and, I would think for the trouble, they would just give us the two rolls we originally ordered but forgot. Nope. What horrible customer service. Even though the sushi was fine and it's the closest sushi restaurant to our place, I won't ever go back. Ugh!"}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly and accurate. The all you can eat is great as you can try different sushi's. The food was great and of course the mochi ice cream at the end tops it off great."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed with Sushi Mon tonight. My boyfriend and I ordered takeout again and we got our usual but this time I also got the chicken teriyaki. I couldn't wait to get it home since I was starving.

We ate the sushi first and that was good like always. Next came the chicken teriyaki... everything was fine until I got to the last piece of chicken. It had a bone in it and I bit down hard on it and I felt the pain in my tooth. I immediately spit it out and ran to the bathroom mirror. I didn't see any damage but I can still feel a slight pain. 

I just hope they are more careful in the future. I will continue to get take out from there but I think I'll just stick with the sushi rolls.

I would have given them four stars but I deducted one star for the chicken bone."}
{"text":"What can i say... Other than.. Be prepared to leave in a self inflicted Sushi and wasabi Coma... $28 for the all you can eat buffet, Made as you order, this is not the pre made sushi sitting on a tray on a bed of ice. THis is legit, you order they roll and you eat. You can also order sides like teriyaki chicken and the other normal items. I am a sushi lover so i say bring it on.. You roll it, ill eat it.... The word Roll seems to be coming up alot in this review, maybe because when your done eating this is exaclty what you will be doing......Rolling out the door. Thumbs up to Shushi mon. Be prepared for a wait, the building holds about 60 people or so and it fills up nightly."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years its close to my house and the staff is friendly. Its a good place for sushi and the prices are reasonable.))) this was my review a month ago. Two days ago my father went to pick up some rolls and sushi and the staff was very rude to him ( he had a stroke few years ago his speech is not perfect) they were very rude. The food on the other hand went from 9 - 3 real quick after the management changed.  Not fresh tasted bad ... the rolls were so bad it was like vending machine food. You can get better sushi n rolls from Smiths. such a let down."}
{"text":"Best place to come in Vegas for all you can eat!! I love coming here , and the staff is amazing !"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon definitely lives up to its hype. A couple of friends recommended this place to me as a must stop in Vegas. I was reassured this is the place to be as soon as I heard Japanese coming from the chefs.  Can't get more authentic than that, right? 

We came in right at opening 11:45am, even skipped breakfast to make sure we have plenty of room for the raw fish. There were only a couple of others waiting anxiously for them to open up. We had the option of sitting at the bar or table, went with the latter to accommodate our group of 4. Our server came up immediately to get our drinks started. We decided to go with the AYCE sushi. You can't go wrong paying 21.95 for good quality fish.  I decided to start off with the salmon belly, which was melt-in-your-mouth good.  I would highly recommend getting this belly if you see it on their special menu. They ran out in just 10 minutes.  Everything else was delicious and fresh!

Restaurant filled up quickly but there wasn't much of a wait until we left the restaurant around 1. I was also worried at the 45 minute time limit they have posted everywhere. How can anyone eat in 45 minutes when you have to wait for your food every time you put an order in? But luckily this rule was not enforced.  I noticed that there are plenty of people ordering from the lunch menu.  That's something I'd consider if I were a local. But since I'm not, I had to take advantage of the all you can eat menu.  

Another huge plus of this restaurant is the insane 2 am closing time. I don't think I'd crave raw fish past midnight, but Vegas never sleeps, right? There is another location closer to the strip on Sahara. I accidentally came to this location because it came up on my Yelp search. But my local friend said that the other location is the original restaurant, and can get more crowded.  I'd have to check out the other one on my next trip.  I highly recommend this place! Friendly staff + reasonable price + great food = one happy returning customer!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi and quite a variety to choose from. I usually order nigiri, including ikura (salmon roe) and if ikura isn't fresh, it's disgusting. Theirs has always been fresh, as is the fish. They've never made a mistake with my carryout orders and the place is always hopping in the evenings so it's too crowded inside to wait for your order or a table.  People wait at the tables and chairs outside the building.  If you're from Vegas the heat doesn't feel so bad, but tourists will probably think it's too hot to wait outside."}
{"text":"For once, I chose to sit at the sushi bar rather than a table, since it seemed like the main highlight of the restaurant was to sit at the bar (bar took up most of the space). Skeptic to sit at the bar due to my unpleasant, first experience at Hikari, I was surprised to find that there are sushi chefs out there at AYCE places that attentively listen, can figure when you're ready to order again, and make the orders at a quick pace. Thumbs up to the sushi chefs. Their cuts were clean, thick, and perhaps even overpowering compared to the rice. 

Sushi Mon's menu is actually quite large in comparison to other AYCE places, specifically their specials menu. I was pleasantly surprised to find Takoyaki on the Appetizers section; that's something you don't usually see nowadays. They also had AYCE Salmon Belly which got me screaming inside with pure joy! Bless! You can also customize your sushi when you talk to the chef. I appreciated the fact that he let me go rice-less with my tamago. There aren't many places that do that for you. For some nigiri such as the scallops, I even added yum yum sauce just for the heck of it. You know, try new things. 

I would love to give this place the 5 stars that they deserve, but this sushi joint has one major downfall. 

The waiters. 

Super inattentive. It seems that whenever I need something from them (water, appetizers, dessert, the BILL), they're just never there. I had to literally hawk my eyes around the restaurant for the first available waiter to tell him my order before he goes back hiding in the kitchen. Several male waiters just kept walking to and from the kitchen, ignoring customers like me that needed assistance, even as I raised my voice and kept saying \"excuse me!\" 

However, it seems that for their friends that visited for the evening, their needs are met whenever they ask. There was literally a waiter right next to me that just kept ignoring my requests as his attention was on his friend who happened to be sitting right next to my group at the bar. Thanks for the service. I guess. 

Despite the hiccups with the restaurant's waiters, the food here is still solid enough to get me to come back. That is, after I finish my checklist of other AYCE sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"So I was in town late on a Monday night for a car show (SEMA) in Vegas. So I checked yelp for some all you can eat sushi that was off the strip. FYI I'm from so. cali and my fav all you can eat sushi places are Tadashi, Midori's, Riptide. 

I have to say their poke bowl was good, salmon sushi, and yellowtail passed. When it came to the albacore it was pretty bad. It was soggy and mushy not good at all. Their scallops were pretty bland and not very large. 

I liked their rolls, hard to fail on rolls because you have other ingredients to offset the quality of cut fish. 

Their Miso soup was good and I finished off with green tea ice cream. But sorry I can't spend $30 bucks for a place thats mediocre. Infact I thought the salmon and tuna at the Bellagio buffet was much much satisfying."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite, my brother and I have filled our AYCE cards a couple of times. (Eat ten times get one free!) I love the lemon roll, Sexy girl, ecstasy, and hurricane rolls. The dragon roll is also good, and the super white tuna is to die for, buttery and smooth."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi buffet I've been to out here.  The quality of the fish is outstanding.  The fact that you get 2 pieces of toro, amaebi and uni as part of it already makes it worth it.  We sat at the bar and chatted it up w/ our sushi chef, Nobu, who was awesome and made a couple of interesting pieces of sushi and rolls..guess it helps having a Japanese wife!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place to date!! too bad I live miles and miles away T_T !!

I first came here with a group of friends for a birthday. Two in our group were locals and took us to sushi mon. Its a small place but worth the wait and the money.  That time I secretly shared the sushi with a friend and it was soooo good!!

Second time I was there (around August) we ate at sushimon for dinner our first night there and I wasn't disapointed! We sat right at the sushi bar and ordered all the sushi we can ever want~ My friend tried the uni (the urchin) and dispite its poop looking apearence she said it was pretty good. I loved the shrimp shushi and the sauce they put on most of their rolls were very flavorful! I ate my money's worth! 

I recomend after you eat, go to the restaurant that is behind it. I forgot the name of it but its a restaurant and karaoke place. Their karaoke is fairly priced and they have so many songs to choose from.  The rooms are very pretty too! I wish my bedroom looked like it! pretty decorations and atmosphere!!~"}
{"text":"Been eating hear since '04 .. Used to get mad at the all-u-can eat and they'd get mad if your baby ate and tell u no... Well the kids 8 now and we usually get take out anyway.. Only had a problem once and they fixed it .. Now big deal.. Nice staff good prices and good sushi. Spouse is Japanese and sushi mon gets the approval for good sushi! 
Oh and they have a sushi bar and usually a game on especially Monday night football."}
{"text":"dragged husband here one night as they had other items for him to eat, since he doesn't eat sushi.  I was too scared to get the AYCE because of the pressure to finish every bit of sushi including the rice, I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it all, so I ordered the super salmon roll and the pixie roll.  Loved the super salmon roll but I wished it had some avocado and cucumber in it along with the salmon for extra flavor.  Fish tasted extremely fresh.  I was not crazy about the pixie roll, as I was not a fan of that yum yum creamy shrimp.  This, plus the soy paper made the roll a bit too sweet for my tastes.

We also had the teriyaki chicken and fried oyster appetizers, the teriyaki chicken was tasty but I liked the chicken better at Yummy.  The oysters were fresh and tasted good but the thick sauce it comes with was not that great.

Giving this four stars because the fish tasted so fresh and the food came out insanely quick.  And, they are only a few minutes from the house.  I'd go here again maybe when i'm ready to try AYCE.  I also liked how they didn't restrict the menu when you order all you can eat, you just get whatever you want.  When I did it at KA on green valley parkway, they kept coming back telling me I had to pick something else."}
{"text":"Ok, so I said that I was gonna boycott Sushi Mon, but this location had much better customer service than the one on Silverado and Maryland. Service was fast and friendly, down to the servers clearing our used plates to refilling our drinks. AYCE is the way to go! I'd drive here for sushi and the good service than going to their other location!"}
{"text":"Okay so it's been a while now since I ate here at Sushi Mon AYCE. Now I remember why I stopped coming here! Majority of my friends have boycotted this establishment all together! Customer service here is just bad! Came here at about 10ish at night on a Thursday to meet up with my brothers. As soon as I walked through the door and was about to sit down, my brother said that the male servers already had given them a hard time. It was originally just my brothers that were  gonna have sushi and they invited me to join them. They told the guy server that they were adding one more person and the server said \"why didn't you tell me earlier that you were adding on more person?!\" My brothers then replied telling him that \"I just literally got off the phone and it wasn't even planned!\" So the server moved my brothers to a bigger table. (Strike one!) 

So they ordered 5mins prior to my arrival. And the server took my order as well. The first two orders came on and the other male server just dropped it down on our table like he was sorta throwing it towards us and told us what it was. He also had an order for the table next to us and he placed their order nicely on their table and explaining nicely to them what their order was. (Strike two!!)

The rest of food came and ate, ordered more trying to pace ourselves. The thing that bothered us also was that it took awhile for the server(s) to come take our orders and clean the plates off and refill our water. And it wasn't even that busy. (Strike three!)

All in all our experience there was terrible. Don't get me wrong but the food was good and the service sucked! The only one we thought was decent was the one female server. I think it's time for me to boycott this place too! I don't think I'll ever return!"}
{"text":"This place gets crowded but they get you in quick and service is very fast! My husband and I did the all you can eat.... well we ended up eating only 5 rolls plus a dessert and spent $70 ... we could have just ordered 5 rolls and spent way less money....... though the sushi was pretty good but very filling ! If I go back I would just order a few rolls .... the staff was  very nice"}
{"text":"The service, food, and prices are exceptional! Anyone that comes in town, I demand we get sushi to come here. As any great restaurant should, there is a bit of a wait if you arrive during prime dinner time. But its worth every minute. Once you've been seated the service and food come quick! 
I have tried a number of rolls and have yet to find one I didn't like! Don't be naive to the vegetable rolls!! The avocado and asparagus roll is the perfect complement to a spicy, fish-filled one! A few other favorites include the shrimp tempura, edamame, and fried calamari. 
They do have an all you can eat option. Although, I have left every visit stuffed and have not yet paid for the AYCE and have still spent less than it costs! Let your appetite and wallet be the judge."}
{"text":"Came here with my family the other night for a late night dinner and had the server Jeffery. I must say this was by far the worst customer service I've ever received. My family tried to order and for some reason he gave us attitude, kept rolling his eyes, and mouthed \"oh my fucking god\". Whoever is the Owner or Manager of this restaurant I would think twice keeping Jeffery on staff if you want business."}
{"text":"Rules for ALL YOU CAN EAT: never ever drink soup or eat rice!  THESE ARE FILLERS...FILLERS!! AND ONLY WASTE YOUR STOMACH SPACE!  COME TO BUFFETS HYDRATED so you don't have to drink much water either!  I know.. nutrition professional and I'm telling you this..hahaha

Story time: The places opens at 11:45 AM and because a group takes forever to get ready, instead of individuals, we left at 12 PM and got there about 12:15 PM.  BIG MISTAKE!  The rush had already gone through. NOO!  As a result, we had a 40-minute wait.  After meeting with mama-san at Tokyo Discount, we came back in dismay as we had to wait another 30-40 min. Waiting in the sun,..dear god it's winter and I am sweating?  WE'RE STARVVING!  On our death beds, hypoglycemia status..and all I could think about are my sugar levels.  Where is an emergency glucose pill when you need it? After all was done, said, and eaten..i left with gochi o sama deshita!  hontoni, sugoku oishiikatta desu!  The Japanese owner was impressed that I could speak Japanese!  

Synopsis: One word, white tuna sushi!  PURE HEAVEN!  It's like buttaahhhhhhhh without the clogging-feeling aftermath.  I literally came in my pants, no joke.  I came here with all the Vegas crew i met through my BFF.  In total, 8 of us.  The horror beginning of it all, was that we waited more than an hour, and the way they made us wait was horrific, but even with that said, the $28 bucks we spent (18% tip including), was more than worth it.  Hence, 5 stars!  I'm certain their revenue has hit the negative due to our cow-like stomachs.  Would I come here?  HELL YES!!!  Mmm.I can't wait to come back and have Sushi Mon on the side as a bonus feature!

Employees:  If you can speak Japanese, they will be impressed, especially if you don't look like your Japanese (usually I am told I look Japanese, but being with all Filipinos...it didn't seem so). The lady smiled at me and the cute guy I was with, Keifer, was also impressed. Sumimasen, Atarashi pureto onegaishimasu!  Although the guy who served us didn't have a happy smile on his face.  I totally disregarded that because I was beyond starvation to care.  More to that, our table was demanding because we were ordering like everything on the menu times 5!  Hahaha..  Although in the end, the guy was rude.  After I got my sugar levels back to normal, service seemed to matter more.  He said, \"because there are a lot of people waiting, we need to as you to leave\" even though our EXTRA round of desserts haven't made it to our table.  RUDE!  Too bad, I put the tip in before he said it.  Otherwise, it would have certainly been 10!!!  not to mention...WE WERE WAITING FOR HEIFERS BEFORE THIS TO FINISH EATING!  And their BMIs were about 35...and there were FOUR of them.  RUDE!

Parking: Very easy!  I love Vegas for this.  It's not like Hawai'i, where you have to hunt for excruciating amount of time to visit your favorite restaurant.  Although, compared to how many people were there, to the amount of parking, it seemed unjustified and misleading.  Lots of parking, not enough space in the restaurant.  Womp, womp!

Cost: For all you can eat, $28 including 18% tip, amazing.  I'm positive we ate the restaurant in the negatives.  I can safely say, each of us ate about $100 worth of food

Food: Where do I even begin!  I didn't care what the names were, they all went into my tummy!  1, 2, 3...Houdini tricks!  All gone in one fell swoop!  Although, the most eye-back rolling, pants creaming goodness was the white tuna.  OMG  Just thinking about it makes me drool with delight.  I honestly hope the next guy I date tastes this good!  My second favorite were the clams soaking in a cheese sauce?  UGH!  OMG!  It was a burst of smooth creamy lovely!  Then of course you have to have the other foods that cause dyslipidemia such as deep-fried oysters? and Shrimp Tempura!  10 each, GONNNNEE!  And then before I pass out from all the food, \"Um...may I have two vanilla mochi ice creams please?\"  

Drinks: Water with lemon!  Cheap flavored water.  Plus you get vitamin C and antioxidants.  Can you please make my lemon bigger?

Rating-disclosure: Although the wait was absurd, and the service not glamorous, i still gave this place 5 stars because the food honestly made up for it.  It really did!  And probably because I was with good company.  If to me, service mattered more than the food, I would definitely have given this place 4 stars.  The only thing holding me back is the unfortunate fact that Hawai'i is deprived of awesome all-you-can-eat sushi due to import costs."}
{"text":"I really like this place. My boyfriend and I come about once a month for AYCE. We keep thinking we are going to try somewhere new,  but always end up back here. 
The chefs are always super friendly and are always asking if we'd like to order something else. 
The fish is always fresh--the yellowtail and salmon belly are the best. Also,  the appetizers are really great to. 
The AYCE includes appetizers and desserts and well.
They also have a punch card so after 10 purchases,  one of us will eat free. 
We love it here!"}
{"text":"You know. EVERY TIME I order take out I ask for ginger. I'm trying to open the bag to DOUBLE check they put ginger in my order. EVERY TIME!!! They forget! I'm not even kidding! I'm sick! Of having to ask. This time they didn't even let me open the bag cause they were SURE!! I had ginger. Get home. NO GINGER! Why!!? Do I have to open the bag and PROVE to every worker there that I am ASKING for ginger and get none every time. I called and informed them of the mishap for the 80th time it happened (yes the amount is an exaggeration but you get it) then was told to come back.. Like nah. I'm not driving back!!!! I'm taking one star away for this reason alone. So frustrating. So I apologize this \"rant\" because you may think it's just about ginger but it's not. It's about the **doubt**I go through whenever I order. The disappointment from the reassurance I receive when I SPECIFICALLY ask to check. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. We had the AYCE and got our money's worth. Great selection of rolls. Only dislike is the seating. Not good for groups and you sit VERY close to other tables."}
{"text":"Tasteful decor, great service, lots to chose from on the menu. Food was good, everything we had came out as ordered, server was knowledgeable and on top of taking orders and keeping the table cleared."}
{"text":"First time I came here the food was awesome, yesterday I went again and was very pleased!"}
{"text":"if i could transform sushi mon into human form, i'd marry him in a minute!

PROS:
all you can eat EVERYTHING ON THE MENU!!! i seriously do not know how they don't go out of business with the selection and price value.  everything i ate was SO good! granted i am mainly a sushi roll person, there was all types of food not just sushi.  THIS PLACE IS A STEAL!!! it makes me mad they don't have places like this in hawaii...

CONS:
it's not that big, so (especially if you're with a group) be prepared to wait.  supposedly there is a 60 minute limit for your all you can eat, but i wasn't too aware of it.  hope and pray there isn't a fat family sitting on the table infront of you, cause you're gonna wait forever...and they don't take reservations

WHAT I ATE:
(All you can eat for $26.99)

- Chubby Roll
- Vegas Roll
- Takwon Roll?
- Red Bean (Azuki) Ice Cream
- I ate more but i can't remember...

WHY HERE FOR YOUR VACA?:
if you love legit japanese from japan sushi or hate raw fish you're probably not gonna care for this place too much.  but if you're like me and CRAVE sushi rolls all the time, you'll be in heaven!!! there is so much to pick from, you'll feel like your head is going to explode.  it is far of the strip (about a 20 min or $30 cab ride)...but if i go to vegas again...i am DEFINETLY coming back!!! with my stretchy pants..."}
{"text":"They are starting to renovate the place to make it more presentable or trendy. Check out the bathrooms: Bamboo plants, wood panels, nice bowl sinks...

Yes, it is starting to look more presentable, but the quality of the sushi suffered! All of the sushi I had one night was just not as fresh as it used to be....The nigiri was just so disappointing...

The price went up too! $1 or $2 more now....

I don't know if it was just that night, but Sushi Mon was just off..."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and the sushi selection is on point.. Large selection of rolls and they offer AYCE at an unbeatable price!! This is a Vegas \"Must\" stop and they have 2 locations!!!"}
{"text":"For an AYCE sushi joint, this place is just ok. You can only order certain sushi like, uni, twice. How can this be AYCE if you can only order twice? Sushi is ok. Wish the rice to fish ratio was better. Less rice and more fish, please. Service is great. The tempura-vanilla ice cream is a must-have!"}
{"text":"The best all you can eat sushi? Almost sounds like and oxymoron."}
{"text":"My first time here and I am beyond impressed. They have a stand out menu, especially when most of the all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants in Vegas are Korean owned and have basically the same stuff. The chefs were so quick with our orders and their selection of fish was incredibly fresh. They have a board of daily specials near the back of the restaurant that we definitely ordered from and they were all delicious. From their regular menu, I would recommend their uni - it was one of the freshest I've had in Vegas. Or if you're into rolls, the Sexy Girl roll (HUGE but they do half rolls if that's more your style). The best part of my visit was the service - our waiter, Joseph, was SOOO friendly and approachable with our questions (also very trustworthy when it comes to recommendations). My mom and I also had the pleasure of chatting with Ziggy, another waiter I think, and he was very sweet and funny. This restaurant is a bit of a drive from my house but it is worth the distance and I look forward to the next time :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Mon ruined 99% of sushi restaurants for us.  This all-you-can-eat sushi place was recommended to me by one of my old co-workers in Vegas, and from that day forward, we became regulars - regulars to the point that the host, waitresses, and sushi chefs knew us and knew what we were going to order for our first round!  I didn't become broke because of my horrible gambling ways in Vegas - it was because of the frequent visits to Sushi Mon!!!  Damn you Sushi Mon!!!  Damn you for being so damn good!!! *shakes fists*

We LOVE this all-you-can eat sushi place where they make the sushi to order - it's not a buffet style place.  As Sushi Mon professional gorgers, we know not to order everything all at once the first time around - you have to know how to space out the ordering and the eating - otherwise you'll become full really quick!  The fish is fresh, the nigiri sushi fish to rice ratio is perfect (not too much rice), and the flavor of some of the sauces they use on some of the nigiri sushi and sushi rolls are amazing!  The service is good - sometimes the language barrier becomes an obstacle, but the food comes out quick.

Be sure to order what you can eat - they charge you for whatever you leave behind.  It hasn't happened to us though.

I can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"I love Sushi Mon!! I go there every time I want all you can eat sushi.  This place is always busy!! But of course I never mind the wait, its well worth it! They have very fresh sushi and a huge selection to choose from! I love sitting at the Sushi Bar and interacting with their Sushi Chefs.  The best part is, when you get all you can eat, there is a huge menu of not only sushi but other dishes you can have along with desert.  I love the mochi balls.   My fav is the strawberry.  For $25 a person, you can't go wrong! Sake Bombs!! Sake Bombs!!  :)  If you don't feel like all you can eat, they do have a very reasonably priced sushi menu!! YUMMMMY!"}
{"text":"best all you can eat sushi in vegas. end of story. 

i suggest going in for lunch since you'll get your monies worth. 
here's a hint to ordering: don't order rolls! 
i know it's tempting, but it's all rice! why would you pay over $20 to get full off of rice?! be smart!! 
order the expensive sushi. ask the chef what their special is for the day. 

there's nothing more to it. good sushi. good price. 

AND extra points for buy 10 all-you-can-eat sushi and get one free. 
that's a FREE $27 dinner!!!!! it doesn't get any better then that!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you, this is THE spot for \"All You Can Eat\" sushi. The service is amazing and so fast!! Manuel aka Manny, Sal & Mauri were a complete treat and so much fun!! I definitely found my new go-to sushi stop. Thank you, guys!!!"}
{"text":"$21.95 for AYCE lunch means that my friends and I get our money's worth whenever we eat here.  I usually dine with my pals after we do a long ride or run in the area, so we come ready to eat.  This was the case again this past Saturday when we arrived a few minutes before the doors opened at 11:45am.  There were a few other people waiting, too, but our party of six had no problem snagging a table, so come early and you won't have to wait, either.
I can only eat shellfish, so my sushi choices are very limited, but I like the appetizers, too.  This equates to a not very healthy meal, but you gotta live a little.
My usuals:  miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura, shumai, cucumber salad, shrimp tempura roll, 007 roll, Dynamite roll, Moment roll, with red bean ice cream or strawberry mochi for dessert.
The service is always attentive and the food just keeps coming.  For the amount of food that we can put away when we're hungry, Sushi Mon is a bargain.  

*Review #200 for 2013--yay."}
{"text":"I can never get enough of this place. If I could come here every week, I would do it.  This is by far the best All-You-can-Eat Japanese restaurant ever.  Not only it's fresh but it is also full of Japanese servers and sushi chefs.  

I have tried many different AYCE Japanese places and none compare to Sushi Mon.  
Who knew Las Vegas would serve such freshness and tasty authentic Japanese food.  

The menu has tons to choose from. Also be sure to check out their black chalkboard on the side.  It has tons of specials so check them out.

If you are at Vegas and you are looking for some fresh sashimi, then this is the place to come.  

You won't regret it. !!!!! Yummy"}
{"text":"For 5 years, Sushi Mon and sister restaurant Goyemon have been our go-to establishments for AYCE sushi, but unfortunately the quality continues to decline at both locations. About 1.5 yrs ago, they changed the unagi to a lesser quality and smaller portion. It's been downhill since then. At Sushi Mon recently, we had to send back the snow crab because it was starting to spoil and was inedible. They are serving salmon nigiri that includes sinews from the worst parts of the fish. Gone is the beautiful marbling of fat that should be seen with good quality salmon nigiri. The California role? Though this role blasphemes the very idea of traditional sushi, the one they served us should be a source of major embarrassment to any sushi chef. The uni thankfully was fresh and delicious. I know the quality of AYCE sushi can never match a la carte, but in this case, the AYCE sushi used to be much better. The price hasn't gone down, but now the quality has dipped so far that we've decided to start searching for a new favorite sushi spot, sorry to say."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is a little bit overpriced for a lunch buffet, but I have to say that it's a great place if you are staying in Vegas and have a car. My boyfriend and I have been there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. the dinner all you can eat is about 26 and the lunch is 23. If you dont plan on eating more than two full rolls, make sure to choose the a la carte option. The all you can eat apparently comes with a free side, which includes stuff like miso soup and a free dessert, which we were never able to try. The cooks make the sushi in front of you if you sit at the bar. I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar. The chefs are very nice, but have pretty big accents, so sometimes it was hard to understand them. They also have a frequent diner card, for a free meal after your 10th meal. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area. Try the JJ roll which is fantastic."}
{"text":"Justice Pao gives credit when credit is due.  This place is the shitznuts.  Fishes are very fresh and the staff are friendly.  Custom rolls are available if you tell the sushi chefs.  Place is owned by real Japanese folks.  The price is reasonable and the all you can eat free voucher card after 10 eat-ins is a great bonus.  This is Justice Pao's favorite Sushi Joint in Vegas!  Bathrooms were very clean and last time I went 01/04/09 they were playing the Final Fantasy 7 theme song!!  

4/5 only because there is no Sashimi, you have to eat the rice :-( Oh and I'm not sure if that wasabi is lactose free.  I would be great if its real wasabi."}
{"text":"The best sushi joint in the Silverado Ranch area. Expect to wait 30-60 minutes if you go during regular dinner hours. It's a very small place but great quality!"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi, that's why I fly into Vegas.

Came to Sushi Mon as it was close to the South Point Casino. It was a Wednesday night around 6:00pm. There was no wait for our party of 3. One person in our party has never eaten sushi like the other 2 of us, so we practically shoved all sorts of nigiri and specials down his throat.

The Salmon Belly special was amazing! If you thought regular salmon filet was soft, this buttery goodness just melts away your heart. We had probably 4 rounds of this during our meal.

The Baked Mussels were also great. 

We mostly ate nigiri and appetizers. The rolls looked good, but as we were hosting our friend, we didn't want to get stuck with something he wouldn't help us eat.

We finished off with Tempura Ice Cream, which didn't have the texture as we hoped, but it was still a nice way to finish off the meal. By the time were finished, the restaurant had a waitlist and you can see people just eyeing your table.

As for satisfying our stomachs... let's just say we opted to walk off our food and head back to South Point on foot... it was 50 minutes of walking..."}
{"text":"So far, my favorite all you can eat sushi in las vegas. I'm going to travel to vegas again, and try out all the other new all you can eat sushi bars. Until then, this is so far the best in vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite All-you -can -eat sushi restaurant and I don't even live near here. I'm from California. I came here with my friend that lives in the area and I'm so glad she suggested to come here. I've been here twice and the sushi was super fresh and the quality so far has been consistently good. It's only $26.95/per person. What a great price. The staff is friendly, but not really the most attentive. At times we were flagging down the waitress to put in more orders. Maybe my friend and I were getting out of control because it felt as if we were constantly ready for our next order. I love this place and I'm in haven every time I come here."}
{"text":"(Update) Came here for an early birthday celebration. The service is alright.. we did AYCE , told them twice until they realize what we really wanted. The appetizers we ordered was not as good as before. We ordered chicken skewered for my son .. it wasn't even fresh. It was below warm temperature. 

I come here every once in awhile and a lot of the host and servers changed.. I honestly miss the old workers.. the service tonight was a little bit disappointing. 



************************************************

This server name Ulysses.. has always been the one assisting me and my family. Even when he's not, he ALWAYS provide such excellent service. Sushi Mon at this location has always been our go to sushi place. We love Sushi Mon. We were never disappointed with the food or service. But Ulysses is so wonderful and patient. Whoever the owner is must give him a raise or promote him!!!!"}
{"text":"I had never been for all you can eat sushi so my friend took me and we sat at the bar. We ordered something fresh to start so we had a half of a cucumber roll, the sushi chef  kind of laughed and rolled his eyes. I brushed it off. Then we ordered a few more and we never got the ones we ordered and he gave us things that we didn't order. He rolled his eyes was rude and made me feel like I was inconveniencing him to make my food. That's what you are there for to make my food! Even the party next to us noticed that he was not nice to us. He is an older Asian man with glasses. His tip jar was empty when we came in and it stayed that way the hour we were there. I at one point even asked a waiter if we could order rolls with him because of the total negative attitude that we got from our chef. The food was decent but I would not return because of how I was treated."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place used to be one my favorite restaurants. My experience yesterday was so disappointing that I don't want to return ever again. The hostess or owner who was seating people made me so angry. Although we got there earlier than half of the people waiting, she refused to seat us. When I checked the waiting list, our names were on the top yet we weren't seated because the team of 7 who came after us. When ever there were empty seats in the bar, she didn't even ask us if we wished to take those seats. After three tables left and were empty, we still couldn't take those seats because the entire party of 7 weren't there. She continually waited for those people when their seating policy clearly states that the party won't be seated until the entire party is present. This experience was so disappointing and outrageous. Although sushi mon has great food, I won't be returning if this treatment continues."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best AYCE sushi places you can find in America. The consistency on the quality that they provide on their menu as well as the variety available is quite enticing to bring back heavy eaters like my party and I even if we only have 1 hour to eat.

The trick as my group came to learn was to order as much as your heavy appetite can handle. They may warn you that any leftovers immediately becomes charged extra at ala carte price BUT if you are certain of your appetite, JUST DO IT.

Another tip is regarding the limited items (meaning one per person). I only remember two items, which I ordered both of and are fried oysters and sake shooters. Now, if some in your group doesn't like (or can't) eat either of these two BUT you can and want to, ORDER on their behalf.

Favorite rolls/nigiri/sides
1. Salmon - exceptionally fresh. BIGGER plus was when it came out as FATTY salmon. OMFG, I had to order even more.
2. Hamachi
3. Miso soup (practically my buffet sake)
4. Tuna

If you like spicy, apparently, there's a roll called the 911. I gotta love our waitress that night when he dared one of my party to take the spice challenge. He looked like he was going to combust.

Other notes: Last few times I visited were during dinner and although the restaurant was full, food comes out fast pretty quickly. Service is exceptional and a plus."}
{"text":"Still hands down the BEST sushi restaurant I have EVER been to. EVER!!! Still hands down a place you HAVE to come when u come to vegas (that's NOT on the strip -- this is where the locals kick it!).

$26ish for unlimited access to all of the super duper fresh rolls, sides, and desserts. AH!!! So flipping good!!!

And the service here is still FLAWLESS. Fast. Efficient. Friendly. Super Attentive. Smiley. Seriously can't ask for anything better.

Reunited with some old friends here as we stuffed ourselves and enjoyed $13 pitchers of Saporro and sake sake sake. 

Get the warm sake...=D."}
{"text":"Now everybody knows how much I eat sushi and how I grew up on it and then I'll eat it like a daily thing the service was amazing everybody is very nice and friendly the sushi people with sushi man was cool and very polite but the sushi itself was horrible I'll never come back I wasted I should just give them the money for a tip and left I have not had such horrible sushi in my life it was dry old tasting no I totally don't recommend it I'm sorry but it takes two thumbs down I'm surprised they even gave it one star"}
{"text":"great place to enjoy fresh sushi.  I can not remember when I' ve have a firm and freah Nigiri before, but lately I had it here. good job guys."}
{"text":"All you can eat and a great buzz from sake. That's what sushi night is all about. I love that this place is open late. After I get off of work, most places are closing. People have to wait for a seat sometimes, but that just means this place is that good. Great people work there."}
{"text":"Mostly got nigiri and fish was fresh. Good for an ayce place. Rice was a little stale so -1 star. Would steer away from rolls that are overloaded with rice. If u get amaebi need to ask for the fried head specifically."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and it's always so great. From walking into the door the service is amazing, they welcome and seat you. There are some options of either doing all you can eat sushi or individually ordering sushi. I personally love the lemon and dragon roll as well as the super white tuna nigiri roll."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Ayce is kinda pricey so I rarely get it & I also only eat one or two orders of rolls, but I love how I can order half orders to go. I usually do 2 full roll orders but 4 different kinds. It's the perfect deal. They are great. The pastel roll is fantastic along with the tiger. All their fish is fresh."}
{"text":"I was hoping that they would serve excellent sashimi, as it is really close to my house... but no... sashimi was just ok, definitely not fresh, and some pieces tasted weird. 
I think this place is good for people who love sushi and rolls with a lot of sauces and stuff like that, not for anal purists like me - I judge a Japanese restaurant by their sashimi."}
{"text":"I have to update my review. I recently tried the new location and it seems to be a better than the first time I have been there. Maybe they changed management or kitchen staff? Their food and service is definitely better now than at the prior location. Thank you Sushi Mon for not disappointing me the second time :)"}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi restaurant I've been to out of 5 different ones. Sushi mon's sushi on MARYLAND has the freshest sushi and great service for the 3 times I've been here. ***please note: the one on sahara is not owned by the same owner and that one was terrible when I went."}
{"text":"The all you can eat includes ALL the specialty rolls! It is worth every penny. Tip: the super white tuna will blow your mind :-)"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my worst meals particularly in a Japanese restaurant.  The food was extremely average, but the service was exceedingly poor.  Granted wwalked in at 12 midnight but they are open till 2am.  But throughout our stay there were about 6 employees who were more interested in chatting with each other loudly in Spanish and ignoring us and our needs even when I had to ask for things.  I will not be back obviously given the large number of much better restaurants in Vegas.  Good luck!  The quality of the sushi was mixed.  Some not so good.  Hopefully they will improve.  I think a thorough replacement of the staff is necessary to turn this one around though."}
{"text":"Normally its always worth the wait but this time it was uncalled for \"Ridiculous\"!! We frequently dine here almost weekly and have always experienced great service until lastnight. We had a party of 7 (not Asian size if you know what I mean.) We were given a wait time of 25 min. But Waited over 1 hour before two 4 seater tables opened up at the same time. Starving and relieved that finally we're going in, two people drove right up, no  waitimg list needed for them and this hostess (short girl with blond dyed, black roots) automatically offers them one of those tables and tries to squeeze us in the other?? That's where I lost my mind!  Especially because there was a 2 seater opened for them and we needed both tables. This hostess refused to put both tables together for us and rudely told us we'd have to wait 15 minutes longer till more tables open up (4 separate parties had to leave first =8 seats still. ) WTH? When we were done, one of those two tables were still unused. So Dumb! If it wasn't for your waitress' making a way for us, you would've lost our Tip let alone our business lastnight!  Good job Sushimon you hired an idiot for your welcoming party, who pissed off your frequent flyer- Don't think we'll be back again."}
{"text":"I am a loyal customer to this establishment.  For years they have been a great place.  This last time I have gone it  was catastrophic.  The wait staff is still excellent and efficient.  However all the talent as far as sushi chefs are gone.  I had to send rolls back cause they were made horribly and incorrect to the menu. Not to mention they were not that busy and took me nearly 30 min to get my first roll.  I am very displease with this place now.  I have them two stars cause the wait staff even commented that the sushi chefs are extremely slow and horrible and they didn't charge me for service because they know me as a loyal customer.   I will give them another chance but not for awhile.  Let me add that if they don't make a serious change it will sadly be the last.  Wish they would bring back the chef Michael he was one of the best.  

Message to Sushi Mon.......Do better or loose a loyal customer.  Try hiring chefs with experience not children that don't know what they are doing."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE... No one to seat us when we walked in (just a table for 2) and there were several tables open so we figured we would seat ourselves, so we sat at the sushi bar for a good 5 minutes before the hostess came over to us and rudely asked us if we were on the waiting list. I replied that no we sat ourselves because there was no one at the front. She then rudely replied \"Nope you guys need to get up there is a waiting list\" even though there were several tables open that when I pointed this out to her she said it's because she gives people on the waiting list 10 Minutes to come back for their seating. She didn't even offer to put us on a waiting list and didn't seem to care we were going to take our business elsewhere. Her attitude alone was enough to give this restaurant a 1 star, Because I believe customer service is the most important asset to a business it. There are a million of sushi bars in Vegas not hard to take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Vegas I always have to eat here.  All you can eat sushi and they don't pack on the rice!!!  I swear my tamago nigiri only had like 10 grains of rice underneath.  haha awesome!  BEWARE: the 9-1-1 roll is super spicy.  the waitress looked at us funny when we were going to get 3 orders..haha good thing we only got one because we couldn't handle it."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Mon on back to back nights.  We were shame to go to the same one twice in a row so we came to this one the second time.  I still think this place is great, but the one on W Sahara had faster service.  There was a couple times we sat with nothing in front of us to eat :("}
{"text":"Saturday night begins at our local favorite Sushi Mon. We had  AYCE for $26.95/person available 4:00 PM - Midnight. Remember last order must be placed by 11:30 PM. You have 60 minutes to consume your full  order.

The children shared a Tempura Special. Two asparagus spears, carrot, sweet potato slice, yam, and onion we're the veggie selections. Salad, 4 shrimp, rice, and two more salads accompanied the main entree.

I am hoping for organic rice at a Las Vegas sushi restaurant and I will continue to keep up the search."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend, we ordered all you can eat sushi, and requested lite rice. 
Hamachi was great.
Sexy girl was good.
Dragon roll,  the eel was like a leather shoe. (I'm not a dog, leather shoes aren't my thing)
Rainbow roll, the fish was disgusting. 

I asked the server to take the eel roll back prior to receiving the rainbow roll. I explained the eel being a little off, she gladly returned the dragon roll. 
Once we received the rainbow roll, (I could see the color was not what I though it could be.) my friend had a bite and didn't say much, I had a bite and the fish was awful. I looked at my friend and he is slowly spitting his bite into a napkin. 
We asked the server if she could take it back and asked for our bill. 
The server then brought the manager to our table and the manager advised me, \"if I eat one more piece, she won't charge me for the roll\" 
I declined her offer and we asked for the bill again. 
The bill came and she charged us for our all you can eat, and an additional charge for the rainbow roll. 

All together, the woman handled the situation poorly. 
I didn't eat the roll because it would make me sick, this is poor quality fish. 
The fact that this was a \"manager\" asked me to eat another piece of this god awful fish is asinine. 

We received our check with 2 all you can eat (which is expected and we are fine with) and additional charge for that rotting roll of fish. 

Save your appetite unless you want to scream out of your anus."}
{"text":"Me and hubby came for a date night on Saturday the atmosphere music lighting was on point, their was like no wait time at all for food, it all came out super fast as well as the drinks. The fish was really good and you can tell the quality is really good, portion sizes were great, just enough rice to fish like others give more rice on purpose but that's not the case with this place, I love it here!!! Best ayce sushi place ever!! If it's me and hubby but kids is a little expensive for ayce in my opinion but it's still great"}
{"text":"The all you can eat special was fantastic. They made the rolls nearly as quickly as I could order them. Everyone was super friendly and they handled our large party with great aplumb.

Would definitely recommend this place for sushi.  I'm sad I don't live nearby.. I would definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Sushi Mon location.   I usually frequent the one on Maryland. 

I appreciate that this one is larger and had more spacious seating.   I also like the fact that there are fry and grill specials. 

The sushi itself wasn't as good as the other location.   Obviously, it's the same menu but the quality seemed a little lower and I really like having more of sushi specials. 

Overall, I would definitely say I would try it again."}
{"text":"It never occurs to me to review places I go to all the time.   

My family and I are basically regulars at Sushi Mon.  I'm not going to say it's the best sushi I've ever had but I will say that it's the best ayce sushi in Vegas.   

I've been to quite a few other places and none other than goyemon (which is a sister restaurant of sushi mon) can compare. 

While sometimes you get a miss and the service is bad or the sushi isn't that great but most of the time you'll get A service and good quality sushi.   Especially if you're like me and don't want it drowning in some sweet disgusting sauce.  

Definitely give this place at least 3 tries and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"It's been 2-3yrs since I've been to Sushi Mon, and uh wtf happened?? Sushi Mon used to be my go to ayce sushi spot since it was awesome and I lived about a mile away. I stopped going because I moved to a different city, then to a different area of LV and it's sad how bad this place is now. 

Positive change - they've finally added more seating for people waiting outside. Negative changes - more things missing from the menu, slow service (waiters and sushi chefs), crappier quality sushi. 

My very fav smoked salmon nigiri has been off the menu for a while, but now they also got rid of the fried oysters, couple rolls I liked and the curry bowl too. Despite sitting at the sushi bar on a night that wasn't full, it took forever to get sushi (they had 5 chefs working). The dishes piled up since the waiters never stopped, and I had to literally grab them to put in orders as they ran by since waving did nothing.   

Dry hamachi and salmon kama, sloppy looking rolls and nigiri, smaller pieces of fish and they don't seem to put wasabi in the nigiri anymore. Spicy scallop hand roll that literally had 2 pieces of bay scallop mixed in with a lot of imitation crab, and also wasn't spicy at all. Even my lychee ice cream was all crystallized and icy. 

The quality had been going down for a while, but I'm officially done with Sushi Mon now - there are too many other ayce options to waste money here."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.
We ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.
I order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.

The service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.
The servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.
Absolutely sad"}
{"text":"Mm. Sushi Mon! All you can eat, about $27 if I can recall correctly. 

This all you can eat includes the entire menu appetizers, all rolls, and desserts. So prepare to gorge.  They are open till 2am like a lot of sushi joints in town, but AYCE ends at 1am... 

They have a bunch of rolls here... \"regular,\" specialty, baked, and tempura. Also a pretty good selection of sashimi. Yummm. And you can't ever leave Sushi Mon... no matter how much food you've stuffed yourself without Mochi and/or green tea ice cream!

What makes this place different is that the chefs remember you! It is always nice to be remembered and greeted by a restaurant that serves so many people."}
{"text":"There are *way* cheaper all you can eat sushi deals in Vegas than here if you're looking to be on the conservative side with your hard earned money. I don't know about anyone else, but unless the sushi quality is top notch and the dining experience comes with the 360 degree service and quality, I absolutely refuse to pay $25-$28 for all you can eat when I know I can get it for at/under $23 elsewhere where I don't have to wait 20/30 minutes to be sat. 

While their sushi and plates are interesting, I honestly don't see anything overly special about this place. Small, always seems to be mobbed, and while the service is good, it is nothing overly outstanding like some of my friends raved to me about.

The reason why I gave it three stars is because 1.) The prices are a little over the top for something you can get cheaper (and in a better setting) somewhere else, and 2.) This place is always busy, and the wait times are very much over-quoted and long."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I headed over to Sushi Mon on the recommendation of my friend [our mistake since that guy doesn't even eat raw fish] one day for lunch.  We both had gotten the All-You-Can-Eat lunch.  So now begins the critique:

The fish was not fresh.  Everything had this soggy texture that comes from defrosting.  I work at a restaurant so you can't fool me.  Although the portions were decent, everything that had some kind of sauce was over done.  Our soft shell crab had so much ponzo sauce, it became overly salty.  That's the typical way of getting a customer to fill up on water and have them stop ordering food.

Overall, this place wasn't as good as we expected but we still left with a full belly."}
{"text":"Who goes to Vegas without stopping by a few AYCE?  Sushi Mon is a great little joint with some decent eats!

Sushi Mon is a small and lightly decorated place with some good eats to offer.  The fish is fresh and the portion sizes are decent.  On a shady note, they do seem to pack a whole lot of rice in every bite.  Tactic to fill you up on rice faster?  Probably.  You can pack away a variety of items before having to loosen the belt.  They have daily/nightly specials written out so make sure you take a peek at the board before you order.  As far as AYCE goes, they're not bad.  I do think there are better sushi places you could go to but if you want speedy seating and no-fuss service, come here!  You get what you pay for without the unnecessary frills.  

Whenever my friends and I come here, we try to score a seat at the sushi bar.  It's always fun watching the sushi chefs prepare stuff and if it's slow, they make random handrolls and other items for you to try.  The chefs are sweeties but the waitresses tend to steer clear when you're sitting at the bar.  Can a girl get more tea please?"}
{"text":"Oh, dearest me, Sushi mon, Sushi mon, sigh, why oh why do you charge so much for all you can eat sushi? Is the fish quality better than any other AYCE sushi restaurants? Absolutely not. Are their rolls superior to other AYCE sushi restaurants? Nope!

This wildly popular sushi joint is gleaming with southern Las Vegas patrons. They are swarmed with clients day in and day out and late night. I walked in at 11pm on a Friday and there was a large crowd of people waiting to either get into the restaurant or just hanging out in front of Sushi Mon. I guess that is the new thing these days. \"Hey, we are going to hang out at Sushi Mon and pretend we are cool.\" Nevertheless, the wait was short as I was dining alone and the bar was sufficient for myself. 

I started to look at their laminated menu and took a look around the restaurant itself. The restaurant itself is bland, Someone had the bright idea of putting tile, in a diagonal pattern, on the wall. Are you kidding me? EPIC FAIL. The seating is quite spread out and the restaurant itself is quite small. The sushi chefs are abundant, however, and that is usually a great sign for a busy restaurant. The patrons seemed happy indulging in their gluttony of raw fish, rice, mayo and cream cheese creations. I for one, always order the sushi first before I order any specialty rolls. 

The salmon sushi was just meh to my standards. Their salmon was a bit  warm and the texture seemed off. The tuna was good and their yellowtail was surprising very good. I do have to say their rolls are quite interesting. I can't really remember what I ordered, but what I did order tasted a-ok to me. I remember asking my sushi chef to make me their best roll they had. It was some shrimp tempura roll concoction wrapped in soy paper. Can't remember the name but I remember liking it very much. 

As for the positive sides of the restaurant, I can see why people like this place. The warm welcoming staff, the sushi chefs, and the massive amount of people waiting to attack their sushi rolls with their salivating palates. 

A word for the owners. You are doing a great job. I hope you continue to succeed. For Christ's sake, please take that stupid tile down from the wall and put up some authentic artwork or something! Augh, it really makes me not want to dine there because of the crappy decor. Stop charging so much for standard sushi quality! Then again, if people are paying it why stop right? I understand.  

Yes I would return to the restaurant, but, I probably wouldn't go by myself again. If my friends are willing to go I may just join them."}
{"text":"Place is our favorite....the fish is great and the people are cool. Place gets packed in the evenings which is always a good sign.

We have been going weekly for several years and can't say anything bad.   Hiro and Eddie are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"We go here regularly - it is a solid 4 star sushi restaurant with good, quick service and consistently fresh food. Are there better sushi places with fancier rolls? Yes. But the service is wonderful and the prices are more than reasonable. It is our go-to place and we would recommend it any day."}
{"text":"Hmmm, what can I write about Sushi-mon other than.... 

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! 

Indulge in the all-you-can-eat sushi experience, tantalize your taste buds with an array of fresh menu items, take a risk and try something you've never tasted before, partake in a scrumptious dessert like tempura ice cream, and casually sip on some hot green tea. 

The service and food speaks for itself. And once you have been there a few (ok, dozens) of times like me :) the sushi chefs will work on your rolls as soon as you walk thru the front door. 

~Tanoshimu (enjoy!)"}
{"text":"This is probably the best of the \"all you can eat\" sushi restaurants. This was my fourth visit here, and I was disappointed that nothing was cold. But we've had this monsoon weather for days, and I suspect that is challenging their refrigeration equipment. My favorites: the fried shrimp heads and the moshi ice cream. This place is consistent; not the best sushi, but good - and plentiful."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have fast service, quality sushi and sashimi and a great atmosphere. My favorite roll, lemon roll! It is sooooo refreshing! 

They also have an amazing sashimi salad! You have to try it next time you visit! 

Oh! and they serve half rolls! I have visited numerous sushi restaurants and if they don't serve half rolls, I will definitely not go back! I like enjoying a great variety of flavors and textures which is hard to attain if you're eating 8 rolls of the same thing... And hopefully those 8 rolls are good. That's what keeps me coming back to them!"}
{"text":"Great place for all you can eat sushi, ingredients are fresh and tasty. My family loves this place, service is friendly and fast. Many creative sushi rolls as well as your basic rolls, good made to order food, fresh seafood and good desserts. Cant get any better than that."}
{"text":"I think 3 stars is a good average rating for the average sushi and mediocre service they gave me. I think other sushi places are better but they do have good portion sizes. Their salmon is good but I didn't really enjoy the albacore and the halibut. I did the all you can eat. The lychee ice cream was amazing and the portion was even better. Our server came to us once for our drink order and our first order and was no where to be found. Later I found out that he'd left without a word and there was no other server that helped us as a replacement for him. It was busy but there was no wait, if I would've been at least able to put in another order I would've been happy."}
{"text":"A bit crowded but ok. The food was really good and fresh. I like the seaweed salad. Prices are typical for all ypu can eat sushi places.  The sashimi was fresh not fishy. We come here a few times a month so yes we like it."}
{"text":"Horrible rolling skills on not 1 but 2 rolls! Go for the first piece fell apart then the second same thing! and not so great on the other roll either. Very disappointing can't do anything when it's take out and you don't see it until you are home. Should've known when the rolls weren't even put in the bag tight just falling on its side. New person taking orders on the phone work on your bagging skills so not to disappoint any future customers!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE, good prices. The wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Ive had Sushimon 2 times now and both times have been very good. They have an all you can eat dinner there that is VERY much worth the quality of sushi that you get. in addition the atmosphere is pretty light and fun and there is the cutest older woman who works there who provides excellent service. it's pretty damn yummy. I'm a fan :)."}
{"text":"One of my favorites of my AYCE Asian Vegas tour.  The staff was friendly, the sushi chef was nice, and the place was very clean and packed with people for a weekday.  They have a wide selection of rolls, but I mainly stick with sushi so I can not comment on them.  The day I was there they had salmon belly, oh my!!
There is also a selection of kitchen items that can be ordered from the waitress.  
If you go, save room for the tempura ice cream, it comes with the AYCE and is my favorite of the desserts from my trip."}
{"text":"Oh I love this place! This is a cool little spot that has awesome sushi. The all you can eat is awesome bc it is worth it. Been here many times and will be back!!"}
{"text":"I live in LA but visit LV often since it's not that far of a drive ... every time I come, Sushi Mon and Rosemary's are the 2 places I ALWAYS have to dine at. 

I am a sushi fanatic and this is the best sushi buffet ever! Everything is made fresh to order and they have a wide variety of rolls. The best thing is that you can do half orders so you can try everything!! I really don't get how they make money?! haha They even have a punch card and after 12 meals you get a free one! They aren't skimpy on their fish and they don't over power the rolls with excessive rice. 

The only bad thing I have to say, is that sometimes the sushi orders aren't cut the best and it has the little silver fiber thingies which doesn't make for easy eating. But the rolls are so yummy. They had a new roll \"mesquite\" which was reaaaaly good - spicy tuna roll topped with mango, salmon and a yummy mango sauce. The mahi roll is good - it has mahi mahi, asparagus and shizo leaves. The chubby roll, hawaiian, spider and orion are all great too! They have poke and seaweed salad too! 

If you go with people that aren't huge sushi eaters - they can either order off their menu or do the all you can eat which also includes tempura, gyoza, teriyaki, miso and more. Plus ice cream!! Red bean, green tea or plum wine. So worth the money!  And they are open til 2 AM so perfect after those late night gambling runs!!"}
{"text":"Before I get to far into my review, the sushi here is good and the staff if friendly enough. 

The main reason I am only giving this place a 3 star is because of the atmosphere. From the moment I got in there I felt like I was being rushed. First off there is a 45 minute time limit on the dinner all you can eat. Then if you do not know exactly what you want to order when you are asked the chef will not wait for you to decide or help you decide, they will just skip you. Near the end of are dinner are chef up and disappeared for 20 minutes and no one asked if we needed anything. If I am paying for a timed dinner I find this unacceptable. Then at the end of the meal we got a punch card where if you get 10 all you can eats you get one for free. I like this, but again they put a time limit on the punch card!

So if you are in a rush and want to eat sushi then this is a decent place to go, but if you want to relax and take your time, find a different sushi place."}
{"text":"This place can get pretty crazy crowded in here.  I was definitely a skeptic, but thought it was more than decent after our AYCE meal.  

The fish to rice ratio for the nigiri were perfect, especially for all you can eat.  Small cut of fish and the proper amount of rice to make this one-bite, as it was meant for, that much more satisfying.  That is my one pet peeve about AYCEs, is they make massive portions and 2 rolls max, you'll be stuffed with just on rice.  Not here...

The fact that they offer salmon belly was a big score for my guests this evening.  $26.95 for dinner, just ordering a few uni nigiri and salmon belly already paid for itself.  We all opted for AYCE, so sharing was really convenient and allowed us to try more things on the menu.

highlights for me- 

tako poke- though a little chewy with light flavoring, more of a ponzu taste was a refreshing change.
salmon belly- marbled like crazy throughout, but that made it that much more buttery
hamachi kama- fully cooked yellowtail collar bone with a side of ponzu and chopped scallion.  I always find this dish so satisfying to pick at.
uni- nice delicate pieces gently laid over a bite size amount of rice. The seaweed wrapped the whole rice with the leftover stuck left out to the shape of number '6'.  Rich and buttery, YUM!
red bean ice cream and green tea ice cream- scoops of heaven, hints of matcha and hints of red beans.  Not the best quality, but definitely not too shabby. 

The albacore, sashimi salad, red snapper were all good too.  The extensive menu included specials for the night, lots of side dishes and the nigiri was the most impressive for me.  

We ordered but one roll to share amongst the four of us and the sexy girl is a no go.  Stuffed with the California roll as the base, a little piece of the tempura shrimp and bits of scallops on top over too much whatever sauce and whole load of tempura sprinkles.  

My one other complaint was the temperature was set way too high for the amount of people in the restaurant. We were situated in a corner with the larger table, under the vent and the heat was so uncomfortable, that the blast of cold air from the ocassional opened door was more than welcomed.  

Towards the end of our meal, the service got super slow and ordering became more of a waiting game, so we settled for our dessert a little sooner.  

Sushi snob, I am not, but this was a decent sushi joint.  I haven't enjoyed much sushi out here, for the fact of being disappointed in comparison to Hawaii and Cali sushi.  

I'm super excited that we have this place in Henderson."}
{"text":"So here is my review. We love Sushi Mon on Maryland and Silverado and we've also had plenty of good dinners here at the Sahara location but the last few times my husband has gotten sick while still at the restaurant. And today out of all days we both are home  with food poisoning. We don't have to be a doctor to know that going to the bathroom over n over n over again .. we started to feel our stomach turn while eating so we didn't finish and instead got up to pay and to let them know we didn't finish so that they could charge us for whatever we wastes but before we could say anything the lady who i'm pretty sure is the manager came to us very rudely and in front of everyone saying \"this is a NO NO in all you can eat\" which we know and is why we went to the front to let them know. We have spent tons of money here and bring all our family from out of town to both locations and we will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"I loved this place, loved. Service was more welcoming and the chefs were more welcoming too. Now it's cold and it has a weird, formal vibe to it.
I'm not a fan of the prices anymore and the sushi changed slightly.

There's a new place called Naka Sushi  on Lakemead next to Savers and this is my new place to go to. The actual owners are working everyday there and the chef was apparently from Sushi Mon (authentic Japanese guy), but left to start his own restaurant. I love his place. Tastes like Sushi Mon, but better. AYCE for one is 18 and 22 for dinner! My family and friends go to Naka Sushi all the time now instead of sushi mon. Friendlier/warmer service, great for family and groups, and yummy food.

Honestly think I'm just paying for the ambience and the new decoration at Sushi Mon. The service and sushi was okay. Not coming back though."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place and driving by it weekly on the way to my brother's house... 

Came here for the Lunch AYCE option, it wasn't that busy when we came around 12PM, got seated for 6 and had our drink order taken right away. 

The sushi menu and quality was exceptional. I think I fell in love with their Unagi and Cajun Tuna? .. or maybe it was salmon. *shrug*

I even got a stamp card since I'm the local and managed to get 6 stamps per my out-of-town friends :D"}
{"text":"They have really good sushi rice, but the construction of their rolls leaves something to be desired. They also do a good job slicing the fish. 

Their rolls are a mess, and not really flavorful. Service was good, with the exception of the waitress saying, \"Hot plate!\" and then promptly setting that hot plate down right in front of my 10 month old daughter who enjoys grabbing everything. The waitress may not have had kids, so that may explain why she would do that. Would I come here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"For the first time going there it was really good. The menu was kinda confusing at first but you'll get the hang of it."}
{"text":"One of my friends took me here for lunch when I was visiting Las Vegas last month.  Great sushi restaurant for lunch.  Its a bit small but, they still got quite busy.

They have a grea all you can eat sushi special for lunch.  Check them out..."}
{"text":"A must do while in Vegas - white tuna is amazing. All the fish are fresh and they taste and smell fresh. Service is great. AGAIN, if you are in LV and have a car, GO HERE!!!!! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Have to update! This place was recently on Dirty dining! Ugh, so gross when you hear about a place you've recently eaten at. http://www.ktnv.com/news/dirty-dining/dirty-dining-sushi-mon


The food was decent, service good, the place is kind of small and super bright for me.  Small neighborhood sushi spot to stop at when you're wanting fulfill your sushi craving. Overall nothing bad to say about it, but nothing great about it either."}
{"text":"This place was great for an ayce. The rolls were great and the hurricane roll was just what I was craving. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the wait times are long to get in ( which yes I understand will be an issue at any good restaurant) and the service was ok. It took a while to get our food and then a long wait for our check. I would definitely go back just not on Fridays or Saturdays."}
{"text":"This place was so bomb-tastic...lol...  I'm a huge sushi fan and I LOOOVVEED this place.  Too bad we came during lunch, otherwise I could have had uni.  I love uni.  :)  

The quality of the food is really good and the service was great.  Honestly, I enjoyed the food here more than any of the Las Vegas Strip Buffets I've been to.  But, I'm super bias.  I love sushi!  :D"}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant offering an all you can eat option! Tried it for my first time with a co-worker for lunch.... great choice! Plenty of great options to choose from! 

Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"i highly suggest taking advantage of their all you can eat sushi deal which is only $24. they offer just about everything on the menu within this deal and they make each one to order. everything that we tried was delicious. the service was most definitely lacking but I can imagine that having multiple tables in a place like this would be time consuming therefore the server was MIA alot of the time. they do serve beer and wine for very low prices which is nice, but the ambience is very basic. little to no decoration, only a few tables. not necessarily a welcoming environment, but will definitely come back! come with plenty of time...we were in a rush so did not get the full experience."}
{"text":"i love sushi and by far this is my favorite place i have been coming here for the past 4 years i would absolutely recommend this place to any one who's craving quality sushi"}
{"text":"I recently been craving sushi  and was recommended to try Sushi Mon on Sahara. Let me just tell you, I'm mind blown. I've had some favorite locations to eat all you can eat sushi in the Las Vegas area in the past but this place just tops them all. Not only is the sushi freshly made and tastes great but the staff was very friendly and accommodating to my every need. 


I recommend eating at the sushi bar if it's just a party of two. Awesome service & you can directly place custom orders to the chef too. This is the only location that I know that you can tell them how many sushi rolls you want to have. If I want a 4 piece California role. Walla, done!  

I came during dinner time and there was a wait, the location isn't big and sometimes I can imagine big parties during theses times. Overall I highly recommend Sushi Mon to all my friends. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best A-Y-C-E sushi places I've ever been to.  They have a large variety of cut rolls, hand rolls, and everything is fresh and delicious!  This place invokes smiles and good times.  The best part is A-Y-C-E lychee sherbert, mochi, and tempura ice cream!!!!

BUT be prepared for a long wait at night because the place is pretty small.  Totally worth it though!"}
{"text":"Coworkers called to check up on me and my jacked up back (I am okay now, just sored from packing and moving and not exercising enough of late) plus to go eat at Sushi Mon (not the one on Sahara and also the closer one) and I went to meet up with them. I didn't know it was that far until I called another coworker for directions, and realized it was \"Holy Cow! I am practically starting to drive back to California\" far.  Last time I came here to eat, I just blindly followed Maryland Parkway all the way down until I reached the destination.

We arrived at 11:45am, when they opened and they already have 1/3 of the restaurant filled on a Wednesday.  Coworkers have raved about this place for a good 9 months we been working together and the food they served I have enjoyed.  And this time it was pretty good, except for the first order of sushi roll we were served (the rice tasted like it was old from last night).  But after that the rice seemed fresh like the fresh super white tuna they served us.

Tip:  Always check the specials of the day or ask the sushi chefs.

Today's Special:
Super White Tuna - so good we ordered a second round, and highly recommended. 
Cajun Salmon - it was alright
Japanese Snapper- alright
Fresh Scallop - pretty good (I don't care for the yum yum scallops the Japanese sushi places serve here in general)
Yellowtail Belly - don't have it :(
We also ordered the limit 1 per customer items:
Uni - good
Amaebi - good (but no deep fried heads)
Hamachi Kama(Yellowtail collar) - good. Makes an excellent meal with just rice.

Tried the poki roll (didn't look like what we ordered last time) and the rice was not fresh. It tasted like it was from the previous night.

Spider Roll - huge and tasted great, but served with rice paper.  Rice paper usually costs $1 more, but I still like it made with the traditional nori.
Pixie Roll - Another huge roll, and tasted good.
Volcano Roll - Pretty good, but can be messy to eat.  But sometimes messy is a good thing when it comes to food :)

Also order:
Masago with Quail Eggs - it was beautiful and I enjoyed it
Tamago - The eggs are most likely ordered premade, and they just to cut it and assemble it with the rice and nori strip, but I liked it nonetheless.
Fresh Water Eel - not bad

Desserts - we each picked different ones. I had the green tea ice cream, coworkers ordered the Lychee Sorbet (looks good), and Tempura Ice Cream (good).

BUT after we asked for and signed for our credit cards and the waitress came and picked stuff off of our table, I suddenly see a confused cockroach stumbling from where the soy sauce bottles and AYCE menu is.  I was in shocked and not sure where it came from, except maybe when the waitress came she might have set something down on the table, and grabbed our dessert bowls and left the unwanted hitchhiker.  Or it drop from the sky via the ventilation vent, which does NOT have a filter in place.  

We waved the waitress over and she was shocked and afraid of the roach as well, but hesitantly picked up a used napkin in from the table and dropped it on top of the cockroach and picked it up off the table.  It was not the happy ending to our otherwise enjoyable meal, so -1 for that.

So 3 stars.  Good place to get sushi for those living in the South South East of Las Vegas. And they have Caked next door, which have good cupcakes, and they are on TV! (But I digressed)"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here before leaving Vegas. The sushi here is good but for some reason the scallops had too much citrus sauce this time that it tasted bitter. Come here if you're looking to for some good AYCE sushi around Vegas. The only thing I don't like about this place is that they don't have a sheet for you to fill out for AYCE. The waiter/waitress has to handwrite your order. So m, if you have a large party, try and order as much as possible the first round because it takes a while to get the food and write down your order on a phone or paper so that they can just read your order."}
{"text":"I came to this location instead of Sahara because I figure the original is usually better than the other locations. This place left so much to be desired. I had high hopes from the the reviews but I can't. Be forewarned that I'm a visual person when it comes to food. The fish cuts were poor and the rolls broken and not well formed. I did not like the Futomaki but it's my fault for not reading it thoroughly. Unfortunately the rolls didn't live much to its hype either as they were all overpowered by one component or sauce. The only thing that really tasted good was the salmon belly(despite its poor presentation). But the super white tuna was great!! Other than this, the pricing was spot on for AYCE; $22 for lunch and $27 for dinner. Service and cleanliness are a thumbs up. But other than that, not enough for me to return. Sorry Sushi Mon."}
{"text":"Friend: OMG THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST AYCE SUSHI EVARRRRRRRR.
Me: It is off strip, hells no, I'm not driving out there. 
Friend: What if I got my gf to drive us out there? 
Me: Sighhhhhhhhhhh, if you insist...can't believe I'm leaving off strip to get buffet. 

Okay, okay, Friend, you are correct...this place is pretty delish. Worth the off strip excursion. Loved that they have half rolls (plus a good variety of rolls that doesn't just consist of Cali roll + (insert topping)) and a really interesting selection of appetizer-like food (yellowtail collar & ahi poke!). Their cuts of fish are super fresh (which is super impt for ayce sushi). Didn't pay too much attention to the ordering because my friend is a regular here (...and he doesn't even live in Vegas -____-) so I just gobbled up everything he ordered. Their dessert selection is pretty amazing (tempura ice cream, lychee sorbet, red bean + green tea ice cream, mochi!) and they don't skimp on the portion size. 

Nifty that they have a stamp card (10 = 1 free buffet)! Service was great. About $30 (with tax & tip) for lunch. Easy parking."}
{"text":"Snobbish host, generally don't care about your business.  Went in with tables open, however, was told all reserved and customers waiting, but there was no one there.  Requested why the was of 30mins when there's no one in line, waiter simply told us it's just how it is.  This place was my favorite for the longest time, with excellent service.  Throughout the years the service level has drastically deteriorated, seems like to happen when their business gets really good.  I hope their management do something about it coz I genuinely like their atmosphere and the great food they provide."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi off the strip? 

Away from all the crowds of the hotel buffets? 

Yezzzirrr! 

Vegas for the Pacquiao vs. Cotto fight brought major crowds any and everywhere. Times like this it's nice to explore the part of Vegas that you tend to forget about. You know the part where you realize there's more to this city than just a strip of street infested with over the top hotels.  Don't get me wrong I love it as much as anybody else, but sometimes the crowds can be a bit much.  Escape for a couple of hours from the madness isn't a bad idea.

This place was a nice change of pace.  Head sushi chef was way cool.  Made to order rolls made in on like Donkey Kong. Place was full of locals so it had to be legit.  One of the highlights to a highlight packed weekend!"}
{"text":"I'm keeping this one nice and short. 

Pros: 
- Great quality fish, not top-quality, but better than most places. 
- Expansive menu with plenty of creative and delicious rolls to try.
- Friendly sushi chefs and wait staff.

Cons:
- Slightly expensive for an AYCE
- Nigiri often has some problems. The rice has been inconsistent, ranging from being too warm/cold to be having too much/little vinegar. Also, the cuts of fish on nigiri tend to be on the smaller side. 
- No fresh oysters. AA-BOOOOOOOOOo.

Bonus Points:
- Fried Ice Cream
- Hamachi Kama 

I'd find more things to say, but now I'm just being picky."}
{"text":"When I go to Vegas, I always look forward to coming here for dinner. The food here is very fresh and very good! Even though they recently raised their prices for the AYCE, it's still worth it. I recentl tried deep fried shrimp heads (not on the menu) and was blown away at how good it was! It's definitely something I would never imagine to be delicious. 
The service is is great. The food comes out quick and all the workers are always very friendly!"}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat, made-to-order, delicious and fresh sushi for $25.  Best.  Sushi.  Eh-var.  It's not the on strip, so every time my husband and I want to come here we have to find it again, but it's SO WORTH IT.  Great selection, great quality...I don't know what else to say to convince you to ignore all other sushi places on the strip and just come here."}
{"text":"Quality of sushi is really good. There are plenty of other options included with the AYCE sushi plus dessert!! I wish they carried asahi black though."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is getting any positive reviews. The fish did not taste fresh and basically all tasted the exact same. Even the rolls were not very good... If you are going to do AYCE sushi skip out on Sushi Mon. I would suggest Sumo Sushi 2 for a larger menu, better atmosphere, and much much better sushi."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Las Vegas we gotta stop by here and get our sushi fix!!! Love that u can customize your order and they accommodate you no extra charge !! Always eat the all u can eat ! Only $26.95 plus tax . Awesome deal and during dinner you can get amaebi."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I have even been to. We got beef, cucumber salad, California rolls and noodle soup. The meal was huge and quite inexpensive. We always have a good time here. Drinks are very affordable. Wine only 4.50 which is very unsual for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!  All you can eat menu includes amazing surprises like saki shooters, fried oysters, salmon potato cup, and jumbo tempura shrimp.  The cajun albacore is a must-try.  Oh, and don't get me started on the spider roll...  Mmm... Amaebi... (sweet shrimp)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I will never go here again after what I saw in the kitchen through the kitchens door, yuck!!!!!!, the floor was nasty, there were two employees working without gloves, I always loved going here but I don't have confidence in this location any longer with the sushi I would get here any longer. Maybe by giving this info they will be able to clean up their act and maybe in the future regain my trust but I doubt it seeing what I saw, to me that was just nasty and they should have more pride with what they do dealing with food and the public."}
{"text":"Really terrible service but the food was good. Servers are really slow, i saw our food sitting at the bar for 10mins while the servers are chatting it up and watching tv. I will not be coming back to this place. We'll just stick to Goyemon or Umiya."}
{"text":"The sushi is below average. The place is very very small. So small you can almost smell the bathroom. Service is not so great. 

For the price you pay which is around $25, Its better to go to a better (same price) AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"Always love their salmon everything! My boyfriend and I go for the All-You-Can-Eat Sushi. It's worth it. Everything smells and appears fresh and the sushi chefs are fast and polite with a smile on their face. I like eating where the staff are happy too. I don't see a high turn-over rate here and the wait staff are always checking to see if you need anything. Good for families, groups, couple, and eating alone. Get here early as there is always a wait at a good place like this!"}
{"text":"AYCE amazingness.

I'm always looking for great sushi. This place is an institution in this town. It's a go-to sushi place when you want it done right and don't want to take any chances.

It's not particularly close to my where I live, so I don't go as often as I used to, but my friend was in town recently and she requested this place and I could not for the life of me remember why I don't go more often. Yum.

I do hate waiting for a table, but this place is worth it.

I usually stick with the nigiri here. To get more bang for my buck. The fish is always fresh. Unagi, super white tuna, spicy tuna, snapper, salmon skin handroll, yellowtail collar and salmon. There are some good specialty rolls that I get as well. The JJ, 911, and a really refreshing one I love, but the name escapes me at the moment. Probably a good idea to order half rolls to save space.

This place is a safe bet. You never know what you're getting with AYCE, but this place always makes me happy. A little more expensive than some, but definitely worth it.

Make sure to get your card stamped to earn a free AYCE!"}
{"text":"Can not beat the quality of this place for the price highly recommend this to everyone! Oh and they're open super late."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 8 and they let split with some who did AYCE and others order from the lunch menu. I ordered from the lunch menu - sushi lunch which came with some nigiri and a few pieces of cali roll. It was just ok, not great. 

I watched my friends eat the AYCE and it didn't look good. They also said it wasn't the freshest and the slices of fish were small.

There are many other AYCE options in Vegas for consideration."}
{"text":"We loved our sushi.  Loved the picture menus!  So helpful.  Our waitress was also very nice and informative.  We both enjoyed everything we ate (we did not get AYCE).  I really liked the salad dressing.  Just wish there was more seating!  Definitely going to be our go-to sushi spot from now on - when we can get in.  :-)"}
{"text":"What was once my least favorite sushi spot, is now my go-to for late night AYCE! I have always loved the friendly service from George, but there was always something missing for me when it came to the food. Thankfully that has changed. The freshness and quality of the food has improved drastically. So much that I'm here at least once a week. Good for them, bad for my diet. Hah! 

Like I said, I'm here for the AYCE most of the time. The Lemon Roll is my all time favorite, along with steamed shumai, and fried chicken. However, when I'm not feeling sushi I opt for a bowl of shrimp tempura udon, which always hits the spot. 

The only downside to Sushi Mon is there are no to go container for soups, which means I can't order my favorite udon as take out. It's okay though, I'll continue to come back as long as the fish remains fresh and the smiles & good service are plentiful."}
