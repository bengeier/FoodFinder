{"text":"At 4:06pm on 6:19/2016 I placed a carry out order for two chili chicken.
They served me with old left over food from lunch.
I had Chili chicken plenty of times before and I know the difference between freshly cooked food and old left over food, very well."}
{"text":"We just moved out here this year.  We've been to 3 indian restaurants in Vegas so far, and this one is the best by far!  Soups are fantastic, the vindaloo, rogan josh and curry dishes are awesome, and the drinks are reasonably priced.

Best indian restaurant in Vegas IMO."}
{"text":"I liked the food and excellent service.
Food has a special taste.
Indian food has a taste authentic.
There is no difference between Indian Masala and Indian restaurants in India

{"text":"This has been a frequent spot but recently the food quality has gone bad. These guys used to have a good dosa around. Few of us came by dinner and were served dosas which were very sour ... old batter I think probably a few days old. Was not a good experience at all :(

We said this and it didn't look like the chef cared much."}
{"text":"Groupon users beware!! We used a groupon of $30 in value and they charged us for 18% gratuity! It was NOT mentioned anywhere in Groupon or at the restaurant. 
To the restaurant owner, if you cant afford to give any promotional offer then please dont! Stop trying to rip off Groupon users!"}
{"text":"Absolute gem! The food is so tasty and delicious, service is really friendly and the prices are low. This is a nice quiet place at dinner time - probably more busy on buffet hours."}
{"text":"I was suspicious about the great reviews, but being a lover of Indian food, had to find out for myself. Don't believe the hype and fake reviews. While the interior is nicely decorated, the food quality and selection is mediocre at best. They have about 15-20 selections and NOT the 45 items that another review claims. Surprisingly, they lacked the standard staples of lunch buffets like pakora, samosas, saag, and even kheer. While the naan and chutneys were ok, the currys and dahl were subpar. They tasted watered down and lacked the spice and complexity that they ought to have. According to their website, they were supposed to have some Indo-Chinese type dishes in their buffet but those items were completely absent. For dessert, they had some weird vermicelli served in a warm and sweet milk, reminiscent of kheer, but not tasting very good. Regardless, now that I know better, I'll be sticking with my tried and true favorites, i.e. Mt. Everest."}
{"text":"Came in around 6:15 on a Friday night for dinner. When we got there, there was only one other party seated. Thankfully we ordered before the other party, or else I don't know when we would have gotten our food! Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chana Masala. For about 40-45 minutes after we ordered, we watched 3-4 employees walk in and out of the kitchen with no food. When the food did come, it was absolutely delicious!!! We thought maybe there was only one cook who had to make one dish at a time. However, in those 45 minutes the restaurant filled up with 7-8 tables. If the first people to order had to wait 45 minutes for their two dishes, I hope the last people who ordered weren't sitting around for hours waiting for theirs..."}
{"text":"This place had one of the best indian food I have had!! The chicken tikka masala was amazing...a good variety for their lunch buffet...and usually u get a good discount coupon on yelp that helps..."}
{"text":"I recently was in Vegas and had gone on Yelp for some tips to find out where the locals eat. India Masala offered a deal and had great reviews so I gave it a whirl. Upon entering, the host greeting me with a kind smile and quickly seated me at a nice table overlooking the dining room. Having pre-perused the menu, I knew I was going to try the Tandoori Dinner, as it offered a variety of menu samplings including Tandoori chicken, garlic chicken, chicken tikka & chicken sheesh kabab. I placed my order and enjoyed the ambiance of the dining room and watching the staff prepare for a large group of 40. Before I knew it,  my huge plate of deliciousness arrived with a basket of warm naan. My server was very attentive and consistently filled my water, all while starting to seat the large party. Everything was delicious and very filling- so much so that I had a 1/2 of plate to take back for midnight munchies or well, lets be honest since it is Vegas- 4a munchies! As I sipped on my Taj Mahal beer, watching the staff attend to this party with ease, my waiter reappeared. He was bearing with my house choice dessert (included with my dinner) : Pistachio kefir which was creamy beyond belief, had just the right amount of flavor, and was perfectly smooth textured frozen goodness.  

Thank you Indian Masala for a flavorful and delightful dining experience."}
{"text":"Nice lunch buffet. The service was quick in spite of heavy crowd on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"I tried the lunch buffet and I was not the least disappointed. The food was delicious and the waiters were very attentive. The buffet offers about eight different dishes, which may seem like a small selection, but the quality of the dishes leaves you more than satisfied. I have been to buffets with a greater selection of dishes, but the chicken and vegetables are not as fresh and I end up with a stomach ache. The complimentary naan bread alone is worth the visit. The restaurant itself, the food, and the price are right. A must go to restaurant."}
{"text":"We  party of 7 went there for lunch at 11.50 . Sign said opening time is 11:30 but it was closed . So we returned hungry. So.. Bad never go back"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food was delicious. . The service was.  big thing for us.. they make sure you are well taken care off and make sure u have clean silverware and napkins every time you get a new plate"}
{"text":"Their Chicken65 is bomb!! I absolutely love it there. As a foodie, this is by far one of my favorite indian restaurant in Vegas. 

Also try the Briyani, it is infused with amazing flavors."}
{"text":"New owners... Mediocre food, terrible service. Never going back."}
{"text":"We ordered naans, chicken curry and chicken biryani to pick up in Indian Masala when we were in Vegas on vacation.
We didn't know that Indian Masala has 2 branches one on strip and one here.  we went to the one on strip and then came here, coz they said they're different.  what a waste of time!! anyways, it's our mistake to get confused.

Coming to the food.  What a horrible food.  Sooo disappointing. The naans are burnt to the core.  I somehow managed to get one small piece that wasn't burnt and it is uncooked!!! How can somebody manage to burn so much yet uncook???
Chicken was soooooo raw and had bones.  A good vet could still have saved the hen!!"}
{"text":"first time trying indian food and it's safe to say it's my new favorite. so good !!!!! staff was friendly and awesome food was delicious and super filling"}
{"text":"The WORST BUFFET ever , we walked in at 2:35 pm and they pick up their buffet at 3pm, the food was almost done and they didn't bother to refill any of the food, the rice was hard felt like left overs from last night. Curries were tasteless, low budget menu, boiled egg curry,cabbage , the appetisers were finished, over all not worth $12.95 . Rather eat mac Donald's for $10 !! Never go again , this is not what Indian food tastes like."}
{"text":"Super friendly people and someone is cooking up some delicious food in that kitchen. Came for dinner on a Tuesday, not to crowded. Had the vegetable korma which was off the hook."}
{"text":"i drove over 5 miles to get there and find out they no longer take the entertainment coupon, and won't be taking the 2015 one either ) :  the food was ok but, i don't think it's worth the drive, we have so many Indian restaurants that are better."}
{"text":"Had their buffet for lunch. Was average Indian food from my perspective. Had mango smoothie there which I did not care for. The good there had a nice variety and desert was very good sweetened rice pudding."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've had in a long time, although very spicy! I usually have the buffet but tonight I ordered off of the menu. I specifically wanted the Chicken Chili dish that I tried at one (only one unfortunately) of the buffets. Never saw it again at the buffet so had to order it for dinner. It's listed under appetizers on the menu. That made me think it wasn't a dinner sized portion. The waitress asked what spice level 1-10. Only had that asked at Thai restaurants. We ordered medium. Also ordered Saag Paneer at medium spice. I should have asked for everything to be served together because the chicken came out first. It was fresh and hot, and also blazingly spicy!!! DAMN! It was so flavorful and quite tasty with an insane depth of flavor...but SO HOT!! Couldn't stop eating it! The saag was just as hot but oh so fresh! Chunks of tomato with strands of chive on top. Could have used a little more salt I think, but a little too hot. Tongue went numb, which I don't mind if the food is outstanding. Also had rice and garlic naan with meal. I would have given 4 stars, but the spice level of the meal caused intestinal distress for a few days, which I usually experience eating Indian food. The spice level of the food at the buffet is far less than when you order off the menu. Dining here reminded me of the first time I went to Shalimar, which I thought was some HOT Indian food. I love Indian food, but for some reason gives me intestinal distress. India Masala is another great Indian restaurant in my 'hood (Mint, Ghandi, India Palace) which I am truly grateful for! Will go again and lower the spice levels. Extremely tasty food! Careful with the spice levels...10 must be unedible!"}
{"text":"My 2 stars are for the pleasant demeanor of the person who took our order.
The food was below expectations. We ordered the bhindi masala which had absolutely no salt, yellow daal which wasn't good either. The chicken Tikka masala was eatable though.
Also we ordered laccha paratha hoping to eat laccha paratha but it looked and tasted like butter nan.
Also the service was extremely slow.

Overall a disappointing experience. I would definately not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome hospitality. Very clean. Joseph, Nicole were serving us with great hospitality. Being vegetarian and indian too, we know the taste of indian dishes. We ordered papadi chaat, idly sambar, rasam, and uttpam. All there taste excellent. One note, if you love spicy, and real spicy you need to say 10/10. Try pista kulfi as dessert. Sambar, and coconut chutney was not that great but it was just Ok. Wasnt hungry much so tried only appetizers. Did not try any main course. Definitely we will come here again. Awesome place..."}
{"text":"Tried their buffet today. Below par is the nicest way I can put it.

The idli is rock solid and could be used as a weapon. Sambar is super watery contraption with oil floating on top.

You need to walk and get everything including the bread and lassi. What next ? Make the diners cook their own food ? 

The dessert was on one far corner in a tiny tray . It looked unappealing enough for me to give it a pass.

If this were the only Indian restaurant in Las Vegas , I would definitely eat here. Thank god there are better choices out there in the same general area."}
{"text":"First let me just start by saying that the food was really good. But the service could have been better. I would have given them a 4-star. The waitress was not too fond of helping me with items on the menu. When I question what's in this or I'm  looking for this she really didn't want to help me with the menu she said I don't know she just said get the buffet. The buffet actually ended up being the better deal for me and I did get the buffet but I think the waitress could have went about it in a different way."}
{"text":"There are so many options and it doesn't make you explode! Reasonably priced. Love the samosas and fritters. The Naan was delicious and they have a few different kinds. Vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food in the Vegas area. I have tried 4 different spots and this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Overpriced as hell. Ordered chicken curry and a side of rice. Total came out to be $17. Food was alright."}
{"text":"I love the food, the staffs are great. the Rogan Josh is unbelievably great! It's great with the garlic naan and the kheer for dessert just completes the meal.  The only down side is that I do delivery through Eat24 and there is a minimum $25 in order to do a delivery and the delivery takes a long time.  But all and all it's a great place to get food when you're feeling like spicy Indian food. it's yum and I love yum. :)"}
{"text":"I came here for the lunch buffet on a weekday. The food and customer service were both decent, but I'm giving them one star for the management's ridiculous antics.

I had a coupon for a free buffet which I'm guessing they tried to compensate for by tacking on 18% gratuity to a party of five. Is that even legal?! There were no signs on the menu or by the cash register to justify this. The host didn't bother to tell me that gratuity was added to my total, and the receipt wasn't itemized. My receipt only listed a \"pre-tip total\" when they had in fact already included gratuity in the total. I had to ask why the total was so high, and that's how I found how that I was already charged for tip. They're just trying to gyp their customers. No thanks."}
{"text":"Totally in love with the food and staff!! Most fun I've had in a long time!! Totally in love!!"}
{"text":"Great food, lots verities of buffet and amazing service. 
Chicken biryani is to die for. Must try this place."}
{"text":"We just stopped by to this restaurant while coming back from Utah. We took buffet for family. The food quality is awesome, they have lot of non veg variety along with nice dessert. I would recommend this restaurant to try for sure."}
{"text":"So this review isn't necessarily about the food. The food is fine, good enough comfort food with an adequate selection. This is more about the service. I used to frequent this place at lunchtime because it's decently priced, $9.99 on weekdays, $10.99 on weekends. On top of that, I'm a student so I sometimes get two for one discount coupons which is nice because I definitely live on a student budget. Let me just say that this pricing is VERY loose. It didn't take me long to realize that the price is RARELY $9.99, it's almost always $10.99 for one reason or another. For example...the restaurant is very busy, it's a \"holiday\" of some sort, or my personal favorite, \"the manager told me to raise the price today\" HAHAHA goodness. Ok then. We actually made a game of guessing what ridiculous reason we were going to be given for higher prices. Because of course 2pm on a Tuesday merits an increase in prices, right?

I had a few coupons for buy one get one free, any day of the week, between the hours of 11 and 3. Well of course that's too simple, it wasn't until after we finished eating that the...server? hostess? someone who appeared to work there? pointed to a tiny yellow sign stuck to the counter that said \"no coupons on weekends\" and she then proceeded to giggle and say sorry and mutter something about...well managers said so. I'd had it, I was done. It's just a joke of a restaurant, and having nonexistent service from start to finish, watching employees hang out on their phones and read the newspaper at the bar, no thank you. I work in a restaurant, and let me tell you, I wish my job was that easy. Thankfully, not all is lost. Delhi opened right down the street, their food is always fresh and flavorful and the staff is FANTASTIC! They remembered us after our second visit and are always so excited to see us and welcome us. On top of that, their lunch buffet is $9.99 every day, no exceptions. Heck, I'd gladly give them $12.99 and I really could care less about coupons, I want to see them do well:):) Such a better choice than India Masala!!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome tasty but service is really slow and bad. Lots of mis communication between kitchen and front desk"}
{"text":"If I could give negative reviews, I would rather do that. It's been an hour since we are sitting here and all We have gotten is Appetizers. Initially when asked they were out of 2 Appetizers that we wanted - Lamb Samosa and Mo-Mos which is one of the main reasons I came here on the first place. They were also out of the Reshmi kabob, rude waitresses, worst service, no apologies, nothing. By the time the food comes, I would have been to 2 other places..do not waste your time and money here. That's what I would suggest."}
{"text":"5 Stars all the way. Went there when visiting Las Vegas in the summer and tried the lunch buffet. It was so good that even though we wanted to go try out different places came back to this place for lunch the rest of our stay here. The food is excellent with good variety and the ambiance is nice. I would definitely recommend it to all. The food quality and taste is comparable with the Indian restaurants in the SF bay area and that was a big surprise. They should get the chef to one the restaurants here in the bay area. :)"}
{"text":"Great service.  Very clean.  Excellent food.  Just enough heat without being overpowing.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review and this review 
is for vegetarian dishes only.

Awesome! Awesome!! Awesome!!!

This place came up in yelp search 
when we were looking for indain restaurant for dinner
on one of our Vegas trips. The food here will not disappoint you
and worth it's value.

We had veggie korma and sambar-rice, both were very 
Delicious. You have an option of setting the spice level 0 to 10
For every dish and you get what you ask for.

Service was very friendly and we got complimentary 
Mango lassi since their kitchen was little behind and we were waiting for our food 
to be served.

Overall very positive experience and would love to go back
when we are back in Vegas !!

{"text":"The Indian food is amazing and authentic. We were 11 people of all ages and the food catered to everyone's taste. The buffet had decent variety of the options in comparison of the price. The ambience and the Indian music was also pleasant. They can still improve the south Indian foods menu and taste."}
{"text":"Best indian food ,;!!we had lunch buffet  delicious, chicken65, bhuna gosht very good and perfectly spiced, service was very nice impressed  ambiance 
  Try the best indian restaurant in town,."}
{"text":"Yelp deal is a big sham. I did a togo of food on a Tuesday night and the guy at the counter says the manager wont accept it. He agrees after I read him the conditions and fine print from Yelp.  An item in my order was also missing. Food is so-so. There are far better places for Indian food around."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The only issue I had was the tandoori chicken was just a little bit spicy for me.
Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The food was exquisite and service was awesome. I was there for buffet today and I totally enjoyed my time. They were so busy today still they managed to give us best service. The girl was so attentive and made us feel so comfortable. I guess the name of our server was Asmita!  sorry if I spelled it wrong. This probably should be best Indian restaurant in town. I strongly recommend this place. I will be definitely back. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Did dinner, chicken saagwala and lamb korga were great. Service was good. Prices were what they should be. Flavor was fantastic. Definitely will be a regular stop, worth driving east of the strip for."}
{"text":"Best food I ever had in my life . Thank you you india Masala/"}
{"text":"I had their lunch buffet two days in a row.everyday new items in buffet.Biggest lunch buffet in Indian Restaurant .  It did taste really good. It was spicy enough for me. I wouldn't mind even if it was a bit more spicy. (I love spicy food.)    The naan was too thin and a bit crisp for my taste. I also tasted dosa which was really good.they have a large choices for Vegan as well. I would love to come back to this place next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow this place went downhill extremely fast with the new owners. We used to come here once/twice a week . The chicken tandoori was dry, iddly tasted powdery and the curries weren't as spicy or flavorful as before. The old waitresses used to be extremely friendly as opposed to people who ignore you now. 

Their only saving grace is they make dosas and decent nan bread. Unfortunately I'm not willing to go back just for that since there are so many other Indian restaurants. They also charge 15% service fees even though you don't have six people in your party. 

I wouldn't be surprised if they closed down if they keep this up."}
{"text":"I brought my brother here on a recent visit to Vegas, he has had a lot of Indian food in Chicago, he said this was the best Indian food he ever had! We had a great dinner starting with Samosas that were delicious!  Great flavor and seasoning.  We also had Chicken Korma and Tikka, both fabulous, the Tikka is my favorite.  We enjoyed a very tasty Indian beer, Hayward's 5000, and finished with home made ice cream, mango and pistachio, both real nice.  I went back to have the lunch buffet later in the week and found many new dishes that I really enjoyed.  The Curry Chicken was just divine! The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated with very friendly servers and management.  The garlic naan is awesome! The levels of flavor in the dishes I tried were so complex and fun to eat. 
It was a pleasure to eat at India Masala, I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"This is by the far the best Indian food I have experienced in Vegas. I have dined there 8 or 9 times in the last few months. The service is great, the restaurant is beautiful and clean and the food is excellent. You can request your preferred spice level for each dish. I have dined there with Indian and non- Indian friends and we all agree the food is excellent. Was there again last night and the bar is open. They have received their liquor license and have a full bar. The lunch buffet is a great deal. Unlike many Indian buffets, the food here is fresh and the buffet area is well maintained. So why only stars? The restaurant is located in an ok area getting in and out of the parking lot is a pain."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Indian Restaurant in town. Went here for both lunch and dinner and was overwhelmingly satisfied each time.

Lunch: They're lunch buffet is HUGE! With $11, I was given a selection of 45 items. 45 dishes (15 is usually standard in any indian buffet)  in an Indian Buffet is unheard of. And it gets better. What makes India Masala stand out from its competitors  is that besides having nearly triple the quantity of dishes to choose from for less than $11, you're always in for a surprise. Unlike other traditional indian buffets, the items on the buffet at India Masala change everyday. Some traditional items such as Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Dal Makkhani etc. remain, but for the most part, dishes change each day. Also, it features both North & South Indian dishes in their buffet. In the end, best Indian buffet in Vegas. 

Dinner: When i step into any restaurant, there are 3 things I stick my neck out for: Food, Ambience, & Service. The food is phenomenal. My friends and I ordered a Family Dosa. Its a BIG BIG CREPE about 4 feet long! Also, I had the Chicken 65 as an appetizer, Lamb Madras Curry, and Garlic Nan. Chicken 65 was highly recommend by our server. It didn't disappoint. It was a dry red chicken. The flavor was quite different and thus hard to explain. All I remember is that each bite felt electric, literally. Lamb Madras Curry was also great. I ordered a spice level 7 and it was PERFECT. The curry had a great depth of flavor. Ambience is very beautiful. As for the service, this restaurant knows what it is doing. They're service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner because a friend of mine told me about this place and I have to say I wasn't just served a meal like all the other restaurants do here in town I feel like I was given a great EXPERIENCE for the short while i was there. the staff was extremely knowledgeable about the food there which was great because I am not too familiar with it and after my food order was taken the bartender (whom was extremely beautiful and charming) came and personally took my drink order even though the place was pretty busy! She made me their signature India Masala cocktail and it was hands down the best cocktail I've ever had in my life hats off to the bartender. The food came out in a reasonable time and the food was amazing, best food I've had in years I gave my compliments to the chef. The prices were very reasonable and as I was leaving they acknowledged I was leaving, gave mea big smile, and said to come back again and it was a pleasure to have me. They hit all the notes to what wonderful customer service is and I am definetely going back there again soon!"}
{"text":"Good food and good company. I really like a food there. One of the best Indian food in Las Vegas. They have a new management and also new cook. Please don't miss to try again in India masala. I hope you also go and try food."}
{"text":"I'd probably give it a 3 1/2. It was close to my hotel and that was a bonus, but after hearing about the neighborhood I had it delivered. I got the chicken korma- which was tasty, BUT SPIIIICY- which I asked for. For $14, though, I'd kinda expect rice with it. Nada. 

The samosas were pretty good, not the best, not the worst. Needed more spicing. Tamarind dipping sauce was good. 

I know, I know, it's Vegas. Things are expensive. But.....it was ok. If you're craving indian, I would say it's definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"We had their buffet dinner on a Monday night.  There is a great Groupon deal for this place. For an extremely reasonable $17 (includes wine, beer, or lassi) you can gorge yourself on a large selection of dishes.  The samosas were extremely fresh even though we got there around 8:30 pm and they were close to closing.  They also brought more out while we where there.  Freshly baked naan is delivered to your table.  Dishes were very rich/greasy but let's face it, that's what we love about Indian food.  I thought there was a larger selection than most Indian buffets including the most amazingly delicious yellow dal I have ever had!!!!!  My mouth is watering right now.  Also, the only people there when we went were Indians"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner. Table was good and was a soft and friendly service. Would recommend pple to try it out. 
Got a free lassi to check in though. 
I gave them only five stars.. Wish I could give them more. Food is great. Sharp test and finely cooked. Gulped all that came to the table. Sorry don't have much space to fill. But will visit when empty. Thanks team of Delhi Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"This review is for the BUFFET ONLY. Since I was so pleased with my food when I visited last time, I thought about trying the buffet. They had 3 types of chicken; tikka masala, tandoori and something called chicken veduppu(spelling?). I had a small piece of the veddupu chicken and it was really good and seemed to have good flavor. The tikka masala was ok.

I was hoping for atleast a couple of options of the indo chinese dishes, but all they had was a schezwan veggie dish, which was super super spicy and I could just have a few bites. They also had dosas which though fresh were not crisp, and were wrongly labeled as utthapam. About the labels-I would suggest that they take care to label food properly, as they had labeled the potato mix that goes with dosas as aloo gobhi(cauliflower potato). The mix itself was ok and had very large pieces of potato and was obviously not the original stuff served with dosas. So the 2 things I was looking forward to-south indian and indo chinese were seriously lacking in taste.
For veggies, they had a few options-okra, black dal, some veg curry. I tried a bit of the okra and dal and they were just ok.

Desert was pretty blah too: pink colored fruit custard and halwa. They need to really consider labeling and arranging the food in a logical order, as I remember standing in the middle of the buffet looking for rice, as it was placed next to the desert. The halwa was labeled 'kesari' which I think is a south indian version of halwa so I knew it was desert. However, for my non hindi speaking friends, it might have been confusing as it was placed next to the rice and could have passed off as a savory dish.

I guess these are initial glitches and I do hope they improve, as I would love to have one indian restaurant in Vegas that serves consistently good food."}

Our server was Pawan 
He is professional and the best 
Suggest us some good wine and food .
Thanks India masala"}
{"text":"As soon as we reached vegas we were in search of some comfort, authentic food. While we were browsing this on yelp we stumbled upon india masala bar and grill. As weird as it may seem they had one of the excellent rasam ( A soup) i've ever tasted. Dinner was as well a buffet spread with neat array of items ranging from south indian to north indian. Surprisingly the sambhar,rasam,pakoras were mind blowing and mango lassi was nothing short of stupendous. Garlic naan was so soft and flavourful.

The front desk staff was very cheerful and attentive. The buffet price was pretty kind on the wallet too. I believe if you take some buffet food to-go its a couple of dollars cheaper, but i've no idea what you may be able to fit in a box in their wide selection of delicacies."}
{"text":"Very clean and new inside. Plenty of tables.  Shiny dark wood-grain finished tables that don't need a table cloth. You will need to ask for more yoghurt if it's too spicy for you. Good service too, but it wasn't crowded as we got there very early   The best Indian food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"A restaurant can be judged by it's chutneys.. This statement holds very true for india masala..! Loved the food. Highly recommend aloo paratha, fish curry and yellow dal.. Dosa was fresh and delicious as well.."}
{"text":"Really liked the food here and it was quick and easy. Just the right amount of heat. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Breakfast items are good. Worst Biryani I ever had. Really disappointed. Please remove the name Hyderabad chicken Dum from your menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I went for the lunch buffet and the scents draw you in from the moment you walk through the door.  There were SO many delicious options to choose from that I didn't even know where to begin.  The naan is the best I've ever had - and I've lived in India.  There is something about the way the flavors of the food blend together so perfectly, the chef has created a truly magical experience for you.  The staff is also very friendly and attentive.  I really just can't say enough about how fantastic this restaurant is.  I go back anytime I'm in the area!"}

{"text":"I had excellent Chicken Biryani, short and simple. The Chicken was tender, not dry, and the spice level was exactly what I asked for (medium). The service was very good as well. My Vegetarian dining companions had nothing but praise for their Masala Dosas as well."}
{"text":"The service at India Masala was good. I went with my friend because he said the food was so good...different taste buds. I found the food (the buffet) to be average. That's because I've had so much better. It's tough to find good Indian food in the area, and I've tried. This also is the case when there are Indian people cooking the food, so I don't get it."}
{"text":"An authentic taste of India 
All of our choices were very tasty and well spiced, attentive service and a reasonable price will ensure our return.
I had the mutton Vindaloo and my guests had lamb sag, the naans were nice a fluffy with good flavour and the lassi was well made"}
{"text":"After seeing the rating and reviews, we were expecting a really good food. The ambience and customer service are good but the lunch buffet was not upto the mark. The curries and the Briyani does not have salt at all and no taste. And the deserts don't have sugar."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place, so we ended up checking it out mid-week for some Lunch Buffet action!!! Place was fairly busy, wait-staff were friendly and we were seated immediately.

The food: This is where they lose 2 stars. While the curries are ok and all, the choices are very limited (and rather uninspiring). The meat items were generic, altho the Butter Chicken was quite delish compared to the rest (but I've had better). No beef/lamb/goat/seaffood options. A bit vanilla if you ask me...

The Garlic-Naan though was AMAZING! Some of the best Naan I've had in recent years. Def recommend getting those1

Customer service was superb. Only wish the curry choices and quality were a bit better."}
{"text":"Indian food. Good buffet option for lunch for both veg and non veg."}
{"text":"Id you are in the area and love indian food(or havent tried it before) i HIGHLY recommend coming here. This is my favorite Indian restaurant on/near the las vegas strip. 

Try the chicken tikka masala with a side of garlic naan and you will not be disappointed.

Service is great, the servers are very friendly and make sure that you are completely satisfied with your meal. 

If you come during lunch hours try the buffet, they have a huge selection and everything is delicious"}
{"text":"Ever since they switched owners last year their food quality and service has declined. I haven't been there in over 6 months and decided to drop by to get my Indian food fix. I placed my order with a young girl who is very unexperienced and the place was empty it took almost 30 minutes for my food to come out. When she brought my food a party of six sat down and she forgot my serving plate. I asked for a plate but she was panicking because she had a party of six to take care of now. She also forgot my Naan bread and it took another 5 minutes to get that. My food was getting cold I almost walked out. I will not come back just because of bad service but also the taste of the food has changed. Not as good as it used to be. For a long time this was my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet. Nice selection of dishes. Tasty food. Service was good. Mango lassi was delicious and a great portion compared to a lot of places. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed. Large selection of entree dishes, no Saag Paneer though?!?! Everthing was good, just not extraordinary. Seems like they go for quantity over quality. I will say the custard with fruit was some of the best ive had. Service was friendly and attentive. Overall decent but Mint a mile west on Flamingo has much better food, though a smaller selection."}
{"text":"The best Indian Food restaurant in town! That is my opinion. I say this as I love their buffet. I was a customer of theirs for 20 + years when they were on Sahara and then Paradise. Food is always fresh and good with the oven baked bread. The Goat Curry is quite tasty as is their other dishes both Vegetarian and  meat dishes. The Samosas are great and the rice excellent! I am sorry they moved from the old location!"}
{"text":"Had their buffet on a Sunday between 11am to 3pm. The Indian food was mediocre and it tasted and looked like it was reheated from yesterday. And what's up with the quantity of chicken? There is a chicken tiki masala with barely any chicken! I had to scrape the tray to find any kinds of chicken.

The chicken tandoori was the only thing that made the meal decent. The naan was okay too.

The server was really nice and the place looked clean. But seriously the buffet was not worth it. Cook some new food daily and maybe you'll get more clients."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience. I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and my GF had the Korma, both were perfectly spiced and had amazing flavors. The Naan was the best I've ever had. Service was good and prompt even though our waiter had the personality of a neatly folded napkin. I would highly recommend this place and get the Groupon deal. Well worth it!."}
{"text":"Had their buffet during a recent trip to Vegas and came back extremely dissatisfied.  Will not go back there again.  The selection was small.   The food did not taste good.  Their rasam was over the top spicy (I eat super spicy but this was insane!) and was floating in oil.  The owner/host told me that he had never tasted rasam before and thought that the base of the rasam was oil...LOL!!  They need to get a new chef who really knows how to cook Indian food.
Mini dosa was good, but the only chutney they had was made of tomato and was tasteless (seriously how can anyone ruin tomato chutney!!).  They charge $9.99 for their buffet..such a waste of money!!   You pay just a couple bucks more and you get excellent and super tasty food at Mint."}
{"text":"I would put this as a 2.5 star joint. It's not like it was bad by any means.. but not a place where I see myself returning to anytime soon.

First, I saw the groupon for this spot. This was the only Indian restaurant that accepts groupon for their buffets, as the others you can only use it for a la carte. But, the lunch buffet is only 9.99, and the groupon is only available for food.

Walking in, the layout is pretty nice. Everything is very clean and well kept. After sitting down, I ordered a free mango lassi that is available with a yelp check in. Out of all the mango lassi's that I've had, India Masala probably makes my least favorite. I think the yogurt they were using was about to turn, because it had a sort of cheesy taste. Also, the mango flavor was too light. It tasted more like a lassi with mango, rather than a mango lassi.

Onto the food. The selection here is quite small compared to most places. The only thing that I liked was the pakora, aka the vegetable fritters. They were crispy and well seasoned. The rest of the items were pretty bland, nothing really stood out. Also, the palek paneer was pretty gross. As for the naan, it was a little bit doughy on the inside.

Delhi is still my go to place, followed by Mint. Since they are basically all the same price for their lunch menu, I think I'll stick to my favorites."}
{"text":"This place has now merged with Indian Oven, but they don't seem to have decided upon a name.  I went for a weekday lunch last week.  I was fairly happy with the buffet.

The buffet itself is not huge, it has about four vegetarian and four non-veggie entrees.  It also includes drinks (lemonade, mango lassi) and freshly made naan bread.  I enjoyed the chicken tikka masala and the chicken tandoori. They were fairly generic but good.  Service was adequate and the restaurant is nice.

All in all, it was a nice experience if not extraordinary as far as Indian buffets go.

(this review has been posted under both restaurants as they are now one and the same)"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  I'm always comparing indian restaurants.  I always find something wrong but honestly speaking I could not find a single thing wrong with this place.  The staff was great and caring.  I overheard them trying to find a taxi for some tourist.  The food was really good. I had paneer butter masala and unlike other paneer dishes this was not oily at all and the naan was soft, which I love.  I hate crunchy and chewy naan.  I took butter chicken and gobi manchurian, which is a south indian dish, home for my boyfriend and he LOVED it.  I am a vegetarian so according to my boyfriend the meat dish was really good.  I will be coming back for sure, especially when I'm feeling homesick :)"}
{"text":"Finally after two years I found a proper curry house. As a Brit I've been spoiled buy eating at some of the best Indian restaurant in the UK.  This is now in my top 5 best Indian restaurants. Food was hot (not the spicy type of hot)! and very fresh and has a really good home made flavor to it. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered through postmates. Took 2 hours to get the food. My courier was waiting on tandoori chicken therefore by the time it got to my house, the veggie pankoras were stale. And I did not receive my green salad. Disappointed bc I pod $77 for an incomplete order. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"We went for dinner here. Restaurant looked good with 5-6 tables occupied. I was craving for dosa and looking at pictures, we decided to go here.
1st disappointment- I ordered for dosa. After 5 minutes, I was told sorry no dosas available and the reason being chef has to switch from making rice/sabjis (curries) to make dosa, which is not possible!!! Then why is that on the menu??? 
2nd disappointment - after waiting for close to half n hour, there was no sign of food coming. When we asked about it, they said it's almost done. They served half of the order in next 10 mins and rest half was not coming. Next excuse they made is chef is new, so it's taking time. That too when not even half of the restaurant was full!!! By then i was fed up with their excuses.
Finally after 40 mins of wait my plate came. 
3rd disappointment - The food. My veg thali didn't have daal (the reason why i choose north Indian thali over south Indian). Palak paneer and naan were good.
Chole and matar paneer were not nice. So as gobi manchurian. They did offer 10% discount on our bill for the late serve. But we wanted good food and service, both were missing. Who wants to waste time on a vegas trip and get a bad experience!!"}
{"text":"We had a coupon and tried this delightful restaurant on a quiet Thursday evening.  Delicious dishes (just a little bite - not too spicy) and great garlic naan.  The pistachio ice cream was a great way to finish!  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian buffet with twice the vegetarian options than regular Indian buffets. The garlic naan is the best I have tried.(Freshly made). They bring it to you to your table, it is not out out the buffet but I is still included in the price of $12.99 per person.   The spice level is just wonderful, it is a little higher than mild (which stands out from most buffets) Definetly best Indian food in town.  We went at 1pm and there was not wait. Clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"First thing we noticed as soon as we entered into India Masala was that the restaurant was busy, and most customers were Indian. A good sign! Right?

After we finished the lunch buffet, all we could say... mediocre at best.

They have very limited selections, so we went with chicken curry and goat curry. The chicken curry was undercooked and watery. Naan was ok but rice was not.

Also, the service was slow - I had to wave my hand to get the water, and the server even complained that they were too busy. Yeah, I could see that because Tandoori chicken tray was left empty for the entire period of our lunch time.

If you think a limited selection and empty trays are the best way to maximize profit from a buffet deal, you won't be in this business long.

Considering that there are many great Indian restaurants, including Delhi Indian Cuisine, India Palace and Mount Everest, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food.  The buffet had more choices than any Indian restaurant I've ever been to, and it was presented in a clean and tidy area.  Mango lassies and lemonade and another drink were also included in the buffet price.  Butter chicken was so good as was the vegetable korma (my absolute favorite).  Great salad fixings too.  Dosa was also on the buffet and was perfect.  The server was very friendly and efficient, our water glasses were filled several times during our meal.  We have found the perfect spot for Indian food in Las Vegas and will be there every time we visit."}
{"text":"I have no idea who writes these reviews, but this place has been waaaay overrated. Friends, maybe?   I am Indian and have been on a endless search for the best Indian food (still searching).   I figure if a place can do a decent Indian lunch buffet then they atleast serious about cooking authentic Indian food during non-buffet times.

 I went for the lunch buffet, which I admit must be mildly seasoned to broaden customer appeal yet can't be too costly for the restaurant to make a profit, but I expect flavorful seasoning and variety. Everything was underseasoned, not enough salt or hot spice...there really was none. 

The buffet had the appearance of being bountiful because of the meat and vegetables were in the front buffet. It definitely captivate the eyes and stomach of customer.  However once at the buffet I found it not logically flowing once at the buffet.  It does not flow logically, which would be flowing from appetizers and papadums, to rice, noodles, and breads then veggies and meats.  Here the buffet started  with plates, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, fish curry, daals, vegetable curries...all very soupy items that probably should have rice or a starch served first so the sop up the gravies.   In addition, too much repetition. 5 Proteins- 1 fish curry and 4 types of chicken (tandoori, wings, tikka, and curry),  4 daals, and 2 batter fried vegetable and 2 cheap starchy filed vegetable dishes...a gobi filled with chana and a \"vegetable\" curry dominated by potatoes and peas. Not reflective of the delicious quality vegetables dishes Indian cuisine has been admired for.  No paneer, as a vegetarian source of complete protein instead of ANOTHER chicken dish?

Furthermore, a very disjointed buffet offering, sambar without idli or dosa? mint chutney and tamarind chutney without samosa or chaat?  Come on!  You give the facade of bounty, but it is incomplete.  You know better, but undermine true Indian Buffet fans in order to cut costs. There are a ton of Indian buffets that are better for the same price and most are around you.

While this commonly happens at most buffets, it seem to be with every gravy dish... all the \"good\" stuff was gone and it seemed once it was finished, it was finished. Yet coming at 1 PM and the buffet is from 11:30 to 3:00 pm...I do expect it to be replenished, but didn't see it happen in the 45 minutes I was there.  

Understandably the dishes were mild, but there should be some \"hot\" sauce/condiment offered...I didn't see any, but I also never asked for any.  

Out of all the dishes the tandoori chicken was the best, it remained juicy yet it was still underseasoned and DEFINITELY NOT cooked in a tandoori.

One of the more promising things about the restaurant was that the atmosphere was \"nice\" and up to date and most importantly the service was way above par of most Indian restaurants...as an Indian it is rare to get treated as well as \"non-Indian\" customers.  Here our water glasses were never less than half full, and they appropriately checked on us from time to time without fussing or discriminating."}
{"text":"This was a great find off the strip!  Very good Indian food with very nice servers. I walked in and it was dead but the food was fantastic!  Give it try when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was once my favorite Indian place until it the change in owners. My wife ordered veggie pakoras for an app and couldn't stand the way they tasted. It was all breading and had a texture as if they were stale. She waited 15 minutes to get her appetizer. We then waited another 45 minutes to get our main dishes. I ordered aloo gobi and she ordered a fish curry. 3/4 of my bowl was oil! I took one bite of my dish and couldn't stomach to eat more. It had absolutely NO flavor and just tasted like grease and oil!!!! 

My wife said her curry lacked flavor as well. The waitresses were extremely nice and attentive. Unfortunately, we will never go back, as the food was that terrible. I am so sad the the change in owners changed the quality and taste of the food. Now, I'm back searching for some good Indian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"It is buffet only place.  Has both vegetarian and nonveg options. Quality of food is average, nothing exciting.  My kids did not like the gulabjamuns. Kheer was just watery. Naans were slow to come. I am surprised that it was rated 4 stars on yelp especially in Vagas where there are so many great options."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly staff. Well priced for the quantity and quality of food. Enjoyed the Tandoori Sizzler.

The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because the place is not always consistent in delivery of flavors, customer service, etc. However, if that changes I will gladly give 5 stars!

Do not be afraid - the lunch buffet is consistently 4/5 stars. Depending on the cook, it can be a 5/5. Two people can eat for just over $20. Naan is included, and they will make a few extra side items for you if you get to the buffet in the last hour and things are missing.

One problem I will point out with the buffet is the white rice - test it before you just start chewing. Towards the end of the buffet service, it can get very hard. They are nice enough that if you ask for a small bowl they'd probably give it to you. 

They have a deal with Yelp, where if you check in, you get a free soft drink.

The prices are totally worth it. We've eaten at two other Indian places within a mile of here (one in the Rio hotel and one in the plaza across from the Hard Rock) and both were of similar quality and taste to India Masala. Here, you will get better service and the same quality food for a great price.

I would recommend this place to friends and family when they visit, so I suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"We came here after seeing a picture of a person with dosa and weren't we glad we tried it out! We ordered a channa batura and a masala dosa as enterees and the gobi manchurian as starter. All the dishes were very authentic and tasty. The spice levels were exactly what we ordered too. The meal ended with a very nice masala chai. The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. This place is on my list of places to eat at in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection! And tasty! The chef came and showed me the vegan offerings. Clean and large dining room. I'm used to mild spice, and this was slightly spicy. I would definitely come again for the buffet."}
{"text":"The only people who understand Indian spice levels.The best Indian food in Las Vegas, period."}
{"text":"Great food. Huge portions. The spiciness was perfect (medium) and the waiter was great!"}
{"text":"I've come by twice for the lunch buffet, and it's one of my favorite deals in town: $12 for a limited but quality selection of Indian entrees and sides, as well as multiple house-made chutneys, fresh fruit, and a made-to-order naan and dosa station. Really, what more could you ask for? Oh, they also include mango lassi. Seriously!

The garlic naan is the first thing I get my hands on, fluffy and crispy and all for me. By far my favorite indian dish is goat curry, and I found it here on my first visit and really enjoyed it. Their tandoori chicken and various biryanis are also solid, along with their ultra-silky daal. I also like how light the batter is on their samosas and pakoras. Service while dining was attentive with refills and placing orders for additional dosas and naan, and the dining room is nicely appointed.

I don't know if they have a schedule for when they feature what dishes or if it's just based on what's in the kitchen, but definitely try any lamb or goat dishes you come across!"}
{"text":"This place had some great reviews so I figured I would give the buffet a try. I was really not impressed. First impressions were good in the door, it is nicely decorated and clean. We got there about 7 minutes after the buffet had opened but the food looked like it had already been sitting out a while with skins on the tops. We enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, rice and the naan bread, but everything else was pretty disappointing. I was also surprised they had no desserts besides fruit, most indian buffets I go to at least have rice pudding. We ordered mango lassis as well because they didnt have cold chais...which didnt really taste like mango, they were like white, sour, runny greek yogurt drinks. Honestly, I will not go back, there are much better places in town, perhaps sit down is a better experience."}
{"text":"Came with my vegan dining partner. We came at lunch and they had only the buffet but we told them we were vegan so they let us order off the menu. Although we announced we were vegan, I ordered a chai tea, and they brought me a chai with creme :( so it was quickly exchanged for a plain black tea. The spice was a tiny heavy for a 6 of 10, so use caution there. Very yummy, easy menu and good value. Very close to UNLV! Worth a try."}
{"text":"The place was clean and the decorations were fun and set the mood perfectly. We were surprised at how inexpensive the buffet was! There was such a variety of interesting flavors and dishes. I tried some things I've never had before and was very pleasantly surprised. The garlic naan was AMAZING! So yummy. The service was perfect. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place by far has the best indian food in the area. They have a large variety in their buffet and their service is commendable. The food was delicious and the biggest thing for us was that our parents who were visiting from India loved the Chai here!"}
{"text":"I had mutter methi malai, dal tadka and mixed vegetable curry.. asked them to make it spicy.. perfecto!! Good food and ambience:) will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First Indian restaurant I've tried in LV and only the second time I've had it ever. The first time I tried Indian cuisine was at a hole in the wall restaurant in New York City with my fiancé and his family and the food was amazing. I knew from the start that it would be hard to find a place to compare it to but I was extremely satisfied with my dining experience here.

My fiancé and I took his little brother visiting from the east coast out to dinner since he was craving Indian food. We started out with a round of mango lassi. The drink was very tasty but would have been far more enjoyable if it was served cold.. (it was warm). 

I'm not even going to try and remember or describe was we ate by its name because I can't recall, but we had some naan and some poori to go with the currys we ordered (one lamb and one chicken). The lamb curry was my favorite, spice level was perfect and it was cooked deliciously too. The chicken dish was tasty but my fiancés little brother took that dish as his hostage.

My only complaint would be that their server was new and it was apparent when more people decided to come in. He forgot to bring my drink (a free coke with my check in) to the table and remembered almost 10 mins later. It was no biggie though, his customer service was exceptional and we left this place with happy tummys and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worst indian Buffett in Las Vegas, empty trays, dry food, asked for refill, brought me 2 pcs of checken as replacements.. Never back again. I wished I took pics of buffet to show  the disaster, Nevada health distric needs to come investigate this place asap."}
{"text":"been wanting to try this place, and finally made it today! yummmmm! im in heaven! and for 11.99 lunch buffet?!? thats not bad at all will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We ordered over $50 worth of food here and it took nearly 2 hours to be delivered. Also, NO RICE came with any of the dishes. So after a 2 hour wait, we had to go to the grocery store to get some rice to cook with the food. I've been all over the world, including India, and this is the only restaurant that doesn't include rice with the main course. All they had to do was put a note on the menu, \"rice not included.\" Simple fix.
Food was super mediocre. The dosa was thick like a pancake, not like a crepe, and soggy. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time and finally stopped in.  Must thank yelp for the deal.

My roommate and I were hungry and the fridge was empty.  Search for a deal and boom, right next to home.  We came in around dinner time and it was fairly packed.  After, I am glad we came in when we did.  The dinner rush came in 20 mins after we did.  Service? Outstanding!!  Waiters very tentative to us, but I felt that too many different servers approached us and made it difficult to keep track.  Our waiter that took our order gave me some good recommendations since I have not had India food before.  Our first app was the chicken 65.  65 different spices, I thought dang.  I'm gonna need lots of water.  Turns out, very flavorful.  Similar to carne asada since it was served with diced onions and cilantro.  Our main was the Masala Dosa dn the Tandorri dinner.  I am first glad I didn't go with the 3 foot long dosa.  Would have been way too much.  I loved the dosa, very spicy the one I got, but also fresh.  Tandoori was very nice, plenty of different meats.  I do feel that the chicken was dry as well as the sausage (over cooked).  This probably happen since the kitchen was backed up.  My roommate loved the naan.  So great, that he ordered another basket.  We got our free mango for checking via yelp.  Very tasty drink.  From the name, I first thought it was a jelly.

Everything was great, but kitchen was overwhelmed by the rush.  Waiters did apologized many times, and we listened into the other tables complaints and all.  I felt that they handled the neighboring table well since they were upset by a mistaken order.  Others were upset by the wait. 

Overall, I'll come back.  Do want to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I am here once a week for the buffet. It's all about the butter chicken and Idilly for me. They also started a rewards system where you can collect stamps for a free buffet. 

See you there!"}
{"text":"Great Food!!  Service needs a little work.  The Naan is amazing.  Their rice is so flavorful.  Their masala curries are awesome."}
{"text":"Food tastes much better when it's made with love! The chef was incredible. He was constantly coming out and checking on the food for the buffet. He asked if we had any questions and made a special bread for my vegan friend. He told us to wait on the rice because he has fresh rice coming right out. The staff was great! Very friendly! The food was amazing! The only downfall: I over stuffed myself because the food was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice, very clean. Service was atrocious. Seated quickly, but waited forever just to order. Five tables with patrons...four wait staff just walking from one place to another doing nothing. As dishes would empty, we placed them aside in an organized manner, yet none of the wait staff bothered to clear them. We actually had a new dish brougt to our table and they simply moved aside the empty/used dishes and left them on our crowded table. Ordered the tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala. Tandoori was not as flavorful as I've had at other restaurants. Tikka was good, but it barely fed two people. I expected more for the price in terms of quality of food and service. A real disappointment, will not be a repeat diner."}
{"text":"I was treated like royalty here the food is amazing . The experience here is unforgettable. I recommend India Masala highly."}
{"text":"The Saag was ok, but lacking the strong layering of flavor that I expect in this dish. Also, the chunks of garlic were all different sizes. (Some were about 2 inches!) The chopping is so sporadic, and obviously rushed. The chicken Tikka Masala was SUPER greasy! Waaaay too much Ghee, or maybe even oil. The chicken in the Tikka Masala was grainy and powdery, and there was so little of it. Odd.

We ordered from EAT24, where it said that they're delivery fee was free. Then when we checked out, our receipt said it was a $5 charge. They said that India Masala charges $5 for delivering \"Far away\". We are literally 3 blocks from them, and THAT is considered far? What's close? If you live in the same strip mall as the restaurant? Our order took an hour and 15 minutes to arrive. We will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:15 Saturday, closed sign on door. So I peeked in(hours say open at 11am),  we were let in, and asked to wait 10-15 minutes.  25 minutes later we ask for water. 45 minutes later we were informed the buffet was now ready with a few items missing.  
  Some food items had been sittin in their stations this whole time yet the burners hadn't been turned on. I found this out by taking bites of my food, telling them certain dishes were lukewarm, seeing them turn on burners or move items around to working burners. 
With the exception of the gentleman who gave us water, took our plates from table & checked on us, staff stayed in kitchen.
We were still charged full price for buffet no apology given. Somber experience. Maybe we should have gone to Mint Indian Bistro instead, our first thought."}
{"text":"Just thinking about it OMG I want to go there.  The food is amazingly delicious.  Perfectly cooked and spiced oh so right.  Love to go there for the buffet at lunch time.  It's a steal at about $9.99 per person.  I love the ambiance, amazingly designed!  Normally the service is phenominal but the last time we were there it took a while to get the bread (which is included in the price of the buffet) and there was no unsweetened ice tea available and none ever did make it to our table (said he was brewing it).  If you like good Indian food, this is the place to go!  I rarely crave anything, but I do this place.  I would give it 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Horrible place - they ran out of buffet items at 1:30 - then kept promising that they would come in 10 minutes for the next hour."}
{"text":"Drove to the place on Wednesday 28 December only to find it closed and no one was answering the phone"}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet (~$11) and left satisfied.  The place was moderately busy and had a nice selection of the usual buffet selections.  There weren't as many veggie options as I would have liked, but the options offered were all pretty fresh and not overspiced.  Our server was nicely attentive and unobtrusive, refilling water glasses with a smile.  This place served as a welcome oasis to begin the new school year."}
{"text":"Best food in a longtime. We had saag alloo. Saag was fresh and flavorful and not too hot. Also had the best tandoori paneer. Service is great and portions generous. I will visit again and again."}
{"text":"The food was really great, everything I had in the buffet was good. The presentation was organized. The fresh made naan was a nice touch. The dining area could use some updating. My chair was dated and had stains on the seat. But again the food was good and the restaurant was clean and full of many Indian families enjoying the food."}
{"text":"The yummiest Dosa! If you have never tried one, it is like a Indian Style Fajita- that is stuffed into a crepe:) Omg! Great ambience and staff! Oh and don't forget to get the frozen mango lasse (Spelling?)"}
{"text":"I can't enough about India Masala. The food here is not your typical Indian takeout.... everything tastes so fresh and the seasonings are perfect. Even the mango laasi tastes fresh and light, with a yogurt taste to it, unlike most other Indian restaurants where it tastes like it came from an overly sweet powder or a mix. 

They also have paneer tikka masala here which is my favorite! And the butter chicken is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Nice spot to grab cheap Indian, with a great variety of choices of Northern and Southern cuisine. Portion sizes are generous and full of flavor. Lots of coupons for checking in. Onion Cilantro Naan was delicious and filling. Madras Chicken Curry was full of flavor and the perfect amount of spicy. 

Nice local spot, a good escape from the strip with friendly service."}
{"text":"This is by the far the best Indian food I have experienced in Vegas. I have dined there 8 or 9 times in the last few months. The service is great, the restaurant is beautiful and clean and the food is excellent. You can request your preferred spice level for each dish. I have dined there with Indian and non- Indian friends and we all agree the food is excellent. Was there again last night and the bar is open. They have received their liquor license and have a full bar. The lunch buffet is a great deal. Unlike many Indian buffets, the food here is fresh and the buffet area is well maintained. So why only stars? The restaurant is located in an ok area getting in and out of the parking lot is a pain."}
{"text":"The food is really tasteless, none of the biryani's are good. The chicken soup is like chicken in hot water. The appetisers were ok. The waitress was rude and was not even able to take the order properly."}
{"text":"No idea how this place got any good reviews. We went for the lunch buffet and it was awful. We arrived right when the place opened and the food was not fresh, already had a skin on it. The buffet was laid out horribly. The rice is in the back and not the front before the entrees. There were no deserts besides fruit(wheres the Kihr?). We tried almost every entree on the menu and the only one that was decent was the chicken tikka masala, the rest was either bland or sour. The goat curry had bones in it... disgusting.  Also, AVOID THE LASSI AT ALL COSTS. It was sour and I could barely get through a few sips. This either means the yogurt used had gone sour or they do not know how to make a lassi, either way it sucked. As you probably have already guessed, I will not be returning, even if they paid me. 

Do yourself a favor and drive two blocks down Flamingo and go to Mint instead! (Get a strawberry or mango lassi, it will show you how a lassi is supposed to taste)"}
{"text":"Although this is a late review but this place definitely deserves the appreciation. I loved the food over here so much that the taste lingers on my tongue even after a month. 
The service was courteous and it had very North Indian authentic taste. Its a good place close to the strip area and I hope to visit when I am next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great selection of delicious Indian plates. Good beer selections too. Very friendly waitress 
Easy parking, sat by the window, nice views.
Liked the Rack of Lamb, delicious.

{"text":"India Masala is an Indian restaurant near UNLV's campus on Flamingo.  The parking lot does get filled because a combination of India Masala, the various business around, and the small parking lot. I'm impressed with the interior, it is very nice and a huge improvement from what was there, only a few years ago.  That being said it is very nice inside but how does the rest stack up?

Well I came here with my usual large group of co-workers and they were more than accomendating.  We all did the lunch buffet which was only $9.99, the same price as Mt. Everest.  In comparison buffet wise, I do perfer Mt. Everest a lot more because they had more selection, flavor, and better quality in the non-salad and non-dessert items but India Masala is an ok substitute. So they don't have a large selection on their buffet. Their rice dish wasn't mixed well, large patches of non-mixed rice was found throughout. The curry dishes were very running, if they weren't meant to be running. But their desserts, the free mango lassi after check-in and yogurt/tapioca/pudding looking things with fruits were all very delicious. Their meat dishes and regular/garlic naans were about the same. Customer service was excellent, when a few of us decided to use our free lassi check-in offers and they gave more than enough it became awesome.

There are better Indian restaurants in the area. The food in the buffet were alright but not good enough for me to be a fan of. Maybe I'll come back for dinner or not do the buffet. They do have a happy hour from 3pm-6pm for with a drink list and 50% off selected appetizers."}
{"text":"Been here for the lunch Buffett and loved everything. Ashmita and Rohan are nice and friendly. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"clean and classy restaurant
welcoming staff and nice service.
Did not really like the buffet. May be they are showing less love in preparing lunch buffet items.
Economical Food for the ambiance and  good for groups.
Its not the best biriyani you will get in Vegas. Still i will recommend Shalimar for Best Biriyani.
Chicken Tikka masala with Nan is good.
Dosa is ok
Its not the best indian food out there but can go once. First timer might like it."}
{"text":"Rich, delicious masterpieces abound in India Masala. The dazzling dishes of Indian cuisine come together in a buffet that features a wide variety of delights, ranging from butter chicken to vegetable korma. Whether you choose the buffet or order from the menu, you won't regret visiting. Also, very beautiful Indian-themed decor. The lobby alone is welcoming."}
{"text":"What a great find in Vegas! Discovered this place through restaurant.com.

Good food, clean and spacious facility, reasonably priced, very short ride from the strip, pleasing decor. I enjoyed my meal thoroughly.

I live in in LA and visit Vegas at least 3-4 times a year. I am glad I found a good India restaurant there. Don't hesitate to try!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Indian food in Las Vegas!!!!! 
Being a Las Vegas resident and having eaten Indian food across the world, I can honestly say that India Masala is an absolute winner.  The interior is plush, comfortable, clean, and well built.  From the moment you walk in, you feel that you are transported for a dining experience half a world away.  I think what knocks out the competition are the unique and flavorful spices.  Spices I have never tasted before.  The entree melts in your mouth and wanting more and more.  The menu has everything you could ask for in an Indian restaurant, and the service was top notch.  I was also shocked at the outstanding prices.  Basically, I cant wait until I have the chance to eat there again!  Recommend for any occasion without hesitation!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good atmosphere, main entrance is welcoming, incredible flavor all around the place, good and high quality buffet, definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the extensive menu and many choices for vegan, etc.  Food was excellent quality and value.  Staff was very nice.  Don't go if you're in a hurry it's a relaxed pace."}
{"text":"One of my favorite authentic Indian place in town. Love the service and amazing food. They have the best naan in town. Love their buffet as well. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy my early dinner today, food was amazing and service was great, for sure we will be back to try the buffet!"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet...awesome mini dosas,tandoori chkn, dal rice, Ckhn biryani,yummy rice pudding!! :) only the was naan is blaah"}
{"text":"Among all Indian restaurants in Vegas, this has good food. But still, I wouldn't rate this as \"THE PLACE\" in town. There are many other places that serves equally good or better Indian food! 
My favorite includes Veg Kothu Parotta, Tandoori Chicken and Medu Vadai. I have had all kinds of biryani, idli and dosa varieties, sambar, chutneys and they are not in their strength list. 
Service and hospitality of the host is a clear differentiation factor among Indian and other type of restaurants. I don't know if it's lack of training or attitude of the servers, I yet to have a good experience at any Indian restaurants. Indian places are still vendor market. Except for a few servers like Ramesh & Jothi, rest of the folks are very unattentive and totally no coordination among themselves. They don't even know which tables they had to attend  to

Verdict - For an Indian restaurant in Vegas, this place is more than okay. For any restaurant in Vegas, this place is okay."}
{"text":"I was totally disappointed with this restaurant. Food tasted horrible and there were not many options. The staff also did not respond well when we told them the food was not hot enough. Overall, I wouldn't visit this place again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. If you're in Vegas and craving some Indian food, this is your place! I like the decoration."}
{"text":"Best food in town. Super food and super service . Loved the taste and hospitality. If you order Gujarati food there; you won't ever regret eating. Best best yummy Gujarati food. Great service great food. 
I would recommend everyone this restaurant"}
{"text":"Was really hungry and came by this one for a late lunch and was utterly disappointed. We ordered a goat and an egg biryani. The server didn't ask how spicy we wanted them and decided to make it really spicy. At the end of the meal when my wife told her that, all she had to say was \"oh\". The food was sub-par and service not that great. The only thing going on for this restaurant is the ambience. If you want mediocre food at prime rates and poor service, consider this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, I already tried the one they have on Riveira Casino. Frist impression of that place wasn't  that great. So i had spoiled potatoes in my Favorite dish (Dosa). After that i never went there. Then i heard this place, gave the frist try with our family. in the evening time wan't that busy and we had great welcome from the front desk and the waiter guy was kind enough to bring three high chairs for our baby to make the broken one replaced. he was no smile and pleasent. Bar tender dude was ecceptional and he knows what he doing. he made great magarita and his generous service was make any one happy. i tried the Chicken tika Dosa twise... really... it was that good.. Only the down fall was the shrimp biriani the shrims were bad taste like they were uncooked. 
     The waiter dude \" Santiago Fernandez\" is a collest indian waiter i ever seen. I think this dude knows what he talking about when he is explaining the food. Even he gave me wierdest messurment of the legnth of the Dosa that chef made in the kitchen. It was unacceptable but belivable fact. lols to my self..... we all happy about the service and the prices but they finally took the shrim beriani put of our bill by Manager Raj... Keep his mustache perfectly fine. $220 something dollarasss.. went down to $160 kindof....Bless me Groupon!!! 
   We will go back thats for sure and we will send more people.. more Sri Lankans of course!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was very nice, and the atmosphere was great too. However, I was rather disappointed with the food. It wasn't bad per se, it just didn't have all of the flavor and spice that Indian cuisine should have. It wasn't so much authentic \"Indian\" as it was \"Indian Lite\". Everything just tasted watered down, so I couldn't really enjoy anything I ate. 

If you like plain food or can't handle too much spice, this would be a good introduction to Indian cuisine. However, this is not the place to be if you're already a fan of Indian food.   

I won't be returning personally, but I might recommend this restaurant to my friends who are more of the \"meat and potato\" type."}
{"text":"My friend Jimmy introduced me to India Masala yesterday for the lunch buffet, it was fantastic! The flavors and aromas were terrific, the garlic Naam was delicious. Many of the dishes were new to me, the traditional Tandoori Chicken, curry noodles and rice dishes were spot on. The sauces and chutneys were a great addition to our meal. Dowside, this place is so good I will now have to drive an hour to get here to enjoy it. The decor, music and atmosphere were pleasant and inviting and very clean. The service was very good! They provided a carafe of chilled ice water, that was refreshig and removed our used plates right away. I had staved off Indian food for many years as the last buffet I attended in San Jose Ca, was so hot and spicy it was inedible, and I love hot. Do yourself a favor, try this place and let it become your new favorite restaurant. You won't be  disappointed."}
{"text":"*Review for the lunch buffet only*

My Indian buffet resume for Las Vegas thus far includes Saffron Flavors of India (Summerlin), Taj Palace (Henderson), and the neighborhood rival a few blocks down (Mint).  In general, what I look for in Indian buffets is value, variety, and flavor.  Thus far, I think Taj Palace wins in flavor, Mint has variety but seems to always underwhelm me in the flavor category, and Saffron is severely lacking in variety (no Tandoori chicken...I literally observed an angry customer lecture the waiter on the lack of tandoori chicken and then proceeded to order some on top of his buffet).  Not quite ready to proclaim India Masala as best one in town since I still need to cross off Mt. Everest and Namaste off the list, but for *value (see below) and variety, they deserve some props.  

In general, I have been surprised by the high prices for Indian buffets in Vegas compared to some other places I've lived (almost always in the double digit dollar range) and I'm at a point in my life where I no longer have the capability to polish off 3-4 plates + dessert to get my money's worth so just like an aging Greg Maddux who has to add some off-speed pitches to compensate for his slower fastball or Michael Jordan adding a fadeaway to his shot selection during the second half of his career, I too had to change up my game, and this buffet is ideally suited for my plan of attack.  

Back in college, when my roommate and I were short on cash, we would routinely compete to see who could pack the most food in the local Indian restaurant \"take out buffet\" styrofoam tray.  Over several trips, we came up with the ideal arrangement which consisted of wet items on the bottom, layer of rice to soak up some flavors but with dry side above, as much tandoori chicken as we could fit, then cushioning everything with naan and other odds and ends.  This ended up easily being the equivalent of 3-4 meals while preserving the integrity of of each item.   So when I showed up one day from my office with a short lunch break, I went with the buffet-to-go option and was ecstatic when they presented me  not only with the usual styrofoam tray, but packed my naan separately in tinfoil and gave me two additional styrofoam bowls....huzzah!  My college roommate would be nodding in approval as I packed my tray full bursting at the seams but now had two additional bowls which I could pack with soup, dessert, salad, or additional rice/or any liquid item suitable for dipping my crispy warm naan.  All in all I foraged enough food to feed a small Indian village.

In terms of variety, this is a double edged sword since like other reviewers have mentioned, this can be hit or miss both in terms of quality (some dishes soared whereas others fell flat) and the expectation of seeing your favorite dishes being present on any given day is highly variable since they do a good job (perhaps too good) of rotating dishes in and out.  I've been here 3 times, and I've seen at least 2-3 distinct dishes not present from before including sauteed okra, fish curry, egg curry, goat curry, and the occasional indo-chinese food item (definitely get this when it is available).  The setup of the restaurant inside is very clean, spacious, and welcoming and for someone that appreciates variety, I like the fact that they take chances and have something for everyone, but not everything is for everyone.  It's an educational foodie experience to see the a wide spectrum of rice dishes, unique desserts, and breads that you won't know if you will like unless it's put forth in front of you.  One glaring omission from the buffet is the samosas since I have yet to see an appearance and while taste of specific items may not be superior to other buffets across town, it definitely edges out Mint head-to-head for the lunch buffet on the east side since they are not afraid to throw in some spice and I'd much rather the items err on being bold than being bland.  3.5 stars with an extra half star bump due to the hidden value in getting their buffet to go."}
{"text":"It's about time I found a truly good indian restaurant in Las Vegas. The chicken tikka masala was delicious when paired with their perfectly cooked garlic naan. Slightly crispy as well as soft and chewy. Tried the goat curry which was nice and earthy. My date thought some parts of the meat were too tendony but I surmised that it's because when cooking such an unusual meat, they probably used most parts of the animal. 

My only true complaint was that our waiter pretty much forgot to take our order and no one else came by our table in a long time. There were only 3 other tables being served at the time! We didn't get to eat til about 40 minutes from the time we sat down. I'm willing to forgive this hopefully one-time incident because of the surprisingly good food. I was treated to a spectacle of the family-sized dosa being served at the next table. It was huge! Can't wait to come back and try it."}
{"text":"Excellent food.. I did to go box. Nicely packed. I ordered paneer batter masala with garlic naan. Both were awesome.. I loved it.."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place was amazing! Cannot say enough good things about the food here. Boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town and took a chance coming here, and I'm so glad we did! We ordered their Tandoori Chicken, Yellow Daal, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Garlic Naan. Each item was incredible, and we both agree that it's the best we've ever had. Everything was very fresh and cooked perfectly. Service was impeccable. They were very polite and attentive, and answered all of our questions about their dishes. I'm so bummed that this restaurant isn't at home, but it will definitely be our go-to place whenever we visit Vegas. SO GOOD!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.   Great food, great service,  excellent value!  I usually go for lunch and get the buffet.   The variety is definitely there: butter chicken, tiki masala, and a ton of other stuff that I don't remember the name of - all of it, ALL of it is good.  They also have a take out option for the buffet, which fits well with my busy schedule.   The naan is cooked perfectly every time, with a choice of butter or garlic with the meal. The vibe is friendly and relaxed, with really nice decor.  I will def keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I had left a good review for them before, but I think I just got lucky that day with the food. After that one time, their service sucked and the food was a disappointment. I've been there so many times now and the same thing again and again. Food takes too long to come out. Hire more staff if it's going to be busy! Their food isn't horrible thus the three stars and the location is great. Wish they just have better customer service and time management"}
{"text":"Tried several Indian restaurants in Vegas. This one is probably the worst. Food tasted super stale and looked awful too. Buffet items were of utter low quality. The server was on phone all the time even while attending us and serving food! Buffet \"broken\"-idli was dry and stale, sambhar was terrible! If you think taste is not everything, this one looses points on service, hygiene and ambience too. Overall a terrible experience!! Would not go back ever! I have no idea how this one has a 4 star rating on yelp!"}
{"text":"A tasty Indian food buffet. Not sure about the chow mein dish, seemed out of place. Service was a little spotty though. Took a long time to get our naan but it was hot and fresh when it finally arrived. I would go back."}
{"text":"Seriously good food. Seriously awful service. Even for pickup- they tell you thirty minutes; it'll take an hour. Currently sitting here 50 minutes after placing my order- I was told to pick it up in 25 minutes. Not a soul in the restaurant and still no food. Hope you like waiting."}
{"text":"The wife and I went for dinner as a spur of the moment thing. Upon walking in, we were impressed with the ambiance. It was open and airy. We were warmly greeted and seated. At the table we were our server presented us with a basket of delightfully light and crisp chips accompanied by plum and mint chutney dips. Our server was Dmitri. He was great. He was speedy without being pushy. He knew the menu and was willing to accommodate special requests.

We ordered the tilapia appetizer. The portion could have been an entree for two. The fish was appropriately flaky without being dry. It was spicy without assaulting the taste buds. I had to hold back so that I would have room for the main course. These did not disappoint. I had the lamb curry at spice level 8, and my wife had the chicken masala at spice level 3. The chicken had to be special ordered. The chicken normally used has the red-pink coloring to it. This tends to upset my wife's stomach. Dmitri was able to convey this to the chef and the chef nailed it. Most importantly, we did not have to wait any longer for this modified meal. And by the way. The chicken was amazing. Juicy, flavorful, and sliced just right. The lamb was the same. I sampled both over a nicely prepared bed of basmati rice.  I only regret not saving room for dessert. Next time.

Another impressive thing was the menu selection. Oftentimes Indian restaurants only serve regional dishes. This menu offers a full culinary tour of India. I am not one for buffets, but I might try theirs just to take the full tour.

The pricing was reasonable. Had we not ordered the tilapia and mango lassi (which was extraordinary), our meal with tip would have been about $42.00. That is a great dinner price just about anywhere, but is an exceptional value in Vegas.

This place hit the grand slam for me: ambiance, service, food, and price."}
{"text":"Mint is our usual Indian go-to restaurant but we ordered takeout at India Masala to try it out. We got the Paneer Butter Masala, Egg Biryani, an order of garlic naan and an order of vegetable samosas. The vegetable samosas come with two, but they are pretty huge and stuffed with potatoes and spices. I've never ordered paneer butter masala before but I love paneer so I had to try it. The sauce was similar to tikka masala, but lighter and the paneer didn't have as much depth since they weren't marinated. Overall though it was pretty good and a nice break from the tikka. I usually order goat biryani but tried out the egg to keep the whole order vegetarian. The description says \"fluffy eggs\" so I imagined scrambled eggs, fried rice style. However, there were probably 8 or so halved boiled eggs. It was interesting, but you have to break the eggs down to be able to eat them. It also seemed to make the whole dish salty. One thing I found strange was they never asked me what spicy level I wanted when I placed the order. This was some of the mildest Indian food I've ever had and I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if it had been spicier. Nevertheless we enjoyed the food and would probably go back to switch it up every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet.  Quality ingredients...pleasant service...  We will return when we come back to Vegas.  Do note that the buffet is only at lunchtime."}
{"text":"The service here sucks !! Do not ever go here . We waited for 30 minutes and told all the servers to get NAN and they did not get and excuse what I told others . The idly and dosa pieces were very hard . It is total waster of money"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the service was a little bit lacking.  We were seated, asked what kind of naan bread we preferred, and that was about it for any interaction.  We never did get to order a soda/beer/wine and we have no idea if ordering from a menu was an option.  We just helped ourselves to their lunch buffet after a few minutes.
The lunch buffet was really pretty awesome.  There were enough choices that we were unable to try all of them.  Everything we did try was very good.  No complaints whatsoever about the lunch buffet.  The bill for two of us was just shy of 20 bucks.  Overall a great value!!!
And yes....  We will be going back sometime with friends in tow."}
{"text":"Very limited choices, soup tastes horrible, like water with dirt from washing frying pan, meat either goat or chicken, tastes the same, no fruits, no sweets, limited drinks. Overpriced - tiny buffet like that should cost about 6 bucks, but this one cost twelve. For that price, any other buffet is better! In Texas or Fiesta you can get shrimps and fruits and sweets and beef etc etc and will be cheaper than this place!"}
{"text":"We have tried Indian food at lot of tourist places, but the Indo-chinese food and the appetizers were very tasty....the staff was also very accommodating ...........will visit again when in VEGAS"}
{"text":"Came here for evening snacks !! Pretty good South Indian servings !! Onion chilly uttapam is pretty good !! Good work guys !!"}
{"text":"Monday night epic fail, no wonder it's empty, no napkins or forks with to go order, meager portions and we must never return"}
{"text":"tried this place for the first time tonight. LOVED the food and the service was great. can't wait to come back and try different stuff"}
{"text":"Amazing food, courteous service with a smile. The food was fresh, prepared with the right mix of spices and herb. Cooked to order, the food reminded us of the food from the homeland. Will definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"We ordered for Idly & Sambar, Chicken Biryani, Chicken Curry, Kadai Paneer. Everything was very fresh and tasty. Idly was soft and was really good. Chicken Biryani was good, but not as good as curries. I would rather suggest to have curries than Biryani. Rice was also given along with the curries and was very filling."}
{"text":"Free mango lassi with checkin!! That being said, I had the lunch buffet. The highlights for me were the chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, garlic nan, and keer. The potato pancake was interesting as well. Similar to what I've had in Korean cuisine, but this one has a bit of sourness to it. There are different types of chutney and also salad. Some of the vegetarian dishes were tasty as well, but I'm disappointed there was no paneer. Overall it is good. Service is excellent as the staff was very friendly and helpful. I think we had 6 yelp checkins and they were so happy to give us our free mango lassi, so much so they even gave us an extra one. There is also pineapple n cantaloupe for those who like to end their meal with fresh fruit."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many of Indian restaurants around the valley and this is by far my favorite. The staff is always pleasant and fast. The food is always fresh and flavorful I love the butter chicken and tandoori chicken hands down the best authentic Indian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tandoori chicken is one of the best dishes here. We had garlic naan and malia kofta which were very tasty. The  service was good and the ambience was great . Will visit once again while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Taste is ok. We had goat biryani and chicken madras. The goat biryani was enough for two people. The chicken madras is enough for one person. Service is super slow and it took them a while to get the food ready. The dessert was very good. We had kheer and I think it was the best thing from the meal. Prices are fine."}
{"text":"Got a togo from this place when visiting vegas. 

The biryani was terrible! Lacked flavor and hardly any good meat in it. 

We also had to wait for a while when they were almost empty. Not a good experience for me."}
{"text":"I looooved this place. Beautiful restaurant! Food was delish, and the staff was so sincere in their friendliness :) I have already told others about it. I will be going back shortly."}
{"text":"This place is not that great. We came here thinking the food will be as good as the Riviera location but it wasn't and actually made some people in our group sick. We came in for their lunch buffet on a Sunday expecting the same quality food as their other S. Vegas blvd restaurant. The goat curry was good and thats about the only thing I liked from here. The rest of the curries were mediocre and just tasted like the cooks just werent on their A game that day. I dont know if i would try them again. I think next time i'll just go to the India Masala in the Riviera."}
{"text":"I've always has a genuine curiosity toward Indian food and this place didn't exactly kill my curiosity, but I did get my hands wet by trying food at this place. 

I went here when it just opened for dinner. We were the first customers to come in and the place was very clean and spacious. The staff greeted us kindly and sat us down. Our server got our drinks and let us be on our way to the buffet. The buffet didn't have as many selections as I was hoping, maybe a total of less than 20 dishes including the fruit and dessert. The food was hot and fresh, because they had just finished cooking it for dinner. The food itself was good with the selection given to us. You can also ask for naan bread from your server to eat with your meal, which I recommend. Their food was good, but nothing spectacular. Honestly, I can't even remember the dish names because of the unfamiliarity of Indian dishes, but they provided dishes that I would try again and at different places. The service was excellent and they took care of any problem we had, took away our dishes, filled our waters. Absolutely 0 complaints with service. Priced at around $17 for dinner, I found it a little pricy for what they provided. I would personally come in for a lunch buffet instead where it would be cheaper, but that's up to the person. I overall had a nice time here, I would just rather come in for lunch next time I go here."}
{"text":"I haven't been to to many Indian restaurants out here yet, but this one was definitely worth the 5 starts. My friend and I were in the area and just looked up Indian restaurants nearby. This came up and had 4 star reviews so we gave it a try. Went in on a Sunday before the dinner rush, just before 6pm. Not busy at all so service was quick. Food was very flavorful (delicious!). Ordered veggie somosa (yummy) and chicken masala (yummy!) with side of rice. Portion was enough to have left overs for lunch the next day. Best Monday ever having my left over Indian food from this place!"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice so far and both times I've had exceptional service!  There's a deal from yelp you can use to get $10 or $20 off your meal.  I love their masala chai, naan, their chicken tikka masala and chicken korma! They also have a great lunch selection as well. Definitely coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"The food is so good!! The buffet is so worth it!! The naan is delish and the paneer tiki masala is scrumptious!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"A little after 5 pm and the place was empty.  I thought maybe that was a bad sign but the smells from the kitchen were enticing.  We ordered the tandoori chicken, chicken masala and garlic naan bread.  Everything tasted fresh and the flavor of the meat and sauce was delicious.  The server was attentive and we didn't have to wait long for the food to arrive.  I will definitely come back and try the buffet."}
{"text":"Before you go to this restaurant thinking it's not expensive............


Minus one star because we've been waiting almost 40 minutes for a butter chicken. 2 of the many many tables are occupied. Minus another star for the shrimp biryani being almost $20 (this is a 2 out of 4 dollar sign restaurant). Minus another star for some really salty naan. Maybe it is an off night for them. Minus 1 more star because we ultimately ordered a few naans, a daal appetizer, one chicken tikka and 3 drinks (non alcoholic) and it cost $48!!!! (See attached receipt)"}
{"text":"this review is for the lunch buffet.

this is a nice-looking restaurant, big buffet- there were lots of choices, and definitely more vegetarian-friendly options than nearby mint. i think they are a little better than mint in terms of sheer flavor and spice-level- while still not where i'd like it to be, it's a little more flavorful than typical indian buffet food.

the malai kofta was good and so was the aloo gobi- the latter had a nice fresh gingery flavor.

naan was served PIPING hot but our second basket didn't make it to our table until we were almost done eating. the service was a bit tricky in general- several different people waited on us, and there was no coordination between them, and they could be a little slow. at one point we waited like 15 minutes for someone to get us drink refills, and then right after we asked one guy to get them, another was asking if we wanted refills. it was confusing and inefficient.

it's somewhere between 3 and 4 stars as far as vegas indian buffets but i am erring on the side of less stars because of one glaring buffet omission: paneer. where was the paneer? :("}
{"text":"The decor, food and staff in this place are all amazing. Our server advised us very well on what to take and it was just the right amount of food!"}
{"text":"Food is so awesome. They accommodated us after closing hours and had food prepared fresh if it was finished from the buffet. Especially, try out the chicken curry and goat curry - they are so much like home made Indian chicken curry."}
{"text":"Just had their buffet that had wonderful tikki masala, a wide range of indian dishes and various types of rice. $10 was certainly worth it! It was a wonderful experience!  We ordered a goat dish with an onion and ginger gravy. The pistachio kulfi was amazing, homemade and creamy! Demetri was a fabulous server, very attentive and caring! He even took the time to go through the buffet line and explain every dish and made helpful suggestions, the goat dish was one of them. The naan bread is fresh and hot, very delicious. We are foodies and definitely will be back, and will bring friends! Thank you for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch buffet with someone else and was very disappointed.  I've eaten at probably 10 Indian buffets before and we both thought this was the worst we had ever been to.

We were seated quickly enough and it wasn't very busy, maybe 3 or 4 tables.  The server asked what kind of naan and water we wanted.  She asked if we wanted ice water or water without ice.  We said ice water, she brought water without ice.  No big deal, but not really getting started out on the right foot.

I can't really talk about this place without comparing it to Mint, which is about 1/4 mile down the road.  The buffet is larger compared to Mint's, but the quality is much worse.  Several of the labels over food items were gone, and there was no chicken tikka masala.  Their website lists that they have both chicken tikka masala and butter chicken on the buffet, but apparently this is a lie.  I asked the server and she said they only have butter chicken.  Yes, I know the two are very similar, but here the butter chicken did not taste anything like a usual chicken tikka masala, for what it's worth.  In retrospect, going back and looking at their website, there are LOTS of things on the website that were not actually on the buffet.  In fact, I distinctly recall them having 6 chicken dishes on the buffet, one of which was not labeled, and one of which I cannot find on the website (chicken biryani).  The website has 8 dishes listed, so there are 3-4 dishes on the website that were not on the buffet, and that's just with chicken alone.  There were some oddities on the buffet, such as ranch & thousand island dressing, chow mein, and plenty of unripe fruit.  

As to the actual quality of the food, it wasn't good at all.  All of the chicken was dark meat, a good bit of it was pretty fatty/gristly, and the chili chicken breading was super soggy as if it had been sitting out for way too long.  The butter chicken tray was 95% sauce and 5% meat -- it was very difficult to find any meat in there.  The only decent thing was the naan.

For roughly the same price as the buffet at Mint which is literally 0.25 miles away and light years better, this is a pass."}
{"text":"For years the food at India Oven has been consistently excellent. In a city of restaurants I find there is a lack of good Indian options, but India Oven never disappoints. The Vindaloo is solid if you like spicy hot. Their biryani is a favorite. Also love the naan. If the quality of food is important to you, this is a great option."}
{"text":"My boss and I just happened to drive upon this place after realizing we were too early for lunch at LOS.  I am very open to any type of food and not afraid to try new things.  That being said I am not at all familiar with the assortment of dishes that I tried or the names nor am I an expert on Indian food. But I can appreciate the fact that the lunch buffet was very descriptive of the what each item was, the waiter was attentive and it's very cute inside.   One of my favorite dishes was the fruit salad in a sweet yogurt.  I can say that for $10.99 lunch buffet with a lot of choices I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas, hands down. I am Indian and have also been to every single one of them so I am speaking from some reasonable authority. Their buffet has the most selection, and each item is of good quality. Most other buffets in the area have a minimal subset by comparison. I especially liked the service, and this is the only one that serves any decent south Indian food at all."}
{"text":"Groupon led us to India Masala Bar & Grill on a Saturday night (not to be confused with India Masala on Las Vegas Blvd.). Walked in at 920pm not knowing they closed at 10pm (well I wasn't proud of that moment), but were still welcomed in with delightful smiles all around. Ordered the Tandoori sampler, Chicken Tiki Masala and cheese naan which were all ridiculously fantastic. They even had Indian beer available so we went with the Hayward 5000 (which sounds like a car instead of a beer). 

Wait staff was great, Indian music was great, decor was colorful and authentic, and food was delicious. It wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, but I kind of like it that way. The only thing I didn't really care for was the free appetizer...it was too salty and I wasn't really into either of the sauces (green and brown). Not my cup of tea but could be yours. 

They have $9.99 lunch buffets as well from 11:30am-3pm which we plan on coming back for! Will skip the tandoori sampler next time but will definitely be back for the chicken tiki masala...and want to try the kadai paneer!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! Must have on your visit to Las Vegas! Price for the buffer was right! Food variety was great and the staff was excellent! Cannot go wrong if you want to eat Indian and not sure where to go!! Thanks India grill for the great food!"}
{"text":"We were invited to have a all-you-can-eat buffet dinner at the India Oven in honor of my God daughter's graduation. We were told that it would be and all you can eat for $15. Dinner was to start at 5:30. When we got there we were told that we only had an hour to eat because they had given the restaurant to another party who was taking it at 6:30 and Beyond. Even though it wasn't all you can eat buffet according to the menu that they gave us there was hardly no food left by the time we got there. We were made rush to eat. The staff was unfriendly. And a lot of us could not eat the food because it was too spicy. My goddaughter all she had was oranges and a small salad and he still charged her the price of the entire Buffet. I got their six and had to hurry up and eat and walk out the door at 6:30. They did not inform us we only had an hour to eat and because the people that came in was of the same culture they treated us as if we were Beggars on the street and not paying customers. I will never ever eat at this a restaurant again it was my first time there and it was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Great taste with quick service. Food taste out of the world!! Tandoori Chicken is favorite. As well chille Chicken. Recommended for other."}
{"text":"What a great find! Vegas has several options for Indian cuisine but if you're looking for fresh, variety, cleanliness, great service, this is it!"}
{"text":"Ownership of this restaurant has been changed.  They have removed couple of dishes from buffet.  Everything taste the same as before.  New owner seems to care about customers. He will walk around and make sure everyone is satisfied. Place looks definitely cleaner.  The only difference is nann seems thicker than before."}
{"text":"Food was great, authentic and tasty buffet. The nana was warm, nice and flaky.  The restaurant was clean and welcoming. Inside atmosphere was pretty. The service was nice and checked on us to make sure we were all good.  Nice job guys. Thank you and the next time we are in Vegas we will check you out again."}
{"text":"Always love a good Indian buffet, and they deliver that here. Fresh, tasty, could be a little spicier, and I know it's hit or miss with other Indian buffets, but samosas would be a nice addition. Otherwise it was a good experience, and would certainly go back again."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place many times and it has become my favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. Indian food can get expensive but this is reasonable. The superb food way out weights the cost. I try different dishes each time I go and have yet to be disappointed. If you are not sure what to order or if you will like it, they have a lunch buffet that has a pretty good choice for you to sample and again very reasonable. Meat dishes are my favorite but they have a good portion of vegetarian dishes on the buffet too. Dal Makhani is my favorite vegetarian dish , but all are good. They always have 4-5 different chutney's to choose from with salad and fresh fruit. The nan bread is always fresh and the service is friendly. This is a rather new restaurant and as the word gets out it will get hard to get a table on Friday or Saturday night dinner without a wait. I would go now and be a trend setter by telling you friends. They will love you for it."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Indian food and a coupon so my BF and I decided to try this place out for dinner. We shared the tandoori chicken, Rogan Josh (heat level 5 out of 10), plain basmati rice, and garlic naan. Food was fresh, aromatic and sizzling when it arrived at our table. Service was great - waiter was super polite was always quick to fill our water. We were also there on a Sunday around 7, and one of two groups in the whole restaurant. We had a great experience and would definitely come back for dinner or to check out the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I am here indian masala restraint food is very good .cook is om sing is propanol madhuri  dixit with work almost 15 year and he is own this restraint last 4 month ago . I want to come back with my family.if you guys-want to try food here come to see indian masala !!!!!"}
{"text":"The low rating is due mostly to the poor customer service received at this restaurant.  I think there are better indian restaurants in vegas and I would not come back here again.  Waited forever sitting at the table before getting our order taken.  Had to ask for water multiple times and once my bf gave the evil eye to the manager did we finally get some help.  The place wasn't that busy either, maybe 2 - 3 tables?? I am not sure if it was because we were foreigners in the restaurant but our waiter ignored us a lot and then later seemed scared to approach our table since we were pretty upset.  When asking about menu items, it seemed like alot of them were not available that night which sucked.  The butter chicken we ordered had pieces of bone in it and had to pay extra for rice on the side.  I mean putting aside the customer service, the food was ok but I would not repeat since it was very slow service (when not busy) and the whole experience seemed pretty miserable :("}
{"text":"My wife is attending UNLV a got a 2 for 1 lunch buffets coupon for India Masala. We went in on a Saturday for lunch, They were still serving the lunch buffet, and the coupon's only restriction was that it could not be combined with and other others. Still the person we talked to when entering claimed that they don't take those coupons on weekends. I informed him that he had to and was breaking the law but he refused compliance with their coupon."}
{"text":"This place
Is excellent every single
Time . The dosa is freshly
Made to order and the naan also . Always very good buffet and excellent. Today the owner gave a homeless man some cold water outside  and that was a nice gesture .  I always enjoy this place"}
{"text":"Returned to this awesome place!  Every dish was just as delicious as the first time.  Love the samosas, pikora, spinach and the different spices!  The chai is better than any other place I've been too.  Had to order more to go!  Highly recommend India Oven Masala Bar & Grill!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant yesterday because it's one of the few Indian restaurants that serves south Indian food.  I checked the times on the website and Facebook for dinner service and arrived during what I thought was dinner service. I was told the restaurant was not seating customers because of a private party, only takeout was available. Anyone familiar with south Indian food (ie dosas) knows it doesn't lend itself to takeout so I left disappointed and doubt I will go back. So my review is for poor service (why not post on Facebook that there is no dinner service?), not the food. I would advise anyone to call before making the trip to make sure you will be served."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice Indian/Pakistani restaurant where food is authentic and servers are friendly and professional, this is the place! We never miss to go there when we're in Las Vegas! The food is extra tasty, made and served with care... A must go to place!"}
{"text":"So. Wasnt planning on buffett but that was it for lunch. Would have loved chk tikka masala but mushroom nice.  Tandori chkn great flavor but dry. Best was fresh naan baked in front of u"}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. They made special non garlic non onion food for my Mom"}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner last night as it had been awhile since we had Indian food.  Since we got there right at 5 PM which is their opening time, the place was empty and we were seated immediately.  Water was brought quickly and we also ordered regular iced tea.  The server came back and said they were out of regular iced tea and they only had the sweetened raspberry tea.  We got that instead.

For an appetizer, we ordered the medhu wada, two deep fried doughnuts made from ground lentils, rice, and black pepper.  With it was served three chutneys or sauces that added some to the dryness of the wada.  The sauces were a tomato based one, a soup, and a coconut based one.  The wadas were very flavorful and after chewing, you got the flavor of the black pepper.  When our server went to clear the dishes, she asked if we wanted to keep any of the chutneys.  I kept the soup and ate it.  It was great!

For dinner, my wife ordered the garlic chicken and I ordered Madras curry chicken, spice level 7 on a 1 to 10 basis.  We also ordered some garlic naan.  Dinner came with basmati rice.  We both liked our meals, and we had garlic chicken to bring home for another meal for one of us.  The garlic naan was good. For dessert, we shared a dish of kheer.

A couple of things keep me from ranking the place higher.  On one of the hottest days this summer, the restaurant was very warm.  I don't like freezing in a place either and I always take a denim long sleeve shirt with me.  I sure didn't need it as I was perspiring and it wasn't from the curry.  Speaking of that, 7 is not high enough for a good spice level.  Their 7 was rather tame and the curry seemed to be lacking some of the rich flavor it should have.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by Thai curry.  I think I need to stay away from indian curry.  The kheer had no pistachio chunks on it which somewhat makes the dish interesting.  I saw the photo that Westie W. posted and I thought that it was really enticing.  The no regular iced tea threw me.  I was going to ask them if I could have some hot water and a tea bag and a glass of ice.  I could have made my own.  Out of iced tea is so lame.  

We bought a Yelp deal which is in essence a $5 off deal.  This place is OK, but I won't be returning.  There are good good, fully supplied Indian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian place. This was a very satisfying lunch. And only $10. Friendly service. Pleasant ambiance - and the place is classier than in its last incarnation when it was a Mongolian Grill. I'll be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"India Masala is...okay.

I had heard about their location in Riviera but there's no way I'm braving the strip, its tourists and its prices just for Indian food. So when my wife and I saw India Masala had finally opened a second location while we were on our way to our preferred Indian buffet (Mint), we decided we had to try it.

In short, we should've just stuck with Mint. There's nothing objectively bad about India Masala. You could even make the argument that the food is a bit more flavorful than the seemingly afraid-of-spice Mint. But whether it's the decor, the service or the selection, something about this place just didn't click with me. Another disappointing contestant in a city that is, sadly, completely bereft of Indian restaurants.

And where oh where is the gulab jamun?!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Been here twice for the lunch buffet on the weekend and the food is on point. Friendly service who understand people with young children. I have yet to get the dosa at the buffet but I will keep trying."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Indian food. I have been craving indian food so my husband bought me a groupon to another place, but it just didn't compare to India Masala. I LOVE IT HERE! And the people are amazing. It's an all around wonderful experience."}
{"text":"India masala on E flamingo rd went here with friends for Dinner .
Excellent customer service .Great Indian food ..
Must eat : Tamarind rice and Bisi bele bath form rice dishes.
Gobi manchurian is a must try!!
Be careful when u order the quantity they serve is more
We went back to hotel room with lots of togo boxes and the bill was in $$$(three digit figure).

No real complaints!!
I have been to India masala on S las vegas Blvd too but that one is definitely not good  to try!!"}
{"text":"Came yesterday with my family to try this food... And they all love it !
The service was good like always and the food of course. 
There is no other place for me to eat Indian food only India masala!"}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise to find this restaurant.   We are locals and we eat out every day.  We are aware of how difficult the restaurant business is and how competitive it is.  With that in mind, we happily commend India Masala Bar & Grill to you.

It is located in a small strip mall and easily overlooked.  Don't over look it if you want delicious Indian food at a very fair price.  The naan is outstanding and you can have it buttered, honeyed, with garlic or as you choose.  The buffet is delicious and varied with plenty of vegetarian dishes that are seasoned perfectly and a lot of protein dishes with tandoori chicken, butter chicken, goat and more.

The environment is comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. Service to the table is excellent. Vegetable samosas are excellent as is the saag paneer. The yellow dal is tasty, spiced well and plentiful.   There is a full salad bar and plenty of choices.  After looking for quite a while for a tasty Indian restaurant we are delighted to have found this place.  We'll be back often and we commend it to you without reservation.   As an aside, we noted many native Indian patrons eating in this restaurant,enjoying their meals and serving as people who know and have eaten excellent Indian food all their lives.  I will not quarrel with their judgment!"}
{"text":"I discorde this place by chance.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they do buffet style lunch and made to order Naan bread, everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Brilliant food ! 
Tried it once and have become a regular ever since, the buffet line up is the best in Vegas 
The food is fresh and the most delicious Indian food I've had and also the service is great, friendly and polite, hands down and most likely will be the best Indian restaurant for the year, gotta try it. !!!"}
{"text":"Three unique must haves tl:dr'd at the end of the review. 

This place has gotten a new chef since I was last here and he has introduced two phenomenal dishes (the tandoori lamb sizzler, veg briayni, and gobi manchurian) as well as great changes to the quality of the usual dishes. Great vegetarian options. Thanks to the new chef, this is the best Indian in town 

Many Indian restaurants cut corners on the quality of ingredients and try to cover it with heavy but stuck in the back of the cupboard spices. Here, the chef took the time to marinate the lamb and chicken so the flavor went all the way through. Some places give you flavorless meat with food coloring, here the color comes from fresh spices. 

I went in mixed company of meat eaters and vegetarians, everyone loved the food. I even found myself going back into the veg bryiani, some much flavor folded into the rice. Flecks of sweet Fried onion, peas, shavings of carrot, bits of potato, fragrant of saffron. This is a veg dish I'll crave. 

Try the gobi manchurian and you'll get cauliflower that's dressed like the best orange chicken you've ever had. 

Must trys:
The tandoori sizzler (i love the lamb), the veg bryiani, the gobi manchurian."}
{"text":"u guys hav the best buffet in vegas... it's so delicious n yummy ... i tried ur buffet n i tired ur dinner too ..   u guys  r so damn perdect it's over my expectation... i highly recommended this resturant to everyobe.. u should go try this place if u  r food lover... i'm sure u will fall in love with indian food :)"}
{"text":"Their buffet is so good! My favorite is the chicken tiki masala and naan! The staff is always friendly and we've become regulars."}
{"text":"I have been to tons of Indian restaurants and it was very good , the buffet had really diverse varieties of appetizers. 
The entrees were good as well and tasty served with hot and soft Naan. 
They could have worked better on the Desserts specially the Gulabjamun which could be made of soft batter and Fruit custard shouldn't have an artificial sweetener added.
Good Indian restaurant to consider in town ."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that my family visited the restaurant 3 times in a 2 week period.  I made SURE that after I had a (small and fixable) problem the first time, that I mentioned to the \"host\" (I don't know his title, but he seated us) I made sure to mention that as an African American family we have no serious idea about what to expect, but we consider ourselves Foodies (LOL) and their restaurant is very conveniently located only steps away from our home.  I mentioned also that we planned to visit them often.  

Okay so getting to the experience...

It was a very busy lunch service and we were skipped over twice for table seating... Strike one...

When it was time to pay and leave we were overcharged, the price was more than I had seen advertised, AND they charged us for more meals than were people in our party.  Asking them (the same hist person ) to correct this seemed to insult him, and asking him to clarify why the price was different seemed to be more irritating than he could stand.  He seemed to be REALLY UPSET that I didn't already know that they \"recently changed the price.\"  Did I mention that this was my first visit to them... ok... Strike two...

Take back strike two, another man came to the cash register and heard a portion if the scene the other host person was making by challenging me to show him where I had seen the different price advertised, and he, the second guy just made him change the price for my family to end the commotion.

I left mortified because I felt like a fool being spoken to in that way, when I was a paying customer.

My daughter and I visited again a few days later, hoping to demonstrate that we LOVED the food, and if the guy could just calm down this time maybe we'd have a chance to establish a long business relationship.  I met the same host guy, reminded him that I said that we'd be nack, and he sat us down, but none of the 3 workers visiting tables even brought us water until I got up to ask for some from the bar.  The person who was clearing dishes from the table came and asked us if we'd like some naan, he set it down and walked away before I answered... it was cold...

The food on the buffet was mostly empty, we had to wait for fresh or replacement everything...  As someone was passing our table we asked if we could order a mango lassi, the man told us that a woman was our server, I asked him if SHE knew that because no one had come to our table.  She came to the table layer with a pitcher of the drink and poured it into the plastic water cups they use, which my daughter and I didn't really care about after the wait, but we were wondering if we could get some ice with that... nope... I got ice at the bar... and if THAT wasn't enough when we left and it was time to pay the host/server/guy sarcastically asked me how much was I willing to pay today (referring to my confusion about their price on my first visit.)  Strike two... I let him know that from my apartment I could see their business advertised on the side of a catering truck parked behind the restaurant and THAT is what I expected when I visited.  He told me that the truck, with their name on it doesn't belong to them... huh????  Why would I understand that???  

Ok, so glutton for punishment that I must be I went in AGAIN  alone this time and unwilling to be humiliated in from of my husband, or my daughter... wait...

I know, I know you want to know why in the H, I would even bother going back right... well I really REALLY love tandoori chicken, and like I said before steps away from home... ok...

I went in a 3rd time, and it was busy again, and I let them know that it was just me...I got an eyeroll from you know who, but I waited about 15 minutes and decided to step outside for air... the longer I stood outside the more I realized just how local I am to a LARGE number of Indian Restaurants... Mint down the street virtually on the next block, and another, India Palace, behind me on Twain... Bombay Kitchen, Urban Turban... I feel like I gave it a shot.  I really wanted to be their customer.  They didn't want my business.  STRIKE three... I'm outta there!

I gave one star for the Tandoori chicken
I gave one star because they are regularly busy, that suggests that people who know Indian Food better than I do approve...

But I removed 1 Star for each of my 3 strikes...
I can take a hint, they don't want me back... ok, now I know."}
{"text":"The food was fast but it was not fast food if you know what I mean. The garlic naam was amazing. The portions are enough for two people. Plenty of parking. Clean inside and and classy decor. Friendly staff. It's a gem! I will come back here again! :)"}
{"text":"Finding great flavors in restaurants with vegan options can be a little challenging sometimes. That is certainly not the case here. I decided to try the buffet this Saturday afternoon. There were several options that met my dietary needs, the roti came out fresh and warm my belly was certainly happy. The atmosphere is calm clean and inviting. The staff was friendly and checked on me several times with s smile. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, prices were very reasonable, service was great and the place was very nicely kept. Had one of my favorite samosas ever here, homemade to perfection. And they were very generous with the wine pour. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"nice ambiance and the wait staff was friendly.  I think there are much better indian restos in town.  My main qualm was that the food took a long time to come out and we were one of only two parties there.  There were also no togo pick ups at the time (5:30pm) so it was a little frustrating.  The other thing i didn't like was the portions were smaller than expected.  The food was a little blander than the way I like indian food, but maybe you can request a higher spice level.

As said before.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Very good!!  

I was looking for something off of the strip and find myself very pleased. 

It was pretty quiet at 8:30 pm. 
The staff was extremely polite and attentive and the food was great. 

I had shrimp tikka masala along with the variety of nan. I'm happy I listened to the waitress when she told me 10 was \"I'm on fire hot\". 7 was spicy but not too over the top for me.  
If you like garlic nan you'll be happy if you order it here."}
{"text":"Super awesome place.  Went their Sunday afternoon buffet time... We were greeted, offered good place to sit and asked if we want ice cold or room temperature water!!! Directed to Buffet area... Emple of options... Their Rayta was the BEST ever... Beryani was so amazing... plenty of veg and non-veg options... Plece is kept clean and service was fantastic. Plates were clean, no water marks or other spots and warm... BIG Plus!  There were lots of people there and place was almost full...but never ran out of food...kept refilling pots with new and freshly made food.... Highly recommended to go and enjoy your meal with friends or family...."}
{"text":"This space is really nice, the menus and music are contemporary, you can tell someone has put a lot of care and thought into this place.  The food is above-average, there are some hits and some misses.  But the real miss is how long it takes servers to bring items, such as drinks, appetizers, meals, and bills.  Tonight, as an example, it took 20 mins to get a masala chai.  There was a family of five sitting near us and they asked where their food was twice, it must have taken 40 mins for their appetizers to come out and they were just getting their food  about 45 mins later.  We had a similar experience, in which it took 30 mins for our appetizer to come out and soon thereafter, our food arrived.  This place seems to have some process issues in the kitchen, I don't know if there aren't enough people working or they have bad routines or what, but this place has to learn how to turn food faster, otherwise, people will be walking out.  They aren't the only Indian joint in town, they have some pretty stiff competition too."}
{"text":"Found HAIR in our food. No apology nothing received.

This place has gone down in taste, quality and flavored. This used to be my favorite place but last 3 times have been consistently bad.

Dosa was alright, idli was hard as rock and worst sambar ever. Naan was only thing we found good. Definitely not coming back and going to mint bistro instead."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, great atmosphere.  I came in early for dinner, and the place was pretty quiet.  I ordered the vegetarian platter.  The food was delicious, just spicy enough, but not too spicy.  The platter came with dessert, a mango pudding with fruit pieces.  Perfect ending to a delicious meal.

Update: went back a few days later for the lunch buffet.  Mostly excellent, good selection, yummy food.  One word of warning though: watch out for the peppers in the salad.  Looks like green bell peppers.  NOT green bell peppers.  Evil hot death peppers.  On a scale of 1-10 they are 13."}
{"text":"The place is nice & cozy.
We didn't care much for the food and neither their buffet, not to many options and for the price we could've gone to another buffet with a lot more options and something that we could enjoy.
The servers cell phone started ringing while we were sitting at our table and told us to hang on while he answers his call Lol"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Thursday evening after a long day of conference. Great service and delicious authentic Indian cuisine. Ordered Lamb Vindaloo off-menu and it was prepared perfectly to taste. Wife had Chicken Saagwala also prepared perfectly. Pappad with mint chutney and tamarind sauce was complimentary and was awesome. 10 minutes from the strip on Flamingo. So, convenient too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at MANY vegas indian restaurants and this one takes the cake. You HAVE to try the lunch buffet it's really the best, and overall they have the freshest, least greasy, and big variety of Indian food than any other here in Vegas. I crave it all the time lol! Nothing bad to say, and DO try their delicious mango drink or strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"Not only is this place cheap ... but its bomb ...i like this place alot better then indian mint a more down to earth home style feel ...if only if they had garlic nan :'( eh thats my only complaint ... but everything else is beautiful and that fire chicken ... is way better then the one at indian mint ... dont get me wrong that place is good too... but i just think this place is a bit better im happy i came here !!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian food i have tasted. The lemon rice was delicious, highly recommend it. The chicken tikka was juicy and favorable."}
{"text":"I am beyond irritated I called in an order at 1pm to be picked up on my lunch break at work for 6pm.  When I arrived no one seemed to have a clue what happened with my order, needless to say the man told me it would be ready \"right now.\" Which with my better judgement I guess I should have just turned away right then. I received my food after 35 minutes. Will be late back to work and has totally tarnished my opinion of this place. Will not be returning regardless of how the food tastes."}
{"text":"This relatively new restaurant is an upscale offshoot of India Masala located in the Riviera food court.  It is decent size and nicely appointed.  We shared vegetarian and tandori thalis that included a variety of vegetarian entrees and sides, pappadum with chutneys, tandori chicken, basmati rice, naan, chicken tika, and rice pudding.  Everything tasted pretty good, but I thought prices were high in relation to the quantity of food served.  On our next visit I will opt for either the luncheon buffet or order regular entrees.  

A rating of 2.5 would be more appropriate."}
{"text":"Best food . Good service . Clean restaurant and closed to Lasvegas Blvd .lots of food choice ."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian Restaurants I've tried. This is definitely a place to try if you like spicy food.

I've just finished going here for the second time and each time has been great. Both the service and the food were fantastic. The best tikka masala I've had. The chicken vindaloo is also very good. Last time we were here we got the lentil soup and it was also good.

Now for the star of the show. The fire naan! It's amazing! If you like hot and spicy food then you have to try this. Be warned though, it is hot. Both times I've been here I had to get two orders!

Our server was Rohan. Very friendly and personable. He made sure we were taken care of. He has great suggestions. His dad is the chef and he makes amazing food.

The prices are about average for an Indian place. The fire naan is a great deal at $3 dollars. I really want to try their lunch buffet some time.

So give this place a try! It's worth it."}

I have been to this place several times since its opening, service has been okay so far... but tonight it was disastrous. It took more than 10 minutes to take the order. Once order was made, food arrived in reasonable time. But after this no one cared to check our table for more than 30 minutes. The restaurant was not even busy. We finished our food and were kept waiting. Even the water was not refilled. I thought of ordering another dish and a dessert, but the lack of service made me decide against it."}
{"text":"I had to fill out my first police statement ever. Why? Because we chose to have lunch at this place. One of my family member's purse was stolen. More than theft the way the guy who claimed to be the owner (here on Yelp he is listed as manager not the owner) talked is the problem. 
Another person on table next to ours wallet was taken as well. After the manager (claiming to be the owner) showed us the horrible quality video footage, went onto say that the those ladies were standing next to our tables for 5-10 minutes and we should have been responsible enough. Instead of being understanding, he tried to divert the blame on us and the other group.
I won't ask you not to eat here, that choice is yours to make but do take precautions and hold onto your stuff tightly."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. Prices are decent. Food was amazing and so was the service. All together a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food! This is one of the top 3 meals we had while visiting Vegas. I ordered the Chicken Tikka with a side of Lemon Rice and Garlic Naan. I can't emphasize how good this was and we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"5/5 Stars, would highly recommend! I was craving Indian food and this blew my expectations away! Garlic namn was amazing, as was their butter chicken! Do yourself a favor and come try this out, right next to campus!"}

Our experience was more like 3.5 stars, but I'll give the nice attentive staff an extra half star for effort.

First off, I'm thinking, what's \"Jainism\"? This was the first time I've ever encountered an Indian restaurant that had dishes for those who observe Jain as a religion, and as a cuisine. Or at least identified as Jain on a menu. Quickly and secretly reading Wiki, I find that their cuisine consists of a refusal to eat \"bulbs\", meaning no garlic, onions, potatoes or such. Fascinating read, Jainism.

But back to the meal. We had a LOT of food, cuz we had a GROUPON, but also cuz we love so much about Indian cuisine, and simply don't go enough.

- Cuminium: A cocktail containing gin, absinthe, cumin and other things! It was actually quite interesting, and enjoyable.
- Vegetable samosas: Not the best we've had, but quite good.
- AndhraSpicy Masala Dosa: Under the \"southern Indian\" column in the menu, this was quite good. Kinda like having the samosa again, except in a crepe, dusted with a spicy powder that, like szechuan pepper, built up spice in the mouth. Great dipping sauces, including one akin to a minestrone soup? Highly recommended, and in fact, I think the \"southern\"  column, or vegetarian selections, is the way to go here. (Keep reading.)
- Flying Horse lager: Split a tall Indian beer, this one we had never before encountered, it was light but worked with the main courses.
- Shrimp Chettinadu: Billed as a 21-spice concoction (again, something we'd never before encountered), unfortunately the shrimp were overcooked. But the sauce, very dry for a sauce, was interesting enough.
- Lamb Pepper Fry: Again the protein, this time lamb, was overcooked. Tough. But the onions, grilled and raw (NOT A JAIN ITEM!) and other things made it overall tasty.

So overall we thought India Masala was about mid-way in this town for its quality of Indian cuisine. We've had worse, we've had better. I want to eventually return for the lunch buffet . (I have found that some places which aren't quite successful at dinner do quite well with their buffet.) But as for dinner, I might go back if friends insist, and only go vegetarian. Or maybe be Jain, for an evening.

ADDENDUM

Oops. Forgot to mention. I had brought a bottle of Gewurztraminer to have with dinner. Corkage was quoted as TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS! And they're not even on the Strip! So don't bother bringing your own, just order a cocktail and split a beer, as we did."}
{"text":"Service was great, Food was great, the place is very clean and the layout of the restaurant is nice. The price of the buffet is really cheap and the quality of the food is great.

Will be coming back to this place soon."}
{"text":"Food is good, place is clean. 
Need to stir buffet line food and keep it fresh. Will always love the cuisine"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Indian Food and decided to celebrate his birthday at India Masala on Flamingo because we remembered how great their buffet was on our last visit. We arrived and noticed that there weren't that many tables for dinner at 6:30 which was probably our first hint that this was not going to go well. We decided to take a booth. second mistake due to the visibility of the dining area. We were hidden behind a wall as other tables started to fill we placed our order of Chicken Tiki Masala and Paneer Masala the Big Mac basic of Indian cuisine. After waiting 30 mins our server came back to tell us that our food would be ready soon. After 15 mins we see our server coming out of the kitchen with food. After 5 more mins more food not ours when we stood up to look around the restaurant we saw that all of the people that arrived after us had food and some were even packing up their left overs. This completely ruined our celebration. We ended up eating cheese burgers at a picnic table in a parking lot. We will never go back to India Masala!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food we frnds had in 3 years. Everything was very delicious. Must go place."}
{"text":"Was visiting Las Vegas for business and took a wrong turn on my way to the strip. Saw it, saw 4 stats on yelp and figured if try it. So glad I did. Split some dishes with my guests we got the lamb kabobs, the chicken tikii masala, channa masala, and shrimp masala. Oh and lots of Naan. 3 regular and 4 garlic. Wow this place is good. Can't complain about a single dish. We are actually going to come back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"never going to this place again :-/my niece husband & myself were seated right away , made us the 2nd set of customer in the restaurant . waiter asked if we wanted anythng to drink and all 3 of us told him we all just wanted water & waiter didn't look like he wanted to that & asked us back \" just water ? \" ... waiter leaves & came back & poured us water . aftr a couple of mins , waiter comes back & asked if we were ready to order ,  my husband was ready to place his order & my niece who just had late lunch fr work was not goin to order anythng  & I wasn't ready to place mine.  Neithr any of us  three on our table really hv been to an Indian restaurant , took me slightly longer to place my order than my husband , then told waiter I wasn't ready , after a couple of mins , waiter comes back & I asked if the dish I was looking getting can b made not spicy waiter right away said \" no \" . ok .. it's an Indian restaurant they'r known for their spices so then I asked which vegetable dish did not come \" creamed \" . waiter mentioned about three . I picked mixed vegetables & my husband then places his order too . soon as we placed our 2 choices , waiter leaves our table then aftr bout a min comes back & said no mixed vegetables ... OMG for an Indian restaurant who's menu s almost vegetarian ... no mixed vegetables ??! I then Change my order which comes w/ nan bread ... waiter asked if bread w/ butter or plain ? I said butter on the side waiter stops writing & said that they didn't 
 do butter on the  side & looked like my request was too difficult .. he said I can just give u plain bread , I said ok just bring me some butter . waiter said he's been there a year & hv not heard such , I asked waiter to ask their kitchen & he tells me they'r busy ... there was only three tables now that occupied out if I'd say @ least 12 tables .. they hv the bread , now it's a matter of having butter or not if their nan bread came eithr plain or already buttered  , & he could hv said they didn't hv butter which would b nxt to not since butter s almost in evry pantry/ fridge . but instead waiter was saying they hv not served plain nan bread w/ butter on the side !! at the end my simple request of nan bread butter on the side aftr so long of a conversation w/ the waiter gets on our table along w/ 2 other things we ordered & we also ordered plain rice which didn't get to our table aftr we wer almost done since our waiter forgot we ordered rice & only found out aftr checking hw we wer doin as we wer getting almost done"}
{"text":"The meat dishes like lamb kebab & chicken 65 we're not that great. 
Paneer tikka masala. Plenty of gravy but only 8 cubes paneer. Chana masala was ok. Naan was fresh & soft."}
{"text":"amazing food and even better service- we ate here twice during our recent trip and have to say they are so friendly and the chicken masala was outstanding - I am only sorry they were closed when I broughtour son who was from Minneapolis visiting-we btw are from San Diego and I have been a huge indian food fan for a very long time, even cooking it. 

Thank you, we can't wait to come back just for the food"}
{"text":"I love the food at this restaurant. We have normally been to the other branch of it which is in Riviera but we thought of checking this one out. I'm not a buffet person and prefer ordering for ourself separately. We tried the chhole masala which came out beautifully good n great level of spice, which I certainly liked ;) other stuff like the chicken curry n aaloo tikki chaat and the complimentary lassi which we got from our check in made our dinner even more special. Next time we tried andhra masala dosa and indian and esp dosa was great and to add, the chutney's were probably the tastiest i'vs ever had in Vegas. We even got the 15 for 20 deal which added to our pleasure. :) A must go place for all indian food lovers."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's relatively cheap, especially with the groupon, and I love buffets. ($10 lunch buffet, plus half-off w/ groupon). I just wish there were a little more vegan variety. All of the vegan food kind of just compliments the naan bread instead of being awesome by itself. But to be fair I think that's how most Indian dishes are supposed to be. Still really delicious.

However, I was never fond of their lunch desserts. They're either kind of weird or boring or both. 

Also, I'm not sure if this was an isolated incident, but the last time I went (1/15/14) the saag (spinach & mustard greens curry) was WAY, WAY too salty. I actually love salty food and most green things, but that had to be a mistake. Hopefully it was just a fluke.

Despite my complaints, I strongly recommend this place for vegans and meat-eaters alike. This place is always tasty, and I leave completely stuffed every time."}
{"text":"Tasty food, spice levels optimal , good service and you get chai with the buffet. Value for money! Must try in Vegas. Goat curry was the best."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Loved the tava fish and chicken karahi."}
{"text":"The food is not halal my friend worked there and told me they lie about halal food to everyone . they have no certificate or any proof ..so if you care about halal meat it's not the right place!!!"}
{"text":"New Disclaimer: I get extremely cranky when my blood sugar drops. 

So, I did go back, to the lunch buffet. Based on the buffet alone, I think I would like to go for dinner at some point. I thought the food was exceptionally good, not just \"for a buffet\", but in general.

I did the lunch buffet for takeout. They are generous with the containers (and separately packaged naan), so I was able to try pretty much some of everything (and lots of some things!). 

The selection is small, but the bases were fairly covered. I knew going in that I wouldn't find samosas, but I still missed them. There also wasn't any pakora, and a few other standard items I was surprised not to see. Still, what they do have is solid. The tandoori chicken was basic, but well-prepared and moist. The chicken tikka masala was exceptionally good, as was the fish curry they had. 

To the best of my knowledge (and please, feel free to message me if I'm wrong), India Masala is the only spot offering a takeout option for their buffet. As you might know from my earlier review, my time is extremely limited on weekday afternoons. It's good to know that I could pop in, fill a few containers, pay, and be on my way in a few minutes with enough delicious food for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Pros: The Goanese chicken curry was good
Cons: everything else. We were the only customers when we got in around 8PM. It took them over an hour and three reminders to get us the food. We ordered some Momos, Nepalese chicken dumplings; they were so overcooked that it was an effort to tear it with our teeth. We had the Yelp 16 for 20 offer and the free fountain drink offer which they would not honor at the same time. It took them 15 minutes to simply get the check...

Recommendation: avoid like the plague unless you have hours and hours to spare."}
{"text":"First time having Indian food. Service was good. Price was good. The butter chicken was really good."}
{"text":"Lunch special buffet is fantastic! This is the only place I will eat for Indian cuisine. The place is lovely to dine in. Tandoori chicken is the best! This is the place to be!!!"}
{"text":"Always such a good experience coming here, love the quality of the food especially for the lunch buffet.  The staff is on point and courteous.  Just a slight suggestion, don't get rid of your goat curry, it is too good to not have as a selection.  Great Spot!"}
{"text":"It's vegas the best place to be. Always coming here couple times during a year. We've been eaten all type of foods and buffets every time we came here. Without any doubt Vegas is absolutely a food heaven. For some reason and whatever the reason may be. This time around we were craving for Indian food. So we got here after 5pm and too bad we barely missed out the buffet style but that's fine. We've decided to go with the dinner and so glad we did. everythings are pretty amazing good. especially the chicken Biryani rice sooo yummy...Naan breads are so good and freshly made and came out hot. the only exception was the lamb chops because its kind of dried and wasn't as good as supposedly expected. Service was great. it's definitely a great experienced."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful, the decor is classy enough for date night, yet not so over the top that you feel under dressed at lunch. 
  It is as all buffets should be, clean and neat and well stocked. We came here after a disappointing stop at Ghandi the week earlier. The service here is wonderful, very nice and friendly also mindful and considerate. Full water glasses at all times, we were offered fresh naan bread and it was great. The mango lassi was affordable and generous.
 I do not know what is expected of Indian dishes officially, I only know if like what I had or not so please keep that in mind. 
 The first time we went we loved it. There were large chunks of chicken in the butter chicken and an amazing lamb curry. Kessla ? dessert which was over the top, we loved this. Lemon rice and unique vegetarian dishes I gave a try. Well cooked basmati rice. Tandoori chicken, soups, pakora.. 
 The second time came around and it was also great!! The Chicken Curry was amazing! 
 Told friends, then came a third time and..hmm..  things changed.. Butter chicken had tiny thin strands of chicken not at all the same kind from before, there was no lamb curry which was disappointing to me, and some dishes that looked good but had bones in them including the chicken curry (the first time it was made without bones). (I personally won't eat any gravies or curries with bones). There was a mango dessert that was unique. 
 I never tried the salads and smaller items, by the time I make it to the back wall I am full I did not count how many items but there is surely enough to choose from.
  So we would prefer more consistency in quality as customers, however that's the only issue we had here. No one got sick, nothing bad happened it was a pleasant experience. The place is really nice and deserves a shot.  I never had dinner here and I am dying to try the cashew chicken. We'll go back thats for sure."}
{"text":"By far the best chicken tandoori in Vegas. No other place even comes close. The staff is great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Our server was a new hire and he seemed so freaked out waiting tables, possibly scared by the boss. Funny guy. 
Location is a bit turn off coz its 10 mints away from the strip.
Interior is so typical and flat.

Vada is the best thing for appetizers."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. So delicious. The staff was so friendly. I plan on going back frequently."}
{"text":"Located on East Flamingo near Maryland Parkway, an area that apparently has ten Indian Restaurants within a one-mile radius, India Oven Masala Bar & Grill represents the union of prior occupant Indian Oven and the Strip's India Masala, owner Ulzan Mehta recently taking over the elegantly decorated space and sprucing up the menu with specialty dishes from both the South and North of India.

An accountant by trade and restaurant owner by choice, a self-proclaimed love of food from his homeland seeing Mr. Mehta enter the ever-competitive industry later than many with a collection of old family recipes and regional influences, guests entering India Oven Masala will likely first be struck by both how well-lit and eye-catching the décor is, everything from the lobby featuring a gold statue of Ganesha to the bathrooms spotless, as too is the kitchen and bar.

Featuring a seven-page dinner menu in addition to a lunch buffet like almost every other Indian Restaurant in town, though several differences in each look to set India Oven Masala apart from the pack, the first of these is immediately evident on viewing the right side of the buffet-line where a live-kitchen producing both Naan and Dosa is located, one of only two of its kind in Las Vegas operating both afternoon and evening to produce fresh bread filled or topped with a bounty of unique ingredients.

Charging prices comparable to other such spots in town, the Buffet just $11.99 seven days a week including bottomless Mango Lassi, it was while tablemates enjoyed White Wine and Indian Beer that a glass of the thick Yogurt drink was enjoyed alongside appetizers including crispy Pappadum and piping hot Chicken Samosa, the latter far better than anything fried at Mt. Everest, Delhi or Urban Turban thanks to the lightness of the Batter, not to mention the finely diced Chicken teaming with aromatic spices.

Further impressed by Chili Paneer, the squeaky cubes of Cheese in a fiery red Sauce featuring Bell Peppers and Onions immediately bringing beads of sweat to the brow of one at the table, it was with the first of two sizable servings of Jasmine Rice that three entrees were presented, the ubiquitous Chicken Tikka Masala offering far more Meat than many while the cubed Lamb Vindaloo was served medium-spicy and delicious, though one diner felt the Protein was sort of dry while no one complained about Mixed Vegetable Curry that featured at least five different Ingredients all cooked to appropriate consistencies, a difficult task considering the fact that Eggplant is almost always rendered mushy in such cases.

Invited to take a short break from dining to visit the side-kitchen, a virtually spotless station where the ingredients and tradition of Dosa were explained by one of Ulzan's employees, it was upon return to the table that two types of Naan including a unique version stuffed with Fruit and Nuts were presented along with a forearm sized Dosa, the crispy Pancake stuffed with fragrant Mashed Potatoes delicious on its own and even better with housemade Coconut or Tomato Chutney that is traditionally served as part of Breakfast in Southern India.

 Rounding out the meal with two Desserts, a bit of disappointment here as neither the Gajar Halwa nor Gulab Jamun listed on the menu were available, it was instead a small bowl of creamy Kheer and the previously unknown dish called Cassata that were served, the latter taking its name from an Italian Cake traditionally featuring Strawberries despite actually being quite similar to Spumoni topped with Dark Chocolate Chips and crumbled Pecans. 

FOUR AND A HALF STARS:  Very good right up to the end, running out of a standard menu item without a doubt one of the cardinal sins of Restaurant ownership, it seems safe to say that India Oven Masala one-ups the competition by way of both its décor and cuisine, the latter offering far more to be explored at future visits and Mr. Mehta clearly committed to offering something a little different than the typical Las Vegas Indian dining experience."}
{"text":"I came on a Friday during lunch and had ate their buffet for $15. 

- Classy. high ceiling. fancy wine glass for water. nice silverware. 
- Great chicken curry! Not dry!
- Solid variety. Great taste.
- No old film over curries 
- Hint of spice! 
- To-Go buffet same price as lunch. $12.
- They had some chopped fruit, but didn't look too appetizing. 
- 2.5 plates, naan, and vermicelli pudding was enough to put me in a food coma..zZzZ
- I'd chose Mint if you come solo and want to yolo. But if you're +1, this is the place since you can use the $15 for 20 value and get the mango dessert from check-in!"}
{"text":"Very good find.  We were very happy.  Had the lunch buffet.  Good and diverse selection.  Variety of both Non-Veg and Veg.  and they bring out freshly backed naan's to the table.  Will definitely revisit on a future trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We had a very tasty meal here tonight. The mango lassi had full mango flavor! Yummy! The chapati and sauces were the best I have had, and yes I have eaten Indian food before  many times although not in India, but in London. 

We ordered chicken tikka dosa, goat curry, basmati rice, and naan. It was our first time having a dosa, not sure that we have seen this on a menu before, but we are glad that we tried it! If you have never had one and you like crepes, this is a must have! Of course, the sauces that went with it were just delightful, bursting with flavor in every bite. The curry was also very flavorful and so was the wonderful naan. We order the rice so the goat curry had something to sit on.

For two of us, we had way too much food but managed to eat most of it. 

Service was very attentive and pleasant. Wonderful experience and great food."}
{"text":"Within a four mile radius of the university is a plethora of Indian restaurants. India Masala is another to add to the mix, but it tends to fall short compared to the others. They serve a lunch buffet from 11:30-3:00 for $10.99. 

Price wise, it is similar to all the others. Where it falls flat is in the offerings. IM offers a variety of dishes that are not often seen at other places. The vegetable korma is a primary example of this point. It was the one I enjoyed the most. The well seasoned mix of mushrooms and potatoes with the mango chutney gave a balanced taste of sweet and savory. The rice in the chicken biryani was also decious. It was soft, pillowy, and flavorful. I scooped around the dried chicken pieces and went with the tandoori instead. Most of the time, it is best to pass on the tandoori because it just sits out and loses all the moisture. Not theirs. Instead, I found it to be tender and moist. Other than those three dishes, I was not impressed.

The service, on the other hand, was polite and friendly. The decorum, spacious and warm. With so much potential, I hope to see them tweak the menu a bit more. I wouls like to come in for dinner and just order ala carte."}
{"text":"Brought my dad here while he was in town. He loved it! Definitely worth checking out. Plus we got one of my favorite desserts (Gulab Jamun) on the house. The staff was super nice."}
{"text":"Back in Vegas and we came back here as I thought we would. Place is even better than last time. Better selection of buffet food. Fresh veggies, watermelon and tons of other usual suspects. Service is excellent and the host who seated us is super friendly. Will be back again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Super yummy naan! Also, their sauces are spicy yet not too hot would definitely return, especially for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"What a gem in the middle of hustle bustle and fat burgers in Vegas. Ordered Gobhi Manchurian and masala Chai as appetizers and Chicken Biryani, Malai Kofta, Butter & Garlic Naan, the food was delicious and our server greeted us with a smile and checked on us again to make sure we enjoyed our food and if needed anything else. The ambience of the restaurant was also really nice and not some shabby take away place. Malai kofta was simply delicious. Overall a great meal and I will definitely visit again when in Vegas next time."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly People and clean place. It took abt 20mins to bring the food. I lived in Índia Before and the food here is very authentic! Jst love it!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here this afternoon, and I must say, incredibly disappointed with everything from the service to some of the food. More importantly, one of the members of our party had their wallet stolen out of their bag and when we confronted the restaurant, they went and got the video feed and told us that we should only blame ourselves and did not handle the situation in a mature manner. When the police arrived, the waiter who claimed that he was the owner told them that we were being very aggressive and threatened to beat him up, which we did not do. They were very unwilling to help, and all we asked for is for them to look at the video feed for us.

Also, in terms of food, their appetizers were okay, but their main courses were subpar. The vegetarian items were okay, but their meat items were terrible. I feel robbed that I had to pay for that food. They boast that they have the largest buffet for lunch, and that's true if you include the 8 chutneys and fruits and stuff that don't count as lunch items. Never again. Save your money."}
{"text":"I have the honor of writing the first review for this new restaurant !

It has been open for just over a week now, the decor is your typical \"new\" Indian restaurant strip mall style, dark woods and a nice clean appearance. The table set up is certainly set up with the lunch buffet crowd in mind, not a bad thing as there is plenty of space around each table.

Service was fast and friendly with even the chef stopping by our table to check on us.

As of now, they do not have a liquor license, but they did say they expect to get it in the next couple of weeks.

The important stuff, the food.

If you have read any of my Indian restaurant reviews, we tend to stick with what we know and like, though today we did go with a Chicken Korma and Butter Chicken rather than Chicken Tikka Masala and just for a change, an order of the Aloo Palak.

Well, honestly, it was good, very good in fact, the sauces were some of the best I have had, certainly better than Origin and slightly better than Mt Everest. The only negative would be the amount of chicken used, let's say it was light in this area, add some more meat to the dish and it would have been a home run. The Aloo Palak was good, I am not a big fan of this dish, but the wife loves it and she raved about this version.

The naan (plain and garlic) were superb, a little thinner than I normally like, but boy a simple dish done perfectly.

So all in all, a good place to eat, certainly the best Indian on this side of town."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner with my hubby... Just  Indian cusine this place was delicious again!"}
{"text":"Traditional Indian food with large quantity. Server are friendly, treated like family. And the food taste great. Compare to other restaurant in Las Vegas Indian masala is BEST, is comfortable to eat. Also price are less then other restaurant.Love it... Must visit!!!"}
{"text":"If anyone looking out for good Indian food in LV.....must go to this place...good food....great quality....n nice people"}
{"text":"Yum, yum!  This place appeared out of no where (I think there was a Mongolian grill type place and I ate at only once in this location).  I was not holding out too much hope since this restaurant is  two blocks away from my previously favorite Indian food establishment.  

Let me tell you why this place rocks.  First, the waiter was friendly and able to make recommendations.Then we got the food, whoo!  I had the tikki masala  with chicken and my friend had the butter chicken.  I had buttered naan and she had the capati.  The spices in the tikki masala were incredible.  The portion of the naan was more than I could have hoped for.  My friend really enjoyed her food.  We both had enough left overs to take home and have lunch the next day!  

Why is this place better than the joint down the street?  Better quality taste and our bill was smaller!"}
{"text":"Biriyani was horrible and super spicy. It was a to go order and the lady who took the order never asked what should be the spice level. After having first spoon of the biriyani we had to trash the rest of the biriyani. I'm not going to come back to this restaurant, Ever!"}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet and everything I had was really delicious.  The reason for 4 stars was the naan and samosas were just ok.  Everything else was really exceptional and the selection for the buffet was solid.  Definitely worth a return trip"}
{"text":"What a great place to come eat ! I have stopped in today for their all u can eat buffet 11:00 - 3:00 pm Just a couple of miles off of the strip but this place is worth the short commute!"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and a good combination of South Indian flavors with the typical Punjabi flavors. This makes it my No 1 choice for Indian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review as Indian Oven was my favorite Indian restaurant. My family has been going there since it was located near the Golden Steer. They did a great job with the new building, it looks really nice.

So we usually order the same thing each time. Lamb Tikka Masala (I get spicy and my wife gets mild) as well as rice and Naan. As well as the assorted hors d'oeuvre as well as sodas.

Well we couldn't order soda because they were all flat so that meant can soda or something else. So no big deal I drink a lot and the waitress was super at keeping my glass full.

Being 6pm it was strange we were the only people in there. That being said it still took almost 40+ minutes for our food to come out.

The waitress brought our food out and announced.. They are both medium. Unapologetic! I expressed this isn't what we ordered, I ordered spicy and my wife had ordered mild. She says that is what she put in but the cook prepared them medium. (This set the mood for the rest of the meal)  - She noticed I was pissed and kept going back to the cook and talking and coming back. Asking if we wanted new items, if the food was ok.. But we didn't have 40 more minutes to wait. Anyways the Lamb Tikka Masala was actually greenish in color compared to the red it had normally been. It used to be so flavorful.. Now it tasted bland and like the meat had been tossed into stock sauce and served (which doesn't explain the 40 mins) but the dish was blah... So disappointing.

The rice too was not very flavorful. But besides the food not being up to it's normal flavor and even the chef deciding he know better then we did... The main reason I will not go back is the restaurant was full of flies. 

I am sure some people are fine with it. As one of the employees was eating unfazed by the flies. My wife and I however couldn't even enjoy our bland tasteless food as we were too busy swatting flies off our food and bodies. 

In the end the waitress checked us out, she apologized for the meal being messed up. The receipt clearly showed spicy and mild for the dishes. She even said she noticed us swatting flies and apologized for that. She said the staff keeps the back door open.

But all the apologies made not one discount was offered. The manager never made an effort to placate us. Obviously we were unhappy, the manager could have made a difference.. but sadly after over 12+ years of going to this restaurant and referring dozens of people to their locations. I will never go back.

Side note - Wife said the women's bathroom was dirty and full of flies as well. Place was also very warm, as if they didn't have the air conditioning on."}
{"text":"Had an incredible dining experience last night at India Masala. I am a huge fan of Indian food, and can safely say that these dishes are some of the absolute best I have eaten in Las Vegas. 

Our party consisted of three vegetarians, so I can't speak to the quality of the meat items, but everything we ate was fantastic. Some of the best dal makhani I have ever had, malai kofta was tasty, rice and garlic naan were both delicious. I tend to like a little more spice with my Indian food, but found no complaint here due to the absolutely amazing flavors. Portion sizes were perfect and we received more than enough rice for all three dishes, which is always good. I order chana masala virtually every time I eat Indian, and this restaurant's similar chickpea curry dish was the best I've ever had. The sauce was so flavorful and mouthwatering- could eat it every day. Though we were incredibly full after the meal, there was no lingering sleepy food coma that sometimes happens after having Indian. Feel like the ingredients were very fresh. Nice! 

Decor and atmosphere were pleasant and our server was very friendly. Service was a little slow at times, but I was willing to forgive this due to the extremely high-quality food. Prices are a little higher than other Indian restaurants I've been to, but rice was included with all dishes and again, AMAZING food. Completely worth the money. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Decent food but very very expensive. Try the south Indian food - very good stuff, avoid dosa."}
{"text":"I went to this place at the last minute w/ my gf who was craving Indian food.  both of us LOVE Indian food VERY much and have been to MANY of them.  This was among the best we've been to.  First the food, which is probably THE most important aspect of any dining experience for me.  You can have bad service and great food and reluctantly find yourself going back from time to time; but a place with bad food and great service is less likely to be revisited.  The food was absolutely delicious!  You have to try the chicken 64 (or something like that - it has a number in the name).  It's an appetizer dish with chicken that appears to have been marinated and then cooked in a batter or something.  IDK - I'm not a foodie and I don't know all the intricacies of HOW a dish is prepared.. all I know is that it was DAMN good!  I had meant to get a dish to go on my way back home the next day but forgot.  The other dishes were almost as good - WAY better than standard, but not quite as exceptional as the appetizer.  For spiciness, we got 8 which was just PERFECT for us.  We like it pretty spicy though, so for people less tolerant, you might want to dial it down a bit.

Service - which I think is the second most important in any dining experience, was PHENOMENAL - I would say it was pretty close to an all-time best for me.  We had sat down and since my gf is the foodie I let her pick the dish while I proceeded to check something on my phone.  As soon as I whip out my phone, the manager comes and asks if I need access to the wifi, which I gratefully accept.  The rest of the evening is just as attentive, friendly, and considerate.  I don't have time to go into all the details, but ALL of the staff were extremely pleasant, and attentive.  They are also very international which I really liked a lot.  There were Indian staff of course, but also Caucasian, Eastern Asian, and other ethnicity as well.  India, which has historically been a major fulcrum of the Silk Road is well represented by the people working here.  It was an absolutely delightful dining experience, adding another dimension to the tasteful decor and immaculate ambiance.  It almost makes me not want to leave a good review in fear that it will be over-crowded the next time we visit.  ;)  but the people working there REALLY deserve every bit of the praise.  I wish I had more time and the descriptive capacity to do them justice, but you'll simply have to experience it for yourself.  :)

PS:  I rarely ever do yelp reviews btw, but this one I really WANTED to do."}
{"text":"Tandoori chicken and Chicken Tikka dishes are to die for. Excellent flavor the Nann bread and rice is the perfect meal with the one you love."}
{"text":"This is the best idli sambhar outside of my mother's kitchen.  And the tandoori chicken is fall-off-the-bone tender.  The only problem is that the naan is rather plain (seems brought in, not house made) and they can't seem to keep up with the demand on several items on the buffet.  But the quality is so high that it almost makes it worth the wait.  Like I said....It's all about those wonderfully pillowy idli."}
{"text":"We were craving Indian food after a night of clubbing and drinking, so our friends from Delhi recommended this place since he knew the owner. The food mostly gets cold by 2:45 pm and the lunch buffet closes at 3:30. But huge turn off was the curly black hair I found in my mouth... Wear hair nets, cooks! The manager/owner paaji is really sweet & innocent tho lol"}
{"text":"It's 8pm and I'm still thinking about the lunch I had today! It was wonderful! I was beyond impressed with the selection but mostly with the flavors! I am not too familiar with this style cooking or I would give you more details, but I tried a little bit of everything and everything was SO delicious!"}
{"text":"Grreat food great service  love indian food  atmosphere a 10 who cares about price  i have eaten at over 100 resturants in town dont mind spending
on good food or service  so pony up get a second job to.support you foodie habits  bon apetit"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food in town, additionally some of the best I've ever had. They are super nice here and the portions are so much better than most places.  I got the Lamb Curry & my girl got the lentil crepe, both were absolutely incredible!! Definitely our top place to go now."}
{"text":"This review if for dinner.

Quick and dirty notes:
Food: quality tasting with a big BUT (see full review below for details) BEWARE OF THE CHICKEN BONES!
Service: very slow and biased 


We come in for dinner TONIGHT ( that's how upset I am about this place)

We walked in and observed the \"please wait to be seated\" sign and obliged. It took 5 minutes before the staff noticed us and seated us. The place was pretty empty, I counted 4 tables in the back that were used. We were seated on the opposite end of the restaurant. 
The busser quickly sat us and brought us out some flat bread and chutney. The bartender quickly asked us if we wanted to order cocktails. That was the last interaction we would have for the next 20 minutes. I noticed the manager/owner at the front desk and tried to make eye contact with him to show him subtly that we were ready to order. My silent ques went unnoticed. I don't understand it?!? The waiters were nowhere to be found? 
Finally both of the waiters noticed and rushed to take our orders. There seemed to be an obvious disconnect between the staff and the tables that they were responsible for. Nevertheless we finally were able to place our order. 

We ordered
Samosas
Pakora (I wanted Aloo Tiki but they were \"out\")
1/2 order of Tandori Chicken
Butter Chicken 
Garlic Naan


The appetizers came out very quickly!

The Pakora was very large and tasty. I was a good mix of vegetables not just batter fried sliced veggies.

The samosas were very tasty and fresh! The peas in them were not gushy and the potato mix had a nice consistency to it. You could tell that they were made recently. 

The tandori chicken came out hot from the tandori still moist. Probably one of the better tandori chicken dishes that I've had. It was not marinated to long as the chicken protein was not completely broken down from the yogurt. Not sure how they do it but the meat was still moist and yet still had a nice red crust. 

That's about where to food compliments stop.The tandori chicken came out 10 minutes before our curry, rice and naan. We waited hoping that the other dishes would follow shortly but gave up after 5 minutes and begun to eat the chicken. What burns me even more is an Indian family that was seated long after us got their food (the same food) before us. Our food came our 3 minutes after they were served. Discrimination or just crappy service? You be the judge. This instantly infuriated me and ruined my experience from that point on.  

10 minutes later, we finally got the rest of our order. 
The butter chicken sauce was very creamy and tasty. The big complaint was the chicken in the curry. It was loaded with what seemed to be leftover tandori chicken bits (not chunks or cubes). I usually expect that but I should not have to pick out shards of bones out of my curry. UNSAT and UNSAFE!
I was unable to enjoy my curry as I had to be on the lookout for chicken bones.  

The food was very good but the misque on the butter chicken and the horrible service tainted what could have been a great dining experience. I think that their food is decent and I'd dare say that it's some of the better that I've had in Vegas but they need to get a grip on the staff before I'd dare come back to this place."}
{"text":"The last Indian buffet I went to there was so much oil over the aluminium containers, F.E.M.A. was called to take care of the spill. The left over saag (spinach) from previous nights had overcooked to the point, it had turned brown and looked like an alien.

The owners of India Masala, should be proud to be calling themselves Indian, since I have never been to an Indian restaurant, which is impeccably clean and classy. The Buffet is the main attraction and not a corner side-show as in other Indian restaurants. Last time I was there, I ate so much I had to find a tree to wind around  to digest the incredible food that I had at the buffet., not to mention it is not easy to find a tree in the desert. 

They also have a nice cozy bar and I have a red wine (preferably chilled since the the wine sommeliers, who go to school of higher learning with student loans jauntily  come back to tell the bartenders to serve red wine at  \"room temperature.\" Room temperature in Las Vegas, happens to be 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The bartenders who are taught not to argue with experts follow the dictum to the tee. The red wine has to be chilled to taste good and even a cheap wine will taste good-chilled and most mere mortals drink cheap wine.

Not to digress, I have red wine before and during dinner which gives you a tremendous appetite, unlike beer, that makes you full and not to mention gives you Buddha like belly. The Buffet is not only sight for sore eyes with over Forty ! North and South Indian items,but it a feast for the palate, to say the least. The buffet is freshly cooked unlike Chinese restaurants where they serve left over from the previous week. The secret to good Indian food is authentic cooks. I found out from the waiters that they have Four North and South Indian cooks. Most of the Indian restaurants have no cooks, but someone on a tourist visa paying off their debts.

The service is superb and the ambiance is embellishment to the feast. There is no way anyone can get this kind of food for the price they are charging and this can happen Only in Las Vegas the Buffet Capitol of the World. India Masala is the Indian Buffet Capitol of Las Vegas., I would say this is the Healthiest Buffet /food in Las Vegas or anywhere.
.
It is time for my weekly visit to the Capitol."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Indian but this place was as good as you can get! 

The service was perfect and the food was good... The only thing I would have liked was more ice in my water because the food was so spicy!"}
