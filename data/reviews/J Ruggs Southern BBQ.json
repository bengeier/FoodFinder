{"text":"Quickly becoming my local favorite BBQ.  After a write-up in the local paper the place has been busier.  Lots of blue hairs the other day (tis the season).

Went with my friend for lunch...got the rib/brisket basket combo.  I think that's what I'll be getting from now on.  I got the beans again which were okay -- with the amount of BBQ though I could do without the sides really.

I think Ruggs will be outgrowing their place quickly -- that's my only current 'complaint' is that during busy times it isn't conducive really to large crowds.

Perhaps during lunch they can reserve the front 2 parking spots, cone them off, and set up tables out there -- maybe a bit hot during the summer...but would have provided more seats.

Keep up the good food Ruggs!"}
{"text":"For the past year I stopped eating baby back ribs because wherever I got them, they were too dry and not meaty enough. Instead, I filled my rib cravings with St. Louis style ribs.

So when I walked into J Ruggs and saw that they didn't have St. Louis style ribs, I was worried.

But my concerns were unfounded. The ribs were tender, meaty, juicy, and with the hot bbq sauce made my mouth happy. I finished a whole rack. They were the best baby back ribs I've had in Arizona. And I've been to Joe's, Waldo's, BBQ Company, Stacy's Smokehouse, and Restaurant 28. J Ruggs are my favorite.

I had coleslaw with my ribs; it was slightly above average. Including the drink with the meal is a bonus.

The service is friendly without being overbearing. If I wanted to talk to the restaurateurs, I could, but when I wanted to be left alone they respected my space.

Everyone that was dining that night also seemed to enjoy their meals.

I look forward to going back and trying some of their other meats."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were craving BBQ and this place is close to where we work.  I was surprised to see how small it was inside, but the lunch crowd was light so seating was easy.  The place was organized and appeared clean.

The price of sandwiches and meals were average, the portion sizes were not.  In fact they left much to be desired.  If we had come for dinner we would have had to order second plates.  Ok, I'm directing that comment to my dollop of pulled pork.  The sides were portioned adequately.  I oredered the sweet potato fries....they were wonderful and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.  The beans were good, but could use some flair (onions, peppers, meat, etc.)

As far as the pulled pork, it was tender.  However the flavor kept making me think of Liquid Smoke.  I don't know if that is the case, but the 3 of us agreed that the pulled pork and brisket taste like that.  

So were aren't fans, not in portion size or flavor....Joe's is still the place to go in the SE valley."}
{"text":"Goodbye Jruggs.  You'll always have a place in my heart!  Now I need to find another restaurant that can fill the hole in my stomach.  Damn damn damn, very sad, this was my favorite BBQ place in town!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and was pleasantly surprised when a southern bbq joint opened up nearby. I stopped in one day for lunch and had the beef brisket sandwich and since I took it to go they put the meat in a separate container from the grilled bun. I added a side of waffle fries and they include the drink at no charge. The brisket was meaty and flavorful one of the best I have ever had. Their sauce is nice and subtle without too much vinegar or sugar. The waffle fries were perfectly done and they left the salting to me which I like.  I decided to go back to try the ribs as the very friendly guy (son in law of owner I think) told me he hand dry rubs and smokes them for 14 hours.  When I finally went back and tried the ribs I added macaroni and cheese and ate there. The ribs were absolutely the best I have ever tasted in my life and I LOVE ribs. The meat slides right off the bone and they are dry rubbed to perfection. No need for sauce even but since theirs is good I used a little and they were that much better. Best bbq in the valley hands down I will never eat ribs anywhere else in AZ for sure."}
{"text":"Update Aug 13, 2010: Stopped by J Ruggs today, only to find it closed for business. :(

-----

Any time I see \"Southern\" in a BBQ restaurant name, I *have* to try it. And I go in a little skeptical.

Texas is home for me, and both parental units hail from southern middle Tennessee. So I understand and appreciate southern BBQ -- and it's not easy to find out here in the wild west.

Pulled up in the parking lot and it smelled perfect. A good sign.

Walked in and the lady behind the counter said, \"How y'all doin tonight?

A better sign...

Sadly, and I mean sadly, we were informed they were out of brisket. Granted, they were set to close in about 30 minutes, so it was understandable. But for this Texas boy, brisket is the ultimate factor in deciding a BBQ restaurant's fate. I did take heart when one of the owners told me that he learned to smoke brisket in Houston, and they smoke their brisket for 14 hours.

I had a two meat plate, chicken and sausage, and the lovely bride had half a rack of baby back ribs.

All three meats were delightful. The ribs were done with just a dry rub, and were fall off the bone tender. Sausage was just the right level of spiciness. The chicken breast was huge, Dolly Partonesque in size. 

The mac-n-cheese was excellent, full of cheesy goodness.

J. Ruggs is family owned and operated, and the owners are very friendly and cordial. You can tell they take pride in their food. Prices are very reasonable, especially when you consider the size of the portions.

We'll be back, and if the brisket is as good as I suspect it will be, J, Ruggs will be upgraded to a coveted fifth star."}
{"text":"I went into this place for lunch one day and ordered a chicken BBQ sandwich to go with the sweet potato fries.  They asked if I wanted the meat on the side because it makes the bun soggy if they put it on too soon.  I went ahead and had them put it on, and indeed the bread was soggy by the time I got home a block away.  I almost walked out without additional BBQ sauce which would have been a travesty because the meat without the sauce would have been a little plain.  I suppose if I had one suggestion to make it would be to find a better vendor for the bread (buns).  The flimsy soggy bun was not a great enticement to come back.  I like a HARDY grilled bun for BBQ that holds up under wet meat and extra sauce without falling apart.  

Considering some of the BBQ joints they are competing with in Gilbert, to include Joe's BBQ Grill downtown, I would also suggest they come up with some outrageously good side dishes...the sweet potato fries were delicious, but they sell those now at any grocery store, so they need some exciting sides you can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find, but worth searching for.  I ordered the one meat (pulled pork) \"from the smoker\" sandwich combo. I was surprised how much meat I got with my meal...a hearty portion. The best part of my experience and biggest surprise came when I found out the soda was already included in the price of my meal. The beans and waffle fries are 10 out of 10 as far as quick sides go. My only complaint is that while the Texas toast had a good buttery flavor, it was drenched in too much butter and slightly not toasty. Other than that, I can't wait to try this place again.  A few final thoughts: The BBQ sauce is very tasty and not overly sweet, which is a good thing. They are also closed on Sunday, which I can respect. Finally, I think this is a family run biz cos all the people behind the counter were very friendly and seemed genuinely concerned that our meal turned out just right. I think I overheard them say they just opened a couple months ago. So far, they are off to a good start!!!"}
