{"text":"For a small out of the way bar in a shoppingish center the food here is really good. 12 oz. Steak and fries 7 bucks. Drinks are priced right. Great place friendly staff."}
{"text":"We luv going to Pounders. The wings are awesome! So many flavors to try, 64 i believe. Service is outstanding especially for a sports bar let alone a regular restaurant. It's so good we drive a bit of a distance to meet our friends there."}
{"text":"The owner is awesome. The staff is alright. When there a little busy takes a little longer for drinks. Understandable to a certain point.  Over all reasonable prices and good times."}
{"text":"This place does it right. Great food and drink specials and great service. Food variety and quality is above and beyond typical \"bar\" level grub. The new 2nd bar room, with craft brew offerings, was a very nice addition. The beer selections change regularly so there are plenty of opportunities to try new flavors! Also, plenty of screens to watch games on. This is definitely the best bar in Parma Hts."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always had decent service, good bar food and reasonably priced drinks.  That was not the case last week when I went there with a friend.  The bar was pretty full but there were still a few seat s open so my friend and I decided to sit at the bar. The tables were empty except for maybe one in the corner. We didn't get acknowledged at all, I don't have a problem waiting for service, but at least look up and say \"hi, be right with you\" or something. We seriously sat there for 10 minutes and nobody said a peep to us. I was really disappointed...We took our business elsewhere that night."}
{"text":"Had several issues paying there in the past. Sometimes there's a card minimum, other times there's not. go on the right night and you might walk out spending the 3 dollars you intended to, not the 7 extra you were forced to. I was contacted via facebook about the credit card incident on 9/3 where everyone was double charged. When I called the person who contacted me to let her know that my problems with their bar /didn't just stem from one night of BS/, she was too busy trying to cover her own butt about the credit double charge problem to listen to what I had to say. Once I threatened to report her to the BBB (better business bureau) she became a 13 year old and hung up on me. I called back, spoke with a much better mannered male manager, told him my issues and it was over. Huh. Thanks for that  Note: I understand the reasons behind credit card minimums, I am not unfamiliar with the concept. Consistency is Key."}
{"text":"The best wings I've ever found in Cleveland so far. They are also able to make your wings extra crispy and have a great flavor selection to choose from. This place has turned from a guilty pleasure to a regular staple in my life lol"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of my favorite bars in northeast ohio and easily my favorite in the area. The food is cheap and is absolutely fantastic. The drinks are cheap and theres a solid variety. They have options for 2-3 dollar beers and shots and work their way all the way up to a respectable craft beer selection. Theres a pair of pool tables, darts, a bowling machine, and more tv's than you can count. The staff is great and trivia night is a lot of fun as well."}
{"text":"Great little local bar. Anyways good food at a low price. Nice beer selection with micro-brews on tap. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great prices. Specials.  I went for the Buzztime Trivia.  Extremely cliquish (not expensive or pretentious though) neighborhood bar, but a nice place if you get there on the right night."}
{"text":"Great burgers in a little hole in the wall bar. Friendly staff and delicious food. Went in off hours but the locale has darts, pool, and a bowling machine. Great find!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday...$1...hidden gem in Parma! Beer selection is a nice change from the ordinary. Love the fresh flowers and mints in the ladies room...nice touch!"}
{"text":"Simple dive bar.  Yet exceeds all other dive bars  by having excellent customer service and always satisfying food.  Like I saw others say, they're not trying to be something they're not like a hip trendy place or a super lame bro bar.  All the workers are always hustling to create an awesome atmosphere and take care of the customers.  No complaints here would rather spend my money here than somewhere like the plain old overpriced Harry buffalo chain bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"If you go for karaoke and you enjoy terrible pop rock then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I love this bar! Great service by all the bartenders. The food comes out relatively quick even when they are busy. The drink selection is awesome and cheap. The food is great. I love their wings and burger sliders with the FAT sauce. Wednesday nights are ladies night after 10pm! Only downside is they do get pretty busy during games and weekend with nowhere to sit, but that's because it's such a great bar!"}
{"text":"Local watering hole. Never had a bad experience here. Staff is great and always making sure your glass is full. My go to place for keno!"}
{"text":"HOLY HEAVEN IN A HAND BASKET! This is a hidden gem in Parma for SURE! endless wing sauces, endless food combinations! I'm a wing lover and the uniqueness and deliciousness(?) of these wings is out of this world! I had jalapeño Parmesan and CHEESUS it was amazing!!! Homemade fresh cut fries you simply cannot beat it! We went on a Tuesday and it was taco night my husband ranted and raved his entire meal about How good his $1 tacos were! Good draft choices, it's definitely hard to miss if you're coming down York or pearl, but it's so worth the uturn to find it again!!"}
{"text":"Food is DISGUSTING.  This \"fish fry\"  is inexcusable.  Fish is preformed. Tough. Tepid temp.  Cole slaw tastes like straight Vinegar, Cabbage and noodles undercooked and COLD."}
{"text":"This place is so Parma and a good local bar period. They have the best bar craft beer list for the best prices and they update weekly! We often go and hang out in the renovated tap room. The bartenders always recognize us and a give great service.  Catch us here weekly having a brew and watching the first half of the game."}
{"text":"Nice place first time i every went monday June 5 17 12 till close got food it was great lots of people for Monday early Tues and the Barmaid was alone one person 50 people wow to much for one person making wait time long she was running crazy made we feel bad she needs extra help but she made good food and drinks but i noticed omg she was cooking too just to much on her i hope they get more employees on staff i dont want to go to a place and watch a worker killing themselves i know what thats like but i will go back"}
{"text":"Great low key atmosphere,  fun bartenders, and the food is yummy!  I recommend the fried pickles, the \"El bimbo\" and the wings too!  Great hangout spot and karaoke! It's the parma version of cheers, love it! :)"}
{"text":"What is this place lol I guess its a true local bar. Average crowd is 50 year olds. Some young people in there but who knows why they are there.  If you want cheap drinks before you go out to party somewhere else, I guess this is the place. If it was me, I would not waste your time."}
{"text":"The service for beer was reasonable. I had ordered hot garlic parmesan wings, they came pretty quickly, but there was no apparent parmesan visually or tastefully. The wings were definitely hot and garlic. Atmosphere was typical bar like especially for a Thursday. Overall the visit was enjoyable. I had ordered two beers and a dozen wings for less than $10, prices are reasonable. It was also $.49 wing night."}
{"text":"Always super nice staff, cheap beer, great daily specials and enough TV's to please every sports fan... They have BeIn TV, the soccer channel. \"The Whiz\" burger is by far my favorite item on the menu."}
{"text":"i cant say enough about this place and how much I love it.  The bartenders are great and usually are waiting, serving and cooking for the entire bar at times.  The wings are great and I have included a few pics of the HUGE variety of wing flavors.  Thai Peanut, Horseradish Ranch, Jalapeno Parmesian and Mighty Maple are some of the best.  Mondays is mug night where you bring in ANY size mug and they fill it for $1.75.  Sure, the sign says 30 oz max mug but these bartenders are great and will fill it to the rim.  $1.00 Taco Tuesdays.  $3.99 steak dinner Saturdays.  All good and even better service.  A ton of TVs around the bar so there is never a bad seat.    There is also nothing better than having a stomach full of wings and beer after during a Browns game and getting your bill and and its well under $20.  The prices are incredibly low.  Bottom line is Pounders is a local bar with a local feel.  Where bartenders remember your name upon  your return and make you want to come back again"}
{"text":"Great wings and service Everytime I have been there. Really fun with the trivia on Thursday, plus their birthday wheel!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not a bar for out of towner's on vacation as they will not accept any other state's ID's.  Edit: returned by the owners request and had great service without announcing that I was the ID issue from the previous evening. Had great service and throughly enjoyed myself with great food, drinks, and pool tables."}
{"text":"Looks like a regular bar but the food is very good.  Really great wings,  we couldn't believe they haven't won best wings since 08! Burgers are made fresh when you order them. They also have great specials everyday.  Clean and well managed.  If I'm ever in a mood for wings and burgers,  I'm coming here."}
{"text":"This place is clean and friendly! The wings were great and the prices are good too. The bathroom was clean and fresh too so I give it 5 stars !!!"}
{"text":"First time I came here I thought it was a dive bar. It probably was. There were 4 or 5.99 steak specials with fries and super cheap beer 6 or 7 years ago. Now it offers decent craft selections upgrade burger selections and me and haven't been embarrassed to bring my wife inside."}
{"text":"Dropping a star due to all the BS rules they have recently added to the wing specials...stop in and you will see.  Eat before ya go..trust me.."}
{"text":"Truth in advertising: Pounders is a beer and a shot joint in a strip mall. Those offerings are very reasonably priced and served by amiable bartenders. The crowd is made up of funlovers who appreciate a solid deal on booze. It's loud and the food's fried. They get bonus points for a slew of extra offerings, including bar bowling, electronic trivia, free wi-fi(!), and the ability to watch your car in living color on the surveillance monitor. Cool place."}
{"text":"We were looking for a sports bar to watch a football game and I decided on this place after reading the Yelp reviews.  We had the mozzarella sticks, pig in a poke burger, and the chicken nachos. All of the food was good. The service was prompt and friendly and they kept the beers flowing. I liked the overall atmosphere--dark, cozy, Christmas lights. A bit of an older crowd but they were all having a ton of fun playing games and socializing. They swapped channels on the TVs for us so we could better watch that game, which was extra cool and really made it the football night we were looking for!"}
{"text":"This place is just absolutely amazing!!!  Their wings are the bomb dot com!!! I swear every flavor that I try here has been unique with a kick of flavor! I used to come here many years ago for the wings and affordable beverages and I stopped because I never had time to come here as often anymore.  Well that all just recently changed and I started making time to come here again! The wings are still amazing after so many years which is phenomenal! They have awesome specials every single day during the week which keeps the customers coming back!    I have been trying out new appetizers on their menu and have been amazed every time!  They give you a very generous portion when it comes to chicken nachos and I'm not sure what kind of seasoning they use on their shredded chicken but it is also packed with flavor!  They have pretzel bites served with spicy nacho cheese which goes great with their beer.  And they also served deep fried pickles chips and banana peppers with special sauce that isn't spicy.  If you're looking for a local bar to eat and drink at, either with friends or by yourself, I highly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Just got back from my first trip to Pounders.  The place was pretty full for a Tuesday night.  We originally came for $1 taco Tuesday but were informed it ended at 8:00pm.  No problem, we moved onto their huge list of chicken wings and ordered 6 spicy pineapple and 6 hot Thai garlic wings and both were pretty tasty.  They have $.40 wing nights so I look forward to checking them out."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this bar for a couple of years now and had told my boyfriend about it.  He loves dive bars and this one is perfect.  The wing flavors are to die for and the beers are super cheap.  Besides that you've got bartenders and cooks who actually remember your name when you sit down.  That says a lot!!! Only thing that you need to be careful for, are the cops.  It's Parma Hts and they will pull you over if they are suspicious.  There was a check point just last night... So be careful while enjoying some wings, beer and lots of tvs to watch your favorite game."}
{"text":"Awesome food 116 different flavors of wing sauces to choose. All there sauces are made in house. The wings are meaty and moist inside the bone when you bite into them. If you are a wing man like me you will love this place. Plus craft beer list to pick from amongst so many other beers. Pool tables golden tee golf and a bowling machine hell yeah."}
{"text":"Pounders is the kind of place that makes you feel comfortable,  no matter what you're wearing or who you are. Its always about a good time at an affordable cost.  The bartenders are wonderful- always attentive, friendly and hard working. The food is really good. Typical bar food, but prepared well and flavorful. They always have special events and deals which are good values.  There's pool tables, bowling, darts but we love karaoke. I'm embarrassed to say I don't know the karaoke deejays name, but he's a great emcee and has a wonderful voice.  Pounders fan for life!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday. Chicken or Beef 3/$5. Service was quick and friendly! My glass never ran dry. Meat in tacos had good flavor. Hard shells were a little weird. Tasty but thick, almost felt like fried pita bread. Overall not bad tacos. Would have loved a side of salsa instead of taco sauce. Fresh cut fries and chicken wings were also tasty. Good eats! Looking forward to coming back for the Electric Grandma Hamburger. Burger with fire roasted jalapeño, mozzarella sticks, habanero cheddar and a chipotle aioli. Sounds fascinating!"}
{"text":"For being in a little Parma Heights plaza, Pounders isn't bad.  They have great drink/food specials   HUGE selection of wing flavors Decent staff Decent TV set - up (although many of them are smaller than you'd want)  Overall, not a bad little bar.  Next time I really want to try the Bourbon Meyer wing sauce flavor."}
{"text":"We frequently order their 50 wings for carryout. They are huge and at a very great price! Their fries were fresh cut and awesome! In the summer they have volleyball leagues and its nice to drink on the patio. Ive had other food here and it was all good. This is a nice small corner bar that had really great food and nice specials."}
