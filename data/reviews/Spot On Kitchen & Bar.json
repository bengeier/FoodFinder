{"text":"Went to out last night expecting to eat at Local 002, but found that it had been replaced with Spot On.  This place is affiliated with 4th Spot in the NW and seems to have the same menu. We decided on pizza (the \"Karuzo's\" thick crust) and some pints (some kind of happy hour deal at $5).  Overall, a good experience. Great service! My only complaint is that the pizza was kind of undercooked - the crust was too pale and didn't have enough crunch. I want to say 3 stars for the pizza, but 4 stars overall, especially considering they had just opened the day before."}
{"text":"A bright \"Spot\" in the area!  Have eaten here several times since they opened in March and the food has been great each time.  Fish tacos are as good as I have had in Hawaii, Burgers are huge and may be the best I have had.  Seem to have some sort of special happening any day of the week.  I heard there is music on Tuesday nights, but have not had a chance to check that out yet...will do that soon.  Best of Luck and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Didn't know at first this place is the same as the 4th spot. This of course is great news, because I knew I could expect a good meal. I had the Samosa Veggie Burger. It had a hint of curry flavour and a softer texture. A nice change to the usual veggie burgers made of Porto Ella or a rice combo. It was served with a sweet mango chutney, on focaccia. My only tiny complaint is that for a veggie burger, it's on the slightly expensive side. My bf went for the ultimate comfort food, the bacon jalapeño macaroni. Also on the expensive side for the portion size, but wholly! It's creamy, smoky and VERY spicy. This dish had a ton of jalapeños.  I would actually recommend this to start to share between three people instead. But alas, some people can eat a heart attack on a plate like that with no repercussions. Our server was friendly and efficient. While the location isn't as cozy as the original, it's food makes up for the lack of ambiance, with quality."}
{"text":"It was the first visit for us to Spot On. Tuesday evening featured specials on pasta and Wildrose beer. It also featured live music ( \"Son of Ray\"/ Rob Lagace) which was entertaining but not obtrusive. You could still hear yourself think and talk and we were sitting in the lounge where the musician was located.   We split an order of salt and pepper chicken wings and coconut shrimp tacos. The wings were lightly breaded. Not something I usually like but these were light and crispy. They also came with a side dish of your choice. We chose Kennebec fries which were nicely seasoned(old bay?)  The tacos were delicious and one of the few instances of coconut shrimp that actually had some taste of coconut. The hot sauce they put on the table in an unlabelled squeeze bottle was fantastic and HOT! I loved it but some people would probably appreciate a warning before using!  I had beer which was nice and cold. My wife had wine and was impressed she got a new glass with each glass ordered not just brought in a carafe and poured into a dirty glass. A nice touch. This isn't a super fancy place but it was those nice  little touches that made it a great evening. The service was attentive and genuine, not like some of the fake saccharine service you get at the chain restaurants. We enjoyed ourselves and will definitely go back. We saw a lot of pizza coming out of the kitchen and it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy going here and love the pizza here! not to mention the great deals that have. Staff there are always great and we often meet friends and family there."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.   Monday night was pizza night.   Reasonable prices and very tasty.   Atmosphere very nice too."}
{"text":"I brought my dad here for his birthday. We were in the neighborhood and looking for somewhere new to try. I always enjoy trying new restaurants and there were positive reviews (thanks Yelpers!), so we took a chance!   The interior is simple, but nice. They have done a good job renovating the space and making it approachable for people who want dinner or just a quick beer after work. Our server was friendly and always made sure we had drinks/everything we need. My dad got the Spaghetti and Meatballs, and I had the Avocado burger. My dad enjoyed his Spaghetti and Meatballs and was happy with the portion size. My burger was pretty good. While I liked the different take on frying the avocado, I think it would've been better if they just let the avocado shine on its own. Otherwise, the bun to meat ratio was good and it was pretty tasty.  I'm only giving 3 stars because while we liked our meal, it wasn't anything unique or something that stood out as mindblowing. I would give it another try though."}
{"text":"I originally gave this place two stars because of the service and a few mediocre dishes. We returned because of its close proximity to work and were served by a young man named Brendan on the patio. Not only was he attentive and efficient as a server, but he made me change my previous review with his great service and personality. They have an excellent happy hour, $5 Rosé (only place in neighbourhood with rosé) and great snacks. We really love the pizza for $4. It's a must do. Make sure to do that between 2-5. They also have really good daily specials. Great job tonight. We will return more often with the new and improved service!!"}
{"text":"First time her with friends. We are all from out of town. All enjoyed our meals , server was great. Used to attend Karouso's on 4th. Loved the pizzs"}
{"text":"Came again this evening for 1/2 priced pizzas and the service was great! Fast, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and a salad for take out tonight because it's really close to my sister in laws condo. My SIL has lyme disease and a ton of food allergies to go along with it. Everyone was really accommodating to them and really seemed to take special care of her meal which I really appreciate! The veggie pizza I ordered was really yummy and filling, albeit a little soggy in the middle. The reason this review garnered only 3 stars because when I ordered they originally told me 15 minutes. But when I arrived 15 minutes later to pick it up I was forced to wait another 35 minutes, which would have been no problem had proper expectations been set in the first place."}
{"text":"I never even heard of this restaurant until I moved into the area. So, when we were looking for a place to have dinner near me... We settled here.  Frankly, I don't think it's something super special but our server was pretty nice, there is daily specials and good drink and food selections.  We sat out on the patio which is always in the WIN column for me.... who doesn't love patios, Amirite?  I ordered up some jerk chicken tacos that actually had a nice kick to them and were quite substantial... however I found the spice on the chicken to be a bit over powering by itself but that's just me being picky (and really, this is MY review.... I'm allowed.. that's right, it's all about ME people) OH also, it was topped with mango salsa... which was nice.  So... like the fellow reviewers before me, would I say this place is \"spot on\"? I'd have to try it out again and see... but good first experience for sure."}
{"text":"Came to Spot on Sunday afternoon. We were part of a big group. Food was great, portions were huge! The only issue was the table maintenance was poor.  Some bus staff would be an asset to this restaurant. All in all I would recommend this restaurant. I would have rated higher if I didn't have to move my starter plates to make room for my main."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Noisy and busy at lunch but still a nice atmosphere. The chicken pot pie was delicious. Serving sizes are generous."}
{"text":"Karuzos pizza comes to the south, finally!    I'm super pumped about this place. As a born and raised Calgarian (please,  no pictures) I have always loved Karuzos. I loved that the 4th Spot kept the recipes once they took the reigns. The only thing that kept me from spending my mortgage on 4th Spot pizza was the inevitable drive north. Now there is NOTHING to stop me.   If you can't tell, the pizza is amazing. The rest of the menu isn't to bad either. Could use a better beer selection but it's not a deal breaker.  Go here. Eat pizza. And give it a good review"}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free pizza. Friendly staff. Noisy at peak times but otherwise you can often get entire place for a few people. Cozy atmosphere and consistently good service!!"}
{"text":"i live in Garrison Green and I'm super happy to have this place so close. The food is great and I've been very happy with the service.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs the first time I was there and they were so good I had to have them next time too.  Finally ventured outside the comfort zone (knowing I wasn't hungry enough to do them justice) so had their Vitamin Sea salad on this third visit.  Delicious!!! I'm obviously not the only one who's happy because the place has been packed most times I've been there - the exact opposite of the previous business in that location.  I want to give it the official thumbs-up because I hope they stay in our neighbourhood for a long time!!"}
{"text":"Friendly, competent service and delicious food. I had the Cobb salad and it was a generous portion with a good ratio of chicken, bacon, avocado, feta, and romaine (I skipped the egg). The focaccia was a bit on the dry side but the salad itself was the bomb. Tender, well seasoned chicken and crispy bacon. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Prices? Too expensive for what you get. Food? Overwhelmingly average at best. Hubbie and I thought we'd try a new spot for date night, and he's a burger fiend . It was \"burgers on special\" night so thought we'd give it a go. The burger was good, but would not have been worth the regular price. I ordered the salmon salad, thought it sounded appetizing and because it said the salad had asparagus- which I love with salmon- thought I'd try it. Mistake! The salmon serving was small, which turned out to be a good thing as it was over cooked. And I'm pretty sure the reason it was over cooked was because it was just on the verge of being thrown out. It was NOT fresh, and had a distinctly \"fishy\" taste that one only gets with fish that is past it's best before date. And the asparagus? It was maybe one stalk sliced as you slice green onions for a salad, in teensy little circles. Nearly $20 for that salad. Overall, not worth the trip. Entirely forgettable food. Bye bye."}
{"text":"While visiting from Ontario for a family reunion we all went to lunch At Spot On (6 adults and seven kids). The service was excellent. The food arrived promptly, to the delight of hungry kids, and was rated excellent by everyone in the party. The burgers were hand made and well seasoned, pizzas for the kids were well received including two gluten free pizzas. The portion sizes were quite ample and you won't leave hungry. We are looking forward to a return visit and will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Just about a perfect neighbourhood family spot. Quick, friendly service and super family friendly. Food is delicious and portions are generous with better than average prices. An excellent patio for nice weather also.   Gluten free pizza crust was a winner with my celiac friend and the burgers and wings were a hit with the others. Kids menu included dessert.   Specials are good and management/ownership gets involved in the community.   We hit this place regularly and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars cause it's about time someone in the area opens up a restaurant that is family friendly while still having great food, wine, specials and not making me find a Boston pizza. The other other choice in Marda, Garrison, Altadore and Killarney are Opa which is on for fast food but not for a sit down evening for a great meal. The food as well is really great. Pizzas are great, tacos, burgers and fries. The kids (and I) love the chicken fingers and friends. Wednesday I half price wine which is lovely to not pay $12 per glass. Overall a very welcome addition to the area and such great food and service I would drive for it."}
{"text":"I don't live in Calgary and this place is located close to where my brother lives. Went there for lunch with four adults and six kids.  The host was nice, our server was a little slow and a little unresponsive initially to our request to have the kitchen look into egg and nut allergies that our kids have.    For my brother's kids with no allergies, the serving size for the kids menu Chicken tenders and Spaghetti and Meatballs was very generous. We had to wait about half an hour for the rest of the food. The waitress tried to get our order for the quesadilla ($14) for our kids out - which our three kids split. We supplemented that with a full order of nachos ($21) and side fries.  That was plenty.  The French Onion was very good - what made it unique was that it was covered with both melted cheese and a puff pastry as well.  Really excellent and worth trying if you are a fan of French onion. Second best to the Sofitel in San Francisco.  My wife had soup of day which was a cream of mushroom - she said it was ok and was a little disappointed that the cup of soup did not have any bread.  My brother had the burger with the deep fried avocado and it looked good. my sister in law had the Matador salad - which was beef and veggie kebob which looked fantastic plentiful.   We would definitions go back given the proximity to my brother's place. Food was tasty and the portion size was good value. Wait staff could be a little better, but they were not rude or anything."}
{"text":"Whenever I see a new restaurant with solid reviews I make sure to add it to my list of places to try, this was the case with Spot On Kitchen & Bar. First of all I was very happy to get away from eating downtown; seems like the majority of the time I'm eating out it's a trek to Calgary's busy core. So heading to a restaurant in the quieter and unassuming Garrison Green was a breath of fresh air! Spot On is located on the corner of Richard Road and Richard Way in the Southwest where Local 002 used to be, you'll notice it right away with its fun and bright new sign and branding! There's plenty of parking as well and it's free, another plus over not eating downtown! Upon entering you'll take in their bright and homey interior, the decor has a simple but modern feel to it with rustic and local elements that make for a very relaxed and cozy environment. The hostess was super friendly and was happy to let us pick our table as it was a quieter evening. The restaurant is broken into a lounge and dining room, but both areas flow freely into each other to maintain the open concept. We sat in the lounge which still felt very relaxed and welcoming, not loud and hectic like most separate restaurant lounges. There's also a beautiful looking patio we would have tried had the weather cooperated.   Their menu offers items created with locally sourced food and selections of a gastropub variety, nothing feels too out there and a lot of it feels Canadian. Things like their poutines, Alberta beef, Quebec cheese curds and maple bacon just scream Canadian comfort food. But then they also have a ton of fresh and colourful ingredients added as a twist to your usual pub menu items, a \"Tacos N' Mexi\" section, pastas, thin crust pizza and even weekend brunch! Their selection is great, well-rounded but not overwhelming or too much to go through. There are even a lot of gluten-free options throughout their entire menu! Their beer selection is adequate for your average beer drinker, but beer snobs will likely be a bit disappointed. Their cocktail menu sticks to the basics, but they looked equipped enough to take most requests. Finally their wine menu is definitely an improvement on the former two and offers a nice selection of reds and whites, along with a couple roses and a few champagne options.   Our server Mia was great; she was accommodating and on the ball with everything. Even when we were changing orders right after saying them, she remained patient and friendly lol :). She made sure to check-up on us more than once and ensure we had everything we needed, and was happy to answer any questions we had about the food or the restaurant. It also seemed like she was well trained on the menu and knew it well, I'm always impressed when a server can confidently point you in the right direction and read the table well. For food we split a half order of their \"El Grande Nachos\" w/ chicken, I can see why they're called El Grande as even a half order was substantial! For our mains I went with the special which was the \"Steakout Sandwich\", for my side I had Kennebec fries and my fiancée had the Maple Canuck Burger with a caesar salad on the side. The nachos were just okay for me, the toppings were good but the tortilla chips weren't my favorite nor was the salsa. To be fair I don't like most restaurant salsas as I like my salsa hot and spicy! My steak sandwich was cooked perfectly and it was definitely a quality AAA cut and the fries were great. By the far the biggest winner at the table was the Maple Canuck Burger, luckily my fiancée couldn't finish it all and I could sample it. It was so tender and the flavour combination was unreal, I tried parts on their own which were all great and as a whole it comes together amazingly! In my top 5 burgers for sure!  Super impressed by Spot On Kitchen & Bar, exceeded my expectations and delivered great service and even greater food! Definitely one I'll be excited to re-visit!"}
{"text":"Working weekends sucks. My boss didn't believe me when I said I'm allergic to working at such times, so there I was, a sap.  The highlight (Other than going home) was lunch. Spot On was nearby, so all of us saps stopped in.  The inside is laid out well. Lots of room the move around, and clean.  Decided on the meat lovers scrambler. It was great. The cheese sauce gave me a Costanza moment, because I think it moved after tasting it.  The server was terrific and very quick.  To put in the clichè, this pub was spot on."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here every so often. The food is decent and the patio is one of the nicest I believe. The menu has the typical burger/sandwich choices, pizza, salads, pastas. But that being said they are all unique and their appetizers all seem quite interesting.   It's a nice place and the service was pretty good. We usually sit outside when we can because the inside seems to really pick up sound, so it can get very loud even when there are not many people there. They have different specials on for each day and we ended up getting the half price wings and wine Wednesday.   Prices are typical $15-$18 entrees. The portions are on the small side."}
{"text":"A lot to like plus some quibbles. The place is comfortable and modern without being fussy. The menu is extensive with a lot of variety and good specials. However the burger tasted like meatloaf -- mushy and over handled. Another person at our table got spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs tasted exactly the same."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for 50% pizza Monday. I decided on the Tropical Thunder, which has  ham, bacon, sundried tomatoes, cheese, cranberries, and pineapple. The service was prompt and the food arrive within a normal amount of time. Not a huge beer selection, but they did have the honey lager on tap (Granville Island, I believe) which was great.  First impression was that the pizza was quite tasty. Good amount of toppings with a great crust. Good size crust with excellent crispiness. They call it a thin crust, but it's not even close to the thinness of European style thin crust. Maybe 'slim' crust is better? Either way, I do enjoy pizza crust but hate when it's too big and you end up filling yourself with it. The pizzas are 10\", of which I ate half and was stuffed.  Pretty solid little pub/restaurant, although I probably wouldn't get the pizza on a regular night when it's full priced."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 10 times in the past year. The decor is simple and they play fun music and have a small outdoor patio. The thin crust burning bee pizza is fabulous and so is the karouzo special. I've enjoyed the salmon salad, the burgers and have tried both kennebec and sweet potato fries. They are amazing!  Fries come in a small deep fryer basket if ordered as a side dish. Portions are fairly large. I've tried the fish tacos and the steak tacos. Would pass on the steak tacos. The saucy balls are super tasty and once they came out undercooked which I sent back and had a fresh order made. That was my only disappointing experience. They brought us hot, cooked saucy balls and removed it from our tab. Do note during busy times, service is not stellar and you may wait awhile for a drink. Overall, a solid lunch or dinner spot as I've obviously been going approx once/month."}
{"text":"This place is light years ahead of the last two restaurants/bars that were in this location. The service is good and the food delicious. I am glad to have this place in my neighborhood!  I'm currently avoiding carbs, but in the past have really enjoyed their maple bacon burger (sorry I can't remember the name... maybe something Canadian) and poutine. In fact, I've enjoyed all of the dishes I've had there."}
{"text":"I wasnt sure what to expect from here as it was listed as a family restaurant, however it was one of the better restaurants that I have taken a chance on lately! Great food with good portions and a nice beer menu. Service was \"spot on\" ;) Definately will be going back and plan to try the other location as well!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is good!  I rarely leave reviews to food places after just one visit, but in case of Spot On I think that's justified. Because I'll most definitely be happy to return, and am inviting anyone to see I was right praising the place.  Just out of it, had a lunch with my dear love, and honestly, everything worked absolutely well. Nice and helpful service, excellent (and I mean it) quality of food, large portions, all good.  Many nice and professional touches in design, menu item names. Food is most obviously created just there in the kitchen - nothing of Kraft's gravy, or burger patties from nearby superstore. Spot On kitchen actually works, and works impressively.  The place is a bit pricey on drinks, and menu may have extend a bit further than \"advanced bar\" fare, but hey, whatever they have - they do it right. My respect."}
