{"text":"Cool place, nice terrase. Terrible service. Our waitress was alone, it took her too long to bring our nachos and sangria. They burned our first nachos and we got the 2nds for free"}
{"text":"Aupres tries too hard to be all things at once and doesn't really hit the spot on either front as a consequence. In Montreal, it is a serious catering offence.  The same hard effort, on the redeeming side, is put in by the staff. Their cheerfulness is second to none, as is linguistic flexibility. It feels French in its presentation and attitude (positively). The snags, however, are just around the corner.   The state and ethos of the \"house\" can be gauged by what the house puts its name on, such as house wine. At Aupres, the house wine is harsher than a mediocre convenience store-bought tipple. Cheap doesn't necessarily mean halfway to vinegar. Oh dear.  Being in a French-themed restaurant, on a French street in a French city may warrant eating some French dish. I, having had enough trendiness for one day at the Fashion Festival, was instead craving the simplicity and gastronomical coarseness of a good burger. It is also, by common sense admission, a dish almost impossible to get wrong by anyone who can cook the fancier items on the menu.  Dear, oh dear. Mystery will shroud the origin of the liquid under my burger bun (dressing from the salad? Burger patty juices? Who knows). Aside from the wet and oily bun bottom the burger was decent and may have earned a pass grade, were it not for its team-mate: the salad.   Fresh-washed greens are all the hype, but these guys were maybe a little TOO fresh. The water dripped more copious than the dressing, making the accompaniment to my abused burger an insult to the catering industry.  So what am I to make of Aupres de ma blonde? A bunch of Europhile friends, maybe students doing this for fun, ganging together to string up a pretence of quality while cutting corners, and lacking even the essential standard of care, or pride, in their delivery. The fact it's instead, from what I gather, a professionally run place makes it all the more tragic. It has three stars solely for the waitress' smile and joie de vivre: the only really French thing about the place."}
{"text":"I found Auprés de Ma Blonde while looking for a place to hang out and have a drink while waiting for a reservation at a \"big F'ing deal\" place nearby. My coworker and I just wanted to have a drink but the smell of the food (mussels) coming out prompted me to ask my coworker if we should eat here instead. He replied that I'd made such a big F'ing deal about the \"big F'ing deal\" place that we had to go there. The other place disappointed us both and Auprés de Ma Blonde didn't when I stopped in on my next trip to Montreal. The mussels and fries are awesome. The steaks have been really good too. One of the low reviews criticizes the fish n chips. Seriously, you ordered the fish n F'ing chips at a bistro in Montreal?!  I bet he orders the burger when he goes to Katz's. If the place is busy then the wait service suffers a bit but no big deal. Order a Belle Geuele or a Cheval Blanc and some mussels and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The place was empty when we went and it took 15 min or so to even get menus. After looking at the menu nothing was jumping at me so all we ordered was a 2 beers and believe it or not we wait another 15-20min just for 2 beers. I can just imagine how much longer it would have been if I had got something to eat. Not a great experience so unfortunately I wont be going back to try the food"}
{"text":"I LOVE auprès de ma blonde. From the front it looks like yet another simple Plateau terrace/bistro. But go inside and out the back and you will find a beautiful hidden terrace with vines and water fountains and of course, the upstair neighbour's cat! The food is delicious and the drinks are too (as well as being extremely well priced). I take everyone who visits here, and they all cannot believe this charming little oasis. HIGHLY recommend if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of St-Denis/plateau area."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday lunch with a group of 17 people. Service was excellent, food came out quick and at the same time for everyone, nice decore, we had a great time. Prices are excellent. Will come again."}
{"text":"My BFF and I happened upon this spot on our way to \"a glass of wine\" after a long day of shopping. I was really impressed as the appetizer plate for two turned out to be a great find!  Our appie for two comprised of the best (by far) tzatziki I have ever had, cucumbers, tomatoes, great olives, feta cheese, charizo, dolmas, and this great salmon flavoured mashed potato dish.  I loved it all!  We saw that a couple got the calamari, fries, and salad that I was looking to try and it looked amazing - large plate and very reasonable!  We only come once a year for Grand Prix but I'm bring my husband next time (the guys were doing the Thursday track day stuff).   I agree with another reviewer, it is mostly Greek but that is not the outside impression you get but heh not a big deal.  Oh and our waitress was fantastic!"}
{"text":"i'd go here lots if i lived here. affordable prices (esp. happy hour), close to lots of stuff and the terasse is perfect for people watching. mediterranean menu items were simple and refreshing. perfect for a hot and humid day."}
{"text":"Adorable covered patio in the back. That was my favorite part about this bar/restaurant. That aside, the service was okay. Decent happy hour prices if you get the beer pitcher. The sangria tasted good, but really not alcoholic at all. Split a pitcher between two people and didn't feel anything."}
{"text":"Very nice terrace, good home wine and very helpful stuff :-)"}
{"text":"cool place. Ended up there by chance as we were hungry, it was cold and it was right in front of us. Late afternoon burgers that were excellent and I would have had a beer but we had a long drive back to Vermont.   Good food, friendly service, nice atmosphere. We lucked out!"}
{"text":"Ma Blonde has a better than average house wine and despite being densely populated with French people, this was a really enjoyable place to have dinner :)  (j/k about the french, ...sorta).  With 5 mussel plate options to choose from, I was able to get my fix on, and that made me happy."}
{"text":"We picked this place for dinner since it had a nice outdoor seating area, right on St Denis it is north of Sherbrooke, so it is in a quieter area.      We ordered a fish and chips and a souvlaki.    The former was OK, even though we asked for the fries to be well done, they came out not too crispy.   The two fish fillets were average in size, they seemed like coming from a Gorton's Fish Fillet box.  They were edible though.     The  souvlaki was completely covered with a yogurt sauce that was all over the dish....you could barely find the chicken and fillings.  The waitress never offered water, we asked for extra napkins, she never brought them...etc..etc..    There are better places on St Denis for a meal."}
{"text":"Great spot for delicious sangria and souvlaki. The patio is a lot of fun and the service was really nice and helpful. We all had souvlaki and thought it tasted amazing, with wonderfully garlic-y tzatziki sauce! We didn't try any other dishes, but I assure you the ambiance, souvlaki and sangria are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Cute little place with a terrace right on St. Denis. Perfect place to have \"a bite to eat with couple of beers\". If you're looking for a pub/resto/bar to hang out with some friends, I'd recommend to check this place out."}
{"text":"Highly recommend.  Very nice atmosphere, our waitress was pleasant and helpful.  My wife had a souvlaki which she liked, I had mussels in a pesto broth + Belgian frites, both were the best I've had outside of Belgium.  Included - very good lentil soup before and good coffee afterward.  I had a half carafe (2 generous glasses) of their house white wine ($5.50 USD), it went well with the mussels.  Along with a very favorable exchange rate right now, our check + 20% tip = $33 USD.  Great lunch in a beautiful part of a beautiful city."}
{"text":"This little resto has the flair of a small town eatery, a place where families go for lunch, girlfriends meet for a cup of coffee in the afternoon to catch up on the latest gossip, and where the guys go at night to watch the game and have a pint. Unfortunately, being in downtown Montreal rather than MiddleofNowhere, it is up against strong competition by places who try to satisfy only one of the customer groups stated above.  This being said, it does have a homely feeling about it. We shared the mixed plate of Greek appetizers and it was quite good. Most food on the menu was Greek. This fact might be advertised a little more, since the decorations remind of French bistro rather than Greek taverna. They have Belle Gueule on tap, which makes for a nice change in an area otherwise dominated by Boreal or Molson.  Overall, the place offers the opportunity to step from present day Montreal right into a small town sometime in the 80s or early 90s, and hey - how often do you have a chance to do that outside of science fiction?"}
