{"text":"Greasy spoon joint.  Great neighborhood place serving breakfast and lunch.  Love their breakfast.  Seating is limited so expect to wait to be seated on a weekend because the locals flock to this place since its the only place nearby serving a good breakfast other than fast food. Waitresses are really nice and will make you feel at home."}
{"text":"great local diner! reasonable price, Great breakfast, very clean. Cant wait to try their lunch."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some quick and delicious breakfast in the morning. But it's always pretty full and you normally will have a wait ahead of you, especially if you arrive on the weekends. Service is good, servers are mindful and polite. Love shufflin!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years and you can't go wrong.  Love this place and it's got a local feeling to it that keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and prices. The people are really nice.  Try the greek omelet."}
{"text":"Perfect greasy spoon!! Great breakfast and great grilled cheese!!  Service is excellent!!"}
{"text":"I truly do love this place wonderful staff and amazing food. I always had great customer service from the staff and always a friendly face."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem!!! I was starving and CRAVING  a last minute breakfast! Great food and service! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best local spot for breakfast and lunch. Food is consistent and the company is great."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  Love the country fried steak with eggs and hashbrowns.   This place is always packed and you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This place belongs on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives...you have to go for the atmosphere.  Felt like a leap back in time.  Food was good -- the service was super!  I had a eggs and sausage patties with a great biscuit, my husband had eggs and ham with white toast.  Can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Great place great food. Service is outstanding by servers that have been there for years. Food is cooked by a cook that has also been there s long time. They are only open until 2:00pm but you can't go wrong for breakfast or lunch. Been there for years and going strong."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there today. Food was average tasting and a typically local joint. Very busy at lunch so service was somewhat slow.  Had a cheeseburger which tasted okay, the chilli seemed like it was from can but could be wrong. Ketchup was definitely the cheapest they can purchase.   Used to eat here 20 years ago for breakfast. Have been told breakfast is still good."}
{"text":"I have lived near here for two years and always wanted to stop in for breakfast or lunch (they don't do dinner). The waitresses were very friendly and you could tell that most of the people in here were regulars b/c they were all being called by name - nice touch.   I ordered coffee (black), two eggs, country ham with biscuit and grits. The food came out in about 5 minutes and it was freshly cooked and hot. The menu said their eggs are farm raised but did not ask if they were local. The coffee was refilled often and they also brought out a huge glass of ice water.   I love places like this, look bad from the outside, inside it has white and black checkered floors with red vinyl seats, no frills, but the food was very good.   Price was right too. I will go back :-)"}
{"text":"We were staying on the lake for about 5 days and wanted a great, local spot for breakfast - wow- did we every find the place. When you pull into the parking lot, I have to be honest, the little building does not scream, \" this is a great place to eat \" ! With that said - \" THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO EAT!!\" The moment you walk in, you smell good food, hear happy people and are quickly greeted and taken to your table. Cramped quarters, but no Bg deal. One morning we had 7 at the table with no problem. We only did breakfast, and both times it was wonderful.  I love all things southern at breakfast, so I was in hog heaven ! By the way, service was quick and very friendly.  Our server was Lauren (sp?) and she did outstanding .  Lunch looked great, we just didn't make it back, but next time !! The coffee is great and they do not let your cup go empty. Prices were super fair and servings were more than enough.  Overall, super great experience!!"}
{"text":"Decent food for the most part. Overcrowding, not the best service. Calling me 'hun' or 'sweetheart' doesn't mean you care about me, the customer. I'm a big fan of the idea behind this place and keeping it around, but it's not open a lot of hours and it's a crowded craphole any other time. My butt shouldn't smack a table trying to walk from one end to the other."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go get awesome food and the owners r the best!!! U will not be disappointed if u go here for breakfast and/or lunch!!"}
{"text":"I decided to work from home today but I have nothing to eat so I  landed on trying Shuffletown. I have been here before for breakfast and the food was ok. Nothing moving in anyway.   For lunch I decided to order 3 entrees to ensure I would have something I'd like. 1) I had the daily special of grilled chicken tips over rice. It comes with a choice of 2 sides of which I chose collards and broccoli with cheese. Both sides were a specialty item of the day as well. Yes, the special was broccoli with a slice of unmelted cheese. Not like a casserole. I wouldn't recommend this dish or the sides. I tasted one bite and gave the rest to the dogs.   2) Bacon Cheeseburger and fries. The fries were fresh and tasty. The burger was ok at best. It's a frozen patty which was a little dry.   3) Calabash Shrimp special. This was the best of the 3. It had good flavor. The shrimp were a bit odd in texture as if they were soaking in water before being fried but still tasty.   If you live in the area, you know there's nothing to eat out here. I doubt I'd go back even with our limited eateries."}
{"text":"Came in after rugby match and it met every expectation! Fast friendly and delicious! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Very busy but fast diner. Fun and friendly staff! Great diner food! Will be back for more. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The only thing good about being out of work for 2 weeks with shoulder surgery is the fact I can eat breakfast here as many times as I want.  My go-to order:  livermush/egg biscuit with a side of livermush.  My kid likes the F-350 which I think is country fried chicken.  And, my wife likes the pork chops with no sides.  Something about not wanting carbs.  The staff always treats me well.  They know that I am always pressed for time so they expedite my food and payment.  They call me by name."}
{"text":"Would give it a 5 but one time I ordered out and they shorted me a sausage patty!! I love their sausage. I prefer their French toast over pancakes but the problem is they don't have a French toast breakfast with eggs and meat. It's all a la carte. I ordered eggs, sausage, 2 French toast, and the $4 pancake Neal special and it equalled $14!?!?!?! Crazy!!!"}
{"text":"Great area dive. Little crowded sometimes but very fast service. Outdoor seating on picnic tables."}
{"text":"This place is like walking back in time super old school diner. servers have been there forever and are nice  Food is pretty good but the price is what makes it worth going to back."}
{"text":"This was amazing food. This breakfast stop was random, and amazing. The biscuits are Rudy the pancakes are fluffy. And the price is perfect."}
{"text":"Ate here a few days ago with a dear friend for breakfast and I was blown away. I ordered grilled chicken, eggs with cheese, grits and coffee. My friend ordered corn beef hash, grits and eggs and coffee.  I was blown away with the portion sizes as well as the taste. I so enjoyed my food. Lordy. I had to get help to eat the hash browns and still brought some home. All that food and we only spent $20.  Customer service made you feel like you'd pulled up to your own table. Very friendly. I will go back."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! You feel like your right at home. You get your food fast and you can tell they use quality ingredients."}
{"text":"This place has been around for years. I don't know the owner, Andy, but he has owned and operated the restaurant for seven years.  I can say he is the most rudest person and does not care about customers. I guess he has so much business that if there is a problem with a customer he defends the restaurant and pretty much calls you a liar because \"I had 300 takeout orders last Saturday and did not receive one complaint\"....I called last Saturday to complain about bad packaging of our takeout food, which I spent over $30. Owner was busy. So I was going to order another big takeout this morning but after speaking to him and he didn't care if I was lost as a customer, it was obvious this cafe has too much money coming in to care if they mess up orders, owe people for missing food, or be the rudest people on earth. I was astonished and actually did not know what to say. He kept asking, \"Do you want to order food or what\" and \"I check everything that goes out of here and it's clean\".  (These are just a couple comments he stated) I've only met and spoke with one narcissist in my life and this owner is definitely the second. My husband sat next to me and he was shocked that I was spoke to in that manner with an, I don't give a s#&! attitude. I will never ever go back and spend my hard earned money for this guy to make a profit on me. In actuality, he does not care anyway because his employees and himself does not do wrong and the CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS WRONG!!!! I suggest if you want good food, can chance your food being wrong or bad, and you will not call and complain ..eat here. If you want to be respected for your patronage, don't step foot through the door. You are nothing to this owner. I guess that's why everyone is so rude and is careless. I've spoke to 5 of my family and friends that do business there, they're definitely finding another restaurant to do business with and told me to definitely post my experience. Thats about $800 per month this owner just lost starting today.  What in the world has happened to customer service in this world????"}
{"text":"this place has the best food around for lunch. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.   great old school greek food and a really great atmosphere!! would always recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, good people. Recently changed ownership without changing values. I like the vegetarian options but understand that we are all not the same. My lady friend loves the breakfast and other meats. We have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Stepping into Shuffletown Drive-In takes you back a few decades. Most of the service staff is very friendly (my server, not so much). The menu contains many classic breakfast and lunch items. This is certainly a hang out for older generations. I ordered a club sandwich and fries. The club was good: fresh tomato, crisp lettuce, crunchy bacon and descent sliced turkey and ham. The fries were generic but the were hot and crispy. Th place was quite busy with what I'm sure is loads of regulars. I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great \"hometown\" atmosphere.  Service was super friendly.  Food is simple and delicious.  Their breakfast menu is all very good."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in the area with a wonderful staff that knows you by name after one or two visits.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  We usually have the shuffletown special and the liver mush is fried very crispy!"}
{"text":"Them grits tho lol seriously the ultimate breakfast spot period !!! I'm about to go there now !!!"}
{"text":"First few visits were great. Good food, good service. Last few visits not so much. Last visit the server wasn't rude, but not friendly either and spent more time waiting on her \"regulars\" and conversing with them than with us. Time before that, our server forgot to bring our toast and just vanished. We had to flag down another server to get our toast. If you want to give your \"regulars\" top notch service fine, but if you treat everyone good then maybe we become \"regulars\" too, if not then maybe we don't come back and go to Dicks Café in Newton and become regulars there because there the servers give EVERYONE the same great, friendly service."}
{"text":"Epitome of \"hole in the wall\" type diner with friendly southern staff. Ignore the unsightly atmosphere and enjoy hot coffee and a decent filling breakfast. Prices are cheap and the portions are plentiful. The food isn't grandma's cooking but the effort is worth it."}
{"text":"Had us sit down at a dirty table with previous customer dishes on it cleaning it off as we sat there.  Had the bbq it was not good coleslaw was terrible.  Only thing good were fries."}
{"text":"i am changing my review completely. this place is way too busy and im sure breaking fire codes by having way too many people in there. the cashier has the worst attitude ever and needs to be re-evaluated by her boss. horrible customer service, i will never spend another dime in this dive!"}
{"text":"If your're looking for a country breakfast, this is the place!  Eggs the way you like them. They serve up a great cup of coffee and an excellent country breakfast. They serve breakfast till 11am.  They have a good lunch menu too. The Greek salad is one of the best I've ever had. Burgers, Cheese Steaks and sandwiches.  They also have real good sweet tea! Serving since 1957."}
