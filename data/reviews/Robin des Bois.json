{"text":"Amazing place!  Stumbled by it one day and made reservations to go there the week after.  What a nice concept.  The decor is also very homey and makes you feel instantly very comfortable.  It helps that the waiters don't seem to be in a rush at all since they're all volunteers.  Even your tip goes to charity!! 

And of course the food was actually amazing. They change their menu from time to time so the same options are not always available but if you get a chance to try their lentil dahl, do it.  It was hands down the most flavourful and spiced-infused dahl I've ever tasted.  Mmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

After that, I ordered the lamb which was pretty good. The presentation was very nice.

Another compliment to the bread!  So crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside - the way bread is supposed to be.  I went with some Bretons (who apparently are bread and butter experts, or so they claim) and they confirmed that it was, indeed, bread of excellent quality.  We asked them to refill the bread about 3 times and at the end, our waiter was so sweet and gave us a doggy-bag for the remainder in our basket.

Robin des Bois made both my stomach and heart happy."}
{"text":"Just walkes in, without even knowing that it is a non profit organization thqt help shelters. We had a great time! Took chilli for a starter - was amazing! So does the salmon steak! All the workers and volunteers were so nice and welcoming. You must try! Im a vegetarian and my bf is not and we had a lot of options"}
{"text":"They made me wait half an hour to let me know that my food was actually not sent because of a computer problem. To make matters worst, the waitress was giving me attitude when I let her know that I was upset that my time was waisted. I don't care if they have decent reviews for food with service like this, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced, and a wonderful cause. The staff of volunteers is enthusiastic about what they're doing, which is wonderful to see. I had the burger, which I highly recommend, with their arugula salad as an entree which was plenty filling but I still found space for one of their delicious desserts. Even better, after that I went to their \"salle de défoulement\", where for 2$, you can write something on a plate and throw it against a wall. The proceeds go to charity and it's lots of fun. Overall, a great place that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a great place. I love the idea they have come up with. The servers are all volunteers and so is much of the other staff.  All the profits and tips go to feed people in need.  Cool idea!  Then, the food is also great!  What a peaceful and enjoyable place."}
{"text":"What restaurant has all their proceeds go to charities?! 
This one!!!

Great price quality and fresh, delicious food?!
This one!!!

Attentive service?!
This one!!!

Everything we had was amazing. From the salmon tartar, to the grapefruit duck confit salad to the bavette. Excellent execution, fresh local quality and just a wonderful experience supporting a great cause."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night for dinner and we were welcomed warmly to a fun environment. To point out, we didn't know it going into the restaurant but everyone who served us was a volunteer (wearing en elf hat-which was super cute!) and all the proceeds go to a charity. We thought that was a very neat idea and created a fun atmosphere. 

We ordered the \"Chinese buffet\" for 2; which was plenty. It included coconut curry soup appetizer-sweet and spicy with a hint of citrus-delicious and great on a cold winter night! It also came with 3 main dishes- pan fried tofu with mushroom rice, Asian salad and saba noodles with octopus- they were all delicious and complemented each other.  All this was $44 CAD (and we brought leftovers home) 
We also got cappuccino and brownies to share for desert. Once again Robin Des Bois didn't disappoint. 

Overall if you're looking for a really good food and fun atmosphere for a reasonable price, we would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely lunch here with my sister.  Really enjoyed the food.  Great prices as well.  We were passing through Montreal and were looking for a place that had good food, that wouldn't' make us feel tired and heavy while driving long distances.  Really enjoyed the food and experience here.  It is only after we returned and I was on Yelp to write a review did I realize that the staff were volunteers, and the nature of the restaurant.  You would have never known it based on the experience we had.  Everyone was extremely professional and very pleasant to deal with.  Would strongly recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Les organismes d'entraide et de charité sont nombreux à Montréal et c'est tant mieux. Certains par contre réussissent à se démarquer davantage du lot grâce à l'originalité et la singularité qu'ils évoquent. Il en est le cas pour le restaurant Le Robin des bois.

Situé sur le plateau Mont-Royal et souvent fréquenté par des personnalités connues québécoises, ce restaurant encourage le bénévolat créatif. Toute personne désireuse de partager une bribe de fraternité peut s'y rendre et participer au changement de la communauté, donner de soi et ce, tout autant à la cuisine qu'au service. Jusqu'à présent, l'on n'y compte environ 3000 bénévoles actifs, ceux-ci assistant une vingtaine de professionnels qui gèrent officiellement la place. 

En plus d'être à but non lucratif, le restaurant se targue d'une gastronomie très appréciée (dont la cuisine française d'inspiration internationale), couronnée d'ingrédients bruts et entièrement naturels, et à prix raisonnables, ce qui soit dit en passant, incite agréablement le retour des clients gourmands et généreux. Généreux car les dons sont assurément estimés; l'on donne autant que faire se peut et tous les pourboires sont considérés comme des dons. Ainsi, comme le légendaire samaritain, le restaurant \" Le Robin des bois \" redistribue l'argent des riches aux plus défavorisés. Pas envie de faire du bénévolat? Suffit d'y manger ; vous mangez, vous donnez...

Au total, 6 organismes de charité montréalais se voient bénéficier des profits générés par les clients donateurs et philanthropes : Cactus, le Chaînon, Chez Doris, Jeunesse au Soleil, le Refuge des jeunes et le Santropol roulant. Depuis l'ouverture en 2006, plus de 30 000$ ont été gracieusement déversés.

Il est à noter aussi que le restaurant se distingue drôlement grâce à sa petite pièce dans laquelle l'on peut fracasser (en toute sécurité) des assiettes au mur aménagé à cet effet; le tout, moyennant une coquette somme de 5$. Défoulements et dévouements garantis...

Allez-y en soirée; il y a souvent des concerts et prestations de tous genres.

-À essayer en dessert : L'aphrodisiaque, une bière dessert...peu commune! Vanille, chocolat noir avec un soupçon de bourbon!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came from America and randomly walked in here to eat. Everything was so beautiful and the food was great. The woman who started the non for profit organization that runs the restaurant talked to us and explained how people come in and volunteer as waiters or as chefs. The food was incredible and the fact that this is a NFP restaurant warmed my heart."}
{"text":"This place is a gem for the quality of the food and the facts profits go to the community.  The wait staff are volunteers and the place had a great vibe.  The night my GF and I were there a lawyer was serving us.  As for the food, excellent.  Braised lamb possibly the best I ever tasted $20.  Red lentil soup to start also very good, it was a bargain at around $4.  Key line and meringue tart to finish was also a total deal at around $5.  My GF said the Cesar salad with smoked trout was the best she ever had.

To summarize this review... meal for 2 was under $90 with a 20% tip including 1 glass of red wine at $9.  Any shortcomings are not worth mentioning; hence giving \"Robin hood\" the full 5 stars.  Moreover, I will definitely go back when I return to beautiful Montreal.  This was the highlight dining experience of our trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here for dinner on our first night in Montréal and we both adored it! We arrived without a reservation and were still seated promptly, although it seems like making a reservation might be helpful. The waitstaff (all volunteers!) were so friendly. I ordered \"The River\" and it was absolutely to die for. I don't know when I'll be back in Montréal, but I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone I know is going to visit!"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance because of the small no. Of reviews but a must to go. Great service and food"}
{"text":"Outstanding food for a great cause. The one volunteer waitress was working her a$$ off. Cheers to her. Great menu with local produce cooked with flawless execution. We enjoyed everything we ordered, polenta fries w/ olives, caeser salad w// bacon, and The Mountain (roasted roots vegetables & green beans). We really enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere. What an amazing concept this is. I hope it catches on it other parts of the world. Great food that makes a difference. I don't think you can ask for much more as a patron."}
{"text":"Epic dinner - wonderful atmosphere, great service, amazing food and all for a good cause."}
{"text":"I hardly ever give five stars. What a great restaurant!  Not formidably expensive and fantastically done dishes with honesty and flair!  I absolutely loved the duck confit and the roasted fancy veggies!  All Very tastefully done.  Very friendly and prompt service. Congratulation to the management for the concept and keeping prices affordable! and my compliments to the chefs! please don't change;-)"}
{"text":"Really solid restaurant. Great service from the volunteer staff. The food was really excellent as well- had a dhaal soup and a lamb dish and creme brulee that were all really well made. The value is pretty good as well (something around 40 canadian with gratuity included for a soup/entree/dessert). would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"NIce ambience and great service.

The waiter recommended an off-the-menu catch of the day, which was grouper. It came with potatoes and steamed vegetables. The food came out in a pot looking plate. I expected the grouper (by the waiters description) to be very well seasoned. Instead it looked seasoned but I could not get any taste out of it. The same applied with the potatoes, no taste either :(

Don't understand why the waiter called this his favorite dish.

My friend was explaining to me that this was one of the best cuisines in town and it is volunteer ran. All the profits are donated to charity. Which makes it hard for me to give this place a bad review.

The wine and beer selection was decent.

I'd recommend trying the flank steak, that didn't look too bad but be wary you might need to bring your own spices and seasoning!"}
{"text":"Super concept; des bénévoles comme serveurs, en formation, et les bénéfices vont pour aider ceux et celles dans le besoin. Excellent menu et choix; beaucoup aimé! Il faut être généreux et pas trop pressé; belle ambiance et décoration. On y retournera. J'ai pris une assiette de riz brun et champignons -- La plage: excellent; et ma mère, nouille de riz, La rivière."}
{"text":"Un vrai coup de cur pour ce restaurant ! Je l'ai découvert lors d'une soirée de départ d'une amie, qui avait invité une trentaine de personnes. Le lieu s'y prête parfaitement, il y a aussi bien des tables pour 2 ou 4 personnes, que de grandes tablées pour 10 convives.

La nourriture est incroyable ! Plutôt que de choisir entre les différents plats du jour, on a eu la chance de goûter au dhal de lentilles, à la salade de betteraves et chèvre, au poulet mais aussi au saumon, ainsi qu'aux lentilles et légumes rôtis. Tous les plats étaient délicieux, à ne pas en laisser une miette dans l'assiette :)
Un superbe menu pour la bonne cause, que demander de plus ?!

Il faut aussi souligner que les bénévoles qui s'occupent de vous sont très gentils et aux petits soins."}
{"text":"This gig has been going on for quite awhile now... This place is all about volunteer workers (service & kitchen work) and about giving back to the Montreal community.  They support 4 local charities (La Chainon, Le Refuge des Jeunes, Jeunesse au Soleil et le Santropol Roulant).

On the food side, I had a risotto dish which was very good and also as a drink, I had a spicy bloody caesar type drink (don't remember the exact name) which was also interesting (I recommend to try it if you like spicy)."}
{"text":"It's Friday night, you didn't quite make plans but you want to maybe spend a nice night out in Montreal with the significant other. You think of all the places you might want to go but realize they're probably pretty booked and you didn't make any reservations. Hm. What does Yelp say? Yeah, been there, it's okay. Umm that place looks nice but way too expensive. What's this? Robin des Bois? Volunteer staff? Proceeds go to charity? Nice looking menu items? What the heck, let's try this spot. Call to make reservations just to be on the safe side. Get there and realize no reservations needed this particular night. What a charming place. Inviting, cute decor, customized chairs, a piano on the stage... And we haven't even looked at the menu yet! Let's see here... grilled octopus confit? Umm yes please. Creamy mashed potatoes? Roasted carrots parsnips and beets? Green beans cooked to perfection? What kind of magic did they do with these shallots? A mashup of all the best, buttery, comforting things to put in my belly. And I can get a glass of whisky? I'm overwhelmed. I hope they don't offer dessert. Oh, okay, I'll get that creme glacee avec fraise et meringue. Siiiigh. Splurging so much never made my wallet feel so good. And compared to other places in town, this was a bargain! Looking forward to coming back SOON."}
{"text":"I came in just before closing, but they seated me with a warm welcome, and served me the most delicious coconut curry soup with soba broccoli, beans and salmon steak. Wine was good and service was excellent. I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. Not only is it for a good cause, its good value for price, the creative and delicious menu is consistently wonderful. The serving staff makes the place really distinct as well and are enthusiastic. Enjoying a night out in a place where people are happy to be working makes you happy to be there too. Window seats can be chilly in winter."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and fantastic food! Plus, it's a non-profit that helps the community, you can't go wrong with that. 

We made a reservation since we went on a Friday. But it wasn't crazy over-crowded."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. We had the poutine fries as an appetizer, burgers, and split a caesar salad. The food was fantastic, the service was prompt and friendly, and the atmosphere is cheery and comfortable."}
{"text":"Love the concept. Love the decor. Love the cause.

Food was delicious too. I shared the Viking with a friend. This included arugula salad, salmon steak, grilled octopus, mountain bowl and liver (which we substituted for chicken.

I then ordered an apple dessert which was unique (but not really my taste preference).

In sum, I would return. Your wallet feels good, your belly feels good. What more could you ask?!"}
{"text":"Only heard of this place a couple of months ago and was taken to a surprise birthday dinner there yesterday (a Wednesday night). I loved the decor, which I found simple yet stylish, and the service was wonderful. It made me wish paid service could be as good.

As for the food, our party of 6 tried the dal (perfectly balanced spices), the watermelon and halloumi (again a wonderful balance), the fries (delicious lemony mayo), and the courgette fritter (made the least impression on me), en entrée. For the main course, we had grain-fed chicken (succulent), bavette (perfectly cooked), wild mushroom risotto (very creamy), mussels with fennel (delicately flavoured) and the lamb tian (melted in the mouth). Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night with my partner and absolutely LOVED everything about this cozy restaurant. They have a retro- diner kind of vibe that is a bit upscale. Tables for large groups as well as small. A stage for music which they have on most weekends and delicious food. We order the dahl soup to start which was reasonably priced ($4 for a bowl to share for two people) and then the vegetarian chili, poutine, and mountain plate with grilled tofu. The tofu was our favorite part, sweet and firm (I hate soft tofu). The restaurant Is run by volunteers and profits go to charity so you feel good about eating here too! The night we visited, there was a family, including a dapper 10 year old boy in vest and bow tie that we're volunteering. I know we'll definitely be back to eat and perhaps even volunteer."}
{"text":"A restaurant with a great cause and great food. This is a non-profit with volunteer staff, quite the unique concept in Montreal. Their menu is very vegetarian/vegan friendly, and very customizable. It's basically \"Build-Your-Own\": you pick a base (salad, rice, soba noodles) and add your protein (grilled octopus, chicken, liver, salmon...). There's also a more \"classical\" part of the menu (with salmon tartare, steak, poutine, etc) and an eclectic choice of sides (we got a delicious okonomiyaki!). The portions are huge (believe me, I took home half my plate!), and the prices are very reasonable. 
Also: we asked for sangria even though it was not on the drinks menu and boy did they deliver! Most generous sangria I've had in Montreal so far, I'd say!"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned before, this place is run by volunteers and donates all of their profits to local charities helping to reintegrate the homeless into society. Great causes aside, their white bean, bacon, and vegetable soup had just the perfect amount of seasoning to bring out the natural flavors of all the vegetables without having any single element overpower the entire dish. For my main course, I had the Cajun fish fillet w/ squash and legumes, which was delicious even if the Cajun spicing on the fish was slightly overpowered. Next time you're in Montreal, you would do well to see out this pro-bono establishment."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal and decided to try Robin des Bois after finding it on Yelp with high recommendations. And let me say that it did not disappoint. 

The restaurant is very inviting; friendly staff with open space and fun eclectic fabrics decorating the dining chairs. 

I ordered small salmon tartare, arugula salad and french fries, and savored every bite!  Salmon tartare came with capers which was a great mix.  I would order this combination again."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try RDB for a while,it's done! We went there last night and had a really nice time. It was music night, so a bit loud but good music always matches well with good food.
We started with a green salad, which was good but nothing more (parmesan had no taste... and we love parmesan!). We then shared the Cheeseburger and the Salmon tartar which were both really good, well seasoned, nicely presented and all ingredients fresh.
All profits go to charities and all staff are volunteer (including the musicians) which is very nice - good food and giving to charities in one go does feel good ;-)"}
{"text":"Love the idea of this place. Fresh food made for you. Proceeds go to charity!

Incredible staff and really friendly.

Would have been 5/5 but they forgot one of our orders.

Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Fun restaurant, great for the cause you are going for, simple setup and service will of course vary depending on the night as many do it out of pure generosity."}
{"text":"Firstly, Robin des bois is a great concept. All profits go to local charities and most of the waitstaff and kitchen staff are volunteers. My mom came into town the other night and we were looking for a good place to go for dinner. Happened to be in the area, and we decided to try out RDB to see how good the new chef is. 

Both of us were blown away. The atmosphere in the restaurant is what it's always been, cute, a little eclectic, reminds you a little of the former Cafe Esperanza on St Laurent (now, cafe Caigibi). Despite being volunteers, the service from these waiters was better than a good amount of service I've experienced from paid employees in restaurants lately. 

Enough about atmosphere and service though; the food! We both started with their green house salad and it bode very well for the rest of the meal. Fresh baby arugula, chopped and roasted hazelnuts, parmesan shavings and a perfectly balanced vinaigrette. Now I know, salad is salad, but getting that balance just right is tough and this place does it very well. We also had their black olive polenta fries. These were delicious too, little crispy sticks of polenta with bits of black olive served with a rosemary mayo for dipping. 

And then our mains arrived; my mother had their gnocchi with buttnernut squash puree (homemade, boiled then gently pan fried for a little bit of crispyness) while I had the \"pieuvre confite\". My mother (who is notoriously difficult in restaurants) loved her meal. The gnocchi were little clouds of heaven served atop a nice, bright squash puree which was perfectly seasoned.  What blew my mind though was the octopus. True to its name, the pieces of octopus were slow-cooked in fat for a few hours and served with a tortilla española and a homemade roasted tomato salsa. The octopus had the texture of lobster. I ve never had anything quite like it. The fattyness was balanced out by the bright acidity of the tomato salsa and the spanish omlette rounded everything out quite well. 

Finally for dessert we split a cognac-espresso panna cotta with speculoos crumbs. It was the perfect end to an amazing meal. Even more incredible was the price. Usually for food this good, I d be willing to pay $100 pp and up. At  $20-30 per person (before drinks) RDB is some of the greatest bang for your buck in Montreal dining."}
{"text":"A midi
Grande salle peu remplie.nourriture simple et bonne a bon prix.service sympathique,mais professionnel par des bénévoles.concept intéressant.agreable et différent."}
{"text":"I have to rant and rave for a few minutes, because this place is truly special! 

So, Robin des Bois, meaning Robin of the Woods, refers to Robin Hood - the concept behind this restaurant is 'take from the rich to give to the poor', meaning all proceeds go to support four different local charities in Montreal. Even if you're not rich, you will feel it after experiencing this fantastic restaurant-with-a-heart. 

I came to Robin des Bois as a volunteer, not a patron (though I will definitely go back to eat the food). In fact, all of the wait staff are volunteers from the community who sign up for a certain number of tables to wait on, and then go out and do their best. To be honest, I had never in my life worked a table before my first night here, but all of the staff are so kind and helpful, ESPECIALLY the very charming manager, Luc, that I found my feet soon enough and helped out wherever I could. I don't speak French very well so I was a little bit shy with people, but everyone was super understanding and gracious. A lot of the wait staff, however, are people who come back to volunteer regularly (because it's so much fun) and they really know their stuff. 

The FOOD LOOKED AMAZING and I wished I was eating every single dish that I delivered. OMG. It's fine dining, my friends. And, the desserts! The volunteer wait staff and kitchen staff were well fed, too, though! Everybody got delicious nacho soup - the best I've ever had, with fresh chunks of avocado, cilantro, toasty chip bits - nom nom! Not only is the food exceptional, but at the front of the restaurant is a selection of local preserves made entirely by volunteers and all from ingredients from local small farms or rooftop gardens! Pickles till the cows come home. 

If you're a \"people before profits\" kind of person, this is the best place to put your money where your mouth is, literally! The interior is beautiful, like a deluxe, somewhat aged theatre with a lovely piano and warm décor. There are plenty of romantic nooks to dine with your favourite person, or whole sections for large parties. I'm really hoping we can have a Yelp Elite event here sometime!"}
{"text":"I went to robin des bois on a fri night with a group of friends. It wasn't quite a 4 star \"restaurant\", but it was a 4 star experience. 

The restaurant is quite spacious w/ high ceilings and all the different colorful upholstery give the ambient a playful uplifting twist.

The service was one of the most memorable components of the night for me. The waitresses were actually a group of friends who had volunteered that night as a way to celebrate the birthday of one of them. It was the 1st time most of them were trying this experience/serving in a restaurant and so our interactions with them were uncharacteristic and fun in new unexpected ways - making dinner a pleasant and successful experience was a shared team effort :)

Unfortunately, we had to wait for about 40 minutes before our food was served. So it helped that we were not starving/in a rush. I got the beef bavette which came w/ fries and a smallish salad. The fries were ok, but the beef was juicy, flavorful and very enjoyable. The rest of us ordered sanwiches and the mountain w/ duck confit. The duck confit was nice but the sandwiches were particularly interesting as the meat was mixed with fresh herbs that gave the sandwich a fresh aromatic character. 

I'm not a fan of lime flavoured desserts/pastries. But we democratically decided to share the coconut milk rice pudding with mango and lime coulis for dessert!  And now I have learned that once in a blue moon there can be pleasant exceptions: I loved it! The main ingredient of the relatively thin coulis  layer  was soft sweet mango perfectly complemented by hints of light fresh citrusy flavor of lime finished w/  toasted almond slices! Hallelujah! Good dessert is always a blessing!

As a not-for-profit organization, along with tasty  food and the volunteer opportunities they enable, they have created a fun charming setting. I would definitely go back, for a casual fun dinner w/ friends or, to experience what it's like to work at a restaurant w/ my friends ;D"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now - once on a romantic date, and once with my parents when they visited town. Both experiences impressed me, and it takes different traits to impress lovebirds/parents. I consistently recommend this place to friends. 

The staff is warm and welcoming. There's a quirky vibe to the service. It's formal, but not overly stilted (the server asked my parents where they were from, recommended favorite dishes from experience). The decor is equally quirky with a whimsical charm that's inviting, but still date-night. 

I'm glad they take reservations, because it has really filled up by about 8pm both times I've been there. Also, our food took a while to arrive both times (45min+) but if you don't mind a loud-ish room, it's comfortable for conversation with a full bar. 

The food meets at the intersection of delicious and affordable. The Brussels sprout salad with Parmesan and nuts was so good I didn't want to share - and only $5. The entrees were very different from each other and each tasty. My husband's dish (Duck Duo) \"won\" because it was the most decadent, but I also enjoyed my risotto. 

This place is an excellent destination for out of town guests. Its location makes it a nice end to a Plateau stroll."}
{"text":"Je reviens du robin des bois, j'étais bénévole en cuisine de 14:00 à 17:00. C'était une expérience très sympa! Je vous l conseille, tout est préparé maison et tout est frais ça donne envie d'aller manger chez eux!"}
{"text":"Les plats sont de qualité, le service était très rapide et il y faisait calme alors qu'on y était à midi. Mais ce qu'on a par dessus tout apprécié, c'est leur concept : ceux qui y travaillent sont bénévoles et les bénéfices soutiennent des oeuvres. Voilà une super initiative que nous ramèneront dans nos bagages!"}
{"text":"Alright, I didn't try the food but I hear there's a new chef. The four stars are for the kindly concept of a non-profit restaurant with volunteers who get to learn about restaurant cooking while supporting good projects; and for the stiff drinks we had there; and for the beautiful wooden stage and piano and performances by the band and string section last night at the album launch we attended. Robin des Bois is hosting lots of shows these days and it's really a great space for some cozy, heart-warming live music and dining."}
{"text":"Le restaurant Robin des Bois est un organisme à but non lucratif, 100% des profits étant distribués à des organismes de charité qui luttent contre la solitude, l'isolement social et la pauvreté. 

Ce restaurant emploie donc que des bénévoles, d'ailleurs je ne m'y suis pas rendue pour manger mais bien pour y travailler 3 heures en cuisine accompagnée de ma coloc. On a très bien été accueillies, on nous a expliqué comment tout fonctionnait, où se trouvait la marchandise, ustensiles, etc. Nous avons travaillé de 14h à 17h, le rush du midi était donc passé et il était temps de faire la mise en place pour le soir ! On a commencé par des choses simples: hacher du persil plat, de l'ail, ... Puis on a chacune fait un dessert: Lemon curd et tarte de citron meringuée, on nous a bien tout expliqué et une recette nous a été fournie afin de suivre les diverses étapes. On a évidemment pas pu s'empêcher de goûter les crèmes que l'on avait préparé, et qu'est  ce que c'était bon, si j'avais été à la maison j'aurais léché le plat ! 

Les gens qui y travaillent sont compétents, ils ont de l'expérience en restauration! En plus, pour avoir travaillé en cuisine, je peux vous dire qu'ils ont de beaux produits ! 

L'ambiance de travail est très bonne, on n'a pas l'impression de se faire commander (logique, en même temps). 
C'est un bon moyen de faire une bonne action tout en faisant quelque chose d'agréable! C'est une expérience que je referais sans hésiter. Donc si vous aussi vous voulez faire un bon geste, venez y travailler quelques heures, si vous préférez travailler en salle, vous pouvez le faire aussi; il suffit de vous inscrire à l'adresse suivante: robindesbois.ca (section bénévolat) ou venez simplement vous faire plaisir un y savourant l'un de leur plat."}
{"text":"It's a volunteer based restaurant but they serve some really good food! Got the octopus and their specialty soup(I forgot the name). Omg, both were really good, food were well executed and full of flavours. However, the service was kind of lacking but considering it run by volunteers, it was forgiving."}
{"text":"Great place. Great ambience. Great food. Good service. Good prices. Spacious. Easy to find.. Not hidden away in some corner. Nice versatility in food preferences. Good for groups, family, dates. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing concept, beautiful ambiance and wonderful volunteer waiters. The food is amazingly good and I never knew you could do that on a good price. Overall, my birthday celebration was successful, thanks to the amazing staff. I hope this business will stays because it has the service and food of a five stars restaurant with an amazing concept."}
{"text":"I tried getting in here without reservation over the years. Finally got to enjoy a a tasty meal at a reasonable price. A fine experience any night of the week with any type of group."}
{"text":"I have the Voir Restaurant Guide 2008. It tell it's a good restaurant, the location is good. etc. 

I went there with a friend with his new «I only eat organic» Girlfriend.  Thought her hippy insight would appreciate the restaurant focus is organic food as well as all profits goes to organization. The concept is great and the Volountering Waiter, in a business Point of view was really good. We went there on a lousy monday night, restaurant was mostly empty. (bad weather). The place itself is great the decor is nice and there's definetely enough places for 80-100 persons. We get the menu and we're automatically told some thing on the menu are missing. Better now then later I Guess, but never a good thing. I've gotten a pea soup and a duck springroll with a little salad. The taste was pretty good for the roll but the others and the other at the table we merely satisfied by their meal. Plain seasam oiled carrot salad. Really Boring and if didn't have the masserated taste of a good carrot salad. The World Cooking was to be understood especially with the theme of giving out profits but in my opinion, if you can't do world food properly just don't do it and stick to what you know. So basically, I felt the amateur way the restaurant was being manage and even though I did felt it was for a good cause, I'd rather give 100$ to a non-profit diner where it is manage by professional and paid staff. 

Overall, good price, ok service, so-so food."}
{"text":"Located on Saint Laurent Robin Des Bois is staffed almost entirely by volunteers and the proceeds go to local charities.  They also try to put an emphasis on using local ingredients which is always a huge plus if you ask me.  The decor is a little on the dated side but the service is great and the concept is fantastic.

I started with a corn and bacon soup which was quite disappointing.  I was expecting a chowder-like soup (something thick and creamy) but this was not like that.  It was quite runny actually.  I followed it up with a braised pork roast with spetzl that more than made up for the soup though.  It was moist and fell apart with my fork.  I finished it off with a lime meringue pie which was quite balanced in flavour.  The lime didn't overpower everything but the pie wasn't overly sweet.

The prices are very reasonable here and are what you'd expect for the location.  In fact the dessert menu was quite cheap compared to a lot of restaurants that I've been to as of late.  Definitely hit this place up if you can."}
{"text":"Concept assez original et plaisant! Le personnel est composé de bénévoles et les profits sont reversés à des associations caritatives comme Le Chaînon et Jeunesse au Soleil. Au menu: sourires et bonne nourriture (quoiqu'un peu trop salée à mon goût). Plats variés avec plusieurs options végétariennes et végétaliennes aussi disponibles. Essayez le chili et craquez pour les dessers. C'est pour la bonne cause!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommending this lovely and MEANINGFUL restaurant! They donate all profits to youth charities and the waiters are all volunteers. The concept is extraordinary, love it!

When I arrived at the door, they gave me a food sample and it was good. I ordered three small dishes that they call petits faims (small hungers), a cup of curry soup (literally a cup!!!), a small salmon tartar and a vegan chili, the price is quite reasonable and I was really full after taking the three little dishes. I like the service very much since the waiter is super nice and helpful. There was also live music performance, the place is really full of good vibes!"}
{"text":"Un de mes restaurants préférés à Montréal, et pour plusieurs raisons.
- une carte qui changent régulièrement, avec une bonne variété qui permet à tous les palais de trouver bonheur
- des assiettes belles, bien servies et surtout tout est absolument délicieux
- un service de grande qualité par des bénévoles enthousiastes

Bref une super place que je recommande à tous. Et si vous avez quelques heures dans la semaines, allez jouer au cuisinier ou au serveur \"pour de vrai\", vous passerez un moment génial en coulisse avec vraiment une super équipe !"}
{"text":"Cool concept, cool decor especially the chairs. The dal soup was great, surprisingly authentic in taste even for an Indian.  Although it is not clear in other reviews, this is more of a lunch place. Beets and goat cheese appetizer was so so, lacking seasoning, hence deducting a star."}
{"text":"Such a great find! The food was really good, especially the poutine. The staff were so friendly and all are volunteers. With profits going to charities, great food and staff, this is definitely a place to go."}
{"text":"I was in Quebec for two weeks. This is the only restaurant I visited more than once. Most of the staff are unpaid volunteers and the proceeds from the restaurant go to several local charities helping reintegrate those who were formerly homeless.

The charity aspect aside, the food is really good. I tried the lentil soup, Maharaja (vegetable) plate, beef burger, beef bavette, and some other stuff I can't remember. Didn't have a bad dish.

Prices are really reasonable too."}
{"text":"I booked Robin des Bois after an extensive search for something that would appeal to my 10 year old as well as 6 of our friends to celebrate my husbands birthday. Everyone was super nice and the food was delicious. Next time I'm in Montreal, I will be staying within walking distance so we can try out their brunch menu!"}
{"text":"We went to Robin des Bois last night as part of a work Christmas dinner and the atmosphere was perfect for the event. Not to mention, as a non-for-profit ourselves, we were happy to support another cause. Because of the event size they had split us into two tables, which I feel was pretty reasonable, although our table was definitely getting served faster than the other table.

Allow me to say, the food was amazing- my partner had the French onion soup, which was generous in its size and perfectly seasoned, as well as the risotto which seemed to be very good as well. I had the polenta appetizer and the cat fish which were both delicious- the apple and lima bean garnish to the blackened catfish made the meal for me.

The only real downside I would put to the evening is that because of our group's size and what I figure is the volunteer staff size, it took us two hours to get our meals. Post-hunger rationale, I can really appreciate a volunteer-run business like this, but in the moment we were less than impressed."}
{"text":"I was at Robin des Bois for a special event. I was extremely impressed with their ability to manage a large table of +10 people! 

Many dishes are great for sharing (see photos) and will cater to a variety of budgets! 

I loved the mango chicken with the feta and their Dahl soup (which has been served there for over 11 years!) We got little chocolate cakes for dessert which were very rich in flavor! The mousse frosting on top was delicious! 

As a large side note, this restaurant reinvests a majority of their profits in local non profits such as Santropol Roulant. Many workers here are volunteers, working alongside regular staffers. Check out their website to find out about volunteering."}
