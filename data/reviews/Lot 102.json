{"text":"Not the best of locations, But the food here is fantastic! I have yet to have anything on the menu that disappoints.  The Lot salad is great, and their burgers & fries are just as good; and the food is always fresh.  I used to live in Kensington for years, I have tried most of the restaurants, and I would recommend this place before any of the others.  Give it a try :)"}
{"text":"A great burger-plus place. The tacos are surprisingly good for a burger place. The biggest downfall is the lack of servers. One waiter for the entire restaurant including acting as the bar tender. It wasn't his fault but we waited 30+ minutes just to pay the check. Went back and it was better, but still only the one server. If you can find parking and don't mind the wait, a definite try-it."}
{"text":"Lovely views of downtown, friendly efficient staff and amazing burgers and fries combinations. The best  gourmet fries I have ever had! A great place to watch hockey games too! Parking at Eau Claire and walking along the River paths and over the Peace bridge make a fun outing."}
{"text":"Four of us recently came to Lot 102 for dinner. We had high hopes for the place, however, we were sadly disappointed from almost the start of our meal to the end. I ordered a beer and after having a few sips realized there was a very large chunk of broken glass in my beer. When we brought it to the servers attention, rather than apologizing she tried to play it down as if it was no big deal and why would we even ask for another beer. She did bring another (which she still charged us for) without apologizing for the first incident. Then we ordered our food. Two meals came out at once and we waited at least another 5 mins before the third meal came out. Finally the 4th meal came out, however it had to have been almost 10 mins after the first two meals arrived (usually when you go to a restaurant you would like to eat together..especially a place like this where you share sides). When We asked the server where our other side was she told us that due to a recent menu change the order didn't make it through the computer system to the kitchen, so it came about 10 mins later when we had basically already finished eating. Then when the bill came we noticed that the prices on the bill were higher than on the menu - specifically for the liquor.  Overall the food was ok but the service was so terrible that we will not be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago for my spouse's birthday. Had entire resto to ourselves due to a snowstorm. Each had a burger with fries. Food was alright. Would prefer less tv while I ate. Also, server turned up music so it was really loud for us."}
{"text":"Literally, been here over an hour and there's no food to he seen. Our drinks even took forever. It's not even busy or anything. Guess where I won't be coming back to?"}
{"text":"We decided to stop by and check this place out on a Sunday afternoon and I am so glad we did. The first thing I noticed as we entered was the amazing smell coming from the kitchen. The menu was very easy to navigate and not overwhelming. The  Wild Rose  beer that was on tap was good and paired very well with the burger that I chose. I decided on the turkey burger with cranberry mayo, grilled prosciutto, sage  and brie which was served on a brioche bun. There was a choice of several different types of buns but this went very well with it. I was sharing the burger with my friend but decided next time I'm having the whole thing on my own!  The burger size is just right for one person. The fries were incredible. The best fries I have ever had. They were served with Rosemary, caramelized pineapple, a generous amount of freshly grated asiago with just a hint of lemon. My taste buds were in heaven! Thanks to our waitress Tracy who gave us great service. The happy hour specials were good and we finished off our afternoon with a free game of foosball. What a great finish to a lovely stroll around Kensington on a Sunday afternoon. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Had take out here. Burgers are great. Fries & onion rings were very soggy by the time I got them home. Turn up your fryer!"}
{"text":"Lot 102 replaces the Bottlehouse on the NE corner of 10th Street NW and Memorial Drive. My wife and I came for Sunday brunch around 10:30 and were pleasantly surprised there was no lineup or trouble getting a table. The renos look good and we noted the outside chairs look very comfortable compared to what the previous bar had.   While waiting for our food we noticed a chalkboard listing all their burger options.  They have lots of choices for buns and sides. We'll have to come back to try some out.   My pork belly hash was delicious and will likely become my favorite. My wife enjoyed her Spolumbo's sausage frittata as it was her go to brunch choice when the bar was Bottlehouse.   We'll be back soon to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"We didn't plan on going here, it just sorta happened. Luckily the place is big enough that we still got a table :) Our server was very good, and although he was managing a whole section all by himself, he still managed to deliver food service.  Food was well presented and arrived on time. The taste was also superb.  Not a big fan of their house wine, it was just ok.  Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday as we found out they have $5 special on.  $5 gets you a cheese and bacon burger with side of fries. For $5 only. That is an incredible deal. The burger was really good too. Nice portion and well cooked.  Only let down was the service but really cant fault our waitress. The place had every table fill - all getting the burger special most probably. She had only enough time to get us one drink order, drop our food off and bring us our bill. If they had an extra person just running food, think she would have more time to get more refills and drink orders taken through the meal.  Did notice the manager helping out too.  Will absolutely be back on a Tuesday. For $5 that meal is hard to turn down."}
{"text":"The food here is solid but a little on the pricey side for what it is, and the menu is fairly small. Burgers seem to be their specialty; the menu was not particularly vegetarian friendly. They only had a few beers on tap, and none that were particularly exciting. Our server seemed nice enough but was definitely frazzled and didn't really attend to our table all that much. Overall, a pretty 'meh' experience."}
{"text":"We ended up trying Lot 102 one evening because we couldn't get into Niko's and didn't feel like Pulcinella.  Firstly the location is a little difficult.  That's probably why this location has been a revolving door of restaurants and bars.  That being said, if you like burgers - GO!  They are excellent as are the french fries.  A little guy at our table ordered the bucket of chicken and it looked very good as well.  The ambience isn't cozy so if you're looking for romantic, this isn't the place.  If you're looking for a spot for lunch or dinner with a group of friends it's perfect.  My only complaint was that they ran out of several of their wine choices and it was an early Saturday evening.  They have to be better prepared."}
{"text":"I got surprised with a dinner out with some good friends.  Worked out perfectly because my fridge is empty! My friends picked this place.    I had the tacos and They hit the spot super tasty.  The sandwich my friend ordered that I stole a bite of was also yummy the chick with onion rings.   Good little hangout spot love the music selection that was playing."}
{"text":"The overworked servers tried but could not make up for the food. My Croque Madame was filled with cold sauce and unmelted cheese and my salad was gritty. No questions were asked and no break on the price was offered though I left most of the meal uneaten. There look to be lots of good reviews of this place from others, not sure what happened to them when I was there."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the much talked about bison burger.   It was great but for $15 you only get the burger.  Fries, cheese, bun choice and bacon are extra.  Before you know it, you've spent.$25.   It does have a great atmosphere, the south wall has a full set of Windows allowing a lot of natural light.   Other than being over priced, it's a great spot for Calgary's best burger."}
{"text":"In comparison to Original Joel's burger and also Red Robin. This is really good! They have gluten free bun and also iceberg lettuce if you don't want that much carb and calories! You have to try their Rosemary lemon fries!! Amazing !  Glad to find this little place for my husband and I while we travel in Alberta!"}
{"text":"Good for drinks. The don't have many wine options, but beers and cocktails are ok. Food is not terrible, but not amazing, just normal for a pub. Prices are ok and service very friendly. The location is very convenient. This is a great place to go for drinks with a big group of friends!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 Came here a couple weeks ago for my birthday at happy hour. Location is great and the restaurant seems nice and airy with all the big windows. Atmosphere is casual and relaxed.  Service was prompt but I didn't find it overly friendly. I didnt even get a happy birthday from the server, let alone any birthday perks. Just took our orders and brought the food and drink.   The cocktails and beer and wine were great but I wasn't particularly fond of the food. My husband and I had calamari and artichoke dip while  number of my friends got lettuce wraps, fried chicken in a waffle cone, and gyoza. Presentation was pretty good, but I found the food too heavy and some of the flavours overwhelming... too much sauce I guess?    The calamari was alright but there wasn't enough actual squid for the amount of batter. If you order this, ask for the sauces on the side. While it looked nice, I didn't appreciate that they drizzled the sauce onto the calamari. I'd rather use the amount I prefer to use.  My bite of someone's chicken was OK, but again too much sweet sauce (teriyaki I think) and batter.  The dip was rich but something was lacking and I can't quite put my finger on it. The pitas chips were fried quite heavily.... tortilla chips would have been better. I felt like a brick was sitting in my stomach and couldn't finish my full half....  and trust me I'm really good at finishing my food and more!  Apologies, apparently I took pictures of all the food but my own!  3/5 for the food. 4/5 for the drinks. 3/5 for service. I would come back for drinks at happy hour, and maybe try a burger next time."}
