{"text":"Usually when you come back try something that you loved as a child, you find out that they changed or maybe that they weren't really so good in the first place.  Danny's hoagies really were that good, and they still are!  Since I was 5 years old - 5 decades now - Danny's oven baked Italian hoagies have been exactly the same.  The meat & cheese topped hoagie roll is baked in a pizza oven until the bread is toasty, the cheese is melty, and the edges of the salami and ham are brown and crispy.  Then they're topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, and Danny's special hoagie dressing.  All the flavors and textures are in perfect harmony making the best Italian hoagie you'll ever have!"}
{"text":"I went to  Danny's on a recommendation from a friend whose opinion I  highly value,  especially when it comes to food.  When we arrived,  we were warmly greeted by Jorge and Francesco, who would be making our food that evening.   Since I had been told that this place serves the most delicious Italian hoagie ever made, we got one Italian hoagie to split. We waited a very reasonable ten minutes and it was ready.  The portion was good,  it was enough to fill us both up.  It came with just the right amount of veggies (I got extra tomatoes on my half),  and the perfect amount of dressing. Enough to add moisture and flavor,  not so much it was dripping everywhere.  There was no sogginess  in the bun at all. It was toasted a nice light brown color,  not that nasty halfway toasting that gives no color and makes the bread crusty like it sat out all day. The great service and a variety of Italian meats (warm and juicy but not too hot) made this one if the best hoagies I ever had.  Definitely go there!"}
{"text":"Danny's is probably the most visited store out of all restaurants I go too!! I absolutely love their food and if I could afford it, I would eat there every day. Fast friendly service and unbelievably, amazing, delicious, yummy, tasty, decedent Super Fresh Food and it's always absolutely outstanding every time I get it!! I wish I could afford to eat there every meal, including breakfast!!! Please Danny's crew keep up the unimaginable good work!! Thank you for the 30 years of excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Awful service. Had a complaint about the food not matching the online menu, they didn't want to hear about it. Instead of pleasing me as a regular customer, first complaint by the way, the manager told me he wouldn't throw away food to remake it because of the online menu error. Apparently they do not give permission to allmenus.com to post their menu and are not responsible to the customer for the miscommunication. Tip if your reading this Mr. Manager, much cheaper to retain a customer than obtain a new one. Poor policies and poor communication with customers.  Who puts Italian dressing on a phillycheese steak without telling them over the phone? Just an awful way to be treated as a long time patron."}
{"text":"This is the worst slice of pizza I've had. The man working heated it up in the microwave and If i wasn't half way through paying I would have left. I believe he was heating up his own TV dinner simultaneously because he sat down to eat it as soon as I left. There were left over pieces of trash on each table. My microwave pizza was gross and friggin chewy."}
{"text":"Go if you're desperate for pizza. It was close to my hotel so I thought I'd give it a try. They have four kinds that I noticed (cheese, pepperoni, pepperoni and sausage, pepperoni and hamburger) on display in a warmer. The server grabbed my slice from the warmer, went behind a room divider, and made it seem like he warmed it up in an oven for a minute."}
{"text":"Almost walked out as soon as we walked in, looked kind of sketchy. Very happy we decided to order though. The pizza was unbelievable, I think this might have been one of the best crusts I have ever had. Thoroughly enjoyed every bite!!  Though it may not look like much from the outside, pizza here is a must try."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had since moving to Pittsburgh. And they have good hoagies as well."}
{"text":"I'm from eastern PA and NJ...I wanted a simple Meatball Parmigiana sub. for dinner. Apparently Danny doesn't understand what this is or..doesn't know how to make one. I was told they have a meatball sub or a chicken parmigiana sub...but not a meatball parmigiana sub.  Are you kidding me?  How hard is it to split a sub roll down the middle, add 6-8 meatballs (depends on size), red sauce/gravy cover with mozzarella cheese and throw in the oven till the cheese is melted...Danny if you read this you owe me for this recipe!!  Give me a break. I left without my sub and got one from Italian Village Pizza just down the street. Dude this is not rocket science..."}
{"text":"Best Italian hoagie anywhere in the known universe. I have been eating these sandwiches for the better part of my life (I'm 45) and I still can't wait for the next one. It's the way they are toasted and the cheese caramelizes--and the dressing is just perfect. Honest to god, I live in CO and this is always one of the reasons I return to visit the town I grew up in. Just get an Italian hoagie here and quit trying to --you can forget the meatball sub guy. Pizza is quite good, too. But get the hoagie."}
{"text":"The hoagies are always top notch--great bread, perfectly toasted, and hot.  We've had the Succulent Steak and Italian, which were both great.  The prices are reasonable as well. I was extremely disappointed in the salad.  Now that I'm back in Pittsburgh, I expect fries on all of my salads. In all fairness, however, Danny's doesn't include fries in the description, so I can't fault them, despite my disappointment.  I got the succulent steak, which the steak was more of a shaved steak and it was cold, and there wasn't much of it.  The veggies were segregated on a large bed of chunked iceburg lettuce. There were multiple cores of inedible lettuce in my salad.  Otherwise, there was really nothing that set this salad apart from any other place, other than the large size.  There wasn't nearly enough toppings to even make up for the vast amount of lettuce.  I basically paid $8 for iceburg lettuce and an overwhelming amount of black olive, pepperoncinis and onions.  I'm not sure I'll revisit the salads from here, nor would I recommend them as compared to other places.  We haven't tried the pizza as of yet, so there's still something to accomplish."}
{"text":"This is the best food in Pittsburgh! Great sandwiches and Pepsi! We don't get great sandwiches like this in SE Texas!!! Very polite folks!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a fellow foodie and got a small pepperoni pizza, she got an Italian hoagie. The pizza was cheesy, the sauce with a hint of sweetness but nothing overwhelming. Over all I thought the pizza was fresh and tasty. The mozzarella was freshly graded which is a huge plus in my opinion. The sub was pretty basic but because it was cooked in a hearth it gave it more of a burnt, hearty feel rather than most light and crisp oven toasted subs. The building is pretty old but the place seemed to be clean. Service is cut and dry, not unfriendly but don't expect a hug and a kiss upon arrival either. Typical pittsburgh joint. I could definitely see myself going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I really enjoyed their pizza. We ordered an extra large with half sausage and half pepperoni. The pizza was excellent. I will be going back again for more. Perfectly  cooked and the sauce was really tasteful.  I also ordered a chicken salad and was surprised with the size, the chicken was cold but the salad had wonderful juicey tomoatoes and peppers."}
{"text":"This place has been here for years and it was my first time here. They are known for their hoagies, but I got the pizza. It was tasty with nice and crispy crust. And, just the right amount of sauce on top. Will definitely come back again. Also, one of the reviews gave 1 star because they didn't have a meatball Parmesan hoagie. Well, they do. It's just called a meatball hoagie, but their is cheese on it. I don't think that review was fair to the owner. Try the place out for yourself it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Even though this place is small, the service and food was stupendous. When my family went there, we didn't expect much, but for a good price, you can customize a pizza to its finest. The crust is thin and crunchy, the cheese is fresh, and if you get the garlic and spinach sauce, it really adds a kick.  It hardly took any time to have the pizza prepared and the man there was very cheerful and asking about adding or removing things, which didn't add to the cost. He was very relaxed and just seemed to absolutely love his job, adding to an upbeat atmosphere.  Overall, loved the place, it was quaint and deserves more customers."}
{"text":"Got to admit, love the Italian Hoagies, yum. But dang, when you go there the service sucks-they treat you like you're bothering them. My hard earned $ doesn't want to feel like I'm bothering someone that I'm giving it to. Good food and \"good\" service creates a repeat service for me. Lots of other ma and pa shops that have great food."}
{"text":"Being new to the area, I get recommendations from a couple of guys I work with who were born and raised in Baldwin, on the best places to eat, shop, etc.    I was informed yesterday that Danny's has the best Italian hoagies around.  So I HAD to try one for dinner.  It has the perfect amount of meat seasoning and topping.  The onions were a little heavy for me, but being my first time, I took it as it came.  The bread is perfectly toasted on the outside, and soft on the inside.  In all, I was given good information by my coworkers.  I would rank it in my top 3 of Italian hoagies.  Darren W's. review on the pizza sounds great too.....looking forward to trying it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the fries here. It has a nice small cozy room which barely can sit more than a group of 10 people. They recently renovated the decor and now its more of a cool country food joint-ish. They have a great selection of pizzas and i highly recommend the mexican or spinach one. As mentioned they really have one of the best fries are that really crispy with a unique taste that has made me a fan. The location is terrific right belpfore you hit parc on sherbrooke so its pretty nifty to get around here and out. They also have special deals for students."}
{"text":"Note- The menu on campusfood.com is actually for the Library Road location as this Danny's doesn't have a fryer, which means no sides.   File this under Places I Have Passed A Trillion Times, and that's no lie. I've lost track, seriously. During every trip to Century III Mall I have passed this place, wondering just what their food was like.  Today was the day. To The Lost Land of the Levitske Brothers I journeyed.   You know you're close by when you pass Baldwin High School, a school I wanted to go to when I was a young lad. I used to imagine it to be THE coolest school ever, one you'd see in an TV show or 80's film like \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\".  I could always picture a bunch of kids eating pizza in Danny's lot  after school ( there's nowhere to sit inside) with that pizza box open on the hood of a car, Van Halen pouring out of the tape deck.   So we got takeout. I called the order in and got there and back in about 35 minutes.   I ordered a medium pizza with meatballs, a whole Italian hoagie, and a whole steak for the family.   This pizza serves as a stark contrast to my DeMino's experience the other night. The pizza is literally smothered in cheese, more so than any pizza I've encountered in some time. It hangs off of the sides of each cut. The cheese has a buttery taste to it and actually tastes even better after the pizza cools down to room temperature, which again, defies convention.  Another thing that makes this pizza unusual is the crust, which is soft, moderately thick, almost has the consistency and flavor of a pastry, and is somewhat light for a pizza. This isn't a typical heavy, doughy, floppy Pittsburgh pizza. And there's nothing wrong with a typical 'Burgh pie.  Don't get me wrong.   They're light on the sauce as well, but what you get is a zest fest. That's the best way to describe it. I can only imagine what a witches brew this sauce is.   Not being a detective, I can't deduce every spice through taste alone. All I can say is that they must use at least half a spice rack. If they don't, then they at least make it taste that way. I'm sure they're not giving up any secrets.   My parents thought their steak hoagie was ok. Danny's apparently puts steak sauce on it. I didn't get to try it.   My Italian was definitely above average, though. The bread wasn't baked into a dried plaster, which unfortunately happens to a lot of Pittsburgh hoagies. In fact, the bread was still spongy when I bit into it, the veggies were crispy and fresh, the meat plentiful, the dressing pungent. It's not the very best I've ever had, but it's still one mean grinder that puts up a good fight.   So I'm glad I finally got around to trying this edition of Danny's (I keep forgetting that there's one in Bethel Park on Library Road). They didn't fall short of my expectations. Well, actually...  ...I do wish I could step into the magic phone booth, go back to this month in 1983 as a teenager, after dark of course, just so I could eat this pizza on the hood of a Trans-Am with some good friends, a few cute girls, and Thin Lizzy's Thunder and Lightning album blaring out of the stereo, beyond the lot, and into the warm summer night air.   Oh how I envied teenagers as a 10 year old.   And I still wonder what's in that odd little multicolored building next door.   If you find yourself on Route 51, look for it. It's just a little stand of a place and can be easy to miss. Remember, if you're coming from the city, look for Baldwin High School (what in the hell? man they built it up!) and then the Old Allegheny Shoppe (which I also reviewed not long ago). That's how you'll know you're nearby. Get in that turning lane whilst driving yer 'Vette, if ya got one!"}
{"text":"My car must be trained.  Was driving by and for some reason ended up in Danny's parking lot.  These are the same unbelievably delicious Italian hoagies that you get at Danny's Parkview.  The smell in the parking lot started my salivating mouth.  Great big hoagie that has such flavor in every bite.  For some reason even the onions taste better with all the other flavors."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick bite and this was the only thing around. I am vegetarian so I could only choose the plain...didnt look amazing and since there is a 5$ min on cards I had to buy 2 slices. I am so glad that I did. This pizza was unblivable tasty just like one of the previous reviewers wrote. Not a huge selection yet the price (3.7$ per slice) is fair and the taste is WOW so if I am in the area again I knew I will re visit. A cool nice surprise."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian hoagies.  The only minus is you can't eat there.  It's for take-out only.  Best to call in your order first.  However, well worth an Italian hoagie!!!"}
{"text":"We had the Italian sub and a calzone. While the latter was good, the former was a fucking dream. The rumors are true. The impeccable blend of crusty baked bread and Italian meats had me positively reeling. I will be back."}
