{"text":"I went here many many many times, as I barely even go to Markville mall as I live pretty far from there. I recommended a lot of my family and friends there, and they all seem to love it there.  There are a lot of variety of good food there, there is this tofu dish that taste exactly like the one I ate in Japan. I was really happy when I ate that dish, since it's very rare for me to go back to Japan.   The service was pretty bad few month ago, but now the service is getting better. They seem to hired more people, since I went there often. Also that place is a excellent place to have a party, I spent my Christmas and Birthday there with my friends and family  You really need patients to eat during the weekends... If you do reserve a spot you should come on time, or else it might be really hard for them, as other customers needs the seat as well"}
{"text":"So I went in with an open mind and ignored the scathing reviews.  Friday night.  We beat the dinner rush, Semibusy. Fair service.  We ordered one twice, the first was one big order.  The food *IS* stale. The tasty spicy salmon roll had raw/over cooked hard rice in it.   The Japanese tart flavor of sweet and roe did not work. Neither did the snow roll idea with tempura bits and smoked salmon.   The beef ribs had an under cooked look - but tasted fair. The mayo shrimp was off - gooey, not crunchy.   The chicken was bland. Almost under cooked. Only the teriyaki sauce had flavor.   However Sashimi was fine, California roll ok, spring rolls were nice.  So it looks like the easy stuff was prepared ok.    Overall I'm not happy with the dinner for the price I paid.  PS - How come they have SOO many TVs??!"}
{"text":"this is not a good AYCE japanese place  1. service was terrible. many of my orders didn't come and orders were mixed up (i had dishes come to my table that were not even mine) the waiters and even the manager seem to ignore you even when to 'nod' at you. most of the staff are very undertrained and look depressing. not one smile on anyone.  2. food is lousy. tempura takes like flour. sushi poorly made. white tuna sashimi came half frozen. fish did not taste fresh and most of all, they did not have multiple items on there menu. not impressed.  i would not come again. the 10% service charge is not worth it. i would not pay it if i were you. very disappointing."}
{"text":"Please don't go there!!! Sashimi are not fresh and I got stomached when I went home. Both sushi and rolls are bad as well. Cooked food are alright. The oyster pancake has no oysters in it. The deep dried pork is really dry with lot of mayo at the top. Also, there is a big chunk of ice in the ginger ice cream. Overall, the food quality is really bad. So we will never go back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but the customer service is less than decent. They say they are an all you can eat but if you try to order more than 4 plates beef sashimi they will say they dont have."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Some of it was tasteless and oily but the hand rolls were decent enough. Tempura very oily. Stay away from the cold noodles and cold tofu. It didn't taste fresh.  The service was reasonable although I had to wait a long time for the bill. Food came pretty quick.  Because of the quality of food I don't think I will come back"}
{"text":"Big Warning sign is the vastness of the menu, I haven't found a single AYCE joint that offers a large menu and lives up to it. My feeling is that AYCE places need to shrink their menus and become good at a smaller range of foods to maintain their customer base.  That being said the level of flexibility is pretty decent as the last time I went here it was within a half hour of lunch closing and they managed to clear ~3/4 of the order.   Food: Average to mediocre, some of the dishes arrived cold when they were supposed to be from the grill so that was a bit of a scary sign. That aside, there wasn't much left for them to stand out on either from a  +ve or -ve point of view.  1.5 stars   Service: Very rushed, and somewhat rude, but we were on the back half of their lunch hour and they were in the midst of beginning clean up so I'd let it slide. Service was meh and very uninspired so left a lot to be imagined.  0.5 stars  Would only come here again if my one friend who lives in the area insisted."}
{"text":"Last week was my first visit at this japanese AYCE sushi restaurant. Customer service was quite decent and service was pretty fast. Food was not bad or maybe I was too hungry. Overall I think I will visit this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"I have never tried such bad Japanese food in the past.  This is a Japanese buffet restaurant, they do have lots of choice on their menu, however, not all of them are Japanese food. They mixed some other Oriented dishes as well. Only very few Sashimi (salmon, white tuna..etc) THe sushi seems ok. HOWEVER, their hot food arrived much faster than the sushi and sashimi, that means either you will eat 'cold' hot dish, or by the time you eat the sushi and Sashimi , your stomach is already full of hot food.  Personally, I don't like their service, most of them are not very experienced. I asked them to give me a high chair, but it's slow, and not very willing to do it.  I don't know why.  THe place is quite clean, and the restaurant is quite big, should be good for a big party to go and eat.   but, you won't see me again in this restaurant.  I am not satisfied with their hot food, none of them has the taste of Japanese.  One thing I really don't like is: They added service charge on your bill. So, that means, the \"TIPS\" are fixed!  If their service is good, I don't mind to pay more, but they don't deserve that at all."}
{"text":"The food quality seems to have gotten better recently. I would recommend going for lunch which is only 12.99 per person, a bargain for the variety and quality of dishes it offers. For lunch you get almost the full menu except the sashimi. Personally, ordering sushi is enough to satisfy my craving for raw fish. Aside from the sushi, I go there for their grilled dishes, I would recommend everything on the grill section of the menu and the skewers. One particular dish that I especially enjoy is their beef sashimi. For a dish similar to the ones at Japanese Izakaya, which you would easily pay over 7 dollars per plate, it is great! The food also arrived really quickly after ordering.  Overall, I think this place is a great deal for lunch."}
{"text":"As far as AYCE Japanese food goes, Hachitarou ranks way up there. And it is \"way up there\" in terms of location, as it's across from Markville Mall. I've been there four times and have never actually stepped foot into that Mall. That alone should tell you that it's worth the trek.  When it comes to sushi at an AYCE, rice tends to be the predominant ingredient. I've always found the rice:insides to be well-proportioned. The selection of sashimi (just the raw fish) is more than decent for AYCE, and the quality is comparable to many a la carte sushi places (yet, should not be compared to higher-end joints). Each \"cooked\" item is freshly prepared when you order it, and therefore served piping hot. Perhaps to be expected, some of the \"cold\" items (not including sushi/sashimi) seem to have been pre-prepped and portioned. Sometimes this is not a factor in taste (e.g. kimchi), yet aesthetically pre-plating is not optimal as ooze and/or air-driedness can be a turn-off. Oh yeh, the extensive menu also includes korean- and chinese-style offerings. Soft drinks, tea, and desserts are included. Decor is mostly dim and Japanese-inspired, but somehow I have a feeling that the restaurant that occupied the space before had a western theme... I can't put a finger on why though.  Hachitarou can get extremely busy on weekends. I recommend calling in advance for larger groups."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during the weekend and the place was packed. The food has pretty much the offering with all of the AYCE buffets ive been to.   Theres the spider rolls, Green Dragon, Black Dragon and Hand Rolls, no complaints on the food in fact I would say their Maki rolls is up there as they actually dont put alot of rice.   I would rate this a four but the service was just bad, I understand the place was busy but giving out OUR order to the next table is unacceptable. How did I know ? We sawthe next table having their desserts and then a few minutes later got the Maki rolls without even ordering, this happened twice. I also didn't like that you get a menu and start checking what you want to order, I prefer ordering it with the servers.  Food: 4/5 Recommendations: Red Bean Float, Spider Rolls, Spicy Salmon Handroll, Grilled Beef"}
{"text":"Super hectic establishment, with a frantic pace as soon as you walk through the door.  Jam packed with people I assumed this would be an exciting, delicious experience.  Took forever to get us seated, even though I had a reservation.  Felt like I was in a fast food court in p-mall.  Disappointing menu.  The food came out slow, felt stale and old as if it were sitting out all day.  Fish quality was very poor.  I could go into more detail, but why bother?  Do yourself a favour, save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere.  Can I give zero stars?"}
{"text":"I felt the need to write an updated review based off my experience today and how bad it was.  When I'm in the Markham area and I have the urge for an Japanese AYCE, I go to Hachitarou instead of the Yang's kitchen not necessarily for the food but because of the terrible service at Yang's.  The reason for the new 1 star rating is because the service and overall experience was terrible, the food has never been great or bad, some items or better than others for an AYCE.  My friend and I decided to have lunch and we fill out our order sheet as usual and hand it to the waiter. Keep in mind the place is only 60% full and our waiter is only responsible for maybe 5 tables at most.   I head to the washroom, no soap, so I notify the front cash which is not a good sign for cleanliness. Twenty five minutes later, still no dishes have arrived, I look over and a table that arrived 10 minutes after us have a few dishes on their table already. I notify our waiter in disgust and he looks at me puzzled. Hey buddy, use common sense, your looking after only 4- 5 tables. You should follow up on your assigned tables once in a while, it's part of your job. He doesn't apologize and drops a new order sheet on our table. I could have filled out  a new order sheet but due to personal integrity, I can't pay the automatic 10% tip added to the bill. The service warranted no tip at all.  I'm not expecting the same service I would receive at a high end establishment but I can't stand incompetent service and reward you at the same time.  So my friend and I just got up and left, that's the best way to show your displeasure in the long run by taking your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I thought it would check it out. To see if the reviews were true. And there were two especially the people who rated this place one star. The food was not that great in fact I thought that the menu was quite confusing even the waiter thought it was confusing as well. Not to also mention that the waitress didn't speak English and I couldn't believe she didn't know any English especially when I asked her what was in the maki.    I have a assorted sushi plate which was okay. However my stomach hurts at the moment. We also ordered that Tempura vegetable dish. Which was the only thing I like.  This is sashimi  was okay. Not a lot of portions. I don't think I will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the worst. Was charged extra for not finishing food but to be honest its not my fault the food was aweful"}
{"text":"A decent AYCE choice for sushi. They offer a large variety of hot dishes, some Japanese, some Korean and some Chinese.   The service is a bit haphazard, and it might serve you well to have a great memory of what you ordered or to keep a 'parallel' list, in order to ensure that what you have ordered actually makes it to the table.  I found some of the sushi a bit heavy on the rice, and that the soy sauce they use is not of the highest quality. They do have a \"beef shashimi\" that is totally outstanding and does not need the horseradish puree with which it is presented. That dish alone is worth a whole star in this review.  I found their hand rolls good, and their sea weed salad of good quality. Overall I would go back occasionally but my wife and prefer, by a long shot, Maison du Japon.  The biggest unexpected and nasty shock, is that they apply a 10% service charge to the bill. I was not paying attention to this when the actual bill was presented, but when the credit card slip came back the bill had disappeared. As the amount did not seem to jive, I went to the cashier and asked for a copy of my original bill, and then questioned the application of a 10% service charge. This is not outlined on the menu. I feel this is not a good practice, and I urge you to be careful of that."}
{"text":"Good tasting food especially for all you can eat. Large selection of hot dishes, recommend the chicken or pork  cutlets as they are pretty close in texture and taste to KFC popcorn chicken, very tasty. Overall their lunches & dinners are good for the price you pay but the Sashimi is not quite as fresh as other ayce sushi places.  Overall I would recommend this place for a quick lunch or dinner since it's somewhat obscure location results in less patronage & faster service."}
{"text":"Ok...I just went back this weekend and the menu and food quality changed.  Some dishes were still good, but others were bleh.  Not all hot food items were available for lunch - no wonder some items didn't arrive.  They did added a few new desserts, but they were not tasty.  The lemon tea was awful.  Service wasn't bad.  Now I need to find a new place for a good dose of some Jap AYCE."}
{"text":"Hmmmm when you look at the menu of this AYCE  Hachitarou restaurant you will think that it is great since it has such a big selections of hot and cold plate...  But the service here is lousy... they messed up our orders... we have food we never ordered dumped at our table...(at first we were a little confused and we just kept on eating them.. then we figured out we were eating other people food.. ohh!)  The food is ok... But most of the hot dishes are like some twisted version of Japanese-Chinese food.. not surprising it is owned and runned by Chinese people.  I found the interior a little bit dark. This place used to be a western restaurant and bar and the owner kept most of the layout..so it does not feel like a Japanese restaurant.  10% service charges are added on to the bill, so make sure you don't double tipped. (and trust me here does not worth the extra tips)"}
