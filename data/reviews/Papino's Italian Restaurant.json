{"text":"CRAPTASTIC.  Apparently, one-word reviews are FROWNED UPON in this institution, so let me elaborate.  DISCLOSURE: The reviews seemed evenly split between likers and haters, so I came in with an open mind.    I hereby officially declare myself a HATER. Sugar-filled pizza sauce. Underdone (and very bland) crust.  I could go on....but I have better things to do.  Slow service never helps either."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic pizza half Hawaiian half the works. It was warm and cozy atmosphere super fresh salad and great tasting pizza."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza! My kids love the food and cozy atmosphere. Wonderful local restaurant to support!"}
{"text":"We ordered a delivery order for 6 people and were beyond disappointed. Nearly $80 plus tip for the driver and they forgot 3 items. When we called back to notify them of the missing salad w/grilled chicken and 2 missing deserts they said they would get them right out to us yet the Manager failed to offer to comp us for their error or inconvenience. 20 minutes later the delivery driver came back out and delivered the salad (minus the grilled chicken) and only 1 desert. REALLY??? Made a third call to the Manager and expressed our total disappointment. Can you believe he STILL didn't offer to credit our credit card or comp us on our current or future orders??? We have been repeat customers for the last year and a half and am completely appalled at how they handled things. We work hard for our money and when we decide to spend over $80 on a meal we expect it to at least be correct. I guess they feel that losing a few customers due to their lack of customer service isn't important to them."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Would not recommend hand tossed crust, and it usually comes out burnt. I prefer the thin, not too crispy. I often call and order delivery but a few nights ago I came in to sit down and eat.   We were greeted by an older woman, I believe by the name of Mary. She was friendly at first, but was not too kind later on. She complained about the restaurant multiple times. My wife and I no longer felt welcome there.  I think we will stick to delivery. Food is great, but they may want to consider a new waitress if they want to keep any business!"}
{"text":"We ordered the bakes tortellini and the vodka penne and they were both excellent. Small place but great food."}
{"text":"Had eggplant strips,  Ravioli w/marinara,  Manicotti.  Young man waiting on us was great. 5 stars for DeForest. I think they may be changing. Not high end 5 star and good value for the location.   Staff seems to be hard working."}
{"text":"Been trying to give Papino's a chance for some time now. The last two pizza's we got had terrible sauce. Seemed like raw garlic flavor that ruined the entire pizza. The last order we had was thin crust. Barely any sauce, so no tomato flavor and I think we got about 4 pieces of sausage and green olives on the entire pizza. I think I am done with them for a while."}
{"text":"They send out coupons and then tell you they are not excepted. They also said they are not good for Friday or Saturday's. They finally excepted the coupon over the phone and then when we arrived they gave us the runaround again at the counter and told us a different price than they said before the coupon.  The pizza was cold and cheese looked like pizza does after it sits in a fridge. They told us 45 min and I am thinking it sat there for 30 after the it was done. The waitstaff even shouted to the kitchen staff that a customer ordered Alfredo sauce.  Get rid of the kids and hire people that can handle orders!"}
{"text":"This is the Best authentic homemade Italian pasta I have found! We found this driving home from WI snowmobiling last year and I have been craving it since that time. Yummy, wish we had this in QC, IL. Quaint, friendly ambiance and clean. They also have delicious homemade gluten free pasta!"}
{"text":"Had an 18 in thin crust pepperoni.  The pizza was a little over cooked and average taste.  The kids really like the pizza."}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant because it's locally owned and convenient b/c they offer delivery in Windsor. However, the service is pleasant but sloppy. I have never dined in the restaurant (delivery only) so I can't speak for service in the restaurant.  I called in to order a pizza. The young lady on the phone was clearly not listening when asking questions about my order b/c she repeatedly got the information wrong. Then we were told the order would take 35 to 45 minutes.  The delivery person arrived an hour later with a brown bag. This was clearly not a pizza. Apparently the orders were mislabeled.   Then we open the pizza and it's cold. The crust is very chewy and tough and does not taste home made. It reminded me of refrigerated pizza dough.  That said, the pizza toppings themselves were very fresh.   One of these things along wouldn't have been a big deal. All of these factors combined resulted in disappointment. As much as I prefer to support local businesses, we will not be ordering from here again. I'd rather order from Pizza Hut for better service, flavor and consistency."}
{"text":"Awesome homemade Italian. Friendly, warm atmosphere. Italian food to die for!! Great find."}
{"text":"I have a lot of friends in the immediate neighborhood and so I eat at Papino's about half a dozen times a year. I've been coming here since they opened.  For pizza, my favorite is the Papino's Special, which is sausage, Canadian bacon, bacon, mushrooms, onion, green peppers, oregano, parmesan cheese. (I sometimes add green olives too).  For their pasta selections, I like the spaghetti aglio and olio (spaghetti with olive oil, garlic and basil) and one of my nieces and I both like the pesto penne pasta.  Another thing I enjoy is the lobster ravioli, but it's pretty rich and best enjoyed in moderation.   This place is VERY small and often is quite crowded so often we get carry out and eat at home.   I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Papino's has lasagna and chicken wings but I'm not sold on the other items I've ordered here... like pasta, pizza, and salad. But whenever I'm craving lasagna... Papino's is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in town.  Period.  The Chicago style pizza is a must.  Red sauce is perfection.  I love the chicken tenders w ranch- best tenders of my life.  Chicken parmigiana is amazing & you can get it baked in mozzarella for $1. Tiramisu is outstanding.  Never a disappointment.  Nice service. Great kid menu portions."}
{"text":"The owner is a real jerk! I used to like this place until he called me a liar over a side of Marinara sauce that I paid for. So disappointed and upset set that I was treated like that."}
{"text":"I want to like this place but can't. Its small, quaint, and locally owned but not even that can save their bad pizza. I have tried a variety of their menu items and none of they have me going back to more. Their hand tossed crust is nearly inedible, it's dry and tough. We had several issues with getting wrong items through delivery and take out. Double checking orders is a must. It is a pass for us."}
{"text":"Super friendly and personal service, they're always so nice when I call to order on the phone or come by to pick up! And they definitely have the best Gluten Free pizza around."}
{"text":"We stopped in the other night with our family for some pizza and appetizers.  It was wonderful.  We ate the Bosco cheese filled breadsticks for an appetizer. We tried a few of their pizzas as our dinner.  The waitress was nice enough to allow us to do half and half so we can try more kinds being it was our first visit to thier resturant. We tried the Pepino on half and theTrapino on the other half.  This was hand tossed crust.  ( My favorite) Then on another pizza we did bbq on half and the other half brueschetta which was my wife's favorite pizza.  This was thinking crust.  Both crust good and cooked perfect.  They offer beers or wine with dinner if you would like.  We thought the service was very friendly.  The resturant was smaller, but very cozy and comfortable for a small town Italian place.  Not a long wait for food.  The waitress brought our daughter a small ball of pizza dough to keep her entertained, which we thought was clever and a fun idea for kids. Got a chance to meet the owner (Joe) as we were leaving.  Seemed like a nice young man.  This is one of those places you need to try if in the area or order out if you live close because they deliver.  Very nice food for the small town of Windsor.  We will be back to try the pasta and lasagna.  Then once we try the pasta maybe we will change review to 5 star if it is as good as the pizza was."}
{"text":"Inconsistency rules the day.  One time it's great, the next time, it's awful.  The other day, it was the latter.  Way too much sauce and cheese.  One time, the topping are perfect.  The next, they're all dumped in the middle of the pizza.  It's just very hard to know what you're going to get."}
{"text":"The delivery service was slow.  The food was delivered to my neighbor's house because the \"driver\" put our address in his phone incorrectly.  Really????  Why can't people take more time to make a better first impression."}
{"text":"We (my Bella and I) ate dinner here last night because I've been craving me some Papino's.  This was my third visit, first was carry-out and last visit we ate in the restaurant.  I was planning on having chicken parmigiana but my lady reminded me that I thought the chicken portion was skimpy when we did carry-out so I had lasagna.  Their lasagna, in my 'umble opinion, is delicious.  Their sauce (or gravy for some of you) is more a sweet sauce rather than savory and it tastes bright and refreshing.  My lady had spaghetti with meat sauce and ordered a side of meatballs which were yummy.  I could tell they were made italiany because they were a combination of meat, crumbs, and cheese.  Very delicious!!  I had a side of sausage with my lasagna and we ordered cheesy garlic bread for an app.  I love this bread....I know it's just small Italian loaves they break in half and dip in butter and garlic, but it tastes \"bene\" (haha thanks google translate)!!  I do not recommend all the appetizers as I've had their poppers and they tasted heated up.  For dessert we shared a slice of NY cheese cake.  Uhhhh....ya...I was full when we left!!  They sell beer and wine although we chose pop to drink with our food.  One last thing....remember you promised not to judge....I ordered a pizza for carry out....and it was yummy for breakfast today.  Sooooo....to recap....this place will never give Francesca's al Lago or Bellini's or even Nonno's a run for their money.....but we had an appetizer, 2 entrees with sides, dessert, 2 drinks, and uhhh....a large pizza to-go, for $40.  We were full and happy when we left.  Ciao' baaaaaaby!!  http://www.papinositalianrestaurant.com/menu.html"}
{"text":"Not good... Gross pizza and very poor service. Its like the goal of the people working there is to make sure no one comes back"}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see negative reviews about such a wonderful place!  Papino's is a highly regarded local favorite.  Pizzas are delicious, their spaghetti and meatballs super tasty, and I love their garlic cheese bread! This place is quaint, inviting, and the staff has been great in my experiences here.  I encourage anyone looking for homemade Italian food to check out this little gem!"}
{"text":"I frequently visit Papino's due to the fact that their prices are actually reasonable - unlike pizzerias in Waunakee where I live. The 18 inch thin crust pepperoni is excellent. I always order either the mozzarella sticks or garlic bread (with or without cheese) as a side, and they are delicious, but they need to jar the sauce that comes with it. It has sweetness and tang to it, almost as if a pinch of sugar is in their recipe, which is something not usually found in the traditional tomato sauce. I can't speak for the service, as I have only done carry out. Great pizza that does not disappoint anyone in my household."}
{"text":"Second time back. My family loves us, but I am more tentative. The portions are a pretty good value but the food is good but not great. I want a local restaurant, a local business, to succeed and I want them to be great. They do a bustling take out business and so something must be going okay for them but the food doesn't stand out.  My daughter only ordered a cheese pizza, but her cheese pizza was probably the highlight of my meal.  The staff was young but they were friendly and served us well. I was well satisfied with the wait staff."}
{"text":"I really wanted this new pizza place to be great but we were sorely disappointed.  We ordered pizza and were surprised that the green peppers and mushrooms were canned.  We really prefer fresh veggies.  The crust is a manufactured crust and is not hand tossed.  The last complaint I have is that we tried delivery and the order was messed up when we received it.  I called to only have the manager or owner swearing as he hung up the phone.  Still need a good pizza place in the Windsor/DeForest area."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent. The service is friendly and the pasta dishes are top notch. I come here when I'm in Madison. The menu is typical American Italian food but everything is made with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Updating my review from 3 stars to 4 stars because Papino's has a functional website again with an online menu. Yay! Thank you!!!! We've ordered from them 2-3 times in the last 2-3 months because of this small detail. So helpful to have an online menu."}
