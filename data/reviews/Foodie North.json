{"text":"The 2.5 rating on Yelp is pretty accurate and I can attest to the service or lack thereof. 

Came here for lunch and tried the braised beef noodle soup.

Couple of items I'd like to point out first.  The environment and menu.  

Firstly, you are seated on benches which is not only uncomfortable but gives you nowhere to put your jacket.  Perhaps they have a coat hanger (not sure didn't check), but it is not exactly something I feel comfortable doing given the environment and theft.  Secondly the menus do not stay open when laid down on a table which makes it difficult to read the menu, let alone find the item that you want. I'd describe it as trying to read a new novel for the first time except triple the size.       

To me the taste of a restaurant's braised beef noodle soup when it comes to Northern Chinese food is a true indicator of how the rest of the food will taste.  It is a staple like xialong bao.  This is the reason I came here.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.  

I understand that braised beef noodle soup can have a lot of tendons but when it makes up 90% of the content it is a little too much.  The soup base was salty.  If I were to describe it I would say that it tastes like hotpot soup with salt poured in for good measure.  Nothing spicy nor flavorful as the salt overwhelms the pallet.  I had asked for water, which never came, and ended up drinking a lot of the tea to save myself from dehydration. 

I won't be back to try the other dishes which is unfortunate given the scarcity of Northern Chinese cuisine in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I'm giving an update since I went a second time this week.  Service is still not quite right as the servers seem to forget to come back and take our orders after being seated.  They didn't even look our way where they clustered all the diners in the back corner.  

They were out of some menu items and didn't even tell us.  They no longer served the nice sweet hot tea.

This place is expensive when compared to another restaurant we visited this week.

I think the fad for Foodie North will die down soon."}
{"text":"Where do I start?

If i had to describe this place in one word.. that word would be 'disappointing'
We were pretty stoked to try this place out, unfortunately the anticipation might have killed it for us. The restaurant itself is stunning (apart from the plastic table cloths). 
Our biggest complaint was definitely with the service, we were treated like shit, the servers and manger were clearly talking shit about us after we had tried to send back a plate of food we hadn't ordered. The manager basically dropped the plate on the table and told us we had ordered the dish.. when we explained to her that it was the wrong item she said to us 'this one is better' lol whatever man we ate it regardless. The food wasn't all that bad, one dish in particular i just couldn't eat, it was slimy and tasted weird (pork with bao i think). 
anyway i would never go back based on the experience we had."}
{"text":"Food is good but no speak English restaurant. Don't give serving spoons, no extra napkins, place very big so it was hard to get attention of servers which are very few."}
{"text":"- portion is small and without quality.
- they ran out of a lot of the 'signature' items (i.e. beef pancakes) and neglected to tell their customers until they have waited for a long time (maybe they can put up a simple post by the hostess stand or something?)
- the food is very salty, even for Chinese food.
- kitchen was very slow even though it wasn't even busy by the time we got a table.
- our server was very rude.
- ABSOLUTELY do not go there.  You are better off spending your money at other Asian restaurants in Mississauga or drive to Toronto."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Avoid at all cost

We went to this restaurant to celebrate Father's day alon my wife; we arrived and waited to be seated, once we seated in the table the hostess gave us only one menu (instead of 2), anyway, my wife and I decided to check the menu. We had some questions about the food so we asked one of the waitress about  this particular plate, she didn't have an answer at all so she asked the manager, who end up taking our order (2 dif. dishes) we wait for 25 min and only one dish arrived, we wait another 15 min, but nothing arrived, so I talked to the waitress and she said 'let me check' I said NO, I just want to cancel the second dish, she said OK and went to talk to the manager in chinese, when the bill arrived they were charging me for 2 extra bubble teas that I never order!  Outrageous! At the end I paid for that only plate and left the place promising myself to join yelp to let everybody know what a horrible service this place has."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Can only comment on vegetarian dishes. Was OK, people I go with seem to like the meat dishes. Very pretty decor, staff is nice and helpful. I will echo what others have said and that is the place is pretty pricey for what you are getting."}
{"text":"The wait staff were picked off the streets! They don't know what good service is. What a shame! Such beautiful decor but stereotypical unclean Asian restaurant bathrooms. We had to ask 3 times each time we needed forks, glasses of water, rice, drink orders and where did our teapot go?! When our teapot was returned, it was placed in the middle of my placemat because there was space as I was holding on to my bowl. If this restaurant wants to sell $500 memberships for $1 off discounted entrees, get your act together or hire all new wait staff!"}
{"text":"Still in it's soft opening we came here for Father's Day Lunch. We were the third or fourth group in the restaurant. The interior is awesome so we were excited. We ordered two noodle dishes and three dumpling dishes. The noodles came quick but
the dumplings were nowhere to be seen. We asked a couple of waitresses and the manager. It took about another half hour for them to try and correct the mistake. Overall we were here for an hour and a half when we would easily have been out in 40 mins or so. 

As for the food. The stewed beef noodles had no flavour (and it was nine dollars!). The only thing worth having was the fried noodles and xiao long bao. The food is pretty expensive for what you get compared to other places. 

They are still in their soft opening so they have a TON of work to do. I'll probably stick to The Chinese Dumpling House."}
{"text":"Nice d√©cor.  Learnt from the waitress that the restaurant is only under soft opening until Aug.  Therefore, quite a few items on the menu were not available.  The Peking Duck special is a good deal.  You purchase at full price and they give you a coupon for a free one plus soup on your next visit.  Beware of the expiry date.  The duck was very good and lean.  Liked how they carved two dishes.  One with meat and a few slices that were very crispy skin only.  Unfortunately, they don't offer how the 2nd course is prepared.  Only choice is soup.  Not bad.  Enjoyed the beans but watch out, quite spicy.  The pork with bean curd wrap was quite tasty.  The pork bao was excellent. Definitely worth another visit when they're fully opened."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my boyfriend and his parents. We were promptly seated just before the dinner crowd at 5:30 came in. 3 sets of cutlery are present although seated for 4 people. Ask for a setting get everything except a spoon. Eventually get a spoon after asking again. Upon reviewing the menu, we proceeded to attempt to order after my bf's dad signing up for the $30 VIP discount card. There were two items on the menu that the waitress said are not available. She calls over the manager and when we ask why the items aren't offered the manager flatly says the restaurant \"wasn't open yet\" and they were expecting a reprinted menu next week. This restaurant has been open at least 4 months? No apology? I've never heard that from a restaurant?! By this time my bfs mother is laughing at this response. 

We proceeded to order soup dumplings, steamed pork dumplings, hot and sour soup, shredded pork in some kind of sauce, mao po tofu, spicy fried chicken. We order 2 bowls of rice to accompany the meal. About 2 dishes come out very quickly.  Wait 10 minutes... no rice. call several servers who look short staffed and barely pay attn when you are asking them for more than 1 request before scurrying away because the dinner rush is now here. 

Dumplings were ok. Asked for 2 drinks. Wait 10-15 minutes. Ask again. Ask a third time. Finally comes. Mao po tofu was not as spicy as it looks but was ok. Shredded pork with sweet sauce was terrible it was far too sweet for any of us to eat. Spicy fried chicken with chillis was ok. Ask for one more bowl of rice- again takes two requests and 10-15 min. 

My bf and his dad came here a couple wks ago and waited for an 1 hr for a table of 2 because there are far less tables of 2 than other settings and the restaurant seated others ahead of them. Despite this they wanted to try dinner but after this experience my bf and his mother refused to ever return.  Save your money for Markham. The decor is the only thing remotely memorable."}
{"text":"I am not quite sure foodie north gets such a bad rep in some reviews. My family and I come here often and we for the most part have not had a bad experience. The important thing is knowing what to order. The Peking duck is phenomenal probably one of the best in taste and quantity (the duck bone soup it comes with is very mediocre and hopefully that can improve). We love the lobster in ?? (golden sand) style- so good! The Kung pao chicken and the savoury chicken cold dish are both great too. They do encourage you to get the combo at times, which are okay, I prefer a la carte to get the items I like. 

In terms of the service, I do agree that they are understaffed because it is such a busy restaurant, but individually as I got to know them better, most of the servers are humble and make their best effort for your experience to be enjoyable, though again because they are understaffed it may not be readily apparent."}
{"text":"We showed up 15 mins before closing coming off of a late flight back to Toronto and they were kind enough to let us in. Food was delicious and the restaurant was very upper class China. Sechuan dishes were fabulous so don't be afraid to try he authentic dishes from Northern China. No bad oils and really fast service. Spice and heat was sufficient for the average person and they do have really nice heat in some of their dishes. We had the Peppered Beef in a sizzling platter, Eggplant with minced pork and Spicy chilli chicken. It was awesome and really clean. Not covered in oil or corn starch. Rice was fresh and fluffy. For end of the night, I was impressed and I've owned and run several Chinese restaurants in my career and this one passed my sniff test. The decor is opulent old China. The is the way the wealthy Chinese are used to seeing in a classy Chinese restaurant. Attentive to detail and the server made great recommendations. Kind and friendly staff. Drink selection was awesome as they also own the bubble tea and Asian smoothly bar next door so you have your choice of 50 variations of smoothie/bubble tea tapioca drinks. Restaurant is clean, relatively new kid on the block. A bit on the pricey side but that is what classy Chinese food will cost you. Compared to the chains that charge an arm and a leg for average food, the prices justify the quality. You gotta try this one at least once for a special night out."}
{"text":"I went when they opened and it was good. Went twice since then and was less than impressed. Today was horrible. Everything tasted weird and not fresh. All of that for $80. What a ripoff. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Okay, no sweet hot tea, but some smoothee samples were handed out during the Saturday dinner rush! It seems easier to get a table with a large family vs. if you're coming with two to four people due to the low number of small tables. 

My fave: the cold chicken in Sichuan sauce - it was amazing. The dish seems deceptively simple, but it was just a perfect combo of oily, spicy, garlicky and super savoury. Mmm. I'd get this again.

The sizzling filet beef was pretty meh though. Like it's a dish you can get anywhere and the beef wasn't very tender or tasty. I had to really depend on the black pepper sauce to get any flavour. Plus side is that it's hot because of the sizzling plate. 

The single baozi I had: good flavour but not writing home about it. they did give us a straw to sip up the soup which seemed unusual, as I thought you just eat it like those other soupy baozis. 

And the steamed sliced pork slices with little steamed bread slices were okay... I've had smoother buns at dim sum, and this bread was kind of hard. The pork is fat and tasty though, though you get some hard non-fatty portions mixed in that did not go well together. :( it's like pork belly but not quite. 

Two people, four items, no leftovers! Portions aren't super big and they forgot one of our items until we followed up. I think they gave it to the table next to us. 

Overall, I liked the food here and would go again with family or a bigger group."}
{"text":"Came here last night, captivated by the large size of the restaurant, and the fact that it served Northern Chinese food. We were absolutely blown away by the beautiful interior... but fairly shocked at the quality of the food.

We ordered three dishes: some sort of stir-fried vegetable dish which some poster claimed was a Sunday special, the Chef recommended Lion's Head, and a chicken medicinal hot pot.

We only ordered the vegetable dish because of the claimed special. However, we were greatly disappointed by the dish itself. The eggplants, potatoes, and peppers were absolutely SOAKED in oil. While I understand that the purpose of the oil is to quickly and effectively cook the eggplant, they definitely overdid it. Moreover, when the bill came, we were surprised to see that there WAS no special! Turns out it's a \"Member's-Only Deal\". Although it was our fault for not noticing the writing on the top right of the poster (since everything on the menu is priced differently depending on if you're a member or not), we found this member system way too confusing and not transparent.

The lion's head came after, and it was a lukewarm dish resembling a meatball. A salted egg yolk lay inside, but the pork meat was... of a very interesting texture. We definitely were not fans. It tasted raw, mushy, and just weird.

Finally, the chicken hot pot came. This was the best by far, but that's not saying much. It could have definitely benefited from some previous boiling beforehand, to truly bring out all the flavours (the dried dates were still hard when the pot arrived at our table).

Overall, the interior was very pretty and attractive. A lot of detail was given to the design, as can be seen from the bathrooms too. Unfortunately, the food lacks soul, flavour, and depth!"}
{"text":"The food was very good but the portions are small. I definitely think I will come back. The waitress was nice as well"}
{"text":"Price is fair. We have the peking duck here because they have the weekday special of you buy 1 you get 1 free... Pretty great value! But for all the other dishes, their pricing is a tad high because isn't enough competition in Mississauga for this exotic type of menu.

Service is mediocre/poor. Need more English speaking staff. Lack of attention.. Maybe i'm ignored because i can't speak the language? They treat me very nice after i tipped them generously.

Food is mediocre/good. Peking duck is good but more because of the value (lol). The soup dumplings are not as soupy as the ones in markham. All the other dishes are just average/an acquired taste. Bonus points for having bubble tea on site."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a fairly large group.  It was the 2nd time I came here.  I enjoyed both occasions, mainly for the food and the company.

The food here is above average quality or for the most part the excellent presentation.

The decorations, interior design, and fixtures are unique and feels more authentic.  The lighting is just right.  The ceiling with Chinese painting and writing, the washroom doors knocker have a sculpture of a lion.  You can also check out how the food is being cooked or prepared with the glass window looking on the kitchen.  But most people won't have time to look at how the food was being cooked, they're there just to eat.  ot your typical Chinese restaurant.

I like this place, I love the food and setting, but major draw back is the customer service.
Customer service here very minimal.

The servers are not attentive, they generally don't talk, or don't explain much.  Some of them don't speak or understand English, unfortunately, so is also a language barrier.  They just take your order, serve your order, not much more.  Most don't smile.  A couple of the servers last night didn't even say 'Excuse Me' to the people when serving coming from behind.
They also don't serve the soup to individual bowls, unlike most Chinese restaurants.  They just drop the serving bowl and individual bowls, then leave it to you to serve yourself.

But I think the major factor in the negative customer service is also the restaurant is under-staffed.  There's only a few servers and lots of customers with lots of requests/orders.  They simply don't have the time to interact, explain their food/or again language barrier.  Even the manager works really hard like the rest because there's not enough servers.

Again I like this place, the food is great, the place generally clean, it has a lot of potential.  It just needs to improve on the customer service, or hire more staff, especially on peak times, then it would be a better place.

If you're here just for the food, which is excellent, and don't mind the minimal customer service, the wait, then you'll enjoy it.  I recommend ordering the Peking Duck, even the basic is good enough, also the Sweet and Sour Fried Fish.

Price, it's not so cheap, but it's worth paying for above average food quality and presentation and authenticity."}
{"text":"We made a reservation and came without any table prepared. The foods took forever and everyone was extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Came for a group lunch for 14 people, we ordered 388 combo plus two Peking duck. Since I am from North of China, I am pretty confident to say this is best northern Chinese food I tried in west side of Toronto. Especially the Peking duck, used to be my favour in Beijing. This is the best you can find in GTA. The rest dishes are also decent. For people aren't used to northern Chinese food, I can understand why the low ratings they gave. I will come back and try other dishes and give further review."}
{"text":"I threw up 9 times after having dinner there.
My friends wanted to have some fancy food with me after my final exam. So we had a Peking Duck and I suppose its too oily for my stomach to handle."}
{"text":"It appears that those who have given this place negative feedback know little to nothing about authentic northern Chinese cuisine. Of course, not every dish they serve here is spot on compared to those in northern China; however, as someone who grew up there, I'm confident to say that most of the dishes here are authentic representations of a the food back home. 
I'm sorry if the northern style of cooking doesn't satisfy your palate that's tainted by North American adaptations of Chinese food. This isn't the place for you if you are looking for a Mandarin buffet dining experience or Congee Queen style Asian cuisine.
Perhaps, next time, before you decide to write a negative, though ill-informed and uneducated, review on something, you should take the time to do a little research. At least you'll know what you're walking into.
As for the poor service that some have mentioned. Know that everyone has good and bad days. Also know that no one is obligated to be nice to you. I've been there with my gf on multiple occasions and have seen the way some entitled brats and adults talk to the wait staff. I would ignore you too if you choose to behave that way.
Other than that, hope you learn to appreciate different cultural cuisines before diving head first into the unknown."}
{"text":"I was totally excited when this place was about to open up, there had been a place that use to offer good steamed soup buns in the past in Mississauga, but it had been closed for a long time and I have to get my fix all the way at Richmond Hill which annoys me.  So I went there probably a week or so after it opened.  They called it a \"soft\" opening and some of the food is not offered on the menu (they were crossed off).  So of course I tried the steamed soup buns...  I was pretty disappointed, I can buy frozen ones from T and T and make it myself that is way better than what I was served.  The dumplings was ok, and the cold spicy chicken dish I got was too oily.  So I also read the reviews here before I gone there, and the nice tea that people talked about was no longer being served.  With family and friends if they insist I would go there, but just my husband and I, probably not."}
{"text":"Foods are not bad but service is really unprofessional. Have been here many times before and served by other waitress and they are all patient and helpful. But this server must be the worst one ever, being so rude and inpatient!!"}
{"text":"We got the Peking duck which is definitely the best in Mississauga.  The duck was soft and skin was crispy.  My mom had a voucher which allows us to get a free duck meal with the purchase of $60+ next time.  

Skip the dumplings, even though they are handmade, they weren't very tasty."}
{"text":"This place opened in Golden Turtle's original location. It's a sizeable restaurant, with an area dedicated to takeout food called Foodie express. There's also a Presotea inside, which you can order for takeout or dine in. Having just been in China a few months ago, I was excited to try some classic street foods, but I was just disappointed with the overall taste and quality of the dishes. 

They lay cheap plastic overlays on their tables which is about the most authentic Chinese component in this establishment. 

The restaurant has a loyalty program, which is a smart marketing move, in which members get discounts on menu items (usually $1-2 off) as well as daily specials, which is 50% off on a specific dish  each day of the week. Membership costs $30 per year. The membership card also acts as a gift card, so you can choose to load a minimum of $300 on the card, in which case they waive the $30 membership fee or you can load $500 and they'll waive the fee and also give you an additional $40 bonus. I personally wouldn't opt for this program because I would never come back to this place, but it's definitely convenient if you come here often!

Service here is quite terrible, which is to be expected from many Chinese restaurants. Servers don't speak English as most of the clientele speak in mandarin anyway. Although my only complaint was that certain dishes came out after we already finished the first couple of dishes we received. I did hear other tables complaining about it getting certain dishes altogether. 

There is a huge shortage of good Chinese restaurants in Mississauga and unfortunately this place doesn't hit the mark either."}
{"text":"Food was decent but we had a very bad experience with the service. 

We came here for my aunt's 70th birthday. She is pretty low key so it's just a small family gathering. We ordered a family combo with 4-5 dishes. 5 minutes later, a big plate of lobsters arrived. We were all surprised by the speed. I remembered seeing a shellfish dish in the combo menu. This must be it. So we dug in. 

Another 5 minutes later, a waitress came up and said they brought the lobster to the wrong table. But since we already ate it, they will charge us for it. 

Excuse me????

I hate to be a b**ch. But I immediately said, I know it's an honest mistake. But why are we paying for YOUR mistake? 

The waitress turned to the manager. The manager was apologetic. She offered a discount on the lobster (something around 30% off). We asked if we could exchange this lobster with the other shellfish (turned out it was crab) that we were going to get with the combo. She said the crab has been prepared, so no. 

She kept saying the discounted price was the cost for the ingredients, so they weren't making any money. But how would we know? So far the conversation had been civil. But I know it would get ugly if I continue to argue with her. Plus my cousins and aunt didn't like conflict, so they were willing to settle. I didn't want to make a scene on my aunt's birthday. So we took her offer. 

Until the end of the meal, the manager kept coming and provided service by herself. Maybe it was a honest mistake. Maybe because I am from California and not used to how the nice Canadians handle conflicts. But the way they handled the situation is unheard of for me. I almost feel like it's a scam. Bringing additional food and pressuring the nice customers to pay for it. 

I hope not. 

Oh, at some point, they brought a dessert we didn't order. For a second, I thought it was the manager's treat for messing up our orders. Glad I asked. It was yet again for another table. They seriously need to clean up their act."}
{"text":"Being one of the few choices in Mississauga for Chinese food, and it's relatively new, so I came to check it out with three other people for dinner.

We ordered the following dishes: 
- Steamed sliced pork coated with glutinous rice flour
- Saut√©ed potato, green pepper, and eggplant
- Kung pao chicken
- Crispy dumpling with Chinese chives and egg
- Saut√©ed beef fillet with black pepper and sizzling stone

It's not really worth commenting on each dish, because aside from the saut√©ed beef fillet with black pepper, everything tasted just about alright. The saut√©ed beef fillet was thankfully soft and tender, as well as tasty.

Overall, the meal was okay. The service was relatively slow, given how busy the place was, but the food came quickly and our pot of tea was kept full most of the time. The food itself was middling at best, and you will find way better places in Markham."}
{"text":"I have been to this horrible place twice, with my family, and have had to leave both times. They give preference to Chinese only, if you are not , you are made to wait forever. Yes, its exactly what it sounds like, racist. So, if you are not Chinese or dont like that, dont bother going there you wont get a table!!! Shameful. I'm going to write to the Liberal party and let them know whats happening here......very shameful."}
{"text":"This is one of those rare times where I have to disagree with the average score given by community of yelp reviewers.

This place is awesome.  The food is top notch and price was reasonable.



Everything about this place was quality, even the wooden tables, seating furniture, washroom door handle.

I just had some leftovers from yesterday from this place.  It tasted even better.  That speaks miles for high quality ingredients.

It was also a nice looking place you feel good about taking your friends and family.

I will definitely go back to this place to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I visited Foodie North for Father's Day and must say - I was pleasantly surprised with both the service and the quality of food. I wasn't too high on Foodie North as it was under construction because the name just sorta.... sucks. You would've never expected it to be a large Chinese restaurant suitable for families.

But lo and behold, on one of the most familial days of the year, I found myself here with my family ordering the Father's Day special lunch for 4 ($99). There were 6 of us at the table, but looking at the menu (it was at least 7 courses), I just knew that it would be nearly enough food. I made a few additions based on what I felt we were missing, but our waiter was quick to tell us that we don't need much additional food. We ended up adding an order of baozi (soup dumplings), another order of seafood dumplings, and rolled beef pancake in addition to the Father's Day special, which included:

-Peking duck
-Kung Pao chicken
-Sweet & sour pork
-Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce
-Sichuan chicken in chili oil
-Spicy vermicelli cubes
-Rice
-Plate of oranges

The standout dish was definitely the Sichuan chicken in chili oil. This was a cold dish, which I'm normally not a fan of. However, this dish had so much flavour packed in it, with just the right amount of spice and oiliness, that I really enjoyed it. The other dishes were packed with flavour as well - they weren't all to my liking, but nothing we ordered came out bland. 

I also really enjoyed the Peking duck and the rolled beef pancakes. The duck meat was flavourful and I enjoyed all the fillings. They also prepared a duck broth soup with the leftovers - which we really appreciated. The rolled beef pancakes had a similar taste profile to Peking duck, albeit at a much cheaper price - which I loved. Wrapped like a burrito, it would make a great takeout snack.

Overall, the service we received at Foodie North was nothing to complain about, especially for a new business that was still in their soft opening stage. Servers were knowledgeable and requests were handled promptly. Can't wait to visit again!

Note: There's a Presotea in the corner of the restaurant if you want to get a bubble tea fix after your meal!"}
{"text":"I was there last Sunday for Father's Day and what happened really grossed me out.  The server brought out this mash potato with blueberry sauce dish by mistake to my table.  We were not even sure if we ordered it ... but my nephew scooped half of one of the puffs.  The waiter then told us that he brought it out by mistake and that if we wanted it he would have to charge us.  Well ... we did not want it to he took it back.  A few minutes later ... the waiter came back with that same dish and served it to the next table.  I paid attention to see what the restaurant did with the half eaten puff and to my dismay ... the chef just added more mash potato to the half eaten one and reserved it ... How could I tell ... well in a untouched puff ... the blueberry would be drizzled on top of the mash potato ... the one that was half eaten and refilled ... the blueberry sauce was not only on the outside but also inside oozing out so I knew they just piled up some more mash potato to the half eaten one, already drizzled with blueberry sauce and recycled the dish and served it to another table.  Sorry ... but that was gross!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice since they opened, first time was during the first week.  Went there for dinner, and it was super busy (the smaller table side anyways) and had to wait a bit.  Went back a couple weeks later about the same time.   The decor is very nice, same as the tables. But the way the tables are set up, bigger groups on one side and smaller ones on the other, can be an issue when it is busy, as I experienced on the first visit.  

During the first week, they had a peking duck special where it is basically buy 1 get 1 free. We like the duck, it was very good.  I'd say overall the food is pretty good.  You can buy a membership where you can get discounts on food items.  I believe it is $30/yr, so it might not be a bad deal if you are planning on coming here regularly.  

Both times, I felt they were a bit short staffed, especially the first week, or maybe they are still learning.  I would certainly return again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! I heard about it on my last visit, but never made it. The first thing you notice is a the great decor: wooden fret work lines the windows, and bathrooms with beautifully painted lotuses and birds on what looked to be old reclaimed wood. Classy, paying appropriate homage to old China without being gaudy (if I see another cheap Chinese lantern with bright red tassels and fake jade green plastic beads...)

They offer a wide selection of Chinese cuisine, from Sichuan to Northern...basically everything, except for southern Canton cuisine. And it was fantastic. Nothing super fancy, just good tasting, authentic Chinese food. The soup dumplings (Xiao long bao) were juicy, the cold pork cut with garlic (Suan ni bai rou) hit the spot perfectly. I *loved* the steamed pork with rice powder (fen zheng rou) - succulent pork belly, sweet, sticky. *Stomach GRUMBLE* 

Service was ok - the first lady was a little snippy, and I can definitely see some people being turned off by her demeanor if they weren't well versed with the 'Chinese way'. The second lady was pleasant and helpful. Prices were higher than expected; according to fellow diners who were more familiar with the local scene, this potentially could be the downfall of this place, which is a pity. 

I do find it fascinating to read some of the scathing reviews here. It's too bad that people had bad experiences, although I think reviewing during the soft opening phase when the place is just ironing out kinks with the menu and service is a little unfair. Having lived in Beijing x 6 years, I can say that my experience was quite positive, and I know we would be delighted to have a place like this open up back home!"}
{"text":"Great Peking duck in Mississauga - you don't need to drive all the way to Markham or Richmond Hill!

We ordered the Beijing roast duck (Peking duck), and the sauteed beed fillet with black pepper which came on a hot sizzling plate. The duck was served with a flavourful soup which I highly recommend trying. 

The restaurant decor is nice and adds onto the authenticity of the meal! Service was great for us, though I must admit we ordered in Mandarin. Would come back for more Peking duck!"}
{"text":"This place is as terrible as they say... The interior is great, but the service is AWFUL! The servers just walk around, not paying attention to anybody, bring the dishes to people and scurry off... The prices are quite high too, if you pay the regular, non-member price. The worst part was the like $50 Peking duck... At other places you get the skin + the meat, usually stir fried with lettuce wraps, or something else- but here, you get NOTHING! They just give you the skin! That's all! What a ripoff!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a cravings for the peking duck rolls. In foodie North you have two prices. One for the members and one for non members.
We paid 40$ for the duck and it came with a big bowl of white soup- had some lettuce in it and bones of the roasted duck.

Roasted peking duck and soup taste were not bad. But not the best. I have to admit I had better peking duck before. But still it was good to eat there since I was having a craving. Wrappers were not enough for the order of the duck.

Fried rice chicken- was not worth the price paid for. Was just ok to eat. 

Beef with vegetables- the vegetables was really good- beef was tender to eat. But had better beef elsewhere.

Drinks- had a bubble tea passion fruit green tea- i like it. It was not so sweet. 

Beautiful decor inside- very heavy furniture. 

Nice servers- they did their best to explain when asked a question on the menu.

Overall taste for my first experience there 3/5
Price total was 82$ - totally not worth that much though for my taste
Up to you to make your own judgement"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful quality and overpriced.  We went for lunch. Noodles we had were soggy like they were cooked last night. The veggies we had were dry and bitter.  I wonder if it is a practice for them to buy almost expired produce.  Avoid this place at all costs.  This place should be out of business within a year."}
{"text":"Finally a new restaurant in the old spot which Golden Turtle and Golden China used to reside. A great amount of time was spent on the interior of the restaurant and it shows. Asthetically pleasing yet has a level of simplicity to it. 

As soon as my gf and I walked in, we were seated and given the special house blend tea of chrysanthemum, dried plums and goji berries. The menu has plenty to choose from with a focus on Northern Chinese cuisine. We ordered xiao long bao (known as baozi with juicy pork) and the soup was flavorful which was complemented by the tenderness of the pork. We also ordered baozi stuffed with pork and truffle topping which was good but I would not order again. Those familiar with Northern Chinese restaurants in Richmond Hill might have tried the fried diced chicken with chili peppers Sichaun style. This wasn't bad as it was spicy and flavorful, however the batter was KFC-like and lacked the crispness I am accustomed to. Also, the spice left an odd numbness in both of our mouths. Lastly, we ordered the steamed sliced pork coated with glutinous rice flour which tasted great but was a little on the oily side.

Overall, the service was good considering they were in their soft opening stage. I would order the xiao long bao again but I will try other dishes on my next visit."}
{"text":"Our first time was for father's day, yesterday. It was great. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and fairly clean considering it was packed! Our table reservation was ready on time. We had the big table with the lazy susan. I like the heavy mahogany chairs with satin cushions. I like the cloth table cloth. The food came out quickly and was beautifully presented. Everything we had was delicious. I think these were the best soup dumplings I've ever had. They're bigger than usual. You can watch the chefs make them fresh from behind the glass, bonus for child chefs. We also had steamed dumplings and baos. I'd recommend any of the fresh steamed baos/dumplings as the handmade skins were perfect and the meats inside were flavourfully mixed with vegies and herbs. I recommend the Peking duck with soup. The bubble tea was a hit for the kids. Beef was tender and not too salty, crab and baby napa were perfectly tender, cold chicken was infused with flavour, everything was delicious.

I think this restaurant is best for large families or groups. They don't really have seating for a romantic couple. Plus it's Chinese restaurant loud. 

I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews. It is on the expensive side, but I think the quality and ambience are worth it. Service is typical. There's no shame in flagging staff down by waving your hand around like a child trying to get their teacher's attention to use the bathroom. A raised hand and eye contact will bring over someone to help. Staff don't interrupt you while you eat and ask, \"how's the meal?\" or \"is there anything else I can get you?\". They come when they're called over and there was plenty of staff on the floor that day. They forgot a beer, but apologized at the end. Most staff spoke Mandarin. 

That location seems to change hands often. I hope this one sticks around! It's a lovely place for special occasions, and good for casual ones too!

Wanted to add that they are wheelchair accessible. Call ahead though they may need to clear a path between the tables."}
{"text":"Never  go back ! 
Just went there with family because mom's coworker highly recommended. I yelped first and I decided not to go because of the low review. But mom gets what she wants so the mistakes began!  
Decor is really nice, love it. Food is over priced but I guess we are paying for the dinner decor . 
They have meal combos. Which the dishes on the combos I don't like. I decided to not go with the combo. But mom asked the waitress for recommendations, she recommended one of the combos which is $218. Seriously we only have 5 adults . But mom always gets what she wants ! This is the biggest mistake! I think if I just order what I want on the menu, tonight 's dinner would not turn out to be a huge disappointment! 
The combos contains a lot of food. But they are mediocre! I mean everyone one of them is mediocre! We had the lobster dish! Good heaven! How can you screw up lobster! For a lobster fan like me . I only ate 2 pieces! 
Peking duck is ok. But for 46 dollars, I am expecting the duck is going to be exceptionally! Other wise I can get 3 duck dishes taste just as good for less that 40 dollars! 
At the end I paid close to $300 because I paid cash so I got discount! But I was not even full. 
One dish \"toss mung clear noodle with dressing \"! Oh please please do not order it! The noodle is so soggy ! The flavour is strange! No one of my family ate it ! We end out not touching it ! 
Be honest! If I am spending$300 for 5 people, I expect the food taste good! Plus i drove from Brampton, 40 minutes to find this disappointments!
If you guys read my food reviews you know that I am not am picky person! For me to make such a big fuss , you can imagine how disappointing and how bad the food it was! 
NEVER RETURN AGAIN!"}
{"text":"In Mississauga it's difficult to find authentic Northern restaurants so my family and I were very much looking forwards to trying out this new spot.
First off, the location was easy to find - in an open plaza close by to Square One. 
The restaurant was roomy, well-furnished and boasted a strong Northern scent; it also included an in-store teashop - PrestoTea.

Among a family of 3+1 kid, we ordered:
1. Beijing Duck  (4/5) - the  wrapping and duck were surprisingly tasty! There was about 12 pieces of wrap, along with a full plate of duck. However, the variety of seasoning and veggies that came along was scarce, would have preferred more variety

2. Xiao Long Bao (3.5/5) - the skin broke while we picked up a couple of them, but it was juicy and fairly authentic, although on the salty side 

3. Veggies w Beef (3/5) - very average, nothing special about this one

4. Cold Noodles w 5 types of veggies (Wu Cai La Pi) (4.5/5)   - this one was very satisfying! Super big quantity, with rich flavors and variety (egg, cucumbers, carrots, meat etc) alongside smooth, chewy rice noodles - recommend if you're a noodle lover!!

5. Chives Pancake (3.5/5)  - the pancake was a bit thick, chives flavors were above average but would have preferred more 

6.  Meat stuffed Pancake (Rou Jia  Mo) (2/5) - the dough was overally thick and over-cooked; not a recommend. Not authentic

The coworkers here were not super enthusiastic, but also because the date we chose was the last day of chinese new years, so it was fairly busy.

Overall, we spent $90 for all the dishes, and got a free Beijing duck for next purchase ($60+).
I would recommend here for a solid, decently-priced meal,  but it's nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Previously my friend and I were going to try Foodie North. But the low reviews on Yelp deterred us from going. We decided to try them out after a few months and take a risk. 

The two of us just shared the Peking duck that came with the broth on the side. We also ordered bubble tea on the side as well. The Peking duck was great! We weren't able to finish it so my friend had to pack it home. The service was mediocre because we had to get their attention several times. We never ordered anything else so I can't really comment on the other items."}
{"text":"This place looks great now. I was excited to see a Chinese restaurant closer to home...and a Northern one, so hoping for something different than the more common Cantonese fare we have around. I am in no way an expert in Northern Chinese food. My few experiences have been only in short visits to China itself. However, I will judge the food based on how much I would like to come back for its yumminess. Unfortunately, this place fails at that. We only ordered two dishes: pork covered in glutinous rice (steamed pork with a sweet sauce and glutinous rice that you stuff into steamed bao buns) and scrambled eggs and tomato (don't ask, it was a craving). Both were just meh. Not terrible but not good either. The pork had a smoky flavor but I felt that there was something missing. Not enough sweetness? I could barely taste that it was pork with that sauce. And I don't know what the glutinous rice was supposed to add to it. The scrambled eggs had a nice wokay taste but felt that the sauce should have been thicker and the garlic pieces smaller. Not sure if I could be enticed to come back."}
{"text":"At least 3.5* overall, food is solid though.  

Not sure why there's such a low rating, but this place is legit!  Just looking at the patrons, as a lifelong resident, I can see just how many Mainlanders have immigrated into the city.  This place was jam packed with them...on a weekday evening.

First off, the interior is absolutely stunning!  Based on the d√©cor and furniture alone, it gives you an idea that this is not a quick 'n cheap Chinese place.  And as per the name, food is Northern Chinese, so think Xiao Long Bao, Dumplings, pots of fried fish in chilli oil, liberal use of fragrant peppercorns, etc.  Spicy dishes are HOT, so be aware!

There were 6 (+ 1 child) of us and the waitress suggested we order the dinner for 6, but we found it better (& cheaper!) to just order off the menu.  We had leftovers and it was approx. $30pp, taxes/tip in.

Standout dishes:
-  General Tao Chicken (nice and crispy)
-  Peking Duck (sliced and presented very well, of course there's never enough wrappers!)

Ok, but not great:
-  boiled dumplings
-  xiao long bao

NI:
-  Service could be more attentive & friendlier.  You definitely need to flag down wait staff to ask for things like an extra place setting, water, refill butane canister, etc.
-  1 toilet was clogged (w/ toilet paper), and water from faucet ran ICE COLD, my personal pet-peeve!  How much does it cost to turn on the hot water in the restrooms??!!  
-  make more pan fried dumplings, please!  After we ordered them, we were told there were no more of that kind OR any kind, ZERO at not even 6pm
-  tea was non-descript.  I couldn't even tell you what kind it was, but it was very watered down.  Restaurant wasn't terribly expensive but it wasn't cheap either, so let's invest a bit on the better tea, shall we?

Regardless, service/presentation is more refined than other Chinese restaurants.  Dishes are served and not whipped across the lazy susan.  Meats that were used were very tender, good quality, not grisly.  Leftovers are actually packed up for you."}
{"text":"Whatever happened to \"the customer is always right\"? Apparently, the manager at this restaurant has not learned that. The restaurant's waiter had brought to our table a dish that we had not ordered and we told him that. He took the dish away. The manager comes to our table with the dish we supposedly ordered and our order form. She insisted that we checked off the item on our order form which in her eyes was proof that we did in fact order it. My mom insisted that the check mark for that item wasn't even written in  the same way as the other items she ordered off the order form. The manager refused to take back the dish and charged it on our bill. We were forced to pay for something we didn't order nor did we want. The dishes were small for the amount they were charging for them. It was $75 for 3 adults and 2 kids including the tip that they didn't deserve. This is the first and last time we will be going there. We will not be going to eat there again. There are other Chinese restaurants that we can go to."}
{"text":"Definitely the worst experience I've ever had! They are very racist here and I was waiting over an hour for my food and people who had come in long after me got service. Everyone was Asian and because my family and I, are not Asian and we are Brown we were the last people to be served. We walked right out of there. I don't recommend anyone to go here unless your Asian!"}
{"text":"Interesting experience...

This was a new restaurant that I wanted to try and brought my family there.  I asked for a table for 5.  We normally prefer booths but there weren't any available.  The waiter/host brought us to what looks to be a table for 4.  It's a square table with what looks to be a bench on each side.  You can see it on some of the pictures posted in here.  Two young adults maybe can sit on one side of the table but not comfortably.  And then the conversation went like this...

\"I asked for a table for 5\"
\"Here you go\"
\"Isn't this a table for 4?\"
\"It's a table for 6 actually\"
Blank stare from me...
\"How do you seat 6 at a square table?\"
He points one person on each side, two people on the other two sides
Blank stare again...

I wanted to say why isn't it a table for 8 but i think I would just get upset by the answer coming so I keep it to myself.  Firstly, who wants to sit on a bench to have dinner?  If I wanted to sit on a bench I'd get takeout and eat at a bus stop.  Even park benches have back support.  How do they expect senior citizens especially to sit comfortably on a wood bench for an hour?  Secondly where does 6 come from?  Mind boggling.

We squeeze in at the square table and begin to look at the menu.  We order.  Then we see another party finish up their dinner at one of the cushioned comfy booths.  We tell the waitress we will switch to the booth when that party leaves.  The waitress's response was 'but then all the food you ordered will come to this table'.  As if this was our problem and not hers.  I actually had to tell her then go do something about it.

The other party leaves.  The dishes needs to be cleared out and the table cleaned off.  While we stand there and wait our food starts coming which we place on another table.  It took a good 7 minutes to clean this table as the waitress took her time.  Another reason it took so long was because she was so short and the booth was long, she had to climb on top of the seating, shoes and all, to reach dishes near the end of the booth.  Meanwhile doing all this she mentions how troublesome we were to switch tables.

Table is cleared off, we sit down, all our food has arrived but with no individual dining sets or utensils.  It eventually comes and we began to eat.

The food, it was actually okay.  Too bad with everything happening up until the eating."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the terrible reviews.  Being from Markham, I have had my fair share of both Northern and Southern Chinese cuisine.  I did not have high expectations for this restaurant, since many west-end Chinese joints have failed to impress me, but I was pleasantly surprised.  

The restaurant was clean, open and spacious. I loved the wooden furniture and accents. The service was nothing spectacular, but it wasn't  terrible. The waitresses were efficient and we never felt ignored. 

Now to the food! Everything we ordered was well-seasoned and delicious!

Peking duck: not too fatty with crispy skin and super super thin wraps. 

Pork belly with glutinous rice: the pork was tender and I really enjoyed it together with the steamed buns that these were served with. 

Deep fried intestines: crispy and so addictive!

Egg and leek pancake: so simple, yet so delicious. Expected it to be plain but lots of flavour. Stuffed with lots of leek and egg. 

Yolk crusted yam fries: not as crispy as expected. But the yolk gave it a nice flavour. 

Overall, very good experience. Again, very surprised this place is rated so low.  I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Chinese restaurant I've been to in a long time. I understand the lack of service is a consistency amongst most Chinese restaurants but the waitress here are just outright rude!  Couple with mediocre food, you will never see me here again.

I would typically avoid restos with 2 star Yelp ratings however a client chose this restaurant so I didn't have a choice. The space is really nice, clean and airy. We came here for lunch and there were many empty tables.  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share starting with the steamed pork dumplings, egg and chives pancake and beef crepe.  If you proclaim to be an authentic gourmet Chinese restaurant, how can you screw up the most popular dish, steam pork dumplings?!!!?! The dough was thicker than usual, the filling was semi-dry and not very tasty. The beef crepe and pancake was not bad. For mains, we ordered snow peas (very old and chewy), lamb with onion (super salty) and chicken fried rice (quite bland with frozen veggies that have seen better days).  All in, with 2 bubble tea my bill was $100!!!!

Moving on to the service, the waitress messed up our order and gave us beef instead of lamb, she then argued that we ordered beef and insist that we take the beef instead since it's already made, when I insisted on the lamb, she offered me a discount to take the beef.  Now it's just annoying so I put my foot down and told her no. They eventually made the lamb for us but the weirdest thing is the same waitress took our unwanted beef dish and went to every table with customers to try to sell it to them with a discount.  We didn't touch the beef but imagine if we did, how unsanitary is that! 

Terrible service, terrible tasting food and it's pricy. I gave them one star for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Currently sitting here at foodie north. Food prices are quite expensive for the portion and I would not say it is worth the extra dollar compared to other Chinese restaurants in the GTA. 
We got the Xiao long soup, pecking duck and shredded pork with steam bun.  We have asked out waitress for water multiple times and tried to get her attention multiple times and she comes in gives us a glass and runs away before we can ask or order anything else. Worst service I've had in a long time   The bad news I've been hearing about this place is true.  The pork is extremely oily and maybe has too much fat."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in GTA in terms of taste, and style. Best and most important which a lot of other Chinese restaurants fail miserably at is cleanness! This restaurant doesn't have oily floor, or greasy table, or dishes that makes you go to the bathroom because they used half bad, cheap ingredients. Finally one Chinese restaurant that's somewhat representative of the great food culture of china."}
{"text":"I always questioned people's low reviews of this place, the food is actually really good. 

But after today, I will not be back; AT ALL. 

I walked in at 6:20 and ordered 2 drinks, I walked out with my drinks at 7:05. 

45 minutes for TWO DRINKS. 

Granted, it was around dinner time; the problem was their staffing. 

ONE STAFF MEMBER running the ENTIRE drink / express portion of the restaurant. How absolutely idiotic / cheap does management have to be to put only 1 person on this? I watched FIVE people walk out because of the ridiculous wait to even get their order taken. Minimum $10/ order, that alone covers a 2nd staff member for a bit. 

This was the absolute definition of management failure and not acceptable in the least. I am flabbergasted at the absolute daftness of these people to not send a staff member to help, after their own wait staff started complaining how long drinks are taking. 

I saw MULTIPLE wait staff just standing around at the restaurant, and not one could come help make drinks? Unbelievable, it's no wonder this place is doing terrible on all forms of judgement / reviews ; the management has their head so far up their own *** that they can't see basic problems in front of them. 

HIRE NEW MANAGEMENT AND LEARN BETTER TEAMWORK DYNAMICS"}
{"text":"Came here twice both times with my boyfriend and experienced the same thing.  Waited to get seated 15-20min.  Once we were seated we gave the waitress our order.  Waited 30 min for the first of our order to arrive. And the rest came afterwards once we were done eating the first order.  We asked for another bowl of rice and you would think that would take seconds for it to come. Nope, we waited 20 min and asked the waitress if she remembered to get our bowl of rice.  She then seemed to remember and went back to check to see if they got our rice.  Waited another 15 min for ONE bowl of rice to come out.  By the time it came out we didn't even want it anymore as we were fed up with all this waiting.  On top of that the waitress'/waiters are not at all attentive.  You have to literally wave your hands in the air to get their attention if you want to add/change something in your order.  

Their food is also overpriced for something you can get anywhere.  We also tried doing takeout.  We tried ordering through the phone so we could just pick it up but was told we had to order in the restaurant.  We go inside the restaurant and it was not busy at all.  We then ask the man standing at the front if we could do takeout and he directs us to the other side of the restaurant where you order bubble tea and tells us to order there (he wasn't doing anything, he was just standing there).  So we go to the back and again ask if we could do takeout, lady tells us to hold on..... Half and hour later we are still not being helped.  We ask the man at the front again if he can just take our order since no one is helping us and he's clearly not doing anything.  He refuses.  Long story short, we received our order only after waiting an hour and half and bouncing back and forth to different staff members who did not want to help us. Will I be coming back here again? Definitely not.  Thank you Foodie North for making my experience an unforgettable one :)"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Prices were too high. I spent $80 tonight (with tip) on 4 dishes for a table for 2.

1. Corn appetizer
2. Sliced beef hot pan
3. Baozi (pork dumpling)
4. Beef pancake roll

Once again, over priced on food.... but still edible."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place despite hearing negative reviews from those who visited here. The decor is amazing as they tore down 2 older units in the plaza and made it one huge restaurant. The wooden decor gives it an authentic Asian ambience that we don't usually see in Mississauga. And that's about where the good stuff ends.

We ordered the pan fried pancake stuffed with beef (pancake was dry and hard with thin hard slices of beef with little sauce), Shanghai style stir fried noodles (super oily and underwhelming), noodles in stewed spiced beef soup (this was actually quite tasty, the noodles were made fresh and had a nice chewy texture, the chunks of beef were flavourful and well seasoned, slightly on the spicy side), and an order of steamed dumplings stuffed with pork and Chinese cabbage (the dumpling wrap wasn't too thick and it was juicy and tasty). On a separate occasion, we tried their dim sum - the only good item was the deep fried shrimp dumpling - everything else was horrible (the skin on the har how was tough, the tripe was inedible and was way too chewy, the buns were hard as rock). We ordered a chicken fried noodle and they brought out a chicken fried rice. We told them to return it and make us what we ordered. Then the waitress comes back and says, oh if you take it, we'll give you a discounted price. Ugh!

They also have 2 columns of pricing in the menu - if you pay an annual fee, then you pay the Member price. How annoying! I might go back to this place to buy a bubble tea, but that's about it. I'll rather spend my money elsewhere for better food and service! Their waiters all look like they're daydreaming even though the place wasn't even busy!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here a couple days a week since the restaurant opened in June. Limited seating for small parties as half of the restaurant caters to larger parties. Very busy during dinner time and there's almost always a line to get in during dinner.

Food is delicious and above the average of those offered at other Chinese restaurants in Mississauga. Noodles are fresh and hand-pulled. Would highly recommend the Lanzhou lamein. Dumplings and buns are also freshly made. On the downside, most menu items are a bit on the expensive side based on their portion to price ratio."}
{"text":"We went here for a family hangout for lunch and the food was pretty decent. I unfortunately do not have pictures but we did get a variety of food like chicken fried rice and dumplings (pretty disappointed, they were pretty dry inside). I can't remember the names of the other food we order but they were ok too. We did order bubble tea (large size) and holy crap they were freaking huge Jesus, ours was I believe $6.99 for a large. I was pretty shock tbh (best experience ever). I only gave it a 3 star because when we ordered fried rice again, it tasted a whole lot different than the first one we ordered and like what everybody said there seems to be a lack of service."}
{"text":"I came here again and tried a few more dishes this time. I've come to the conclusion that this place just isn't any good aside from the nice looking interior.

Hits:

Lanzhou noodles - these are some of the best lanzhou noodles I've had! Delicious, delicious, delicious.

Misses:

Spicy beef in noodle soup - not spicy enough, the noodles were undercooked, and the beef was not tender at all.

Pan fried pancake stuffed with beef - very hard pancake and very chewy beef with tendons all around in it. Probably the worst dish of the night.

Jiaozi stuffed with pork and cabbage - the first time I got it, it was good. The second time it was gross.

Noodles in home style sauce - looked and tasted like something I would make... from a recipe that I've never tried before.

Beef with chinese broccoli - waaaay too salty and the veggies did not taste fresh either.

Presotea - it's like going to a Burger King and getting watered down coke.. except this is bubble tea. It tastes very diluted and watery and not like Presotea at all.

So yeah the only tasty dish they have here is the lanzhou noodles and they only serve it at LUNCH! It makes no sense at all."}
{"text":"This time we tried some more different items on the menu that were not the typical items on top of familiar ones, and to our surprise, we liked some of our picks too. 

If you're adventurous and dare to venture off the typical popular menu items on the menu, then try the marinated jellyfish with black vinegar because it's quite the tasty dish with some brown sugar to balance the sourness of the vinegar. The jellyfish has a nice crunch to them. 

We tried the shrimp paste with steamed corn bread too. It was a tasty dish because of the shrimp paste mixed with the eggs and chopped greens mixed in. The corn bread was alright, kind of too doughy with no taste to my liking. But the dish is suppose to be served together where you put he shrimp paste of the dish inside one of the corn breads. The shrimp paste on the eggs on its own is worth ordering though because you can really taste the shrimp paste in the dish. 

This restaurant is usually really busy, even on weeknights!! So be prepared to wait a bit if you come during prime time for dinner - starting 6:30 and later. 

They mainly benefit from customers coming back to the restaurant who have a membership with the restaurant. By being a member, you save about 5% from your bill. But you'll have to pay cash only. By being a member, you'll have to deposit $300 with the restaurant that you can use over time on your food bill. It's a win win situation!"}
{"text":"Food is good, I don't know why the rating is so low, I believe ppl order the wrong dish."}
{"text":"Hmmm.... I'm not really sure why the reviews are so bad. I've eaten here 3 times now (for dinner) and aside from the fact that it can be quite heavy, I quite enjoyed my meals!
I agree that not all the dishes are amazing but maybe we happened to order the right ones and they were all very good! The Peking Duck was crispy and well seasoned, shrimp were big and fresh, we also enjoyed their pork belly and sticky rice which they served with steamed bao for you to make little sandwiches yourself - great flavour!
Service is hit and miss but not terrible either - a few good servers, a very accommodating and attentive floor manager and a few space cadets.
The very traditional Northern Chinese dumplings unfortunately were a let down, but I found that if you stick to the dinner menu, I wasn't disappointed! Give it a try... I think it's more of a 3.5 out of 5 stars but I will give it a 4 just to balance out all the 2s since I genuinely think it's one of the better Northern Chinese restaurants in Mississauga"}
{"text":"Don't bother unless you speak mandarin and enjoy horrible service.  Came at 9pm, half full yet waited at the front for 5 mins before being acknowledged.  After a rude \"how many\". I said \"4\" then no reply, just talking to her colleague in mandarin.  Waited 5 more minutes until another waitress asked us \"how many?\".

At that point, I tell this waitress  we've been waiting a long time. The first waitress who didn't reply to us and went on to take an order from another table, gets on the defensive and says that the table that's full of dirty dishes is for us.  How was I supposed to know!  I just left at that point since there's no effort to smooth it over. Why stick around after that?

A quick glance at the menu showed two sets of prices, one for members and one for everyone else. No thanks.

I'm not sure how it is on the mainland but This is Canada. Sorry"}
