{"text":"Another nice place to grab a quality meal with a local owner. The chicken wraps are outstanding and there is a wide variety of somewhat unusual fare."}
{"text":"Stopped in for wing night.  We sat at the bar, bartender came right over to get us our drinks.

We order wings and boy did they hit the spot. They we perfectly cooked with a great crunch.  We tried the pickles my wife liked them a lot, I was not as impressed to much pickle for me.  

Bartender came by often to get more drinks.  

Place was hopping for a week night.  This is always a good sign that the food is good.  I would agree with the masses on this place. 

The food was good.  Parking is a bit tough."}
{"text":"Amazing service, atmosphere and food! Have been going here regularly for the last couple years and haven't had an issue. The menu has a good variety and the bar has an extensive beer menu."}
{"text":"Make sure you get Cassaundra hollaway as your bartender she is very friendly and awesome"}
{"text":"Delicious fried pickles. Friendly and helpful staff. Excellent happy hour that starts at 3, $1.00 off drafts."}
{"text":"Nuts about their burgers.... Hint- hint
Get the pickle burger and you'll be happy and full all day,,, friendly people make this a \"no brainer\""}
{"text":"i would have liked to get the whole pickle not just a quarter of pickle slice.  The burger was fair, possibly frozen patty?"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service and lots of drink selections. 
Been there several times and never was disappointed. If your looking for a good locally owned place to relax, eat and drink this place is for you"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and other drinks! The food is actually pretty good. The pickles are tasty but the breading is a little thin. The spicy pickles are pretty good too! Staff is always very friendly and service is quick!"}
{"text":"Booked a party 2 months in advanced of the date. I found out the week of by someone that they booked a band, and didn't bother to talk to me about it at all. Took almost 2 days to hear anything back from them. Severe lack of communication, and the owner didn't seem to care one bit. Found out a few days later they also had another party booked for the same night. To tiny of a place for that kind of cluster, glad I found out before hand, but unfortunately it wasn't from them. I used to really enjoy this bar, but the lack of leadership and care for customer satisfaction I will NEVER return to this established. Had to re-plan a party I was working on for 2 months with another venue in a matter of days, and they showed more care and attention then I ever received once from here. Save yourself the trouble, book your party elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great lunchtime spot. Good beer selection. Good vegetarian options as well. Good for groups or just to come alone and sit at the bar and do some work solo during the work day. Not too loud. Oh yum, and did I mention pickles?"}
{"text":"Anyone that knows me knows that I LOVE pickles (dill, not sweet, YUCK!), I will leave no pickle unturned, and this place delivers! They have an appetizer named pickle salsa, and it is AMAZING! It is some kind of pickle concoction served with warmed pita wedges,I'm literally think of this all the time, so good. I had their pickle variety assortment, and while it was good, I would take the pickle salsa over it for sure. I even asked the waitress if they had a catering size order (yes for me and me alone, I have a problem, ok?!). I also had their pierogi special which happened to be buffalo chicken pierogis, and they were damn tasty too!! If you are a fan of pickles go here ASAP!

I'm sure their other food is fantastic as well, but I cannot not order the pickle salsa when I go."}
{"text":"Solid beer list, great menu for lunch or dinner, and terrific service. These are the best words to describe my first food experience with pickles and pints. Two bars, a good amount of seating and tvs, plus sports on!

The menu has a lot to offer from stuffed peppers or crab cake appetizers, to wings, or a wide variety wraps/salads and burgers, even pasta. I was pleasantly surprised to find my favorite season beer available, fat heads' hop juju, which is hard to find in beer stores let alone at a bar.

We ordered the fries pickles, traditional wings with buffalo sauce and a side of fries. The fries pickles come in two flavors, garlic dill or habenero, we got half and half. The habenero wasn't spicy enough to burn your pallet but I would recommend the garlic dill. The wings were exactly what you want, meaty, well cooked and just enough sauce. Traditional and boneless are the same price which surprised me. The fries were on point, but after seeing the tots with someone else's dish I would definitely give them a try.

Some people we were with ordered the asiago chicken sandwich and the buffalo chicken salad. Both looked great and were filling portions. Our bill could have easily been $10 higher at other restaurants.

I also have to give a Shout-out to The bartender/server/one woman army named Heidi. She was the only staff there on a busy Saturday lunch rush and not only made sure everyone got drinks and food but was able to stop and talk with the guests."}
{"text":"Lunch stop for thursday and it was a treat!  The food was great i had the poutine which was good but not the best i have had, fries were nicely cooked, herb gravy was spot on and seasoned well, there were julienne cut green onions on it which added a very nice fresh bite.    The let down was the lack of cheese curds, melted cheese can not compair to the texture and taste of a cheese curd other then that i would recommend trying them but i think its a one timer for me with the lack of curds.  My main dish was the wahoo burger which was amazing, burger hot dog stadium mustard pretzel bun = stadium under one bum.  The burger was cooked to order and correctly, i would have liked more of there pickle salsa/relish on it that is my only issue with the burger. The tater tots that it came with were a touch over fried for my liking.  So other then those few small issues the food is 4.5 to 5 stars.  The service at the time we went was not as good, there were what seemed like a few regulars at the bar that were getting much more attention then others (showing one how to use diffrent features on his cell phone) while my glass and my coworkers glass sat empty for at least 5 min ( 7 people in the bar including us, 1 bartender/server) which is what brought the rating down. If the service was on point with the food this would be a solid 4.5 to 5 star joint."}
{"text":"Great food!   Everything was fresh and a lot was homemade, from the pickles to the dips to the chicken fingers.  Also had a nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"Food is OK, but nothing to write home about. Music is way too loud. Service was erratic. We would be visited too frequently and then not at all."}
{"text":"Fun game times here ! The crab cakes rock as do the wings. We enjoy the staff since they truly interact with everyone, Emily is one of many great assets here. Go check them out for your self you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"So went back last week and WTF pickles are in your name and you don't have them anymore.what happen to to this place the service and food quality has went to hell was sad when I moved out of the are because I went here all the time now that I moved back I am sad again you guys need to step it up and for GOD sake either bring the  Pickles or take it out of the the name"}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely return.  My husband and I stopped here for the first time, after seeing a movie, directly across the street.  We were in the mood for a good burger, but didn't want to face the crowds or long waits in downtown Willoughby, on a Saturday night.  We entered the restaurant, seated ourselves and immediately approached by a server.  We reviewed the menu, ordered drinks and proceeded to watch the college football games being shown on the various monitors around the bar.   Our food arrived a short time later and OMG, we couldn't wait to dig in.  I ordered the mushroom burger, which consisted of a perfectly cooked beef patty topped with sauteed mushrooms, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato.  The burger was accompanied by a generous portion of hand cut, well seasoned fries and a pickle.  My husband opted for the \"build your own burger\", and enjoyed his order, as well.  Several employees/manager's stopped by to check on us, throughout the meal.  We will definitely add this place to our regular rotation of go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"The house salad was the best I've had in a while! So simple but so delicious! The speakers were just a bit loud Friday night so it was hard to socialize. Also, a local bar owner tried to start a bar fight, which seemed immature. Otherwise, fun place for an out of towner!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go out for a beer and snack. Was out with friends and discovered this place. After a couple nice visits must say I needed to review. First never thought I'd compliment loaded tater tots! Yum lol....And some really great wings!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food. Try the French fries. They are outstanding. Pass on the frozen tater tots. 

Friendly staff. They even made me a patty melt that wasn't on the menu. 

It's on our rotation list of places to eat. 

Dress casual."}
{"text":"We stopped in pickles and pints for a plan and work party. They had a buffet line prepared of various appetizers and all those were about as good as could be expected, everything was tasty hot work needed to be cool where needed to be. Couple things that I noticed is that the place was about half full a lot of other Christmas party goers and they ran out of beer glasses. How is a bar, that is half full, run out of 16 ounce pint beer glasses?

My second issue always seems to be a recurring issue amongst bars. The bathrooms. At pickles and pints they have to rest rooms for men coded number 1 and number 2 urinals and stools for obvious reasons . I did not go in the room mark with a number 2. The door is poorly placed as when you open it it should open out and not in because the bathroom is exceptionally small and anyone trying to wash their hands would get potentially hit by the door. And they have a cheapo bathroom light fixture from a residence in there and one of the bulbs was burned out. Now I don't need the bathroom to be super duper bright, but my obsessive compulsive this requires that burned out light bulbs be changed and it drove me nuts.

Other than that, I don't feel it was spectacular or awful. 3 stars is a pretty good review to get and if I could give three and a half stars they would get it."}
{"text":"When I walked in for dinner on a week night, there were a couple of people drinking at the 
bar and no other diners sitting at the tables. Kind of makes you wonder why there's no one there, and I soon found out.  
We started off with the pickle appetizer, not the fried ones, but house-made raw pickles. There were 3 cups of pickles served with pita bread. They were alright. I love pickles, though they werent the best. I ordered the polish boy burger. It was a very average burger.  Not memorable at all. The only thing I can remember about it was that the kielbasa was gross and I picked it off.  My two dining companions had another burger and a wrap. The tater tots were good, a nice change from french fries, and who doesn't like tots? 
Overall might be an okay place to drink a few beers but I won't come for the food again."}
{"text":"The mango habanero wings were good but not spicy at all. When I order habanero I expect some heat. The fried pickles were good but the dipping sauce they came with wasn't that great. Our server was kind of slow. It was a nice atmosphere. Would be a good spot to catch a game. I might return."}
{"text":"The online menu had me very excited about this place, but the actual menu we got when we arrived was missing many of the items (the most disappointing missing item was the pickle sampler). I asked our server about the differences between the menus and she said they changed the menu two days ago and the online menu hadn't been updated yet. For a place called \"Pickles and Pints,\" there's very few pickle items on the actual menu. The fried pickles, burgers, and fries were pretty good, but the fish tacos were essentially fish sticks in a tortilla. The pickles served on the side with the burgers were very disappointing; they were essentially still cucumbers that had maybe been quickly soaked in a weak brine. I did like that they had more than two non-IPA selections on their draft list. The service also was a bit slow, we had to go up to the bar to remind our server that we ordered a Diet Coke with dinner. Overall, I was very disappointed by the changed menu and probably will not go back."}
{"text":"There are so many reasons we go to Beal's so often. The primary one - I'll be honest here - is that they're one of the few close by places with a kitchen open late (til midnight in the later half of the week and weekend). My man and I both work 2nd shift type hours, so getting out to eat on a Friday before 11 PM doesn't really happen. Our options are fairly limited at that time of night on the East side, and Beal's is definitely the best of the options. 

But we've come here even when we could've chosen other places too, for a lot of the other reasons. 

Service: They take a sort of team effort approach here most of the time rather than you just having whatever server your section has - pretty much if anyone on staff walks by you and you even sort of maybe look like you need something, they're on it. Every once in a rare while, when it's really packed (think Cavs games) you just don't see a staffer as often as you'd like. But I've never had a problem hoofing it over to the bar if I need something on those occasions - when I say packed, I mean it, this place gets PACKED - and yeah, you know, I get it. Other than that, the service is always super excellent -- there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of turnover on staff either, which tells me it's likely a good place to work too. (At least I would hope so!) 

Food: It's bar food, but good. Meaning: Burgers, sandwiches, flatbread pizzas, salads and appetizers. Oh, and pickles. (In case the name didn't give it away.) All of the sandwiches and burgers come with tots, which are far superior to french fries and I don't know why every other restaurant doesn't do this. The soups of the day have always been consistently delish, the burgers are always perfectly made, and the pig wings are a favorite of my man's. We just recently tried the buffalo chicken dip app for the first time and we can't believe we've wasted years not having it (sooo creamy and warm and gooey and tasty). The one time I've been able to not indulge in a burger or sandwich (dude, TOTS!), the salad I had was well made -- real greens (not pointless iceberg), fresh ingredients. Will the chef win a James Beard award? Probably not. But for solidly good freshly made bar (comfort) food, Beal's can't be beat. (Warning: The habanero pickles do have a helluva kick. They're tasty, but make sure you've got some pita wedges to go with to help calm the heat. And if you eat one of the pickled habaneros, well, you are a much braver soul than I.) 

There's a jukebox that you can play with an app on your phone, there are a ton of TVs to catch the Cavs, or the Indians, or that other team here. The crowd is mostly cool - your usual drank a leeeeeetle too much folks on the weekends - but generally nice folks. 

It ain't fancy, but it's not a dive either. It's got that just right sort of vibe that makes it one of our regular haunts."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!  Who serves peanut butter and pickles?  My dream place. I'm from VA but I will come back for sure. Please please stop in. The service is great too."}
{"text":"Average bar.   Good location.   Great bartenders and DJ.  But just a good ole regular bar with a nice sized patio with a view of the parking lot!   But u can't beat the good staff!!!"}
{"text":"I should preface my review by stating I didn't eat any food (even the pickles which apparently are amazing. The couple beside be bought several to take home with them). I stopped in to watch the baseball game and sob into a beer. 

They had the game up on several TVs and even protected on to the wall. They were pretty busy but we sauntered up to the bar and found two seats. Even being as busy as they were, the staff was great. I don't know how often they do specials but they had them going for the game. They had several beers on tap but not that amazing of a selection of bottled microbrews (but enough that most people would be happy). Average price for a few drafts and two shots - you aren't getting a deal but I also didn't feel ripped off. 

I would probably go back here at some point, but I won't be rushing back. I have other places I'm a regular at and will drive out of my way to go to the Winking Lizard (what Can I say? I'm on the beer tour and you can't sneeze at their beer selection)."}
{"text":"there are plenty of reasons why everyone loves pickles & pints. just a few of those are the location, which is so close to everything, whether you're coming from downtown willoughby, plan to go there after or want to stay put here. there is always plenty of parking since the other establishments close are or before 9 pm. the patio is relaxing and enjoyable to spend a summer day on having some drinks and lunch or dinner. they allow smoking on the patio which is a plus for smokers and a minus for non smokers, however it didn't bother us at all as most of the people smoking were not blowing it in the general direction of people eating food. the place itself is always clean as well which is a huge plus. they also have a flat screen tv so you can enjoy a game. the food is exceptional for bar food... the french dip is one of my favorites that i've ever had with super tender & juicy meat and the tater tots on the side are so deliciously crispy. the service is top notch compared to many other bars. everyone here is always helpful and consistent but noelle takes the cake. she's sweet and will never leave you hanging at your table. if you're ever in the area and stop by, ask for noelle!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out after seeing the lime green umbrellas in the corner of the plaza where good ol' Micks used to be. This place is so new, there isn't even a sign up. Walking in, we loved what they did with the interior of the place and it has a great new American style. Many taps at the bar and decent size cooler but the selection seems vary one sided, heavy hoppy handles. Menu wise it's above average pub grub with the burgers coming from La Freida Farms. Pricey but quality food and everything is served with tater tots and a pickle. Other sides are available but for an upcharge. He had a burger with slaw and capicola, said it was awesome. I had a wrap with chicken and avacado, it was okay and needed some more sauce. There are other options on the menu that sound tempting but a $10 sandwich isn't always what we are looking for. Two sandwiches, Two beers each, and we spent $40...not sure how I feel about that. 

One thing that stood out though, the coleslaw has cranberries in it! I loved it, he wasn't so sure.
 Update:
We have been back many times and have enjoyed more of the menu. Havent had a bad thing there really. And the owner is great and very involved. We got complimentary salsas and sauces of his own creation and it really made us feel great as customers. We have turned a few of our friends on to it as well and it has become our new little hot spot.  The menu items have not disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and staff.  Burgers are awesome with some creative burgers of the month. Beer selection is nice"}
{"text":"Brian and Chuck the owners are truly great lads! They have great food! Service is always amazing! It is the best place to watch a Detroit Red Wings game!"}
{"text":"The place has a nice friendly atmoshpere. The staff is friendly and always making sure your drink is full and the food is good. The prices good. A very nice place to go, and it easy to get to."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is amazing! Drink selection is abundant and fantastic. I've come here many times, and every time it's awesome. A lot of fun! Great place to watch a football game. Obviously, there are a lot of pickle themed dishes, and you should definitely try at least one. It's a 5 star for me because I always have a great time here - food, drink, service all top-notch!"}
{"text":"Pickle salsa was awesome.  They also had fathead on tap...  Definite stop in the future."}
{"text":"Pickles and Pints.... I think I like this place! I thought the wings had a really good texture. We also got something with breads and pickle salsas or something. and some beers. That's all! Nice place. The food really seems to be a good quality. I would go again and recommend to at least try it."}
