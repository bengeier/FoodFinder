{"text":"The pantry was great came from a long trip had a great lunch will go there again great service and clean"}
{"text":"Very good a little foo fooie for the men. Food was fresh and taste. We had the warrior sandwich and tomato basil soup and the ham turkey and bacon on a toasted pretzel roll"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop has seating and a store where you can buy their products in bulk. The sandwiches are ordered at a counter - large list of choices. My sandwich was the Chief - fresh, tasty, homemade. Interesting choices of soft drinks as well and very tasty desserts."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything at the Pantry. The soup and sandwich choices are great. We will certainly come back."}
{"text":"I really like this place so far, I work in the mall across from this spot and it's a nice place to go on my break. Clean, friendly, Christian place. The soup is AMAZING! Haven't had any salads or sandwiches yet but I plan on it. Only down side is that there is no chicken Caesar salad, but whatever. Great place to feed your stomach and soul."}
{"text":"Quaint locally owned cafe serves soups, salads, sandwiches, and desserts. They also sell bulk and local food. The fresh baked goodies will catch your eye as you enter. My fave is the warrior turkey sand on fresh baked swirl pumpernickel. Not fast food and a little pricey, but the service is quick and the staff is very friendly. They do not have a fryer.  Sides are chips or potato salad..."}
{"text":"Located right by The Outlets at Tuscola Mall great place to stop for amazing soups, salads, sandwiches or coffee.  This place is wonderful my personal favorite is their grilled cheese just because I can create my own but you can not come to Tuscola or live in Tuscola and not try the Pantry!"}
{"text":"This spot is quickly becoming a regular for me. I love the atmosphere and the coffee is amazing. I am usually here for breakfast but I've been known to stop by to grab some cookies or some other treat too.

The only complaint I have has to do with the breakfasts. I'm not sure what you call the sausage they use, but it is the least sausagey sausage I've ever had. It's pretty flavorless. So if you're ordering a breakfast sandwich skip the sausage and bacon instead.

There, I just give you permission to order bacon. You're welcome"}
{"text":"What a treat to find this place!   Awesome soup, sandwiches, baked goods, and salads!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Traveling by Tuscola and saw good reviews for this place so gave it a try and glad I did. Deli style sandwiches with awesome fresh bread. I had the triple threat and it was awesome good amount of meats and cheeses  and the pasta salad that came with was also top notch. Thanks Yelp for leading me to another great meal."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for. Quality, homemade food. Immediately upon walking in you get the feeling they take pride in not just the appearance of the place but in the quality of the food. Had one of their sandwiches which I chose to get the potato salad with. Both were a hit so I had to try desert.  I don't understand the other review saying the prices were \" a little high\" because they certainly were not. Looking for a good lunch?  Go here!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Just stopped for lunch on our way home from southern Illinois. We wanted something besides fast food or a chain meal. Its They have a great selection of sandwiches made with fresh meats and cheeses that you can get on a variety of fresh baked breads-grilled if you like. I got the turkey sandwich with provolone, mayo, cranberry sauce and green peppers. Delicious! The side of pasta salad was very flavorful. There also salads, a couple of soups, coffees, and what looked like all homemade cookies, desserts, and other sweet treats, but we were too full to eat any. On one side of the building there is a store stocked with \"pantry\" items. I bought some rice grown in southern Illinois more naturally high in protein that I can't wait to try.  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Really the best little coffee/breakfast/lunch place. In winter they often have this chicken enchilada soup that is outstanding. Amazing iced tea, coffee, and fantastic baked oatmeal!!! Oh my now I have to go there tomorrow. ;) Best staff too! Super nice, caring people."}
{"text":"Delicious cheesy potato soup and roast beef sandwich with rossted red peppers and Dutch apple pie!  Quick turn around and great Amish food store."}
{"text":"Newer business/restaurant to Tuscola, family owned and ran with owners usually on site. Near the Holiday Inn Express, across of the outlet mall.  Recently expanded their hours into the evening. Includes a deli-cafe and Amish-style bulk food store. Cafe features many coffee drinks and specialty sodas; sandwiches on homemade bread and homemade soup, baked goods, and fresh salads. I enjoy a sandwich on the marble bread, toasted. Toasted means \"panini style\" - pressed. Very yummy. I recommend getting cheese on your sandwich as it's good, Amish cheese. Special is often half a sandwich and soup for $6.25. Everything is always high quality and very yummy. Not the biggest portions (which can be good - I hate having too much and feeling wasteful, or stuffed) but very satisfying and in-line with the price given the high quality. I'm glad they've expanded their hours. Be sure to check out their facebook page for the daily special. They have a few couches, a few tables and some bar height tables. Not the biggest place around, but I've never had a problem finding a seat. There's room for them to add outdoor seating, so I hope they have some this summer.

{"text":"Really cute breakfast/lunch place in a town with not a ton going on.  There are a few other chains on the street, but the Pantry is a breath of fresh air.  Delicious soupss, salad and sandwiches. Staff is friendly and service is quick.  Definitely recommend if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way up to Grand Rapids, MI for ArtPrize 8. Good food, good place to sit and eat, good service and a small Amish food store also."}
{"text":"Excellent.... Friendly, clean and delicious food. Roast pork with mashed potatoes, panini roast beef sandwich with potato cheddar soup. A great half way stop between Chicago and southern IL"}
{"text":"Nice but small indoor area for eating
About 5 standard sandwiches listed  I tried the triple threat on pretzel bun with the potato salad.
Also a peach mango smoothie

I liked the food. 

About 6 to 9 for a sandwich with a side. Smoothie was 5

Staff was nice"}
{"text":"Nice cafe atmosphere near outlet mall.  Very good quality and delicious food.  Easy parking.  Friendly service.  Will be one of my regulars!"}
{"text":"How can The Pantry only have one review!? I'm creating a Yelp account just to add another. This place is awesome. The sandwich's, the huge salads, the soups, the tea and coffee drinks, I've never had anything there that wasn't good. Talk about awesome service and kind people. Any time we've ever had a problem, they've always made it up in some way. Not even really \"problems\", just inconveniences. Like, sorry we are out of the soup you wanted, but pick a free dessert to make up for it! And that's not been a problem recently, that was closer to when they first opened and were still figuring out quantities and such. 

As for the bulk food side of the business, they've added stuff everytime I've been in there. Candies, spices, extracts, snacks... everything. They've got some awesome fresh produce right now, and it's pretty much the only place my wife and I buy eggs anymore. Farm fresh eggs, and they are the biggest I've seen. Everything is local. AND you can buy the salad dressings that they make in house! (The poppyseed is awesome.)

So pretty much, if you havn't been there, go. If you have been there, you probably are still going on a regular basis. If you went and didn't like it, go again just to be sure because this place is one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast/lunch options, coffee bar, meat and cheese counter, and a good selection of bulk items from candy to flour. Limited selection but everything tried has been fresh, well prepared and high quality. Family friendly, accommodates larger groups, or nice for some alone time."}
{"text":"Raved about this place to my sister in law, so we stopped on the way home from Covered Bridge. We both had a coffee and the Chief sandwich. That sandwich was amazing!!"}
{"text":"If you are on the road and tired of fast food. This is a great place to stop and get a meal as close to home cooking as possible. Great deli food, fresh with many home made deserts."}
{"text":"Salads & sandwiches, coffee drinks & some specialty sodas.  Good for lunch but don't get here at noon or be prepared to wait. Both sandwiches were good as was the soup & potato salad.  A little pricy, $22 for two.   Always like it when a local place opens up so I can avoid the chains."}
{"text":"Amazing. Must stop and eat here. Small business with amazing food. The broccoli and cheese soup was delicious. Sometimes it has a grainy consistency but this was perfectly smooth. I had a roast beef sandwich on white bread with pepper jack cheese, lettuce and pickles.  I got it toasted and would highly recommend it. The cheese was incredibly creamy and had the perfect amount of spice. The roast beef was tender just pure deliciousness. This is a place you must stop at!!!!  It's just off the highway by the outlet mall."}
