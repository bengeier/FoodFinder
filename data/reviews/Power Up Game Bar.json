{"text":"My friends and I attended the JunkFood Fest and they encouraged us to check out this place after we were done so we did. This place is so awesome. We played a little \"Just Dance\" and followed that up with \"Rocket League on their large screen TV. We then ordered some drinks and food and we were pleasantly surprised with how great the food was. We ordered the Salt/Pepper Wings with Sriracha(decent), Carmelized Onion Mediterranean Dip (really good), Duck Confi Wings (really good) and Spring Rolls (AMAZING).   The place has a whole retro-theme going on (like you're in a spaceship) with many booths with their own TV screen (ideal for multiplayer battling). The staff were very friendly and continually offered us help if we had game issues, wanted to order more,ect.  My friends and I will definitely come here again and I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place for 10 plus people or large parties. First off, our party was booked three weeks in advance and yet, seemed like no one at this bar was prepared for this day. My friend was the host and paid $200 (WAIT) for this event for due to not meeting a certain bill for the party. They expected everyone to pay $30 each to meet accomendations but everyone didn't(HUH?). Plus everyone had to paid their own bill (WHAT?!!) even though everything was suppose to be covered. Our water and food took too long (Imagine waiting for water, WATER!), and the food is nothing special for the price. Money wasn't worth here. Sure the games were suppose to keep us occupied as they make the food but for having 10 plus people not everyone will get a controller or participate while to only look forward to food or socialize."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time, as did my friends.  Not only were the games great (many options to play with a group) but the food was amazing and definitely wayyy better than the typical bar food and made for sharing.  Also a must visit for any cocktail lover... very creative cocktails with a good balance of flavours...kudos to the mixologist.  The most fun I've had at a bar in a while."}
{"text":"Service and everything was amazing. A couple friends and I went on a Monday night. I was a little nervous since it was actually the first bar I went to in Toronto, but as soon as I stepped in, Jess was very outgoing and chatted with me until my friends arrived. Manny was our server for the night and always came by to see how we were doing in terms of games and drinks and food. He gave recommendations that were spot on with our tastes each time, and informed us of future events such as movie nights, or any new gaming systems that they may be getting. I will definitely be coming more often"}
{"text":"The concept is alright -- it's a half-finished game bar, very cool entrance, but unfinished concrete floor. Came with a group and they charged $12 a beer -- $9 + 13% tax + a 20% auto-gratuity -- and that was ordering at the bar.  Not even table service. Just go and order the same beer as the guy next to me, but pay $12 for it.  Obviously a bar run by gamers, which is great, but charging $12 for a pint of Beau's is ridiculous.  I'm a decent tipper -- tipping $1.50 a beer is pretty standard. Also fine with paying $9 a beer in a bar that is worth visiting.  $12 a beer is INSANE. Sorry. I never write yelp reviews. This is just crazy."}
{"text":"Went here because my sister wanted to go (I'm not really a video game player). Ordered some food, the cheeseburger sliders were surprisingly tasty! I'd order them again, also had the wedges and feta dip which were also good. The beef skewers were way too tough and we couldn't eat them. I wasn't a fan of the drinks, I'd like more classic drinks over signature \"fancy\" ones. Our server was super friendly, informative and helpful with explaining the games food etc. We played \"over cooked\" which was fun. I would say that the set up could be improved, it was a little awkward to sit and turn our heads to see the tv screen to play the games. Nice hangout place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Super fun place! Never heard of a gaming bar before, so we decided to stop by. Immediately we were greeted by a super nice waiter who was really down to earth and could tell right away that we were first timers at this bar, and he treated us super nicely the entire night.   Drinks were pretty cheap and really good, the waiters have fantastic suggestions based on your tastes. There's a wide variety of games, and you can even just choose to sit and watch sports or TV if you want. Great place to kill an hour or so if you really need to, would recommend."}
{"text":"Great gaming bar that's actually got some class.    Food was great but a bit pricey. The drinks take a loong time, actually got most of them after food, but you can tell that there's a lot of care in making. I had most of the cocktails at $11 each (as I said, I had fun.. maybe a bit too much), my favorites were Dark Sign - creamy but slightly bitter, Dawn's Beauty - very sweet, kind of reminded me of honeydew juice, and Capital Wasteland - had absinthe, slightly sweet and a bit strong.  As for gaming, would've liked a bit more options. Every booth has only one console so you might have to wait for a booth to be free - even if the group seated isn't playing it. Layout is also a bit awkward - the booths are C shaped but the monitor is on the wall behind the booths, meaning some people would have their backs to it.   As for atmosphere and decor, I'm not sure how new this place is but it's obviously a bit of a work in progress. Would love to see more gaming related memorabilia - doesn't have to be in your face but collectibles on display would be cool to see.   Had a ton of fun here and would love to come back. Wish there was something like this place on the west side - which would make sense since a lot of animation/gaming studios are over here!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place from a friend as we were looking for something to do on a Saturday night. A place to play console games and have drinks? Why not? Sounds awesome!   I gave a rating of 4 stars, but it's more like 3.5.  First impressions, the decor is pretty sick. Blue LED lights on a nice clean white interior. The bar looked beautiful and the sight of two guys at the bar playing Street Fighter really got me pumped!   We were seated in a nice booth with a PS4 console. The server was really attentive and informative. There was apparently an event for Pokemon Go happening that night so there was some Pokemon Go drink specials for $6. That was pretty interesting.   The regular drink menu were on the pricey side but that's understandable since they aren't charging you to play and everything's pricey downtown. I didn't order anything to eat but they did have interesting snack selections such as truffle popcorn.   The seating of the booth is a little weird if you're inside and the TV is directly behind you. It made gaming a little weird. So that was one con I had, but there's not much you can do about it. Also, with the PS4, there was limited coop games in comparison to the other consoles such as the Wii. So game selection was kind of disappointing. A suggestion would be to have a video game list and maybe a consoles for every booth. I get that it would be expensive, but it would be great to have options for people coming in.   The server checked up on us often, but I found it was a little too often. Maybe longer intervals once we've settled and are into the games.   All in all, it is a great concept. There's some small improvements that need to be made but it's a work in progress. I'd recommend going as a date or a small group, maximum of 4 people. I think the experience might have been better if we were able to play games like Mario Party because the PS4 was so limited in choices. Also we did have a group of 7 so it might've been a factor."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews about this place. The concept is great, like nothing I've ever seen. I've never played Mario Kart on a night out before and it was so much fun! The lay out of this place is pretty cool too. Blue lighting everywhere!  However... it was a quiet Thursday night and there wasn't many tables and yet they service was s l o o o o w. We chose to order off the signature cocktail menu as they all sounded unique and different to other places but ultimately, they were rubbish. The flavours of these drinks just did not work well together and I'm a little confused how the bar staff haven't figured that out? Maybe it's just me...  To summarise, go here it's a fun bar but stick to beers/spirit mixers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Amazing food and cocktails, and Canadian craft beers on tap! Comfortable booths for private gaming, or you can sit at the bar for a more communal experience. The staff are super friendly and did I mention the food is awesome? Snack-style stuff, but those chicken wings are amazeballs.. It's all console gaming right now, so it's more socially inclusive than PC gaming. Great place to hang out and play some games!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice. I tried a few cocktails like Snake Eater, Samus Aran and Fan Boy and first two were very nice. Little bites we had were excellent, like mini burger, chicken wings and duck wings, spicy chicken bites and lavash type bread. Dance video game was so much fun. There was a group of Asian guys who started playing it and we were sitting next by and we got right in with them.  I think it's good for groups especially if people hardly know each other as they can break any ice by this fun dancing game. The other room had round cabins with a TV screen where group of people could play a game together. Service was very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent for large groups but book in advance! Also mention which console you would like to have. I wish we chose the wii u but we got the PS4 and the xbox. Not too many competitive games for either of them. Expect large crowds. I ordered a hummus platter which was awesome. Our server even replenished the hummus. They also have nights where there's dancing."}
{"text":"This place is a blast! Especially the dancing game. The cocktails are really good too. Would recommend this for a fun night out with friends. It's easy to meet people too because the video games are an ice breaker."}
{"text":"Yes, drinks on a Monday after work. It was a  great evening at Power Up Game Bar for a geeky combination of party games, finger foods, and drinks. It's a little on the pricier side, but I would recommend it for bdays and night outs when you want somewhere more chic than your living room. The staff members were very friendly and hospitable too!"}
{"text":"Just found out about this new place. Hubby ordered the Duck Confit Wings which had an awesome honey, orange, rosemary glaze and a different yet tasty, sugared rosemary garnish. I had the Tuna Poke which was really good too, lots of varying flavors and textures (mmm fried wontons). We actually ate more of each other's food than our own, but it seems the whole menu is meant to be pretty shareable. Probably cuz the whole concept is video game consoles setup to play for free while you eat/drink. We had a great time munching and playing Street Fighter, and even played Just Dance on a big screen with our server. As for drinks, we only had pints of Beau's Lug Tread tonight, but their signature cocktails seemed pretty interesting/incorporated different ingredients. If they happen to be anything like the food, I'm sure we'd have a blast playing here with friends on a Friday night and not just a quick dinner on a Monday eve."}
{"text":"Came here for a party. Never would have given this place a second glance as I don't play video games.    It's a futuristic space in a basement on wellington st. There are numerous booths each equipped with a game console either Xbox, play station or Wii.   The staff are very friendly and helpful, although they can be very busy...this is understandable as the place is packed and they try to acvommodate our needs as much as they can. I am also amazed by our server, Manny, who somehow remembered everyone's order despite we all move around from tables to tables (large group) and leaving at different time.    Our favourite was the big screen TV where one can play some follow-along dance games. It's quite a workout.  One thing that would be great is to have napkins readily accessible. They serve a lot of finger food but there was nothing to wipe hands with.  This is a bit annoying when you want to pick up the remote.  Otherwise we plan to return as much as we can!"}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace to hang on a rainy day, and this place was an excellent find!! Cool, unique cocktails, decent beer selection (not huge, but interesting), tasty food, and excellent service!! We had Risotto Balls, Pork Rinds, Truffle Popcorn, and a surprise treat of S'more Churros! Not only that, but you can have these yummy food and drinks while playing MarioKart (or whatever game you choose). It was slow the day we went, so our bartender played a game with us! Really great place."}
{"text":"We had such a great time here! Took my girlfriend to power up because she loves gaming and I love drinking. We ordered the marshmallow churros and they were to die for. You wouldn't expect so many original cocktails and a wide variety of food in this little place! The lighting was super cool & tables were cozy with a TV right in the booth. Had issues with controllers which didn't get resolved but we made it work! Wish we lived closer so we could go more often."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The place was severely understaffed on a Saturday night, with only 2 or 3 employees seen. Trying to order drinks or food, change game discs, or pay the bill was an exercise in patience. There was a minimum spend of $30 per person, and the food portions were small. On top of that, our medium-sized group was charged 20% service. The games and atmosphere were not that enjoyable, and I found much better value at other places, particularly board game cafes.  Additional comment after business owner's reply: To be fair, the items I ordered were delivered in reasonable time (I think 5 to 10 min). Some members of my party waited longer for the food to arrive. However, I had trouble getting a staff's attention to order in the first place - I sat and stared at the bartender's nonstop hands for about 5 minutes waiting for a chance. When I said the place was understaffed, I don't take this lightly - it happens in less than 1 in 10 places I visit on average."}
{"text":"I've never been to a game bar, so I loved the concept of this place. As soon as you walk in, it seems like you've time-traveled forward into a futuristic world.   We called to make a reservation in advance. I was told that ordinarily they only reserve for groups of 10+, but still penned us in, even though we only had 8. The beginning of some great customer service.  We initially asked for the PS4, but realized that there weren't too many game options, so asked for the Wii instead. However, we were free to switch between the two consoles as we pleased. The server was super accommodating throughout the evening, especially when game controllers ran out of battery, or as more people joined our party. We found out near the end of the night that he was the only one manning the entire place, which included a bar upstairs, and multiple large groups in the gaming area. I was impressed with his patience and overall ability to keep us satisfied.  Alongside the games, we snacked on some platters and drinks. I will say that it was a bit strange having the TVs at the back of every booth, which made it difficult to fit more than 5 people in that area. If possible, try to nab the large couch area in the corner, which comfortably faces the TV.  A great place to visit if you're looking for a fun group activity!"}
{"text":"The inconspicuous sign on Wellington does not convey any of the interesting, funny, and memorable moments that your group will experience just down a set of blue-lit stairs. The basic premise is that it's a full bar with food options, but each booth/seating arrangement also has a gaming console that you can play with. Even if you are sitting at the bar, there are screens there for you!! I don't think there is a cover charge but my group had reserved the largest gaming area by the bar, so there was a minimum spend of $30 for each person. We ended up staying there for 6 hours, therefore that was no issue since we were getting dinner and a couple rounds of drinks.    The food and drinks are pretty good! Both are on the pricey side, but that is to be expected when you can hang around for hours. For drinks, I would recommend the Snake Eater if bourbon is your poison. The chicken wings were good and disappeared quickly after showing up at the table. The potato wedges and chicken skewers were also ordered a couple times by the group. I had the bacon burger sliders, which were filling but not that memorable. Service is nice and friendly, but the bar gets a little overwhelmed at times so you may need to be patient with them.  The gaming choice is quite varied. We played Castle Crashers, Quiplash, Lego StarWars and Rocket League throughout the night. However, the real winner of the night  was Just Dance. If your group is outgoing, doesn't mind being stared at and wants blackmail material on each other, this is the perfect game. We were having so much fun, random people would join in with us and that only made it better. Definitely a great night out with a group!!"}
{"text":"A pretty great place with somewhat decently priced and delicious food and drinks, and an awesome atmosphere and service. The gaming is free, which is also a massive plus as a lifelong fan of couch multi.  Service was frequent, our waiter was really friendly, and the atmosphere, combined with party games and drinks is great. There's a really cool assortment of video game inspired drinks, the Geralt of Rivia tasted amazing and my friend's Snake Eater definitely wasn't lacking in presentation either.  That said, while there was a decent selection of games in our booth (PS4), the selection of party games (3+ players) was lacking (perhaps more to blame on the PS4's library of games than the bar itself, but the selection still could be improved with a few different games.. add on Towerfall, Rocket League, or Broforce perhaps)"}
{"text":"Food and drinks seemed to be a little pricey but it was worth it as there was a good selection of games. We enjoyed Mario Party and Mario Kart on the WiiU as well as Street Fighter. I'm not a big fan of video games but I still had fun. I would recommend this place - you could easily spend a few hours here with a good group of friends."}
{"text":"The service here is super friendly, the atmosphere is perfect, and although it's a bit pricey, the food is SO worth it. And ofcourse you get free gaming which makes the price totally acceptable. But honestly, all the food here is beyond delicious and the bartenders and servers are great."}
{"text":"My first time here was when they first opened.  It was very obvious that the place was still constructing - unpainted wall, unorganized staff, and it seemed like everything was out of place. When we walked down into the bar area, not a single soul greated us. We had no idea who were the staffs and who were the customers. We proceeded to the \"gaming\" area with cute couches and tv screens. Someone finally greeted us for a seat, showed us how everything worked, and took our order. Our food and drinks came quicky - they were better than expected (expected the food to be on an \"unconstructed\" level too).   As the name of the place suggests, you play games with different consoles. The selection of the games were extremely limited. I really liked the idea of having a drink, a light snack while gaming on a comfy couch, but everything was just very uncoordinated.  Fast forward couple months, I dropped by again - everything has been \"updated\". The place is more lively, people seemed more welcoming and knew what they were doing. Had a light gin based drink with egg white and I was pretty impressed.  I was really turned off by the initial first impression I had of this place, but I'm glad I gave it another shot."}
{"text":"[Foreword: My visit last week was mired with problems - the waiter was slow and took a long time for us to get drinks; they had a \"system issue\" and we had to repeat to the waiter to note the items we ordered for the bill. I am attributing these issues as \"waiter problems\" and not an issue with the establishment, so it did not affect my rating of the place.]  I love the concept of power up game bar - it's a bar pub with a side of \"free\" gaming. Of course, the gaming isn't entirely free since the prices of the food here are a dollar or two more than what they should be, but I feel it is worth the premium.  I was very surprised when I ordered the duck confit wings, because they are very delicious and I had not expected much from the food here. The skewers were ok but I probably won't get them again. I love the fact that they have the Nickelbrook IPA on tap, which earns points in my book.  The game selection was decent and patrons would do well here playing cooperative group games.  Overall, I really like this place and would come back again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first visit.   The bartender was really chill and friendly, didn't catch his name. Food was tasty. They had 2oz highballs for $7, can't beat that in this area.   My friend mentioned to me that he thought some of the alcohol spilled out of the glass when it was being poured. The bartender overheard him, and without even questioning him, friendly topped it up.  Will be returning tonight as well!"}
{"text":"We booked a reservation for Friday night and we were provided with the big screen TV station situated next to the bar. As soon as you walk in you can appreciate the design of Power Up. They have a wide range of games to select from and offer a few different systems to play. The only negative from my experience was the lackluster customer service and food turnaround time.   The chick with red hair really soured the experience. She seemed annoyed with me asking questions like what games would you recommend for a large group? What was the WiFi password? etc. She messed up a few of our orders and never really apologized for errors.   The turnaround time for food & drinks was quite slow. I ordered the \"Mediterranean Dip Platter\" and it arrived approximately 1.5 hours later. When asked what caused the delay, they attributed it to the length it takes to create the dips....I spoke to the owner, Chris, and he did end up compensating the meal. He was professional and understanding, and the only reason I am giving this a 3/5 instead of 2/5.   Overall, interesting idea that suffers from quality of customer service and food turnaround times."}
{"text":"Came here because we saw it on blogto and it looked pretty unique. First off, the service is excellent, and it's a very modern, clean environment with large TVs and comfy seating.   We decided to play wii u because we all had ps4s. Their selection is good: Mario kart 8, New super mario bros u, mario party, and smash bros. We spent most of the time playing smash bros and it was fun. The thing is I feel like the seating should be flipped the other way to be further from the TV. The way the seating is you're very close to the tv and looking at it from a side angle. It's a minor complaint but felt like my neck was sore from turning it for a long period of time. Maybe i'm old though.  The food:  Tuna poke, it was good. It didn't really look like poke but the flavour was good. not hawaii level or style though. It was an interesting take on poke but not sure I would order it again.  Crispy salt and pepper chicken wings: These were pretty crispy and tasty. I could order this again and also try the duck confit wings next.  Chili puff pork rinds: not bad, the chili adds a good flavour and it was a low level of spice  Drinks:  N7: probably my favourite trilogy mass effect, this drink has a blue colour reminiscent of the asari - a good drink that didnt skimp on alcohol at a reasonable price $9. Now that I think about it the powerup bar design kinda reminds me of a mass effect bar/club.  Capital wasteland: I didn't try it but it was based on fallout and it had absinthe and citrus. My friend enjoyed it.  Master chief: didn't try this either but my friend enjoyed it. Strong and citrusy. You already know what game this is from.  Overall, an enjoyable and unique experience worth going to. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great Idea for a bar and is great for coming with a group of friends. Wide selection of consoles and all the classic games you'd expect to go with it - FIFA, Mario Kart, Smash Bros etc.  However, what let this place down was the drinks service - granted they're doing table service, but this place was barely full and it still took a good 20 minutes from when they took our order, to deliver our drinks back. What's worse, we were on the cocktails (which are all intriguingly named after computer game characters) and for want of a better word, they all tasted like ass...  As I say, great location to hang out with friends, however I'd stick to beers and wines from a drinking perspective."}
{"text":"Really nice staff working the place who were always willing to help out. The ambiance of the place is really relaxed and laid back. Drinks and food decently priced - all in all a good hangout spot for anyone who likes video games"}
{"text":"Instead of greeting me or asking me what I'd like to drink, the bartender asked if I was \"Industry\", which I am, I'm a business owner... and I guess she didn't believe me because her response was pretty rude. Anyways, I really just wanted a drink but she walked away and never asked what I wanted... even though there was only 5 people at the bar. So I left."}
{"text":"I heard about Power Up Game Bar from a friend and since my birthday was coming up, I decided to get a group of friends and book a table for a Saturday night. I called early October to make a reservation for the Saturday of the Halloween weekend and they were in the middle of planning their own Halloween party. Chris was the one who kept in contact with me and he was great during the whole experience. They called me after they had confirmed their plans and told me the details well before the day. With the group reservation, we had to spend at least 300$ as a table and a 20% gratuity fee would be added on. This was clear prior to booking so it was very much appreciated that we had the information before going in.   Upon arrival, it felt like I walked into a different world. The ambiance was definitely on point with a sci-fi movie set. We had a group of 8 so they sat us at the back which was somewhat isolated from the rest of the bar. This worked in our favour because it definitely got crowded the rest of the night with the amount of people there for their Halloween event. We were set up with the PS4 since it was the one that happened to be at that booth. After ordering some food and drinks with some of the staff, Chris also introduced himself to us and everything went smoothly. We played overcooked on the PS4 before deciding that we wanted to change over to the Wii to play Mario Kart. They explained that we couldn't switch to a booth with the Wii with our size of party but could provide us with the Nintendo Switch. We ended up playing Mario Kart, Bomberman, and 1,2, Switch.   The food and drinks were pub-styled dishes. We ordered most of what was on the menu. Some of my favourites include the risotto balls, the chicken wings, and the potato wedges. I also loved the naked mole rat drink and our table ordered at least 6 between the 8 of us (some had repeat orders). The drinks on their special menu were more cocktail style and didn't have that liquor taste which was very much to my liking. They even gave our table a complimentary plate of churro rolls for \"being a great group.\"   At the end of the night, there was music going with a live DJ. Everyone was dressed up because for the Halloween party and it was a very social environment with people watching each other play their games and joining in. The staff were great and with the amount of people they had to serve, They made effort to check up on us. It was unique experience and it was a great way to spend the night if you're looking for a group activity. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is good for a chill night. Really cool idea and food/drinks weren't too expensive. The waiter was great and super helpful."}
{"text":"I went Friday after work with a few work friends/outside of work friends and we had a blast. The location is incredibly convenient for people who ride the subway (myself) or those who may live outside the city and ride The GO train. We sat in the section that had booths because we were quite a big group. The staff were extremely accommodating and eager to share insight on how the place worked. Each booth has different consoles/games and they are FREE! If you want to change a game or try something new your server takes care of all of that. We ordered a few plates of food to share at the table and we weren't disappointed. The mini sliders are AMAZING!   I will say this as my only suggestion on how they could make it better... Have another waiter/waitress especially during the busy hours. Our waitress was clearly frazzled at all the tables she was working and we felt bad for her because more often than not she took ages with our drinks or completely forgot them all together.  Her attitude was AMAZING and if the management team is reading this post, please give her some R&R (Rewards and recognition). The food, games, atmosphere, waitress were all top notch.. just maybe get a second server to help out."}
