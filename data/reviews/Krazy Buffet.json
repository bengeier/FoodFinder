{"text":"Like some of the reviewers have mentioned, the food at Krazy Buffet are not only tasteless but gross. I was there at their grand opening with my family and I just wanted to leave after I sampled some of the food they have. This Chinese restaurant represents one of the worst on my list. I'm Chinese and I cook myself, so I know more than a thing or two about what has passed through my taste buds. Krazy buffett is a disgrace to the Chinese food, it's anything but Chinese. Why the one star? Well, my 13 year old daughter threw up soon after we went home and I was quite sure it's because of the food poisoning! I won't eat there even if they pay me."}
{"text":"Perfect for the price. They get everything you want to find in a Chinese buffet. They also have Mongolian BBQ inside. Drink is $1.69. I should have known this place earlier!"}
{"text":"This place is cool for the price. They have a decent selection. I had more than I could eat of those crab Rangoons. The shrimp and cheese mussels are huge and really good. I'm not a big desert person but I didn't have any room left to try anything. I won't mention why they are missing one star."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled.  Rainbow Krazy Buffet doesn't have crab legs as pictured!  Went in, was waiting for crab legs to arrive on the buffet, never showed.  I asked about it, they said no more crab legs.  The manager at the desk seemed totally unconcerned that I was unhappy but was totally happy to take my payment after we'd been there 15 minutes.  When I complained that it was bad advertising to show crab legs pictured in the website she just looked at me.  DON'T go to Rainbow Krazy Buffet, staff couldn't care less about you and they have no desire to make things right when confronted.  What a joke for a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just walked was greeted then she tried to seat me at a dirty table with food chunks all over table and booth.  I had to ask her for a clean table then decided that they suck and better to just go somewhere else.  Great first impression.  Filthy and really no respect for a customer."}
{"text":"Its so hard to find a good asian buffet. Theres A huge selection of food for a awesome price. Unlimited crab legs. There must be 40+ appetizers, entrees and desserts. Im giving a 3 stars because though the food tastes good, they could keep up wth the bathrooms better for as busy as they are. That is obviously very important."}
{"text":"Filthy, filthy bathrooms.  If the bathrooms look like this, then what do you think the kitchen or the fridge or the freezer or the ice machine look like?  Should be shut down by the health department - if there is one in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ate at Krazy Buffet since (west side) since it has been opened.  Husband and I eat there at least once a month.  Since it has been opened the place has become VERY rundown, dirty and in need of a good overhaul.  The food is good to very good, but eating in this atmosphere makes it feel just plain nasty.  I have told the manager about our concerns and he seemed surprised.  Until there is a face-lift we won't be back."}
{"text":"We have a tradition of having Chinese food on Christmas.  We are new to the area, so we thought we would give this place a try.  Since it was a holiday, the place was very busy and completely full.  We were seated within 5 minutes.  Even though they were packed, the buffet was kept full and all the items we tried were fresh.  The food was tasty and we left very full and happy.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the food. There are many choices and the price is also acceptable. I will come back evey time to here."}
{"text":"This place is Krazy. It was unexpectedly very good. It could just be my expectations were low to begin with, so even average food exceeded my expectations.  I've driven past it dozens of times but never considered trying it because of the name. That is until one day I was craving crab legs and searched Yelp for a decent seafood buffet. Krazy Buffet popped up and I figured for a fraction of the price of a casino buffet, I'd give it a try. I was nervous about eating here (I mean, what can you really expect from a place that misspelled crazy?) But I was surprised at how good it turned out to be.

First I should mention they only have crab legs for dinner which starts at 4pm. If you paid for lunch and stay around for the crab they will charge you extra. At least that's what the sign says.

Anyway, the crab legs were just ok. I don't know if they were frozen or pre-cooked, but the texture seemed a bit squishy to me. But hey, it was still worth it because it's crab! We ate so much crab I think they were happy to see us leave.

The selection of other items was pretty good. It's what you would typically expect from a Chinese buffet. The items that stood out to me were the large steamed shrimp with shell on (a bit bland but very fresh), clams, meatballs, tiramisu, and strawberries.

Service was great. Everyone was so friendly, they kept our drinks full and our table clear. Obviously a buffet is self serve but the employees here are much more pleasant than some expensive high end restaurants I've been to. I'd recommend it for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"I just found a baby roach crawling in my pudding! When I took it to the manager/owner he said he knew he had a pest problem and had called someone a few days ago! Really?!? They KNOW they have a problem and they still serve people! Then when I told him I refused to pay for it he said, \"it's ok, a lot of white people don't like to pay!\" Omg! This place needs to be closed down!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and I was surprised how popular this place is as we have to wait in line for a bit. The lunch price is around $8.75 per person which is ridiculously cheap for a buffet restaurant that provides a huge variety of food plus Mongolian grill and sushi bar."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm full!  The food is varied and pretty good.  I think I will be a frequent flyer here. The crab legs alone makes it worth it. Fresh oysters ( not very big, but fresh ). Yes, do try this place."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Not bad for a buffet. The staff is pretty unfriendly. I felt like I don't belong here. 
Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"The best Asian buffet in all of Las Vegas!!! It's cheap too just over 10 bucks for adult dinner, can I get a hell ya!!!!!! A good variety of sushi, crab legs, shrimp with cocktail sauce, soft and chewy sesame balls and a seafood mix."}
{"text":"Went with family and thought food tasted a bit like cafeteria food. Overall, my family loved it. I was just not too \"Krazy\" about it."}
{"text":"Super lackluster! Myself and my two daughters (foodies too), went to Krazy Buffet yesterday early evening (5ish), it wasn't busy at all. Our waitress Nicole was nice.  I'm finding hard to write anything else. Unfortunately, the best item was the soft serve. The crab legs were super budget and only had a tiny bit of meat in it, the oysters and shrimp were \"water logged\". The choice and servings of \"sushi\" were so miniscule that it doesn't even count. Some things looked really good, but the flavors just weren't there. The chow mein was more like brown spaghetti. Several choices (actually too many)of items that starred imitation crab. The salt & pepper squid was ok. I meant to try the Broccoli Beef, but forgot. The seabass was tough and chewy. Some could say the you pay for what you get, but we've gone to another Asian buffet that was a little less and lots better. The restaurant was clean, and again our waitress was nice and that is where I get the two stars from."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to come here yesterday for lunch since she had received a $30 gift certificate from one of her friend's for Christmas. At first my sisters and I were all apprehensive since we're very picky about buffets. My dad has owned and operated several buffets in his lifetime and we have all worked in one or more of his restaurants in the past. My mom said she likes this place because it looks very clean. She said although they don't boast the biggest selection its cleanliness outweighs this by far. 

I ended up eating only one plate since that's what always happens to me at buffets. I can never seem to pig out or stuff my face. I tried many different things but this time I was pretty conscious of what I put on my plate. I didn't want to get a lot of stuff and end up wasting half of it so I got a little bit of the things that did seem appetitive to me at the moment. I got random things such as the Blue Fin Shark (my sister said her portion tasted sour, don't know how that could have happened), a very plump chicken wing, a big dollop of Chocolate Pudding, a big plate of clams, Coconut Chicken (very similar to Walnut Shrimp, which they don't serve), a cucumber and tomato mix, seabass, sauteed spinach, two pieces of two different rolls, etc. All-in-all everything wasn't bad and I liked the fact that they offered multiple types of fish and seafood in general. FYI, they serve raw oysters for dinner. They also serve some Chinese buffet staples such as egg drop soup, hot & sour soup, lo mein and sweet & sour chicken along with fresh fruit and various desserts.

The place was pretty packed when we were here and there seemed to be a constant trickle of customers coming through the doors. We ate pretty quickly since we wanted to get our shop on at Stein Mart, which is conveniently located in the same strip mall. The total came out to be $33 something for the four of us.

The soft serve ice cream was more water based and icy than it was creamy. I know my dad's soft serve ice cream spat out ice based ice cream too so I can conclude now with certainty that Mc Donald's soft serve ice cream is the best. The ones offered at buffets can never and will never measure up. So in other words don't get your hopes up on one of these soft serve machines."}
{"text":"This shh is KRAY. Not in regards to the food, but the KRAZY decor that remains on the walls and windows as holidays come and go. So, yeah, the food wasn't as krazy as I was expecting; it's Panda Express in buffet form. No seared cow brains and fried chicken beaks here.

I had my doubts about this place. But I have doubts about restaurants that have carpeted floors. GROSS. Ignoring all that, focus on  the rows of food containing soups, vegetables, meats, and fruit. Also, there's back rows with sushi and other miscellaneous foods that I was too lazy to explore, because I kept returning for more of my favorites. Besides, the other stuff looked meh.

Highlights:
- House Special Beef (gimme more of that MSG, please!)
- Egg Drop Soup (ho-ho yummy)
- Beef with Broccoli (good, only got this cause I was missing some greens on my plate)
- Orange Chicken (so good, so good!)
- Black Pepper Squid (not chewy, woot!) 
- Chinese Wontons (stuffed with cream cheeeese!)

Not gonna lie, I did get a little sick from this place right after, but maybe you, reader, have a stomach of steel and could handle this \"gourmet\" Chinese buffet. Ah, but  I'd be krazy, nay, stupid to return for a second time. It was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"2nd time to this buffet and the outcome......good. For the price of the lunch buffet it's worth it. You have a variety to choose from and they continously keep the food pans full so you are not really waiting a long time for your favorite dish to be refilled. The staff is always cleaning the empty plates off your table while asking to refill your drinks. Clean and simple chinese buffet."}
{"text":"When your experience is so bad you actually sign up for Yelp, that's a problem. We arrived a full forty five minutes before closing and found over half the trays were empty, and what was available was clearly dried out and old. There was no beef of any kind, no warm shrimp dishes(but a nice pile of partly dessicated salad shrimp), several dishes of just leftover garnish(warm, limp cabbage anyone?), only two types of sushi with avocado that had gone brown. The manager was out there already shutting off and cleaning steam tables, right after they had seated three tables so it's not like the place was empty. When we complained we were told to come earlier! I suggest if they don't intend to make food past 8pm, they close earlier!"}
{"text":"Service is usually good here; fast and friendly. Drinks are always topped off quickly. I think this is one of the better asian food buffets.  I come here for the crab legs and shrimp that's coated with honey and mayo.  Yummy.  They serve sea bass and shark sometimes. They have a small selection of okay desserts."}
{"text":"$12.99 for Dinner with oyster and other seafood is really good price...lunch is like a regular buffet but Dinner is nice on this place... Just make sure that you come around regular dinner time the food is not good when is not hot.....but as long as the food keeps coming in the place is a go go..."}
{"text":"The food is good EXCEPT the shushi, stay away from the sushi bar. It's not fresh!  
For the price it's okay."}
{"text":"went here for dinner a few weeks ago and again for lunch this weekend.

dinner has crab legs, sushi, oysters (all not my gig), and several shrimp and fish entrees.  the shrimp entrees were great!!  soooooo yummy!  the chicken and beef entrees were also really good. the service was a little slow and the iced tea was a bit watered down, but for the quality of the food and price you can't beat it.  

lunch also has oysters, sushi, shrimp and fish.  the lobster shrimp was good, as were the chicken entrees.  not too many beef offerings for this lunch.  the ice tea was better (not great) and service was on the spot!  she flew in each time a plate was finished, even thought the place was fairly busy!  and lunch for 3 ppl including tax and drinks for under $30 is a bargain."}
{"text":"The price is higher than other lunch buffets. Figure $11 with tip.  There is variety but flavor wise it didn't knock me over."}
{"text":"It's not bad for the price your paying the sushi isn't that great but there isn't any MSG in their food which is a plus."}
{"text":"In a city of buffets, why in the heck would I go looking for a Chinese Buffet? Because sometimes I just want a variety of Asian food to choose from. I've tried most Asian buffets here in Vegas so when I couldn't decided on a place to eat but knew I had a craving for some good Chinese eats, I figured what the heck let's do a buffet!

This place is called Krazy for a reason, lots of people were here on the Sunday afternoon we came. The crab legs were piled on plates quicker than they could get out on the buffet line. I'm sad I didn't get to sample these suckers as people piled them on their plate like there was no tomorrow.

Overall the food on the line was pretty good and exceeded my expectations. I ate so much that day that I can't remember what was the best thing on there, I just know that I was completely satisfied afterwards.

Decent food, decent price and lots of people! Good luck trying to get crab legs! :("}
{"text":"Last time I will EVER allow my kids to go down there! My two oldest met a friend for dinner last night and my two have been sick all night.  Filing a complaint with SNHD right now...food poisoning is NOT what they ordered!  Lesson learned, visit the SNHD website and research all the demerits before you go out!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Not tht much of a selection.  Prize was not bad. FYI, drink is not included."}
{"text":"Reasonable price. So so food. Good stuff. It will be perfect if they refill crab meat all time :)"}
{"text":"I know. Five stars? For an asian buffet?  Well its not gormet, but it is the best asian buffet I have ever had.  Friendly staff and nice decor. Was the old Lone Star that closed years ago. The sushi was varied and fresh.  The pork dumpling had a lot of flavor.  The cold shrimp should have been devained, but were still good.  My favorites were the coconut shrimp and the sushi with cream cheese.  Oh, the cream cheese wontons were good too.  So high marks for fresh and flavorful food.  My only fear is that it just opened  and may sacrifice quality for profits over time.  But for now, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Price increase  $12.99 dinner . 
Sunday's all day is $12.99

Food is good , good staff .
When they receive you is not to friendly,  if you arrive 15 mins before dinner you pay price for lunch ,  but they are watching do you don't eat dinner food.  Well the manager one time did that with me and family.

The bathroom is nasty , dirty I don't want put pics . If you are looking for food is not good idea post pictures disgusting. But they need put attention with the contamination from baths. 

Thank you ."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just average......a lot of food, decent selection and reasonable prices, but the food is nothing to shout about....it is just a typical Chinese buffet....if you love Chinese food, go someplace better"}
{"text":"The customer service here is awesome!!! Food is good for the price, their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is great. Location is great as well."}
{"text":"It was okay, it did the job of filling our hunger! The service was good tho I must say. We went when it first opened so everything was fresh but not very great tasting. Hot sauce was needed"}
{"text":"Never coming back! Serviced was not good, there was a bug in my drink and the cashier said something in her native language when my boyfriend and I walked away (my guess about the tip amount because we were not pleased with anything). DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!"}
{"text":"The place was okay. I was craving for some seafood and this place did not disappoint me. They had crawfish which was my favorite on top of the other seafood. Good selections of food. For their price, its a good selection of food from sushi to seafood. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a rate is give them 0 so this was my experience last night @ the restaurant, my boyfriend and his friend as well as I chose to eat at the Krazy buffet at first everything was fine they seated us, we went to go get food my boyfriend went and told the waitress that seated us he had a 15% coupon from Yelp, she then said that they would take it and asked each of us what we would like to drink so I gave her my response then I went and got crab legs as soon as I came back to sit down I asked the waitress if they had crab claws she said yes, and literally threw them at me as well as a basket to where I can put the mess in, she was so rude and at the end when we were done eating my boyfriend had asked for the check and the lady came back she already put the discount (15%) on the check and said please put a tip? Like really wtf? Isn't that my option if I want to or not? And she said circle an option 15% 20% my boyfriend circled 15% basically the discount , never coming here again."}
{"text":"Plenty of variety. Quality of the food is above average and the price is excellent. Beware of the bathrooms. If they're that nasty, how clean is the kitchen?"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It's not bad but I like to go on Sundays because of their oysters. Surprisingly, they are fresh and juicy just like any oyster bar out there or even better but this one is steal deal. Not fancy, just casual. They do have limited food but I'm okay with it. 
They also have fresh sashimi at their sushi stations. Again, limited rolls but I truly understand. 
Just a big boo hoo on their dessert. My only favorite was their cream puffs, which was seriously filled up with cream."}
{"text":"Drove 9 miles from the strip to get to this place. I have a big family and al the kids wanted Chinese buffet. So why not? Looked up Chinese buffet on Yelp and review spoke for itself. Was surprised at the quantity of food available. Everything from sushi to pizza to even apple pie was available. Seems like the owners want to welcome everybody and that's not a bad thing! Service could've been better though. Waitress didn't look too happy.. Gotta smile for 5 stars."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I think the food tastes great.....Weeelllll, except for the Okami brand-like sushi.  But all the cooked food was great.  Especially the steamed sea bass.  On flavor, this place should be 4 star.  But when you're flushing said food down the caballero's ivory throne less than 5 minutes after you tap out, you have to wonder about stuff..."}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times and it still hasn't dissatisfied me. The food is good, always the same quality--between good and great, never something amazing. Service is good and recently they've been opening a little earlier than 11. Sushi is decent, never got problems with it. 

One star off for the food and service just being good, not spectacular.
Another star off for lacking in some areas. Deserts and fruits are their weak points--and I love deserts! 

Go here if you just want a no BS asian buffet. Good all around, but not great at anything.

EDIT: I've been here for dinner. Not exactly worth the extra $$$ for the dinner service, but they do have different dishes. The coconut chicken (which is the \"leftovers\" bits of the chicken (skin, tendons, scraps) at lunch) turns to coconut shrimp, they add in some seafood, and the choppy tri-tip mix."}
{"text":"The consensus with these reviews align with my evaluation. I'll skip the lengthy play by play and state that while the food is delicious Asian fare at an affordable price, the cleanliness & food handling is abhorrent. I'm astonished that the Health District hasn't hammered this place with violations and closed operations. Service is sub par at best. Strongly consider your health & patronize any of the other restaurants  nearby."}
{"text":"Large selection of seafood. Delicious sushi. Pleased that children under 4 years eat for free. )"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese buffet.  Would definitely go again if I lived near this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food here is great for the price especially for dinner. Used to come here a lot. My only real complaint is on the customer service. The waitresses are very pushy when it comes time to pay the bill. They slip you the check in the right middle of your meal and expect you to pay up immediately (at least make you feel that way since they seem to hover near/around your table taking short glances to see if you have placed the payment). While that part is sort of annoying, the last straw was when the waitress started demanding her tip. Not to bring race into it but it is usually the restaurants with Asian decent that seem to believe that tip is mandatory. (Note: I am Asian myself relax). My suggestion for improvement is to take the payment in full as you enter, or when you leave. It feels rude when your meal is interrupted for payment. While that part can be ignored, at least don't try and force your customers to pay up the second you drop the bill at the table."}
{"text":"Very good price performance. Clean environment. Food well prepared. Surprised by the menu when come in with 12.99 thanksgiving holiday menu. Worthy the drive from the strip to here."}
{"text":"Awful food and atmosphere. Cheap price. You get what you pay for I guess. Waiters & hostess don't bother taking to you much at all."}
{"text":"Krazy buffet is crazy good! 

I am not a huge fan of buffet settings, because to me, the items are usually added on to the old items sitting there for god knows how long!

The Krazy buffet on the other hand was delicious. They had a nice unique variety of flavorful dishes to choose from for $10 per person.  Probably the best $10 i have ever spent at a restaurant.  Their items were fresh and and the customer service was great! (5 stars) 

I discovered this place across the street from my place of work and tried it out with a few co-workers.  They had a pretty decent self serve sushi bar.  Seafood was fresh and that is all that really matters to me when it comes to sushi.  

Let's just say i liked this place so much that i wanted to make sure they were consistent with their food service.  They are consistent every time!

Great place to go on an empty stomach and certainly the place to go to on a dine-in budget."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place if you enjoy good food !  I am married to a Japanese woman and I know great Asian food....and this aint even close to being called food. When you have to ask what something is supposed to be.....don't eat it.  The shrimp was  at room tempature ...the egg rolls were mushy and the orange chicken wasn't even close to being as good as Panda Express. Within an hour I was breaking out in a cold sweat and was having problems keeping the stuff (can't and won't call it food ) down.  Save your money and go to Buffet @ Asia ! A lot better tasting food there !"}
{"text":"It's a 12.99 buffet....... what else is needed. 

The best part was the Mongolian Grill.

Be warned that the seafood (oysters) was suspect and 2 people in party paid the price by being really sick afterwards"}
{"text":"Krazy buffet was horrible the food was bad wouldn't recommend and the bathrooms were filthy"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday at 7p.m. most of the food was cold and old. Even though they close at 9:30 p.m. 
The only fresh and hot item was the soup on wich I give them 1 Star. When I brought it to the waitress attention, she told her Supervisor. I was yelled at,  totally uncalled for, that is no way of treating a customer. $12.99 for the worst dinner ever!!
Never coming back nor recommending this place."}
{"text":"$8 a plate for lunch gets you an all you can eat Chinese food at Krazy Buffet. $8 a plate for lunch at Panda Express gets you a limited imitation of Chinese food. So this place is great. I didn't like my waitress though, rude and pushy, when she refills my drink she does it so aggressively like okaaaay. When I say thank you not even a \"your welcome\". Most of the customers money that eats there goes to there paycheck so I didn't at least get a thank you. Its okay though because it felt great when I was done and when I didn't tip her. But either then that its all good."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!!!! This place may have an employee stealing credit card information I went to lunch there on Wednesday. By Friday my credit card was shut down for questionable transactions. There was over $1000. In charges attempted all in the same shipping  center as this place. That is the only place I used my card between lunch and Friday night when I found out my card was blocked, thank God my bank shut it down after a few transactions. I had my card so didn't even know until I tried to use it Friday. Someone is taking the info and then making duplicate cards. If you like the food here then just pay cash or bring your card to counter yourself. Lesson learned.

UPDATE:  I went to talk to the manager to let him know he may have a problem.  He assured me all his employee are long time employees and the cashier is his sister.  He pulled up the security footage, I have to say quite impressed with all the cameras and how clear.  We watched it about 10 times together.  I didn't see any thing weird.  There is a few questionable things but none enough to say it was the waitress.  I still believe the breach started at this facility but they may have a skimmer on their machine they don't know about or whomever got my card info is very good.  I would still be careful if you eat here, check your card just in case."}
{"text":"Food is good but the variety is lacking for what I like to have , since this location is
very west for myself I dont see too many trips for lunch anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been there for both lunch (at only $8.75), and dinner (at only $12.75). I actually liked some of the sushi selections, but hate that they put ham in their fried rice (kinda gross), they do have other food selections that are pretty decent though. For dinner, which starts at 4pm, they add crab legs & oysters... Just be sure to bring your patience with you because some of the servers dont understand english, are kinda rude, and it gets so packed with people who bring their little kids, and let them run around unattended while yelling and screaming, as if the buffet was a personal playground. Other than that, yeah, the place is okay."}
{"text":"Cheap in every aspect except the cost! Will never return. Bleh."}
{"text":"I think it's kind of an average, run-of-the-mill Asian buffet.

Unlike most other buffets, drinks are not included in the initial price. And you pay your bill at the end of your meal, not before. But service is pretty good - dirty/empty dishes are quickly whisked away and drinks are promptly re-filled.

As for the food, there are a few standouts. The wontons were excellent, and almost tasted homemade. Most of the food were full of oil, but it's to be expected at a buffet. Soups were mostly forgettable though.

Dessert and fruit section were pretty vast. The fruits here actually looked and tasted fresh. And there's your standard chinese buffet desserts like soft serve ice cream, almond cookies, macaroons, cake, etc.

I wouldn't drive out of the way to come here, but it's good for a cheap filling meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"good price, goods selection.  $8 buffet is what you get. No frills or perks but its good for the regular 'person'  that doesn't have many complaints about food and aren't those picky eaters throwing around fancy fake diets and gluten-free BS. its food fuel as stated in a previous post. 
you want a great authentic chinese buffet for a great deal gtfo of here and goto CHINA... if you want good chinese buffet for food. come here. Theres also a 10% off coupon online and also 15% on weekdays late lunch"}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal. Flavors in every bite. They have all the dishes you look for. 

Price is so, so cheap. Put this food on fancier plates, on the strip and it would be $18+ per plate imho. 

Service was prompt and consistent though it may have lacked little cheer. 

Music was modern though a bit too quite. Would have liked it much louder. 

Decor was dated and lacking but the facility was well maintained and clean. I felt safe eating the food and was still happy days later. 

I give them five stars because at the price point I think if there were six I would do six. The buffet just down the street wants $18 a person."}
{"text":"Food here is ok . Nothing  impressive . But  u cant go wrong with $12.50 buffet dinner where u can have oyster , snow crab legs , sushi and soup."}
{"text":"Just a few min of the strip for half the price.. going to look up this place again once we return. Typical China buffet but good service good food."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. This was my first time here and I thought it was pretty good. There was a nice selection and the price was affordable. This place is better and cleaner then other Asian buffets I've been at. The servers did a good job. Remember, it's a buffet and not a gourmet restaurant."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews I was excited to try this place. When I got there I got a bad feeling I wasnt going to like it. The service was horrible. The girl at the front was on her phone as she sat us down. She didnt even greet us. The food was horrible. Hurt my stomach for two days. Our waitress was concerened more about talking to her co worker then helping us out. Will never go again. Total fail."}
{"text":"This place is dirty. I would not come here again. Some of their seafood looked like it might make me sick later...so I didn't eat it. The seafood did smell. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Seafood tastes questionable. Most of the food is bland and had been sitting too long. Buffet area is not kept clean enough and sneeze guards are insufficient. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Definitely will come here again next time we visit Vegas. For the price, lunch or dinner, the quality of the food is outstanding. It is comparable with what we would have to pay in LA $25+ buffet. We regretted so much that we went to Rio world carnival buffet and The Buffet at Bellagio where we forked up $26+ per person for less than mediocre quality food before finding this place. We will never go to these two buffets again. Wow, we are so happy for our lunch here that we came back again four days later for dinner. Service is good. Even we don't expect to eat lobsters and top grade sashimi here, but for $8.75 and $12.xx, hay, for pretty good quality food, can't beat that price. Please keep it open until we come back to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Really good food at a great price. I recommend going there after 4pm because that's when they put out the majority of the seafood and it's really worth the couple extra dollars. Highly recommended!"}

{"text":"It's a buffet on west Sahara so I am not expecting anything special. We ate here on a Sunday and they had crab legs, shrimp and clams. No king crab legs here but for the price ...$13 per person is not bad whatsoever. It's crowded and can get chaotic. I just attacked the crab and some Chinese Favorites. I'm not impressed but not disappointed. I think it's a good deal."}

Driving around and found this place
Ate here 2x ( Lunch + Dinner)
Food was fresh + Tasty
Sushi was great for the price
Shrimp OK but about the same as other buffets
Sesame balls were lite and great
For desert they had a coffee taramisu which was rather good"}
{"text":"This restaurant is Krazy, like their name. So many food to choose, and they are also tasty and it's only $12.99 (dinner), Fresh oyster and sushi is my favorite, I had at least dozen oyster. Which will cost me more than $12.99 if I went to the other restaurant. So those people out there who loves oyster, just go for it lol."}
{"text":"Got seated as soon as we came in, service lady was nice, sat down and the table was a little slippery. So many variety of good food (Chinese, Japanese etc..) Loved the fruit section, they even had Lychee and Mandarin orange  I heard that you can also have the chef cook you a meal. This place is great, I loved it. Definitely recommending to family & friends. 4 stars for these guys!"}
{"text":"In general very good buffet for the price..nice little sushi bar ..crab legs and such. I highly recommend if u like Chinese  buffet .."}
{"text":"Me and Shiny get to Vegas fairly regularly. Not as often as we should, and not in the hi-roller fashion that you might imagine.

Take this last visit, for instance. Random women's hockey game (go SF Sirens!) and the family love of buffets. Thankfully we ended up at a non-strip buffet (those are nice, but a bit much for just regular eats).

Krazy Buffet--with a name like that, I was instantly sorry I forgot my camera and phone. But the food proved to be decent, fresh (lotsa ppl = plenty of turnover on the food), and sucha deal! At $7 for lunch (less for the folks, since they're on the AARP train), we were able to nab the bill and look like good kids, without much strain on the wallet.

Everything I had was pretty good. Pretty standard Chinese fare, with a bit of sushi as well. Not too greasy or heavy. I'd go back next time, except there's a million other places to try!"}
{"text":"A bit of a hit or miss lately. Prices are average for a buffet and the selection is pretty good. The food quality is just not always up to par. I once complained to the hostess about the food not being properly cooked through and they argued with me that it was fine. I like this place but I have not returned since this incident. I hope they can clean up their act and maybe i will return.."}

{"text":"My first review on Yelp ever. I registered this account to tell people DO NOT GO TO THIS BUFFETT! My parents, my wife and kid and myself all had diarrhea after lunch. I called the manager and with very bad attitude, he didn't apologized for what happened and questioned me why there were no others called him about this issue but me. Excuse me? WTF! Just don't go! I had bad restaurants experience but I was too lazy to wrote reviews but not this time! I am so angry! Curse them! XXX"}
{"text":"Great price for a decent size establishment, selective food was not very tremendous  to eat seeing seems like it has been out for more than a odd amount of hours, the coconut chicken was greatly delicious and great. The fried plantano  was wonderful, meatball screwer  were cold and dry 
Our waiter was well mannered and he was atentative and he was quick with the many other tables around him I appreciated his assistance when I needed a highchair clean establishment and great customer service over all"}
{"text":"Clean facility, staff was warm and inviting, food was phenomenal.  Loved the all you can eat sushi (tips recommended).  Very enjoyable experience. Close to home and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Staff was awesome, everyone was so helpful. Wish there was more of a variety of food choices. But it was ok. I would come back for a quick meal."}
{"text":"My first time going here was, overall, a pretty good experience. I went for lunch and for $11 dollars per person it was a good deal. 

The Service - I was greeted and seated immediately. My cup never got past halfway before the server asked if I wanted a refill. It seemed as though they had a lot of servers on hand. 

The Food - The food was what anyone would expect at a decent buffet. The sushi tasted pretty good for buffet sushi, it seemed to be very fresh. The dim sum and the coconut chicken were good. My favorite thing of all was the Mongolian BBQ. I would come back just for the BBQ. 

Overall it is worth the money for a buffet I would recommend it, but, don't expect gourmet food from any buffet."}

I will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese Buffet.
Of course it's not the best quality Chinese food, it is a BUFFET. One thing that's been really bugging me about Yelp lately is how so many people compare buffet food to restaurant food, which just isn't fair as buffets work on a totally different level. /Ramble.
Anyways, the Krazy Buffet is definitely one of the better Chinese buffets. I loved the spot Penda's on Spring Mountain@Rainbow (It closed recently. R.I.P.), but that was pretty much hangover/stoner food, and I'm still upset over the $11.00 I wasted at New China. Krazy Buffet on the other hand is always fresh and good quality. There's quite a bit more seafood than usual to be found here, however, the seafood items are ironically the least fresh of all the offerings in the buffet. The sushi ain't half bad though. 
The service is decent enough, my drink was never empty. 
They also offer french fries and garlic bread. That gave me some interesting ideas to say the least, since Chinese food is something I love to improvise with. 
Don't come here expecting it to be on par with the best Chinese restaurants or takeout places, and trust me, you'll love it."}
{"text":"For the price, the food and service is excellent.   Building and men's restroom need work or I would give it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Took the family here today for lunch buffet. Very good food for the price and for the fact that's it's a buffet. Will definitely be back to try again."}
{"text":"Daughter dragged me here. One of those places I drive by and don't see every day. I'm not a foodie but my daughter thinks this place is \"the bomb!\" She says to give it 5 stars. She works in a restaurant so I'll buy it. I'm supposed to say that the green beans are to die for and the sushi is \"all that!\" I'm a steak and shrimp kinda guy so I'm a little out of my element. Good eats though. Wifey loves it so I guess I'm coming back. Look for future check ins."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!!
I should have been forewarned by state of disrepair at the entrance and ladies room( plus not clean).

Lots  of loud children. Food  mediocre in taste and selection.The 
only saving grace was we got 15% off of the bill for checking in with yelp.

We ate lunch on a Friday at 11:00."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. My credit card information was compromised and someone used it in other businesses in that area. I have my card. So they copied it. So besides not having a good meal there, they have caused choas in my life, now trying to fix this financial mess. Staff had to be involved. :("}
{"text":"I cant hate and I was gonna hate Chinese buffets usually not that great, BUT this place is hands down bomb.com especially for the price, only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the crab meat had very little crab meat in it, was a pain to eat but delicious it was and all you can eat so yea can't complain. Almost everything was the bomb though nothing cold, and the fried bread with sugar on it ummmm lets just say you need a plate by itself for that one."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food! Great price! Fast service. Really love it here. Rice is fluffy. Noodles arent soggy. Meat is fresh & full of flavor. Ayce crab legs. Mongolian bbq & sushi. We came at 7pm so nothing looked like it was sitting out. It was all hot & new."}
{"text":"Girl kept giving us diet drinks.....not sure if it was a hint or what but it got annoying!  Haha.  The service really just isn't good /:"}
{"text":"Gross! Food was horrible and this place was dirty! To top it off I had a 10% off coupon for my entire bill & they didn't even do that right! I was very disappointed and even thought the lunch buffet was $8.99 it wasn't worth it for what we ate! Gross & will never be back!"}
{"text":"The food are below average, The Men Owner has really bad moral to doing business. we have party of 11 people. they stopping us to getting crab leg when we getting the second plate of Crab leg. Is it really all you can eat? at the end of the dinner, they sneak into your back charge me $100 tip on my credit card. we already gave $110 tip cash even we are not happy they don't allow us to get more crab. this is really bad business in Las Vegas. There are lot of Chinese buffet like a Asian buffet on Rainbow and Sahara."}
{"text":"Every time I come here,  the food is always good and the place is clean.  Easy place to go to for a cheap Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"After hiking at Red Rock Canyon, we were famished. Our options were eat at Wicked Spoon, or eat somewhere cheap and fast off of the strip. Since we were planning for the $90 Sterling brunch the next day, we decided against two pricey buffets back to back. A quick Yelp search revealed that this was the closest Chinese buffet. Lunch prices went until 4, although note lunch does not include crab. Took about 13 min from Red Rock Canyon.

Overall, very impressed with the food and service given the very reasonable prices. The food is what you would typically expect at a Chinese buffet. A lot of Chinese dishes, soups, sushi bar, some American items such as pizza, salad/fruit bar, dessert and soft serve ice cream. Note that this place did not have the Mongolian BBQ station that some Chinese buffet places have. Not premium food and can't compare with the nicer buffet in Vegas, but at around $11 each after tax and tip we were all impressed.

Plus the service was friendly and quick, and bathrooms were clean. Great find!"}
{"text":"I love this place, Everything is fresh, the restaurant is clean, and the prices are reasonable. I only wish they had more variety on the sushi, but I would definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"The food is good and unusual. They have pizza and French fries but no Mac and cheese. I expect every buffet to come with Mac and cheese even if it's a Chinese buffet. The dessert selection isn't great and you can tell that they don't rotate them out very often. The actual food is very good and authentic."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in restaurant looked very clean and staff was very friendly. Food was delicious and I liked how  we got refills right away. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"It's decent. My go-to place whenever I feel like pigging out. 

I've been here so many times I can tell you what they are serving for lunch and dinner.

It's the same thing every day. 

My only complain is sometimes the place gets too busy and it gets dirty. One place, our table smelled like fish and I completely lost my appetite. 

Also, the servers get so occupied, they can't really refill my water and give me enough tissue LOL gets me frustrated and wonder why they can't just give it us as soon as we are seated. No one really survives a buffet with one anyways."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????

There are lots of options on these tasty food, and the waitress served us very well, will come back again when we visit Las Vegas next time."}
{"text":"Decent buffet- it's not on the Strip, so don't expect five star quality, but it's a decent option for a large selection that isn't packed with mediocre dishes of low quality.

Sushi selection is large- about 8 different rolls with at least one vegetarian and one fried option, but most are variations of Philadelphia and California rolls. Primary fish used are crab and spicy tuna, lots of avocado in use here but in one roll it had more of a guacamole flavor to it. Not the best quality fish, but large selection for a price under what you'd usually spend on a single roll at an actual sushi restaurant.

Soups are fresh, won ton was good but broth was a bit too oily for my liking. Fish used in cooked dishes (baked salmon, grilled seabass, seafood delight) was underseasoned and over cooked.

Other items were decent: salad bar and dessert area had the usual choices, plus an octopus salad that had way too much jalapeno for my liking. Chicken wings were fried but tasted fresh. Chinese options weren't overly Americanized or greasy: beef and broccoli, a sad-looking lo mein, several tofu options.

Service was fine, food was fairly fresh and staff were all over the place wiping spills and clearing tables. Was surprised to go here solo and get seated at a booth.
Lunch price is $8.96 including tax, tipped cash."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best Chinese buffets
I have been to in Las Vegas. The price is affordable
They have a nice selection of food and sushi. My 
Only wish is that they had better deserts to choose
From they really fall short in that area. The servers
Are quick to clear your plates so you don't have to
Worry about a bunch of plates on your table while you
Eat and they keep on top of making sure your drink
Is full. The only thing I saw there I didn't like was when
we were leaving the manager was debating with a 
customer who used a coupon for 10 people she verified
on the phone she could use it, gave it to the cashier 
when they left and the cashier did not apply it. The customer
came back in when she noticed they didn't apply coupon
and the guy who was dealing with the issue told her 
she should have made sure they applied the coupon before 
she left and that he remembered talking to her on the 
phone and that she had the coupon. To me that is terrible
customer service it should not be her responsibility to 
make sure they do their jobs right and she should not have
to debate on them fixing it. If you knew she had a coupon, and
it was not applied how hard is it to fix the problem. I am not
sure how it ended because we left but I was not impressed
With the type of customer service I was seeing."}
{"text":"Hot food was hot. Cold food was cold. Many choices crab legs were good. Chicken wings had a lot of meat. All food that was tried had very good taste. Prices were very good. They have a 10% off coupons on there web site. Rest rooms were clean and free of odor.  Dinner was 12.99 before coupon."}
{"text":"You know what, this place is OK. We are staying on the strip and an older lady wants to go here to eat. What!?! There's a gazillion buffets on or near the strip and they wanna go 25 min out of town? Must be special I thought.

I get there and its an Asian/Chinese buffet. Not impressed. Even the decor was non descript. I was dreading eating there but I did it for my aunt. Pleasantly surprised, the food was actually OK. Nothing special but there's the standard fare. I was surprised there was honey shrimp, crabs, and prawns as the higher cost items. Service was fine. 

Mostly locals eating here. The best thing about this place that bumped it to 3 stars is the just under $13 price tag for dinner. I am not sure how they make money.

Not worth the drive but if you're in the area (maybe to visit the ridiculous number of car dealerships) then hit this place up."}
{"text":"Great Experience.  Food Fresh and Yummy.  Clean tables and seating.  Prompt waiters."}
{"text":"They replaced the food right as they saw I w as s going for it so that was awesome.  They have a Mongolian bbq station and a lot of offerings in general.  I also liked their signs that said don't take more than you can actually eat."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a month or so and have never had a bad meal. Living in buffet town i think a lot of people compare this to casino buffets but they shouldn't. As the name may suggest it's Asian fare complete with sushi but it also has seafood like crab legs and shrimp. Everything is fresh and replaced often. I really enjoy the pot stickers and chicken on a stick  and as much broccoli as I can stuff. Dessert is OK but not a rave. It seems to be busy always, or at least when we go, Since the price doesn't include drinks like casino buffets it isn't the cheapest but it is well in line with non mega casino buffets and well worth the trip since you don't have to go in a casino and possibly get lured  into a gamblethon."}
{"text":"Place is disgusting filthy and the food sucks trust me if you care at all what you eat this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"I came to crazy buffet with my brother when he visited me. I was kind of amazed at the difference typeof food they had. The food is pretty decent and it tasted pretty good too as well. The price was not that bad. They did have sushi which was pretty good. They had different types of food they even have food that was good for little kids and adults as well. The tables for me was kind of close to each other but it was not to the point where you're bumping into everyone. The waiters were very friendly and also very helpful at times. I like coming here for the fact that they did not rush you to leave like other buffets I've been to. We had a good time we ate and we were full when we left. I would come here again next time I have a family member over. I also would like to tell you kids who are younger then three eat free which is great for us since we do have a two-year-old."}
{"text":"The BBQ area cooked up one of the buffet meals I ever had! It was beef with red & green peppers, broccoli, mushrooms, garlic, & hot chili sauce. Came out outstanding!

Other than that, a pretty good selection. It is not the biggest buffet you'll ever see. However, they did have sea bass as well as spicy octopus. Neither of those I would ever expect to see on a lunch buffet.

The desserts were a tad lackluster. I was used to Pacific Buffet where you can have ice cream served in a bowl. Personally, I do not care for vanilla swirl soft serve. Ended up going to Golden Spoon after eating to take care of the frozen dessert craving.

All in all, a solid price for a fairly good lunch buffet. The best in town? Not too sure on that - but a great value."}
{"text":"It's been over three years since I've eaten here and it's still a great buffet. I would have kept on coming here, but my wife and the rest of the family hated eating here. I guess it's because we ate here all the time back then. Well, for my birthday I told them I wanted to eat here, while my wife's mother also said she wanted to eat here again, so they reluctantly agreed. And what a change of heart they all had, my family had nothing but praise for this place, from the server, to the food and price, everything was great. It's still a great asian buffet after all these years."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a strong 3 because the food was pretty good, they had a good variety, but the food was warm at best towards the cool side. The prices they charged for what you got was very good. It almost hurts to give it a 3 but when there's meat and chicken involved, the food rule is 40/140. Otherwise you have to worry about bacteria and food poisoning. Cold food no warmer than 40 degrees. Hot food no cooler than 140.I am excited that we did NOT GET SICK. If the food was hot it would have been an honest easy 5 star."}
{"text":"The food is actually really decent here. One star though for terrible customer service. The waitress rarely came by. Our plates were starting to stack up and our drinks were empty without being refilled for long periods of time. Because of that we did not give tip. The waitress had the nerve to demand tip in the end which even made things worse. We declined to give her tip. As we were leaving the restaurant we can hear her say out all sorts of profanity while pretty much slamming all the dishes together as she cleaned up. Horrible person. I've experienced this in two other restaurants in town as well. One restaurant even tried to charge me tip before I even sat down. I believe tip is earned, not required."}
{"text":"For the mere price of $12.95 I can not get enough of the crab legs, fried crab, pepper shrimp, sushi, broccoli dish, steak, and soup....it's all so good and no MSG!"}
{"text":"I sing with in harmony with Dionne Warwick ... walk on by.

In my seemingly never-ending quest for a high-quality, non-casino, AYCE Chinese buffet somewhere in the Valley, I drifted in here while on West Sahara on business with one of my jewelers. 

This is pretty bland food-as-fuel, nothing more. 

The waitress was polite and her service was adequately attentive.

The buffet offered an entire steamer-station full of just seafood choices. For-real, not-imitation, crab legs was the clear draw, but there were various other, somewhat odd, choices such as stuffed mussels. I avoided all of that, until the venue 'earned my trust,' so to speak. Except I did slightly sample the salt&pepper calamari. Meh.

And while there were a lot of choices, the buffet seemed somewhat light on the traditional entrees one might expect to find in such a place. You know, the usual suspects: Beef w/ Broccoli, Kung Pao chicken, et. al. Just not many of those guys in the house.

So, in the end, I stuck close to the soups, the teriyaki chicken-on-the-really-pointy-stick, the crab Rangoon, egg rolls, lo mein noodles and such. Removing the dried-up, baked-on chicken from the stick was dangerous enough to be a mission for Special Forces. There wasn't a single item I could describe as desirable enough to want to return. 

Again, in a word, bland.

And I wasn't entirely surprised that my tummy was somewhat queasy for at least a couple of days afterwards. And every time it groaned, I heard it saying 'sayonara' to this joint for sure.

I shouda guessed. I suppose I was KRAZY to go in there in the first place. The quest continues."}
{"text":"This has become the best Chinese buffet for my family.  Lunch prices are good. The food is constantly changed out/refilled with fresh pans.  The staff attendance is rediculous. They're busing and refilling glasses like crazy EVERY TIME.  The sushi bar is always fresh from my experience unlike other locations were the rice dries out. Pleanty of seating. Check for yourself!"}
{"text":"Not my fist visit by the way... 
Also offer seafood nite

Come one come all, bring your family, friends and co-workers.

{"text":"I had a feeling of what to expect so I am not completely disappointed. I personally prefer Buffet Asia which are similar but a better spread of food options.  They definitely spent more time on the decor  than their buffet display. A cheapy Chinese Buffet is right!"}
{"text":"We went there on Wednesday night for dinner.  It's a very typical asian buffet set-up. The selection was below average. We were looking for the fresh oyster everybody talked about, and they were a no-show. We felt gypped. The check for 2 including tip was $30 which I can get some good chinese food from a nearby restaurant seem a little high."}
{"text":"I was here at 5pm today 4/3/16 Most of the food was just warm even the egg drop soup was only warm,but the main reason for going for diner are the crab legs which I waited 10 mins for the refill to come out they were COLD and this is what you pay extra for.I told the mgr and he said the steamer under the crab legs was hot maybe so  I told him but the crab legs are COLD he could care less and suggested I didn't know what I was talking about.I have been a regular here for the last 5 years.But no more !!!!Buffet Asia you have just gotten a new customer."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet for the price.  Food is great and the variety is endless.  Sushi, crabs legs, chicken wings, egg flower soup, dessert.  All for $14.99."}
{"text":"I do like this place. But they upped the price a couple of times. I enjoy their mayo shrimp. Its pretty tasty. They also have crab legs. They arent the meatiest but they will suffice if you are willing to work for it. My wife and I would always wait for the coupons in the mail for this place."}
{"text":"Food is very average. My husband got really sick after our last visit. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Lunch is what I'm reviewing. It's one of the best deals in town. You won't find better quality for the price you pay. It's like 7 bucks, but it tastes like 10 or 15. If you want the best chinese in town, go pay 30 bucks somewhere else. If you want quality food, at an amazing price, go to Krazy Buffet!"}
{"text":"i go with my friend ,there has lots seafood on dinner time,my friend love it,and we got  good servise..."}
{"text":"This was the first buffet i ever tried upon first arriving to Vegas several weeks ago, I must say after visiting several others within the area; Krazy on Rainbow is hands down my favorite. Fresh Seafood, a plethora of entrees and desserts and they even have a sushi session with a chef on stand-by ready to cook you whatever you need. What i appreciate the most is the cleanliness and customer-service, The staff doesn't rush you to finish eating etc. they're definitely worth a second or third visit.

One small note id like to say is that the crab-legs are extremely thin and roughly have no meat in them, I wouldn't recommend them - then again would you expect them to serve unlimited jumbo crab-legs for $12.99?"}
{"text":"Love this place!
The food quality seems to be very nice. 
Their shrimp is amazing! There is almost never any waiting time to get fresh food, once something runs out, they fill it up almost instantaneously, which is very important for a good buffet experience!
Very large variety of foods, and drinks! 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For an Asian buffet, it's pretty on par with what you'd expect, mediocre fried bits of God knows what plus the occasional decent chicken or pork dish. However, if everything is fried which I understand is a simple effective way of cooking about-to-expire seafood and meat, please dear god change out the oil once in a while. Every single thing tasted like shrimp. I put my fork down, praying for everyone around me to be done. They must have been going insane from the heat outside, for they were loving every morsel of food even pirates might turn down on a deserted island. When desert was acquired what seemed like days later, I was not so pleasantly surprised to find the fried puff pastries and assorted fried deserts all tastes like shrimp! They really need to get up to par with the changing of the oil weekly, plus frying different foods in different friers. Not to mention I was extremely sick the rest of the day. Simply creating a schedule of maintenance and temp logs would alleviate many of their problems. Sheer laziness is not excuse to hawk crappy food and call it a buffet."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great!!! A lot of variety. The crab legs are the best. Great service."}
{"text":"Better than similar ones for the price but the food was still subpar. Sushi wasn't fresh. Service was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Service was great but the food was not as good as the other Krazy Buffet on Sahara. Overall it was an ok experience but I would rather drive the extra 15 min to go to the other Krazy Buffet than this one."}
{"text":"When in North Vegas, and we want a lot of food, my mom, my brother, and I eat here. 

My doc, a very skinny dude. says going to a buffet might make you balloon in weight if you if you can't control your appetite. He doesn't recommend them.  Easy for him to say. But if you love unlimited crab at dinner time - along with Korean BBQ and the usual accompaniments, you ought to try this place. But I have a few things to warn you about. First, some of my friends would think this is dirty and they would not come here. I think it's clean enough, though the bathrooms would gross out a clean freak.  I always bring my own alcohol wipes.  Second, the parking is horrible at night, esp. the weekend.  Third, there might be a wait at dinner time.  The wait is...Krazy long.

 The lunch price is $8.29 per person last I checked. .At dinner the price is $12.99,which includes the aforementioned unlimited crab. The piles of crab creates pigs out of mere mortals.  Soft drinks are extra. The clientele is probably mostly working class families with a few business people.  Not a single guy was wearing a tie.  There were lots of kids of all ages,The tables are close together, so you'll feel cozy and hear all kinds of interesting conversations and arguments. I've seen people \"normal people' but in my last trip there, you could see folks dressed like Beverly Hillbillies  and tattooed grannies.  The people watching is Krazy cool.

The servers are very good about picking up dirty places and refilling water and sodas. Surprisingly, with all that food in the place, the ones that were there were skinnier than my doc. What, they don't eat this food?  Is it Krazy bad? No, I think they hustle the whole time.

I love the various ways shrimp are served, and the vegetable options.  Actually, my two favorite things are the homemade donuts when they are still warm, and the fried platanos. Even Mexican and Filipino restaurants I go to can't make it this sweet and gooey soft, Thank God for the double doors upon exit. waddle waddle..."}
{"text":"Are you people kidding me? The place should be shut down! Unsafe tempretures on the food,nothing was hot.Homeless people in clear view of my table bumming cigs off anyone entering the place. They are also pushy when they bring your bill half way through your meal. They seemed upset that we used credit instead of cash. I've noticed that many asian shops dont like that. Bottom line is stay away from any restaurants that are located in Wall Mart shopping centers."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly good.  I would go back if we lived around here. Lunch was a great deal at $8.79. Dinner items came out while we were here and wow. Crab. Awesome deal at 12.99 for dinner. Staff was nice"}
{"text":"Very tasty Asian meals,His Chinese teahouse I like to recommend to you?And the service is also very good!"}
{"text":"If you want real Chinese food, go to a restaurant where it is frequented by local Chinese. Otherwise, a lot of these so-called All-You-Can- Eat Chinese restaurants have Americanized Chinese food selections. There's not much of those authentic Chinese food. Krazy Buffet is no exception... BUT it is patronized by many (not by Chinese) for their seafood selections like crab legs, oysters, mussels, clams, etc. The dessert section has a very few selections though but with a full stomach, I doubt if you still have a room to spare for that. Price is cheap, around $14 for a Sunday brunch and dinner. The waiting staff are very attentive. Lastly, you get 10-15% discount when you show them a Krazy Buffet discount coupon on your smart phone. No need to print it."}
{"text":"If you don't mind filling up on the cheap junk food while you wait for a sliver of the good stuff it's ok. Even my child had to wait for a single slice of pizza, and if you were not 1st or 2nd you were not getting any. 
20 minute wait for a single slice of pepperoni is ridiculous. 

What a huge disappointment this was!"}
{"text":"Two weeks ago a close friend took me here for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised. Lots of variety of food and pretty good quality. I did not give it 5 stars as the interior probably should be upgraded and fixed in some area, but I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Excellent food choices. Quick table service all the time. Great prices. Highly Recommended. Fun place for casual group gatherings, birthdays or just cause..."}
{"text":"I always go here for a quick and cheap dinner, usually with the parents. Pretty big place, lots of table and usually not a wait at all or even a long wait. We are usually offered drinks right away, the staff comes around and pick up the dirty plates very often which is very nice, and they are also pretty good with refilling the drinks. 

This Asian style buffet in my opinion is better than others such as Asia buffet. They have a bigger variety of food, they have shrimp cocktail and oysters, sushi, and a nice blend of meats and vegetable options. A pretty decent place for a cheap dinner.

UPDATE: Wrote this review right after I ate here... it is the next day and my brother threw up all night and I had bathroom issues all night. We are sure this is from the oysters... this is our first time eating the oysters from here and is the first time we experience any issues after eating here. Eat the other food...avoid the oysters!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time! The variety is very good, the food was all cooked well seasoned to perfection! If you like sushi? The variety will satisfy your taste buds! 
 The service was top notch! There were several wait staff all around, and I believe for all of the quality of food the price was more than fair!"}
{"text":"Don't go here after regular dinner hours... Everything was lukewarm and tasted as though it had been sitting for several hours. I'm pretty sure there were several health code violations. Will not return.

EDIT: For the past five days I have been extremely, violently ill. I'm placing the blame on Krazy Buffet. Holy crap DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"The customer service in this place needs improvement. The food was just ok. After reading reviews on this place my family and I decided to give it a try, just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This place has always been my go to for a cheap and quick meal. It's less than 10 bucks for lunch and they have a good amount of food. Don't expect amazing quality... after all it is a buffet! It can get quite busy during lunch hours, but I have never had trouble finding a seat. I always find myself going for the orange chicken as it isn't so bad! The sushi is what you would expect from buffet sushi sometimes the rice is a bit dry sometimes it is not. Give this place a try if you're lookin for something affordable to feed the whole fam! Krazy buffet because the price is krazy cheap"}
{"text":"went for Christmas.  pretty good, light on beef but has crab and oysters.  the shrimp are too hard to peel to really enjoy.  the cream puffs are great. Sushi and Mongoloian BBQ as well you get your 13 bucks worth."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet is loaded with fresh product and flavors.  They have a Big variety of Sushi and the crab legs are fresh and sweet.  Went there for Christmas dinner and have no regrets.  The Jalapeno Clams in broth are so good I couldn't get enough. The Chicken wings are very good and just adds to the value.  We only paid $12.99 for this meal and I would have paid $30.00 easy.  All the other Items are prepared with Love and you can taste the difference.  Everything was good and we all know that's hard to find.  And by the way the service is fast and friendly, you will never have to wait on any item that runs out."}
{"text":"The food here was very fresh and tasty. We came here on a weekday night at 8:30pm and they still had quiet a lot of tables still eating. 

Everything we had was super tasty. I personally really liked the fried crabs, crab legs, beef cubes, claims and the mussels they had. The seafood was very good quality and fresh. And for the price, it just doesn't get any better. 

Service was decent. There was no ambiance at all. Just a Chinese restaurant. 

Overall, I would definitely come back here if I was in the area. This place offers tons of seafood that were tasty and fresh and for $11.99, all you can eat, you just can't complaint."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, especially for the price.  I always come here with my family when I visit.  Lots of choices including crab legs, oysters, clams, salt and pepper crab, sushi,... they also have a \"bbq\" station where you have noodles prepared for you with whatever you like added in.  I don't get why this place has awful reviews.  Maybe the service is a little slow at times?  But it is a buffet with yummy food at very affordable prices.  There really isn't much room for complaining if you ask me."}
{"text":"Its cold food, you must dig to the bottom to get hot food . Dont come. I suggest pf changs where you know its hot. They tower the fiod in the tray which makes it cold. Ok if you just each sushi."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad at all. They had plantains that my wife loved so that was a good bonus. The food tasted good. Could be a little more variety but over all I liked it a lot."}
{"text":"If you have been to any other cheap Chinese buffet, this place is very similar. I've been here twice now, the first time was around 8pm and my most recent visit was around 2. They are open 7 days a week from 11a-9:30p. Lunch is served Mon-Fri only. I would say the earlier you get here, the better. When I went at 8pm, the food was not being turned over as there were not many diners. When I went earlier in the day, the food was being made faster and things were fresher. 

So this buffet has your standard Americanized Chinese food, as well as sushi and dessert. A lot of the items on the buffet are fried, and holy sodium Batman, drowning in msg. The items were a hit or miss. Some of them were cold and flavorless, others were hot and flavorless. Some actually tasted good and were at the correct temperature! 

Things I enjoyed
Miso soup
Potstickers
Cream cheese rangoon
House beef 
Coconut chicken

They had some good desserts, almond cookies (my fav), and a really delicious coffee flavored cake and mousse. Price for adult dinner is $12.99, which does not include a drink. But if you go to their website they have coupons so you can get 10-15% off depending on the meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food but they are liars...on Sunday they are multiply the price without notice!!!!!"}
{"text":"Took a sip of their Special Iced Lemon Water, I haven't felt the same since. Highly recommend getting this, very refreshing unless you're allergic to H2O."}
{"text":"At $13.99 on a saturday night for all you can eat boiled crab legs and chinese fried crabs. How can you go wrong? They even bring you a shell/bone plate when they realize you're about to go to town on the crabs! Awesome service! Dishes that were really good :

1) Did I mention the boiled and fried crabs?
2) Shrimp and asparagus, very tasty.
3) Hot and sour soup
4) Gai lan
5) Honey dew melons
6) Coffee/tiramisu mini cake

Dishes that were average:

1) Sushi options
2) pork buns
3) Some \"spicy\" chicken dish

Dishes that were below average:

1) beef and broccoli ..pretty bland
2) seabass ..this was disappointing and had a funny taste
3) pork dumplings ..also had a funny taste

Unfortunately I didn't really eat much other than crabs. Note there might be a wait depending on how big your group is. Looks like some people had been waiting for several minutes but somehow we got in within 2 mins with 2 adults, 1 kid, and 1 kid that required a booster."}
{"text":"Tripped over this restaurant last week. 5 of us and we all absolutely loved it. Real value for money. Under $11 for a large juice and all you can eat. Very large selection of all Asian favorites. Plus a big sushi bar and a decent number of desert choices. Very friendly service to top it off. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dont trust the commercial video, its not like that. The place needs to be cleaned and revamped. Food was not good too. Sorry."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, and wide selection. Mediocre customer service. I would definitely recommend for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"This place has rude staff and the quality of the food wasn't that great. The crab in the seafood delight is imitation. The place seems a little unsanitary. I wonder how long the food has been sitting out in the open. When my family was paying for the bill, the waitress didn' ask how many senior citizens we had for the senior citizen discount. We had to talk to the manager."}
{"text":"This is one of my Oma's \"hole in the wall\" places to go and we like it too! They have a pretty good selection overall and they continually replace the food. Been here twice now and it was great food both times!"}
{"text":"They really work hard and I appreciate that, but the food no fresh, even the fruits from yesterday. The restroom so bad!!! And the restaurant not very clean. The service when I ask sauce she told me go take by yourself and there is not enough for vegetarian people."}
{"text":"Another Asian themed buffet in Vegas...doesn't hurt if the food is alright to pretty good.  This Sahara location is conveniently located on the West Side of Las Vegas, just off South Summerlin on the hustle and bustle along the Sahara Strip of business galore.  If any of you have been to Buffet@Asia...you are pretty much getting the same perks if not better.  The atmosphere from the outside appearance is clean and fresh.  Once you get in through the doors, the array of food welcomes you.  It has been strategically well planned as far as layout goes. Spacious in both seating and food arrangements.  The place is surrounded by windows gathering natural light and makes it more welcoming than Buffet@Asia (if any of you have been there you will know what I mean)  

Price wise...it is a little cheaper than Buffet@Asia, but almost the same in price.  This is not your Todai or Makino's gourmet Asian Buffet, but you will have plenty of selection to choose which will be enough to satisfy the cravings.  I myself am a fan...who wouldn't mind going here every now and then.  If you are in the area...check it out.  It's more of a hit then a miss.  

Don't forget to try their Mochi Balls (sesame)  they are a great snack/dessert.  Nice and warm, light with a bit of sweetness.  Pretty good than most places. :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Very tasty. Good prices. Only complaint is that the restaurant looks a bit messy. Dirty floors and back kitchen looks terrible. Bathrooms are sometimes dirty. Toilet paper on floor, trash cans look a mess. But overall decent place because of the food. Been a customer for about 2 years and never have any major complaints other than these. If they put a little effort in cleaning up, would be a 5 !"}
{"text":"Worst buffet I've tried. The food didn't have flavor. Sushi was terrible. Will never eat here again. Don't know how this place stays open"}
{"text":"Really good food, crab legs and the hibachi is on point. All for a really good price."}
{"text":"I like the idea of being able to try many different dishes but this place is not worth it. You get what you pay for here. Everything tastes cheap/off. Atmosphere and cleanliness is not good. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Just a brief review of one of my local and often enjoyment resturaunts. 

The location is by no means subtle, easy to find, and the crowd varies depending on the days. Weekdays are a prime time since it's relatively calm, and the food is definitely abundant. Speaking about the food (Obviously?) It's absolutely phenomenal for the price you are paying, drink prices aside.

That was the good, now to the bad.

The food can often be, well very underdone. Given the price you pay, I wouldn't expect much further than that. The crab legs are really where it's at, so that's definitely where the value comes in to play. It's often a hit or miss, the crab can often smell rotten or somewhat decayed, given the obvious smell of ammonia, which is very strong at times. 

Unfortunately i did once receive a horrible case of food poisoning several hours after, which out me out of work for 3 days, and all I had was the crab legs then entire duration of my visit. That being said, I'd take care in cracking open that delicious crabmeat, by inspecting and smelling the meat prior to consuming.

On a other note, I'd stayaway from the Nigiri.

3 stars for the locality, often great food for the price, and the friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here with my family tonight.  We have been going here every time but tonight we went here it was so horrible.  The food was so horrible, no taste, no flavor it was just plain and bland... It was so disappoonting my family and i left their still hungry and had to end up goint some place else to eat dinner..."}
{"text":"The food here isn't going to win any Michelin stars, so let's be real. This is comfortingly adequate American-Chinese food cheapness for those extra hangry days when you can't decide if you want a California roll or some Kung Pao but want a lot of grub. My boyfriend and i come here every few months to pig out and it does the job. There are better places to get Chinese food or sushi or even crab legs, but they probably won't be as cheap for as many options. We mowed through 2-3 plates each and our entire meal was about $22 plus tip, less than we spend at most fast food joints. Nothing really stood out, but I like the opportunity to eat endless crab rangoons or salt and pepper shrimp."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great variety, including sushi crawfish, salads, bbq pork ribs, chowmein rice, fruits and much more . And the service was great , got drinks right away, and every time one of us finished a plate it was taken away right away. Went around 4 pm and it was a great time!"}
{"text":"FOOD: 3/5 
The variety of food was good. There was a lot of different Chinese foods, sushi, seafood, and desserts, so I couldn't complain. The soups were also really good. I was surprised by how many different dishes were offered. Let's just say, even though the quality wasn't AMAZING, I wasn't upset about it for the price I was paying for my meal. 

SERVICE: 3/5 
The service was pretty good here. They refilled waters as needed and came to check in on our large group (we had about nine people in total). However, I sometimes felt rushed by certain servers. The service wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't bad. I think they served us well overall. They also didn't charge us an automatic gratuity, which was surprising because it seems so customary now-a-days. 

AMBIANCE: 2.5/5 
The ambiance is fine. It is pretty mediocre and doesn't really add or negate from the dining experience as a whole. I wasn't super impressed with it overall, but it was good. I didn't think the place was extremely tidy or clean-feeling, but I still liked it. 

PRICE: 4/5 
For about $13.99 per person, there was a good variety of food to choose from. I can't complain. They are also running coupons in the newspapers and such in the area, so you can always use those! 

LOCATION: 4/5 
It is easy to find and there is quite a bit of parking. It is right on W Sahara and you can't miss it (unless you are going too fast)."}
{"text":"I didn't realize how much i loved this place till I moved to Utah (no AYCE crab legs here :-(). The food quality is pretty good but the real winner is their crab legs. The staff is usually prompt in refilling all the dishes including the crab legs. I usually peel the cold shrimps, crab legs, and use them as toppings on the average tasting sushi which then becomes amazing. Krazy Buffet also has the average AYCE dining price of around 10-12 dollars. Did I mention they have crab legs?"}
{"text":"took my parents to eat here cus my dad loves this place. the soy marinated fish was great today. the dude that usually serves us is always on top of it. 

they claim they dont use MSG. its written on their business card. 

i had two regular bowls of wonton soup. the first was so savory. i didnt think anything of it. the 2nd was so savory i kept wanting more. uh oh... sure enough an hour or so later i was getting super sleepy and started to get a bad headache. two typical symptoms of ingesting too much MSG. right now i have a very annoying headache thats at the back of my head.

most places that serve wonton soup is going to have a ton of msg in it. i used to eat this broth the street vendors in korea would sell. they would boil the fish cakes in the broth. i asked the lady what made it so savory. she said MSG. the wonton tastes the same. 

i cant help but bitch about false advertising. a lot of people dont realize how many products use MSG. soy sauce, sausages, ranch dressing, etc... 

i still like this place cus their sauteed spinach and baked fish in soy sauce is so good. wait, is that the MSG talking?"}
{"text":"It's not a bad buffet but not the best. They have sushi and sashimi, a real little section but they have it. The rest of the food is pretty standard. No Mongolian station, and not a lot of seafood but at least they're clean, have good service, and located in a nice area. The only thing I really liked and none of the other cheap buffets have been able to make better is the coconut fried shrimp.  

For the price you can't go wrong it is a cheap buffet."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a small birthday gathering last week. I would categorize this place under what I call\" chinese junk food buffets\" as its very similar to Vegas buffet on Flamingo and Buffet Asia (several locations). The food is your straightforward chinese spread with fried foods, stir fried foods, ice cream, bought in desserts, sushi, and more fried foods. Prices are cheap (around $10 for lunch and $13 for dinner) and there is ample seating. I would say the experience was decent.  The best items at this place are the crab legs, clams, spicy chicken, coconut shrimp, and apple pie. Now some of you are thinking, \"Why would they have apple pie?\" I have no idea!.... but you can't really go wrong with apple pie with ice cream.  If you are really hungry and near the area, then this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Its the best Chinese buffet I have been to in Vegas. They have a wide variety of food including crab legs (which I went there for), shrimp (boiled and fried), beef spare ribs, mussels, clams, oysters, some yummy seabass, and even sushi (which I have eaten more than a few times and have never been ill :-) ) The cost is $11-12 per person depending on if you have a coupon or not which you can print off of their website. Cost of the drinks are extra. Overall, highly enjoyable and I would and have gone back."}
{"text":"So, yesterday I would've given this place a decent review. Today....I've changed my mind after I spent literally all night in the bathroom. My boyfriend wasn't feeling that well after we ate here last night, but just brushed it off since some places we go, the food quickly moves through him. I however felt fine for a few hours until I was about to go to bed and the pain started. I don't know if it was food poisoning or what, but it was bad. Maybe this was just a one time thing, I don't know, but I'm not really wanting to find out. 

Breakdown of the restaurant (aside from me getting sick). The place isn't very big, but the have a decent selection of food items. The desserts could use a little work tho. There isn't anything that is that great to choose from. They have a lot of seafood items which is why I wanted to try the place because that's usually most of what I get. For $15, you can't really beat the price to get crab legs, shrimp, claims, mussels, crawfish, etc. The staff was very attentive and picked up our plates and refilled our drinks quickly. I can see why people give this place good reviews, but getting super sick from eating there has definitely ruined my experience."}
{"text":"Food here is great! And  the service here is awesome! I don't know our server's name, but he's the nicest Asian server ever! He's quick to refill our drinks and remove our used plates.  Many Thanks! x"}
{"text":"The food here is worth the money..... it has sushi, baked oysters, and salt & pepper shrimp is real good."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from this place. I had low expectations. I thought it was going to be another cheesy Chinese buffet. I came here on a weekday lunch with my coworkers. The manager or one of the male hosts greeted us right away and we were seated immediately. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the variety and selection. They had four soups-egg flower, hot n sour, miso, and wonton. They also had a sushi station. I rarely get sushi that's been sitting out from a buffet so I can't comment on the quality and taste. There was also a salad and dessert bar and of course lots of Chinese food.

There's no way one can try everything here in one sitting. Out of the foods I tried, I liked the steamed clams in some delicious sauce (no idea what's in it but it's good), seabass, chicken wings, and coconut chicken in a creamy sauce. I didn't try the salad bar because I went for the main courses. Their dessert selection is alright. I grabbed a cream puff, chocolate mousse, and soft serve ice cream. Our waters were filled and plates cleared so no problems with service.

This is a steal for $8.79 to satisfy your cheap Chinese food cravings. There's a 10% off coupon on their website but I was embarrassed to use it because my coworker made fun of my coworker for using it last time so I didn't. LOL."}
{"text":"$7 for all you can eat chinese seafood lunch. Don't hate. I've been here 5 times mostly for dinner. Tastes varies but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"I've read some of the reviews regarding this place and i have to say that I disagree with some of the posters.  

This place has one thing that I find I crave which is the Coconut Shrimp.  I'm not one for coconut because of the texture, but after trying this accidentally, I found that it was fantastic.  It had none of the texture of coconut, but all of the sweetness.  

I had the crab on seafood night several times and did not get sick as you hear others have.  

I find they have a good selection and have never disappointed me.  

In fact, I find that they go out of their way to make sure you never have a dirty dish on your table and always have fresh tea if you finish your pot."}
{"text":"dinner- quality of every single dish is pretty good. Coconut Shrimp and Korean Pork Chops is my favorite. Even the fried rice taste pretty good compare to all the Hotel buffets I'd been to where they always try to serve a Chinese Station,,,,with horrible horrible fried rice and beef broccoli if you know what I mean!.... 

Lunch-same great quality of food , always fresh and hot, since theres a lady always on top of ordering with a microphone which dish is almost gone on the buffet station. I think that's brilliant!  I would rather eat here for $8 lunch than $8 in a burger Joint or other fast food."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. The price is not bad, $15 for dinner but the quality is terrible. There was only one item that was half way decent and that was their coconut shrimp.Their crab legs were pitiful, the width was the size of a straw and there was hardly any meat in there. eThe beef had hardly any flavor and the orange chicken was mushy. The sushi was bad and I did not even want to try their pizza. 
I will not say the name of the place but there is another Chinese buffet on Rainbow, a few blocks from Krazy buffet and it is ten times better. The only reason why I went here is because my date insisted on it because her friend recommended it. When I took her to that spot she immediately noticed the night and day differences. The best part is their lunch buffet is only $10. Their dinner is the same price, I think it is a few dollars more $17 but they give you real crab legs, sushi, beef and food. Plus the worst part is I think this place puts MSG on their food! I felt sleepy when I was driving back home and it was only 500PM."}
{"text":"They used a dry ragto wipe up vomit off a table and then continued to serve drinks without washing hands then got mad because we told what had happened with the table next to us"}
{"text":"Quantity over quality is the motto here.  The price is good, the service is adequate but while they may have some items that does not mean those items have taste.  

Crab legs, tasteless, same with the shrimp unless you get one of the salt and pepper shrimp or crab which do have taste but none of the original food, just of salt and pepper.

At half the price of the better buffets in town this place will attract those who want a lot of food cheaply but do not go expecting any subtle tastes or anything that will make you take notice, but they do have a lot to offer as far as variety.

We will spend more, wait for groupon discounts and go to other buffets in town where the quality is better."}
{"text":"First off, this place doesn't look pretty on the outside, but when you walk inside it's really clean. The set up is of the buffet is the food toward the back of the restaurant and seating around. There are long tables for groups and also booths available as well. 

I have tried coming to this place during the week and after Church on Sunday and well I'd rather come here on Sunday. I feel like there is more a seafood selection available. They also have a sort of hibachi where you gather your uncooked meats, veggies and sauces and bring it to a window where they cook the food in front of you. That's a plus for me. I've tried sushi once and it was really fresh. Lots of hot entrées, desserts, fruits and salads to choose from as well. 

They do offer a military discount but only for those who has a card. So if your going with a group expect that your meal is the only one with the discount. 

Defiantly coming back again!"}
{"text":"The food is great and fresh for 12.99 dinner or 8 bucks for lunch. I don't understand why people are expecting a 5 star service and quality when they are not paying for it. I think this place is just great compare to some buffets that I had to pay for more than triple of this price on the strip. Try their coconut shrimp and clams !!! And their sushi counter also better than lots strip buffets."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying this place after several people had suggseted it to me.

 I've come to the conclusion that ALOT of these type Buffets are basically serving the same dishes and what stands out is the things that they offer that the others dont.

I arrived late for lunch around 3pm and even at that late hr the place was active with people -a good sign. The place was well lit and I was offered a nice comfortable booth where I could spread out my paper and read. I even lucked out and was sitting across from a crying baby!! lol

 As I said, they are basically serving the same thing as other places with the difference here being Sweet Potato French Fries, fresh breaded shrimp & Fish with cocktail & tartar sauce available. They also had peeled shrimp on ice as well as whole fried shrimp and grilled shark. Also \"coconut chicken\" was offered but the chicken was more breading than substinance but the sauce was very good, they even have a fresh sushi station with several types of rolls available.

The desert station was pretty pedestrian with no standouts at all other than the small coconut cake squares they were offering were dry and stale which is nbd as I really wasnt there for desert.

I also got to see them putting out the dinner items such as the snow crab legs and while thin, they looked good.

 Overall I'd have to say try this place because you cant go wrong. Of the 3 places on Sahara I still rate Buffet @ Asia #1, followed by this place and Pacific Buffet at #3."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of buffet and Krazy Buffet dinner prices are $11.99 with a mix of clams, mussel, CRAB LEGS, fish, and fresh sushi made right in front of you. I really enjoy the steam crab legs and there no limit so you know for a fact I like ALL I CAN EAT. So if your just like me and love seafood then this is the place for you! Get your money worth and get your grub on! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OMG! You can't get better then this for the price! It's around $9 for lunch and $12 for dinner. There is a child price for kids up to 10 year it's only $4.50 at lunch. I'm not sure about dinner but its probably around 1/2 the price like it is for lunch. I can only review lunch for you because that's all I've had so far but  I will update once i get to do dinner. Anyhow the variety is awesome! The taste of the food is excellent! I was not expecting anything like this for a $9 lunch   buffet! It's most certainly well worth the money. You got eggplant, chicken wings, pizza (for the kiddos i'm sure), french fries, garlic bread, friend banana, garlic spinach, tofu and veggies, a seafood mix of shrimp, squid, and imitation crab, orange chicken, honey walnut chicken, pepper pork, fried rice, chow mein, clams(a lot of people seem to pile this very high on a plate), prawns (again I see a lot of people with this piled on a plate as well), salad bar and more. The sushi bar is awesome and fresh! The desert selection is small but to be quite honestly I never go to a chinese buffet expecting and outlandish desert section. I will say for the small selection they do have the taste is good. I did taste everything here and I have to say the flavor for all dishes are wonderful. I am also impressed with the price of drinks. They only charge $1.39 for a soda with unlimited refills. most buffets with a cheap price with always over charge on the drink. This place does not and I actually have respect for a place like that. Not to mention the service is amazing! You never have to ask for a refill they are so on it! Not one plate will be left at your table. The min you are done that plate is long gone! The manager does stand in the front kind of grumpy looking. However he does smile if you do acknowledge him with a hi and a smile! So come here and enjoy! I will say though it is a bit high in sodium. I went through 2 glasses of water there and 3 bottles of water and home and i'm still feeling thirsty. I did over do it today though. I will definitely be watching my portions from now on when eating here, it is very easy to overdo it because it's soooooo goooood! Dont waste your money getting a lunch plate at a Chinese place. You're going to pay around the same price but you wont get anywhere near the selection or quality that is for certain!"}
{"text":"This place is good for what it is. Kinda cheap end Chinese food that you would get from random Chinese take out place. Nice and greasy. Perfect for a hangover. 

But the best reason to go here is the ayce crab legs. Under $13 for dinner and you can get warm snow crab any day of the week. I love that!

Cream cheese wontons are so good but I'm so ashamed to admit that lol. Everything else is just OK...not bad but OK."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by here for some lunch because one of my friend's recommended it to me. I was a little skeptical at first because I'm so used to going to the competition buffet down the street, but I must say... THIS PLACE IS DEFINITELY A GO! You'll get your money worth in one plate. And for all my seafood junkies like me, I must tell ya, the seafood (specifically the snow crab legs) is so fresh! I also loved the environment here, it was excellent! Most buffets are usually dirty, but during my visit, I noticed the workers kept the place clean at all times....and since it's a busy place, I feel like that's very important to do. So if you're looking for a new place to try out, come here! You can't beat the prices either."}
{"text":"Good food, but be careful if you use credit card- I left a cash tip, paid with credit card, and a $5 tip was added (I noticed on my credit card bill).

They probably thought I wouldn't notice since I'm from out of state."}
{"text":"I feel like we're on a game show and the price is right! $11.99 dinner buffet is a wining price! Now we know why they call themselves \"Krazy.\" The food wasn't bad at all. There were certain items that I had to pack my plate up with since they were my favorites! 

The place was bustling and packed on a Saturday evening at around 8:30pm - but we didn't have to wait, we were quickly seated at a booth when we walked in. The food kept being refreshed since there were a lot of diners- this is a great thing! 

They have a decent selection of Chinese goodies and other asian flavors. 

I ended up with a plate stacked with cream cheese wontons and gyoza...Somehow it seemed like the right thing to do. They were so crispy and gushing with cream cheese goodness. So bad yet sooo sooo good! They make them very good here. 

Plus their sweet and sour sauce and gyoza sauce sealed the deal! I'm a saucy girl, and I dunked my gyoza and wontons like there was no tomorrow. Super yummy! 

They had oysters on a half shell that were cleanly shucked, tasted sweet, and didn't get us sick after eating... That's a huge plus in the books! 

The crab legs and butter with lemon was a hit for me! (Only served at dinner) 

The vanilla soft serve was creamy, sweet and a perfect ender to the gorge fest! 

Here is a list of everything that I could remember from the buffet: (trust me, there was a ton more) 
Frog legs
Oysters
Fried chicken 
Bbq pork bun
Sweet and sour pork
Honey walnut shrimp
Teriyaki chicken skewers  
Orange chicken
Shrimp cocktail
Gyoza sauce and sweet and sour sauce 
Baked mussels 
Steamed clams
Fried dough
Fried wonton chips
Beef broccoli
Steamed Seabass
Chowmein
Fried rice 
White rice
Egg drop soup
Hot and sour soup
Miso soup 
Wonton soup
Sushi bar
Salad / cold bar
Fruit
Vanilla Soft serve ice cream 
Some baked cake selections
Pizza

Remember this isn't gourmet fine dining! This is greasy good ol' buffet style Chinese fast food! The price is right, take it for what it really is. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty Cheap Chinese Food. They have coupons monthly in the mailers. I think we paid $6ish a person with coupon. Which is pretty decent for OK food. The food was surprisingly not that bad for the price we paid. But there isn't much selection. Its very basic. They spent more time decorating the place then on the menu. There is very little people so some of the food been out for a while. So go when it's busy and get fresh food. Oh wells. But personally I'll prefer Buffet Asia a bit further and a tiny bit more money but your'll be more satisfied."}
{"text":"This is a scaled review. Obviously it can't stand with 4 starred places on the strip, but in terms of a Chinese buffet, its a great place.

Some other reviews are knocking it for not having extensive salad choices, or a diverse menu, uhm, it's a local Chinese buffet, not a casino buffet.

What it does have is regularly switched out food (freshness), a lot of choices (in comparison to other Chinese buffets), a Mongolian station, and on weekends crab legs.

For the money, this is definitely a place you can go to get a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Even though I hate Chinese food, this place was pretty good. The price was $13.99 per person. My favorite thing on the menu was the fried shrimp. I mean it was sooo tasty!!

Everything else was mediocre. There was a salad bar, sushi, fruit bar, dessert bar and main courses like orange chicken, short ribs, different kinds of soups.

But honestly, I would just go there for the shrimp! It was that good and you will definitely get your monies worth from eating the seafood. There was crab legs as well."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that you get what you pay for when coming here. It's very cheap because it's not the best. Now, it's not really that bad but compared to something simple like Panda Express, it's not that great. Panda has better food. I love how large the selection is though. The food is average and that's about all. Great service! I'd come here if a couple friends wanted to but not really on my own."}
{"text":"came back here twice...so satisfied with the service, staff is so prompt, the food is okey, the place is clean and you can see whats goin on in the kitchen (yes it is an open kitchen, resaon why im giving 4 stars...) =)))"}
{"text":"i go to the one on rainbow. the food is fresh, the staff is friendly and on the ball. i prefer the dinner buffet to the lunch, only because there's more of a variety. (better sushi, crab legs, oysters to die for, pick your own meat veggies and shrimp, they grill it for you. there's so much, i cry. i take everybody i know there. family, friends, i can't say enough about this place. i don't know how they do it. all for $ 11.49? and they have a 10% coupon you can print? what more can i say."}
{"text":"Eh. It's alright. Nothing to write home about. Just your usual fake, greasy, been sitting out for probably too long Asian buffet. Not my first choice, not my fifth choice and definitely not even my 10th choice for places to eat. I only eat here because my boyfriend and his family likes this place a little too much lol."}
{"text":"Had a great experience! Pepper crabs were seriously good! They are lightly fried but seasoned extremely well. Small establishment, clean, nothing over the top. Just a good Chinese buffet! My meal was $12 or so on a Sunday where it's dinner all day. You will find a diy BBQ station, crab legs, fried crabs, shrimp varieties, lol mein, veggies, chicken varieties, pizza etc. Hopefully you get the picture."}
{"text":"I just love, love Krazy buffet!   I have been to most, and this is the best.  Don't waste your money trying to find a good chinese buffet, this is it."}
{"text":"Exploring North Vegas and found this place and it was packed on the night I went. About $15 a person and it's asian seafood oriented buffet. You won't be finding your cuts of cow/pork/chicken here. There are some stifrys and stuff but think soups, mussels, clams, crab, sushi, calamari, octupus. Wasn't amazing, but definitely hits the spot if you just want some seafood."}
{"text":"I went to this place and was amaze that it was actually good a lot of buffets are not good and the food be nasty but this place had fresh food amost everything I had was real good very cheap for a buffet but worth it ."}
{"text":"First time here and usually hesitant about Chinese buffets. This place was absolutely delish.  Excellent selection of foods.. everything was fresh and tasty. Will defo be back!"}
{"text":"This place is better then Buffet @ Asia, hands down. Their grilled seabass is always a hit.. as well as their garlic clams (in shell).

The sushi rolls are not really great but I figure if one wants sushi, go to a darn sushi joint that specializes in that cuisine. Krazy Buffet is not one to be scrutinized for its sushi. 

Basically, you get what you pay for... I always have lunch here for $7.99 and the food is well worth that deal. (well, except for the hot n sour soup.. it's kinda bland)"}
{"text":"It's rare that I leave a Chinese buffet and dash home to write a review, but damn, Krazy Buffet is THAT good. It's newly opened near my Desert Shores neighborhood, and I have to say, it's a welcome addition. Everything's new, clean and shiny and they did a nice job remodeling the place.

But most importantly, the food is really good. There's a wide selection of Chinese dishes, with heavy emphasis on seafood. Everything was very fresh and the favors were just right. In addition to the Chinese dishes, there was also surprisingly good sushi and a Mongolian grill, where the chefs stir-fry just for you. Bonus points for the plethora of fresh fruit including Hawaiian papayas.

And speaking of Hawaiians, there were lots of local families here, judging from the bumper stickers in the parking lot. Always a good sign at any Asian restaurant.

Last but not least, the service was top notch. Let me repeat, good service at a Chinese restaurant, a buffet no less. Damn, I may never have to eat at Panda Express again. Yipeeee!"}
{"text":"Favorite buffet in Vegas! Crab legs are delicious,  staff is great, price is too. I will not heitate to spend an hour eating crab legs here while my husband stares at me."}
{"text":"Tried this buffet last weekend.  Krazy Buffet has a very large selection for a reasonable price.  I liked the large selections of different kinds of sushi and deserts too.  The food seemed fresh and very well prepared.  In all, a great mixture of both Japanese and Chinese offerings.  There were more things to try than I had room in my stomach for!  I would definately recommend this buffet!"}
{"text":"WORST buffet we have ever been to.  

We originally went here for the AYCE crab legs, but the crabs are a joke.  They're basically the crab shell and if you're lucky you will get a little crab meat if you search inside.  The rest of the food available in the buffet was nothing to talk about.

There are TWO main reasons we will NEVER EVER EVER go back here!

1)  There was a long, black hair found in my friend's house steak.  Neither of us have black hair, so obviously couldn't have been ours after we received our plates.  My friend was a little more compassionate to this, since she does work with food as well and we do have to consider it's a buffet with lots of people hovering over food throughout our visit, but still.

2)  After we found the hair in her food, she told the server about it.  His response was 'Ok.'  That was it!  Not an 'I'm sorry,' or 'Let me take the food away for you.'  This is what made the experience worse than the food.  The service is AWFUL.  Worst server I've ever had.  Even when he took our plates away before it seems like he was annoyed he even had to do his job and was rushing us to get out of there, which after we found the hair I didn't mind doing just that.

At the cashier, my friend complained about the hair in her food and the cashier was a little more apologetic for it and offered her a $3 discount.  I didn't get a discount at all.  I guess we were better off taking what we could get and getting out of there and never looking back!!

If you're looking for a good buffet with crab legs, don't waste your time here.  Pay the little bit of extra money and go to Palms or Rio"}
{"text":"We all know it's \"Krazy\" to say that an AYCE Chinese Buffet is excellent but I must insist that Sahara's Krazy Buffet was just that Krazy that it was well worth the trip. The food was extremely fresh, well-displayed, and included those nice little touches (peeled shrimp, rindless fruit, etc.) that really make a difference. Our busser, Ming, was always circulating and making sure all of our needs were met with a smile and a thank you. Ming was a big part of what made this quick excursion to Krazy all the more pleasurable. Thank you, Ming!"}
{"text":"Meh. Not horrible, but not amazing. Edible. It's your typical Chinese buffet. I called a week prior to make reservations for a party of 45. Yes it's a buffet and reservations aren't necessary. But we wanted them to be prepared for our large group. They seated us immediately and we started to eat. This has your typical Chinese food items...chow mien, beef broccoli, hot & sour soup, etc. plus lots more. They also had a salad bar, sushi station and dessert area. All the items were pretty fresh and hot since it was busy and they were expecting us. But flavor wise, like I said earlier, pretty typical. Nothing really stood out as amazing and we just ate what looked good. One thing that I did enjoy was the sweet potato tempura, which I got seconds of. The servers cleared our plates as we ate and kept drink filled. At $8ish per head for lunch, you get what you pay for. Standard Chinese. The end."}
{"text":"As crazy as it sounds (pun intended), I am definitely a fan of Krazy Buffet. Tell me where else can you find another buffet that serves crab legs for 12.99? Besides their other location I dont remember anybody else doing the same thing. While most other places that charge you more for COLD crab legs, the ones they serve here are STEAMED. 

What's the difference you say? Well, besides the fact that you know it hasnt been sitting out from the night before, (hence refrigerating it is necessary so they can serve it again the next day and thats why a lot of places prefer to serve it cold), steaming it kills a lot of bacteria and/or any other germs that it may have with it. Most importantly, the crab meat tends to be more flavorful and moist.

Not into crab? Well they have lots of other choices like crawfish, grilled fish, clams, mussels, oysters and even sushi. Soup choices from hot n sour to egg drop. Honey shrimp, spicy chicken, chicken wings, etc. and lots more that I am not putting here simply because of the fact that you are not going to eat every individual item. What you will end up doing just like me is sampling here and there which will eventually lead you back to those items that make your taste buds happy.

A major plus for me is their Mongolian option. You put together on a plate your choice of meats which is shrimp, beef, pork, and chicken along with veggies like onions, green bell peppers, jalepenos, and mushrooms. You can top it off with minced garlic and/or chili sauce to give it that spicy kick. Then you hand it over to the cook who grills everything together until all is thoroughly cooked. He puts it on a plate for you and off you go to enjoy. What you want and how you want it to taste is obviously up to you.

Service is pretty good. They do a good job of refilling your drinks and picking up your used dishes.

Just remember the 12.99 price I am describing is for Dinner only. Here's the breakdown:
Monday through Saturdays are as follows.
Lunch: Adults are $8.29 and kids 4 to 10 years old are $4.29
Dinner: Adults $12.99 and kids 4 to 10 years old are $6.99
Sundays are all day dinner price.
Senior Citizens and Military get 10 percent off

So in closing, the food here is pretty decent for the price you pay. They have another location off of Sahara but my preference is this one because its bigger and I think the service is a lot better. So whenever you are thinking of crab legs (especially steamed), then this is the place to go for the price is decent for what you get.

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #108 \"Feeling Crabby?\""}
{"text":"Whoever prepped their food needs to get fired..including the person in charge if the bbq station who doesn't thoroughly cool the veggies all the way. The seeds are still in the cantelope and the chocolate pudding is sour."}
{"text":"It's an Asian buffet, went on the weekend so it was a seafood buffet. Checked in with Yelp and got 15% off my bill.  Had my fill of snow crab, roll sushi, mussells, shrimp and clams."}
{"text":"Nothing special or out of the ordinary here. I've been to many of these asian style buffets. This is definitely not one of the better ones. They do have a few decent sea food dishes and the fired rice wasn't bad. Service here was not that great.  Altogether I wouldn't suggest this establishment over some of the others in the area. Your better off spending your 12 bucks in a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Have gone here for both lunch and for dinner. Have not tried Sunday Buffet yet.
Krazy Buffet has a very strong selection of items for even the picky eater in your family. They offer hibachi (my personal favourite!) You fill up your plate with a selection of meats (pork, chicken, beef, and for dinner they add shirmp) and various veggies such as mushrooms, bean sprouts, jalapenos, etc. and a cook makes it fresh right in front of you. You can of course adjust how spicy it is to your liking!
They also have a wonderful selection of other foods, including great amounts of fish (dinner only) various fried/sauced items, American (such as pizza and fries for the younger ones in your party) soups, sushi, and of course desserts.
Overall, service is pretty okay. Sometimes the hibachi cook seems like he's in a bad mood and it can be uncomfortable waiting to get your food, but generally the servers are fantastic.
A 4/5 for me, and we'll certainly continue to be customers here."}
{"text":"if you value your time dont come here. Food was not fresh at all and taste so plain, sushi was nasty as hell but at least the waiters were  nice though."}
{"text":"Parking is good. It's super cheap. Expect a ghetto crowd. 

The sushi is of suspect quality, I'd avoid this.

The Chinese food was mostly good. It was all hot and the place was packed so it gets turned quickly which means that you're not likely to get diarrhea unless you go for the sushi.

Probably won't return due to the crowd at this place."}
{"text":"My family really like coming to this buffet, the foods pretty good, price reasonable, service okay.    We love the seafood selections especially."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday night for dinner. It's $12.99 per adult but they do charge like $1.40 for a drink. 

There was a lot of families here, so lots of running children. Beware! 

The food ran out quickly, especially the crab legs. They would be gone within 5 min or less. I managed to grab a plate but was very unhappy with them. I couldn't even break them, they had no meat in them really. I did not understand why everyone else was so obsessed with them. 

Pretty much EVERY thing else was worth eating though. It all had good flavor and was warm. The buffet isn't huge but they still have a good variety of stuff. I will definitely return when I'm craving a good Chinese buffet again!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre nothing about it really appealed to me.

You can tell by walking in that the place used to be something else, because the seating didn't seem to match with anything. 

The food selection was blah.. one section had crab legs, cooked oysters on shell, shrimp, and imitation crab filled crab shell. And BTW they charge extra for touching anything is this section.

the next section were your soups, and fried dessert and typical chinese food selection.

the next section was their sushi station, the rice on the sushi was so hard it popped off my daughters braces while trying to gnaw on it.

they had 2 sections for desert. and they had a section for raw meat and veggies/ overall,  for having to pay $30 for me and daughter together , was definitely not worth it. I could've gone and went to panda express and would've had a better meal than this place.

i will not be returning... blah. no thanks ! i would rather go to the feast at any station casinos and it be cheaper."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a Chinese buffet. Everything was bland or cross contaminated. The pepper beef, orange chicken, vegetable lo mein, the edamame (how do you mess that up?!), egg drop soup, egg rolls, pot stickers, even the Mongolian BBQ...bland. 

I am writing this review to remind myself never to go back here though I don't think I will need it. We walked in and it was almost an immediate regret. Don't eat here, it's not worth the price."}
{"text":"Cheap food that is ok. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat, then I would come here. However, be warned! Not everything is edible and some looks questionable. There's a lot of options though for only $14.99. Serving American-Chinese food for those who are extra hungry but is on a budget. 

Came here over the weekend and it was pretty busy. Stayed there and ate for a good hour. Left full and satisfied. I have come here and been sick before, but it was at a different Krazy Buffet location. 3 stars across the board for an okay experience that is hella cheap."}
{"text":"Much better than the average asian buffet in the valley. Clean with a good food selection."}
{"text":"Not bad at all!! I eat crab legs while my other half tackles the meat which he was very surprised that it was good mmmm and the shrimp cocktail is so bomb"}
{"text":"We used to go during the week but found that going on the week-ends was better because it is busier and the foodies not sit as long in the trays.  The soups are good. I mix the egg drop with some hot and sour, put in some wontons and it is really good.  There are several selections but we like the spicy crab the best.  Most of the food is replenished quickly except for the crab legs and the spicy crab.  I wonder if this is done on purpose."}
{"text":"Decent price and great food selection. You can get a wide variety of sushi, claims, oysters, crab and a large selection of other Asian dishes."}
{"text":"Very good Coconut chicken !!! very Good Price for Buffet . I come here every couple months or if I am driving around on this side of town. The servers are always quick to refill drinks and take empty plates off of your table. The food is very GOOD!"}
{"text":"Everytime when me and my family are really hungry, we come here. They are crab legs, fish fillets, sushi, and many more. I definetely love their apple pie. The downside is that their some of their foods needs more flavor and more crunchy."}
{"text":"This was before we found out The Palace Station was a better deal with buffets. Wont come back here since the food was trash."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the price. 

For just 14.99 plus tax this place offers a lot more than buffet at Asia. 

Came here because my cousin wanted something cheap and a place that had everything from seafood to some fried chicken. We were about to go to buffet at asia but saw another yelp review that said this place was better...and cheaper. So had to. 

It was pretty empty when we got there, around 4pm so I guess people were just getting off work because when we were leaving it was filling up fast. So get there before 5pm to be safe. 

Also on the being empty part, I was a bit concerned about it due to food just sitting and not being replaced.  That wasn't the case here. They kept putting out fresh food and taking out older ones. 

They had crab legs, fried shrimp, sushi (which I never trust at a buffet), chow mein, and the other usually Chinese food with some pizza and fried chicken.

The only bad part was the stale desserts."}
{"text":"W/ a boyfriend who is in the culinary industry, this place is a FAILURE!!

First of all, there's no customer service.  We have a child and not even asked if we needed a high chair or not.  We had to get it ourselves.

Secondly, the bottles of tapatio and tabasco sauce that were given to us had no covers.  the spout was old and crusty looking.  The tapatio bottle had a date of 3/14/13.  Keep in mind the day we ate at this place was 7/17/13.  That's like four months later and still have the bottle???

Third, the surroundings (i.e. tables, walls, blinds, etc.) were filthy.  Who would enjoy eating a meal at this place???

Fourth, water spills and male server don't even bother cleaning it up (i.e. wiping it up & drying it).  He just places napkins on it and lets us walk over it since it was litterally next to and under our table.

Fifth, lack of service.  Two servers only and it's customer chasing down the server, or serving yourself because server is not doing their job right.  The ervers are not efficient.  I've been to other places that always comes to you asking you if things are good.

Sixth, no professionalism by Manager. Gets into a confrontation w/ us ESP having to take it outside the restaurant.  He also placed the bill after just 10 minutes of sitting down.  We put it aside bc we are not done eating and Manager comes back to table and repositions bill in same spot he placed it initially.  Manager say's \"Customer is not always right\" and makes an issue about paying the $18 bill.  As a customer, why would you pay full price of a meal if you didn't get the service you deserved, unsanitary, unprofessional.  It's not about getting a free meal, it's about providing great service and assuring your customer is statisfied so they can in return come back for more business.

There are better buffet's than this place (i.e. Buffet Asia, Casino Buffets, etc.).  If you want coconut shrimp, there are better place than this place.  Bahama Breeze or Thai resturant will serve tastier coconut shrimps.  If you want sushi, you don't get FRESH sushi at these places.  They have been pre-made already and sit around until you come by and eat them.  Buffet places have low grade fish (cheap) and are frozen.  If you want an all you can eat sushi place, I recommend Sushi-Mon because it's made to order and way better than this place!

I have pictures to prove this place is not clean...Bottom line, think twice before coming to this location.  If you want food poisoning or other illnesses, continue coming here.  Never say u didn't get warned..."}
{"text":"For the price it's probably the best Asian buffet in Vegas crab legs every night, raw oysters are big"}
{"text":"This place is great! For a Chinese buffet I'm not picky, I just want hot food, a clean restaurant and plenty of choices! My boyfriend and I came In today around 2:00 it was starting to get busy. The lunch buffet was 8.99 ! What a steal! The things I recommend is the sautéed mushrooms, orange chicken, barbecue chicken, malsadas,spicy chicken, pancit, chicken wings and pot stickers! The only thing I didn't like was the brócoli beef everything else was yummy! Great dessert selection! Will definitley return here !"}
{"text":"Holy shit this place is gross!

My parents saw the waiter drop my fork and spoon while I was away getting my second plate. All the waiter did was put it back up on the table. Right in fucking front of them!

The meat of the crab legs appears to be made from cheap, unhealthy crabs with very poor meat inside. Also DO NOT EAT THE CLAMS! There are alot of clams that remained closed after being cooked, that means the clam actually died BEFORE it went into the pot, which can be a dangerous vector for food borne illnesses.

And for $12 a person for this kind of crap? Stuff that is unsanitary and can potentially kill us? 

Mom and dad told me later that they were really sick, but me and my brother were fine due to our precautions."}
{"text":"This buffet was terrible.   The food was old and soggy.  I will never eat there again"}
{"text":"Skip it.... There are much better options out there!  The \"hot\" food was NOT hot, and the flavor was only mediocre at most."}
{"text":"Me: My kids love buffets. As far as Asian buffets go, this is really good. It's small so food stays fresh and small batched. I don't think the use much if any MSG. The steamed fish, stir-fried clams and the spinach dishes are always my go-to. Everything else is pretty good but these 3 are best. For quick Asian food fix, this beats Panda or take-out shops any day. 

Him: The fish here is amazing. The flavor is nice and light and it breaks easily when you eat it. It feels like it flakes apart. You don't have to really bite it. They have good sushi too. It's not like other sushi restaurants, but it's still just good. I like the noodles too. It tastes like the Chinese noodles I like with extra onions which means extra-flavor. Only go for lunch. Don't go for dinner like other people do who just go for the crab. I like crab but they have skinny snow crab and it's too weird because it doesn't have much flavor or meat like Dungeness crabs. Bathrooms are yucky like most Asian restaurants. Go at home or wherever you are before you eat there."}
{"text":"I waited until we had eaten at Krazy Buffet twice before writing a review.  I am very pleased to tell you that both visits were just fine!  Nothing fancy, but where can you get unlimited sushi, crab legs, and shrimp for the price of $11.99.  That's their dinner price.  The sushi wasn't the finest quality, but there were at least 15 kinds to choose from and all tasted just fine for the price.  The crab legs are very good and if you dip them in the butter you will need a bath like we do when you are finished eating!  I do agree with other reviewers that the food could be a little warmer, but at the dinner service it is turned over so fast that everything we ate was very fresh.  This is definitely a good family buffet!  Remember:  it is always wise to eat at a buffet during peak lunch and dinner service....never, never in-between if you want fresh food!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. Been here a few times and will go soon again. Prices are fair, food was good and I was happy.
Some people are very picky about buffets. Don't go then and eat at a restuarant where you are expected to tip. I would recommend this buffet to anyone wanting good food and clean restuarant."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was good and prices good too. Don't have to leave a tip either."}
{"text":"I don't get to this place nearly as often as I would like to since I live near UNLV and this place is on west Sahara and I'm a non driver so I need to go with somebody who has a car and I don't relish the thought of taking 4 buses (round trip). I went there with a friend yesterday.We've both been there before and I've eaten here on at least 10 or more previous occasions.I always enjoy the food TREMENDOUSLY here.They have a pretty decent variety and the food is very fresh and extremely tasty.I probably end up eating more here than just about any other Chinese buffet I go to.The manager (Daniel) and staff are extremely friendly and personable.
         Some of my favorite items include cocktail shrimp (with cocktail sauce). I really like this and most Chinese buffets do not have this.I would also recommend their garlic shrimp(extremely delicious flavor),pepper steak(tender),steamed fish,teriyaki chicken and a variety of other items you may like depending on your tastes and preferences.Their sushi selection is average,not bad but not spectacular,but to tell the truth,I enjoy the regular dishes so much that I rarely eat the sushi.
        Buffet Asia used to be my preferred Chinese buffet but Krazy Buffet has definitely replaced it as my favorite.My comments are based on the lunch buffet.You can go to the dinner buffet for about four dollars more but I haven't done that yet.I assume they might have a few extra items but I'm more than satisfied with the lunch selection.If you go to their web site,they have some coupons that you can print which will give you either a 10% or 15% discount depending on what time of day you go there.
       In closing,I truly recommend to anyone that is reading this review that you pay at least one visit to this place.If you do,I think you will go back again.I would come here at least once a week if they were closer to where I live.Try it.If you like it,post here and let us know."}
{"text":"I have very pleasant memories of past lunches at Krazy Buffet, but I hadn't been here for awhile. I was glad to see not much had changed. Still lots of choices--potstickers, chow mein, fried rice, sushi, all the requisite Asian items, plus pizza and french fries. Desserts aren't too exciting, but I like the fried donuts. And there's always the fresh fruit. The service is good--your used first plate is magically gone before you get back with the second! For me, the variety is the draw so I give it four or four and a half stars."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call it gourmet.  I'd call it average at best.  Kids do get a discount and under 3 years old are free."}
{"text":"Our server was great and we were sat promptly. It's not the best Asian buffet but it wasn't the worst. The BBQ ribs were really tasty and tender and the pepper steak was surprisingly good. I also really liked the BBQ/hibachi bar was surprisingly good as well. I don't eat sushi so I can't speak on behalf of that."}
{"text":"The food for lunch was hot and plentiful.   The staff was prompt and got you drinks quick.  We brought our three girls only the 4 year old was charged.   The bill was reasonable."}
{"text":"Simply put.  Terrible.  3:30PM 11.7.15.......

Didn't like anything I sampled.  Sorry."}
{"text":"The Booths were old and torn....The tables looked as if they were 20 years old....The carpet was old and stained....The ice cream machine was dirty...I had some coconut shrimp and it was average...I have had better....The selection was okay...The low Mein was over cooked and under seasoned....I probably won't go there again...Maybe John Taffer Can revamp the place ...LOL  Oh Yeah the Fruit was room temp....not very tasty"}
{"text":"This place is great! I ate at the other location on Sahara  and this place is just as good if not better.  The place is very clean and the staff is friendly.   I recommend the cheese oysters and coconut shrimp.  Their fresh lychees super sweet!"}
{"text":"So it's been a year since the last time I was here.  I went because the kids really wanted to try it again.  I guess they had better memories of this place than I did.

Well, we went here and what can I say? It's still the same as before. 1 Star.  I am all for a cheap meal, but I don't think I could do this place again.   I wish it was different, it used to be awesome but not so much anymore."}
{"text":"This was so much better than the other buffet I reviewed a few months ago. My two star rating is a bit deceptive, though.

I gave the last place I went to one star, but if I could have, I would have given it way less stars. It really was that bad. This place... solid 2 star buffet.

I'd come back, but only if I was really in a buffet mood and felt like stuffing myself until I got sick."}
{"text":"I friggin' love a place with a goofy name, especially buffets.  The image of a \"krazy\" buffet for me would be loud colors, customers and a general orgy of food.  I guess because it was rainy, 11am on a weekday and everyone is broke as a joke, it wasn't exactly KRAZY.

However, $6.99 weekday lunch... and a friggin' 15% off coupon for senior citizens.  I got the senior citizen discount as well since I was dining with my parents.  I would have been okay to pay full price, but hell, that's more $$$ for next time!

If you are a veteran of \"Asian\" buffets (primarily of Chinese food with some Korean and \"sushi\" mixed in), then this will be a familiar typical experience... except that it's friggin' $6.99!!!  Even Asia Buffet II cannot compete with that.  Yes, the selection is a little lighter than AB II, but that is fairly reflected in the price.

In case you have never been to an Asian buffet, first of all, tsk, tsk.  You are missing out.  Basically, you are looking at AYCE chow mein, rice, broccoli beef, dumplings, four soups like hot and sour, wonton, egg flower and if you are lucky westlake, kung pao, string beans, deep fried tofu, possibly some Korean short ribs and sushi (of the roll variety with a smattering of hand rolls).  If you upgrade to dinner, you extra money goes into the sushi selection and the addition of crab legs.  My general policy is that this is not worth the extra money since sushi and crab are on my list of \"Things not to go cheap on\".

I suppose that Krazy makes up some of its food costs by charging $1.39 for a beverage, including tea.  Though, they only charged $1.39 for the table, rather than each as would be the case if it were sodas.  I am not entirely sure if a second pot would have yielded another $1.39 charge since we only got one pot.  If you are that strapped, then be sure to ask.

Anyway, I think that this a great place after a night of drinking or perhaps after losing your whole stack to a 10-3 suited.  Happily, I was just hung over."}
{"text":"Krazy buffet on sunday is awesome. For the prize it is worth every penny.  Crabs are fresh and the selection is one of the best for chinese buffet in the area. I will definitely recommend for anyone to check them out. The staff really works hard to keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"They lured customer with picture of large crab legs but they are small and you have to wait for a long time before next refill. The hot and sour soup wasn't tasty. Matter how f fact I couldn't find any dish that tasted decent."}
{"text":"Solid buffet. All your usual Chinese favs. I particularly liked the Sushi (they have alot of different kinds) and their baked seafood dish. This was lunch so no crab, etc. Their honey chicken was also really good, not covered in batter and sort of light. The service is also really good, they clean plates and re-fill drinks right like ninjas (so stealth you wonder was it aliens who did it)."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Nothing special. None of the food was hot. The sushi was shit! The rice was hard and the tuna was gray on the ends and edges. The dessert had definitely been sitting out for a long while. The cream puffs were hard and the whipped cream was hard as well. To be completely honest. I was a little scared at first to eat the food when I saw it. I was invited by my family. So I kinda of had to go. I will never eat here again. The only thing that was good was the service. That's why I gave 2 stars. Not going here again."}
{"text":"I can't believe this was my first visit to the Krazy Buffet. I've done several \"drive-bys\", but have never stopped in. After picking up a few items at the shopping conglomerate in the same shopping center, it was time for lunch. 

The lunch buffet was just south of nine dollars and beverages are not included, but your 15% discount for checking in on Yelp will cover that. The buffet itself was some of the best Oriental buffet I've had in Vegas. Couple that with a good selection of sushi and a phenomenal Mongolian barbecue, and you've got a four-star experience.

It was pretty busy during lunch time on a Saturday, but the staff did a good job of keeping the buffet full. The sushi guys were busy making up fresh rolls of sushi and the Mongolian barbecue chef was busy as well. The buffet is stocked with all of your ready to eat favorites as well as fresh vegetables and meat for the Mongolian barbecue. You just grab all of your veggies, meats and sauces and take it to the Mongolian chef. He cooks it up right in front of you. 

Lunch for two with drinks and your yelp discount will run you just under 20 bucks. This will definitely be my new spot for Oriental buffet."}
{"text":"Pure garbage. Dont waste your money unless you like the lowest quality of food.  This place is filthy and should be shut down by the health dept.  The bathrooms are foul and disgusting.  The food is all frozen and tastes old.  Service is on par with the food, my wife told the server her cup was leaking and she said no its just the ice....Are you kidding me?  She finally got her a new cup after realizing the truth.  I guess she thought my wife was lying.  I feel sick now also....never again cheap buffets!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite chinese food buffet. The prices keep going up but the food is very good."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet has a good selection of seafood and kid friendly stuff. The prices were great! We fed two adults and 4 kids for less than $50! 

Favorites:
Clams in black bean sauce 
Raw oysters
Steamed crab
Deep fried crab
Salt n pepper shrimp

Staples:
Orange chicken
Hot n sour soup
Pot stickers

Kid friendly:
French fries
Fried rice
Chow mein"}
{"text":"I used to be Kray Kray over this buffet, but I think I'm over it. Had dinner with the homies looking forward to some crab legs and oysters. Crab legs were dry, and a no show on the oysters. I got the usual here and there, but the two items that are ALWAYS on point are the coconut skrimps and the \"kick his ass SEA BASS!!!\" These two items with some rice is the WINNER!!! 

Note to self... Sea Bass and Coconut Skrimps..."}
{"text":"It's an $8 buffet and you get exactly what you paid for. Service was poor, the staff looked like they couldn't wait to get out of there. The food was exactly what you expect an $8 all you can eat buffet to taste like. I don't think I'll be eating there any time soon, or ever."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese buffet, food is always hot and can be made to order. The had a wide variety and good selections. No wait to be seated and prices are very competitive."}
{"text":"Great dinner with my family, it's been 6 months since we last visit this place , they have great customer service , they are well organized, everything is clean , the food was very delicious, I had a great time here with my family. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese buffets in Vegas I have experienced since being stationed here.  Food was good.  Price was reasonable compared to others in the area I have tried.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  
I will return."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet.  You'd have to be \"Krazy\" to eat here twice.
They don't bother to keep the entrance to this restaurant clean, and the usual clientele appears to come fresh from Wal-Mart. Loud, rude, in all their low budget finery they descend upon this buffet to feed like mindless cattle, chomping away as they stare vacantly at cell phone screens, or scream obscenities at their misbehaving mini me's. There's a Nat Geo documentary here somewhere.
A commercial fisherman once told me, regarding fish, ALWAYS trust your nose, no matter the presentation. I wouldn't do the sushi. The Mongolian BBQ was super greasy. Nothing to recommend here, in my opinion. It's cheap food, just \"this side of grimy\"."}
{"text":"We couldn't believe the price here- 9$ for a AYCE weekday lunch buffet? Yes please! Quality was superb and there's many more authentic Chinese choices here than other Chinese AYCE buffets. Came here for a weekday lunch buffet and was pleasantly surprised. Options included stuffed clam shells, salt and pepper fried shrimp, steamed fish, chicken wings, mussels, sushi, dumplings, and plenty of veggies. Great experience eating here."}
{"text":"Food was great. Lots of variety and the price is more than right. We are here right now for lunch on a Monday. 
It's about $9 for adults and half price for kids. Excellent price for what you get."}
{"text":"What you pay, is what you get. With that being said and dinner is 12 dollars and some change, don't expect a gourmet meal. Everything was standard Chinese food which some items were beyond inedible. I mainly stuck with crawfish and crab legs. The Chinese food is a step down from panda express. I tried the shrimp, fried rice, oysters and beef, so that I could say I tried it. I don't think I would get any of those items again. Stick with the crab legs! Also, what bothered me a bit and deterred me from getting some items were that some of the customers are gross. They were using the tongs to get the items and then throw the tongs with the handle in the food. Or they would throw the tongs on top of the food so that the handle was in the food. Gross ass customers that have no manners or courtesy of other people's health. I don't know where your nasty hands have been nor do I want to even guess. What is the point of using the tongs to get the food! Might as well as have had your gross hands in them to grab your food. So, I decided to pass on the items that had the handles sitting in the food. Anyways, overall, I give this place a 2 stars for having crab legs for the price of what I paid for and the service was friendly and quick! However, I'm not sure if I'll be back again, unless I absolutely have to.."}
{"text":"I was there about a week ago and also about 3 weeks ago. The selection is awesome and the food is very tasty. Lots of Chinese food selections. Pricing very good for a non casino buffet. You will definitely not go hungry here.  I would like to go there more often if I could. The only negative is that they give free parking but no equivalent benefit for transit users and allowed someone to open carry a firearm in to the restaurant. This should not be allowed except for law enforcement and those with concealed carry permits. It does not make for a comfortable situation while you are eating. The restaurant may ban open carry patrons from entering if they wish. These last 2 items are the only reason that I did not give them a 5."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet? What is KRAZZYYYY about a great buffet with a huge selection of Chinese and Japanese deliciousness. I walked in not knowing what to expect because there have been some gross buffets in Las Vegas so I went in without any expectations.

Luckily I made a great decision and the food was fresh, hot, and scrumptious. They had plenty of greasy, fried appetizers that were all tasty and a great start to the meal. To my surprise the sushi was really fresh and there was a dedicated sushi chef making rolls the whole night which was refreshing to see. Generally when you head to a buffet the sushi is fairly fishy smelling and rarely edible but kudos to the sushi chef here.

If you are looking for a buffet where the busboys take your plates creepily within 2 seconds of finishing your meal then Krazy Buffet is the nuts. I felt like I was being hurried up every time he'd grab my plate before I even stood up. If that was my only knock on the whole experience I guess I can't be too upset with the overall experience. Give it a shot, then thank me later."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several time  and I Am not impressed mt teriyaki chicken was cold even thought i watch a server refill the chicken , pot stickers were oily.. our cups did stay full and so did the buffet  the sushi was being made it was good (not a big sushi fan)california rolls please  lol 
We have had better at casino buffets  ..nothing crazy here"}
{"text":"My family and I usually go here whenever we're too late for Buffet @ Asia. There's not too many food compared to other buffets, maybe that's just me. But i feel like eating the same thing over and over again every time i go here. The music is indeed nice of them. The service is great and the staffs are nice. (:"}
{"text":"Come during seafood dinner time! Baked mussels, sushi, crawfish, crab legs, & more. Hot & fresh tasting food with actual flavor. Not your typical buffet. It does get busy so come a little earlier than the usual dinner rushes. Only if asian buffets wouldn't have that \"MSG\", food koma sluggish feeling.. I do recommend you only go for dinner & if you like asian and/or seafood. Not overpriced at all!"}
{"text":"Go for the Salt n Pepper Shrimp, fried chicken wings, cocktail shrimp, snow crab legs, raw oysters, greens, and fish... they also have clams, mussels, crawfish... the kids love this place.  We always print out the 10% off coupon online.  For all the seafood thats offered, it's better than your average chinese/asian buffets around town..."}
{"text":"This place lives up to it's name! Both customers and staff pushing and shoving to get food and restock. I was nearly knocked to the floor with a plate of food in hand! It can be a brawl here; especially with the mouthbreathers going for the sweets! OMG! Pigs have better manners from what I've seen here! 

Sushi bar surprisingly good as is the hot food. Pro tip: try to get the veggie tempura right when they put it out. Recommended: sesame balls, fried rice, fried bananas, chicken wings, peel-and-eat shrimp, the aforementioned tempura. Nice selection of dishes here. Good eats. Nothing weird like sauteed cow testicles or any nonsense like that.

This place is definitely above the norm for Asian buffets on both the East and West coasts. 

Come hungry and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular visitor of Krazy Buffet and all of the dishes are excellent. The only issue is that stop making sushi at 8:00pm. The cooks are cleaning up and want to get out fast. It would be nice to make sure that all of the trays are full of sushi before they leave."}
{"text":"The owner seemed rude upon arrival. He herded us to our table like we were sheep.
The food was okay not the best. Typical buffet style food nothing to be impressed by. We were sat at an awkward table next to a big box of sugar packets. It didn't help that the servers' were also using that same spot as a mini server alley. I was really annoyed with the fact that a member of my party was literally back to back with the server every time they stood there. 

They need to fix their ice cream machine. You fill up your cone, just one wrong turn and the whole ice cream slides off the cone. Such a waste, the ice cream is terrible McDonald's serves better.

What really set me off was when I went to the restroom to wash my hands. I turned the sink on and in 2 seconds scorching hot water came out and burned my hands. I don't think I was the first person to experience that there. Made me want to leave ASAP! 
I'll never be back, another reminded why I highly dislike places like this."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for my mother's bday (her choice.. Idk why)  and I know I shouldn't expect much from a buffet off the strip but their crab legs tasted and smelled AWFUL!!..it smelled like a backed up sewerline!!..I informed the waitress on how awful the crab is & all she said was \"everybody eating it\"..I guess the other guests enjoy eating Sewer Crab!!"}
{"text":"This is probably a place to go to when you are craving good chinese food. I recommend coming at 4pm to closing or weekends because they have more seafood. I mean fried calamari with jalapeño?! Yasss!!! 

The only con for this place is the bathroom. They could be more cleaner and nice smell of air freshener would help because one of the greatest key to a successful restaurant is a clean environment."}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the sahara one. This place has more seafood and it seems different kinds of seafood dishes after 4pm sometimes. It is closer to my to home."}
{"text":"I love love going to krazy buffet! It's so good and affordable and it's a favorite place of mine. They have variety of food including oysters and crabs. They also allow you to buy a box to take home which I LOVE to fill with sushi :)."}
{"text":"Meh...not good! So unsanitary, the carpet alone is so dirty it makes me sick thinking of the years of food and grease and who knows what stuck on it. it's one of those places where you wanna wash your hands even after pulling the chair under you. I'll give a star for a decent tasting coconut shrimp. Am I going back? probably not! Unless I hear they have sanitized and remodeled/updated the place."}
{"text":"Super Good service!!! There was always a server to take away all of the dirty dishes right away. Also always having a positive and smiley attitude. 
But every time I would go to get my next plate of food they would be out of mostly everything...not being able to enjoy the different varieties without waiting for them to bring out more. 
Overall though the quality of food was actually good, I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I'm from PA and I'll still never forget this place. I don't know why it was the best thing I ever experienced. LV buffets are too expensive and over whelming. This was a little bit of a drive, but how could you beat an $8 buffet!? Big assortment, friendly staff, definitely would go back to if I was visit Vegas again. Not 5 stars because it wasn't the best quality, but you get more than what you pay for here."}
{"text":"I love this shrimp in coconut sauce. Oh so yummy. I seriously just load my plate up with the shrimp and get a second plate for fried rice. My husband really like the little fried donuts they have I call them Chinese donuts. Fried and cover with just regular sugar but pretty yummy. The ice cream machine never seems to be working but really who needs ice creamat a Chinese restaurant? The service is okay but it's a Buffett I font expect to have great service. Just clear the plate. All and all I love will come back, many, many times."}
{"text":"I like this place but just look out for the weird black spots on the crab. They have great selection the ice cream is kinda weird lol, but the place is pretty decent, people run for the crab & it's kinda crazy lol but just watch for the weird spots ."}
{"text":"All you can eat. Lunch with drink about $10 and dinner with drink about $15. They have a Mongolian Grill where you can pick your ingredients and the chef stir frys them for you. Be sure to throw some bean sprouts in for extra crunch."}
{"text":"At $12 per person, it's hard to have too high of a standard for any buffet. This one included. I suppose I got what I expected for the cost.

The food selection was decent and the quality was mid to lower mid grade. It's an Asian buffet and has all the typical things you would expect.  One nice addition was the Genghes Khan style stir fry station. 

If you're looking for a lower cost alternative to feed a group of people quickly and efficiently, then you may like going to Krazy Buffet. 

I would come back again if with a group, but not likely if it was just two or three people."}
{"text":"We went to lunch there today and we wanted to eat healthy.  They had a stir fry station.  It was delicious.  Sushi station.  It wasn't a lot of choices but they were all delicious.  Good service.  Drinks were always filled and they cleared played right away.  Will come here again."}
{"text":"You can never go qromg with an all you can eat buffet for less than $15 that serves seafood(crab legs, crawfish, oysters, shrimps, clams, squid, etc!) And there are plenty of dishes to choose from that are actually tasty and delicious! I come here with family often, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The price is good and the food is good for what you pay. The service is ok. They are little busy in the weekends but on week days it's so calm."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and I think it's very good! My food is fresh, about every 15min someone is coming out to add more food or change out food and the food itself is good! I've tried almost everything and it's very tasty. For $11.99 this is a great deal and can't complain. It is typically very busy but the people at the front are very accommodating and try their best to get you in as soon as possible. The server we had was really awesome, she was absolutely slammed and she always made sure we had fresh drinks, enough napkins, and took our dirty plates as soon as we were done. She was constantly smiling and was just overall really pleasant. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Alright. What can I say.  Krazy buffet is a very American style chinease place. WHICH I LOVE.  

It took a long time to find a chinease buffet in Vegas that didn't have octopuses and fish heads as main dishes.   This is a delicious American style chinease buffet general tso chicken  (or as they call it Orange Chicken... it's not. It's general tso) and sweet crab ragoon are my favorite.  

8 bucks for lunch. 
13 for dinner.  

The place is kind of dirty(which is why it gets 4 not 5 stars) but the food is always fresh and good."}
{"text":"I'm almost ashamed to even write this post, because I never usually eat at buffets, I swear. But here I am, once again, reviewing a buffet.  Me and my fiance' have joked about this place for quite some time, just because of the name.  Seriously, \"Krazy Oriental Gourmet\"?  Huh?  What the heck? I thought oriental referred to rugs now?  Maybe I'm wrong, not sure.  Anyway, we finally decided to give it a try about a month ago now, the first time, hehehe.  

It was so darn memorable the first time we went for lunch, I had to get me some more!  AND...I spotted that they have crab legs at night, and I'm a crab crackin' fool, LOVE me some crab!  The crab was nice, hot and fresh.  Thecooked veggies are amazing!  They even have a pretty nice salad bar and soft serve for dessert.  Plus it very clean.  I leave a very happy camper :-)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here regularly over the last year or so, Just started yelping so it's time to give them a review.

The time a day you go to this place really governs the quality and the freshness of the food in my opinion. I notice that when i go during the lunch hours, the food always seems the freshest.  Krazy Buffet is a pretty good place to eat at ,during my experience there today and on other occasions ,I have noticed that  the staff there really  seem to be concerned with the comfort level of the customer- Making sure your drinks are full- Making sure the food is good- asking if the temperatures OK-- But not overly did or annoying - really more so in the sense of being observant-  I appreciate that kinda stuff.

They have a large selection of Chinese and Japanese food to pick from. Ranging from sushi , noodles , sea foods  , fried rices, vegetables,coca-nut flavored chicken, soups, desserts -ect- - They also have a small selection of typical American likes--- like pizza , french fries ,ice cream , salads- ect.

The price seems to very as expected depending on what time of day you go. The same goes for the food. During the day the typical price is about 10 bucks and at night time depending on what kind of foods you desire- like crab legs for instance-- the price could reach up to 13 bucks-- But hey it's all you can eat.

 Any way I'm going to give them an overall star score of 4, because the food and the service have  been pretty consistent during every visit I have had, and for me that matters the most.-- Consistency. 

Hope this was useful to some one . ENJOY.!"}
{"text":"I ate at the Krazy Buffet for lunch on a Friday.  It was busy but always had a table open for people streaming in.  I was seated promptly, my drink order was taken quickly and I helped myself to several dishes that had shrimp and found them to be of average flavor and not anything that was over the top.  The chicken wings looked cooked perfectly but had no flavor...none...they were hot temperature but bland even though they looked good.  Their Hot Sour Soup was good but lacked that vinigar(?) flavor.  I tried small portions of several dishes and did not find anything that was so good that I would go back for, but none of it was \"bad\".  My drink was refilled quickly, however, I was puzzeled by a sense of invisibility while eating there.  No one asked if my food was good or if I liked what I was eating.  The wait staff spoke Chinese to each other and I think my dining experience could have been better had I been acknowledged or spoken to.  The overall rating of the food would be average or 1/2 a point below average.  I try to find positive issues when rating buffets,  as these places have a low margin of profit, and deserve fair and impartial comments.  So with that being said,  the place had ample parking, clean eating area, sufficient dishes to satisfy a lunch crowd that wants quick service, inexpensive food to cure the hunger and be on your way.  Should I eat there again, I will update my review."}
{"text":"I love going out to eat when it is just my wife and myself going. For the past few months we have gone almost weekly. Just the two of us. Today she and I were running a few errands and since she was driving, decided she wanted to eat at an Asian buffet for lunch.

We knew of the place Krazy Buffet on Sahara Avenue in Western Las Vegas and had been there before. So there we went.

I am still trying to figure out the \"Krazy\" part. Is the \"Krazy\" part the blatant mispelling of the word crazy in the name?  

The food was average at best. The servers brought us drinks, and cleared plates from the table but beyond that, nothing. Cost wise the bill for the two of us was between 22 and 23 dollars. Not bad at all considering we are in Las Vegas and buffets liter the city.

But even the fortune in my cookie was boring, \"You are interested in public service and would make an outstanding statesmen.\" Oh really? 

Sorry, just another buffet in Las Vegas, nothing crazy or even \"krazy\" here."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and their family.  We had 10 people in the group, we did not have to wait too long for a table.  When we sat down most of the group was able to begin serving themselves, however I waited to make sure I can take my time and discover some good food.  I guess I am still waiting to discover some good food, this place has plenty of seafood, but it is a buffet.  The quality is OK at best, the servers were very unhappy to be working, and the treatment of our group showed it.  

Is this a place I would be returning to, NO.  The staff tried to keep the place where the food is clean, but they also needed to keep the floors clean and the bathroom needed serious attention too.  The cost is reasonable, but it was funny because after coming here I was hungry an hour later, and yes I did eat well, just did not want to push anything that was smelling not fresh."}
{"text":"Me and BF went there. ....dirty place ! Crab legs, mussels  were old and smelly,tempura  ( sweet potato ) was rotten inside.....disgusting lost my appetite!  We complain to mgr.  He didn't care !!!"}
{"text":"12.99 Dinner..Not really worth it..Mostly avg everything..Good Cocunut shrimp, cheese rangoons, and sushi. Everything else was one bite and don't.touch it. Crab legs sucked. Lil man Owner looked like a jerk, as he patrols the place staring at customers and he has a permanent foochie face. His presence makes me never want to return, so I won't."}
{"text":"We have eaten here on three (3) occasions over the past 18 months, twice for dinner and our most recent experience for lunch. We have enjoyed it each time and we are fans for a Chinese buffet in this part of the city. The food has always been fresh and they seem to try and get fresh replacements out as soon as possible. They have quite a variety to choose from, including shrimp and seafood dishes at lunch (which is $5 cheaper). If you are looking for a somewhat cheaper (Chinese) priced buffet than many of the casinos offer AND are in this part of Vegas - give it a shot. It won't break the bank, or give you food poisoning. But, as usually with us, pigging out on Chinese food does make one want to take a nap afterwards!"}
{"text":"Tried many Chinese Buffets from Sacramento to here. This one is clean fresh and great crab legs for dinner. Their selection could be better, but if your a crab lover, cant beat it!"}
{"text":"Food was great, fresh rolled sushi, crab legs, soft shell crab, shrimp dishes, all you can eat at a very reasonabke $14...if course with every experience there are opportunities...they are motivated to get as many people in and out of there in a hurry, they have piles of dishes and trash visible by food stations, the server gave us an ice tea, that was watered down so we asked to change it to a pepsi, she brought back pepsi in same cup, i know it was same cup because it had same crack on rim and it had all the sugar from ice tea on bottom.  They could use a health department visit to get them back on track.  Again food great, service poor.  Maybe i will try the rainbow location to see if service is better."}
{"text":"Decent place for the price. Atmosphere is good and the service is good. Food was comparable to my regular spot Buffet @ Asia except they got salt and pepper shrimp daily. The only thing i didnt like is every time i go here they give you the check while you eat and don't even ask for it. Other than that it is a decent back up spot."}
{"text":"Selection is decent but the Crabs are awesome and bigger than most places. For the price alone killed them with the amount of Crabs I destroyed!!!"}
{"text":"If you like Asian food and you enjoy a buffet style meal then this is by far the BEST place in the city!
The prices are unbelievably amazing for the amount and value for money that you get and the food itself is so good! A personal fave is the crab coleslaw and the orange chicken as well as the white fish.
Even if you arrive at a busy time, there's lots of seating, so even with a wait it doesn't take too long before you can grab your favourites !"}
{"text":"Good buffet food its fresh and always nice... oh and they have a sushi bar with FRESH sushi and its descent. Its priced preety average also 11.49 on sundays dinner all day thats when I went same food they have at all chinese buffets. Well for some reason everytime chinese buffets get big they start making there shit cheap and nasty so its good."}
{"text":"I am amazed at the huge number of food critics in Vegas.

And I always thought the place was mostly hicks!

Anyway, Krazy Buffet isn't bad at all, kind of like most buffets, you go a couple times and find 5-6 things you  like.

It is almost worth going just for the chicken on a stick."}
{"text":"We were heading down from the mountains and we're hungry.  Some wanted sushi while some wanted crab legs.  We'll we Yelp on our way diwn and found this place.  It was a  find for sure..everyone's appetite was satisfied...even my pocketbook!"}
{"text":"Here on a Sunday afternoon, lots of cars in the parking lot so I thought I would see why.  $11.99 all day price, not bad but a little high for Vegas.  Food is average, didn't find anything special here.  Crablegs not worth the effort, sushi was good with a few choices.  Frogleg batter was really really salty. Place feels like a cafeteria.  Probably will never go back but I have had much worse at other \"chinese\" places.  Deserves a 2.5 star rating."}
{"text":"We stopped here after spotting it while driving down Rainbow Blvd.  We we're not disappointed!  We could not believe the variety of high quality options, including fresh sushi and crab legs.  The place was packed so the food does not sit long.  There was a create your own bowl in which they would cook your own creation for you -- great for vegetarians.  I found several foods that I thoroughly enjoyed and ate too much in the end!  There were so many things I wanted to try.  I really liked the friend bananas.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is awful I can't eve pick words. From the over cooked tiny crab legs to the all around over cooked horrific food. The statement you get what you pay for could not be more true never again!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Krazy Buffet after getting a coupon in the mail for $1 off... $10.99 for dinner, so $9.99 for me... how could I pass it?  I didn't expect much, as I've been to many Asian buffets and they've been sub-par.  But Krazy Buffet was pretty amazing.  Almost everything I tried was delicious, especially the coconut shrimp and crab legs, which were some of the best I've had at a buffet in town, including casino buffets.  They had some sushi on the buffet as well, and while it wasn't the best, it was actually BETTER than most hotel buffet's sushi.  For the price, I'll definitely be back, especially when they keep sending me coupons!"}
{"text":"I was a fan of the old Krazy Buffet and I'm a fan of the new one.  If you've never been, it's one of the best asian buffets.  Sushi is really good -- tonight I had some of the best salmon nigiri I've had in awhile, including regular sushi joints.  Dinner is $11.49, I believe, and they send out $1 or 10% off coupons semi-regularly.  It's almost 5 stars for me, but with Pacific Seafood Buffet being $7.49 for dinner without a coupon and having a better selection, I just can't.  But Krazy Buffet wins in customer service for sure!"}
{"text":"No bad ... Big variety .... Sea bass was surprisingly fresh .... The rice wasn't that great tho ...
But im a huge fan of seabass so it def gets a pass..!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, very small even in the Party Room.  I don't think it's worth the amount you pay even with the 10% off.  The imitation crab in the sushi had a weird texture because it was pre-frozen and thawed out.  The desserts aren't even very good and the white rice was hard and oily for some reason.

The service was good, our waitress was very efficient and polite, that's they only reason they get 2 stars."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet is by far my favorite asian buffet. Ive always went there and came out satisifed. Their food has always been fresh when I visit and this location has an area where you can choose your food and have them cook it for you ala mongolian bbq style.. Im hooked !!"}
{"text":"Been coming here sine the day it opened. However they quality of food has gone way down. Here first thing today the food is not even hot looks like someone forgot to turn on the warmers on time and just tired them on now. I do not know if I will come back again. Quality of food low, food is not hot.. Complained to the staff and manager said get food the bottom. NOT GOING TO COME BACK. DO NOT EAT AT KRAZY BUFFET"}
{"text":"Ok ok. Let's jump in realistically. For a cheap Chinese buffet- we're never going to have super fresh ingredients or experience the most delicious food we've ever eaten ever.

That being said-- as far as Chinese buffets go. This one is definitely my favorite! The Chinese food here is super good! I mean, don't come here looking for sushi or something fancy. But if you like creamy Crab Rangoon's, perfectly grilled chicken skewers, savory chow mein, crispy French fries, bomb diggity broccoli beef -- this is the spot for you.

You can compare it to Panda Express. Wait--- except it's unlimited, the food is not drenched in grease, and you can finish your meal with ice cream. Hm, I guess the only similarity is the price ;)

If you're craving a variety of Chinese food-- which I know we all eventually do at some point or another. Check this place out. You won't regret it. (:"}
{"text":"Me and my wife came with my other four family members to try this place, we had a OK welcome from the front desk typical asian dude with aggressive look (may be the manager) ... I was really surprise with the service and the food they were offering for the buffet. Verity is small, but small containers make the food fresh and quick change. 
I had three attempts with whole bunch of crab legs, muscles and other seafoods. Here  is the breaking one start for them.. Sushi bar.... most sushi are sitting long time and cant even eat bcos of the dryness. Dessert was OK, I know you can offer much for the $10 - $11...... But i want to tell one more thing about the waitress girl, i never seen a buffet lke this kind of fast service and she deserve extra $$$ for the tip finally :)
We will go back for sure...."}
{"text":"Food was fresh! Waiters were very attentive, extra napkins, drinks always filled n plates cleared right away! Awesome price for crab legs! N they werent the crappy kind, they cracked easy with plump juicy pieces in them....yumm!"}
{"text":"This is a good place 2 eat nice place if u want 2 just have someone 2 eat with and eat on some crab legs"}
{"text":"My friend took me to lunch here today. It's way across town from me and I wondered why we needed to drive so far for just a buffet. Well. I sure was surprised. It's nothing like the dreary Asia Buffet. I tried a great many different things and every single thing was just delicious. This is a really GREAT buffet. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place! Its pretty good compared to other cheap buffets and the quality is alright. Its definitely worth the $13.99 dinner especially if you're a seafood lover. I would recommend if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new, because we usually go to China Star. I looked up Krazy Buffett and thought it sounded decent. We were seated right away and the drink order was taken. All the food looked great and was very colorful. When we sat down one drink was missing, so we had to ask for it. They finally brought the other drink which was a tea, but no straw. I had to get up and ask for a straw. Long story short the waiters did nothing and were very cold and unfriendly.  We had to ask for refills on drinks and then they brought my man his tea in one of our pepsi cups. They didn't even dump the pepsi out first so it tasted funny. The only thing they did fast was to bring us our check. Just a weird vibe in this place like no one wanted to work. Seamed they stood around and talked in their language more than anything. Service...no bueno"}
{"text":"They have tremendous turn over, so the food is relatively fresh. As with most buffets, the sea food is over cooked are the noodles. But this place was very inexpensive. I would come here again"}
{"text":"I don't know why we somehow always end up at a Chinese buffet at least twice a month.  Maybe because it's cheap?  Maybe because there's a lot of selection?  Maybe because I like to risk a bad tummy ache?  It's probably a combination of all these things.

We usually end up visitin Krazy buffet because of the coupons...yep!  I've been able to find them almost weekly in some of our local neigborhood papers.  Not only there but you can sometimes find a coupon in the online version of the Las Vegas Review Journal, they have a coupon area on the website.  The coupon we use is good for 10% off lunch or 15% off dinner.  Or is it 15% off lunch and 10% off dinner?  I can't recall right now.  Either way, with lunch being only $6.99 and dinner being $10.99 (all you can eat seafood none the less) it's not a bad deal if you're pinching pennies or want a change from Panda Express.  That coupon helps, especially in our broke-A$$ economy.

The selection is not bad, but for myself I prefer lunch items over their dinner items.  I say this because darn near all their lunch items are served at dinner, with the exception of the addition of crab legs, sometimes a steak option...and sometimes fresh oysters.  One night there might be oysters but the next night there might not be.  I know, it's a bit of a throw off so check the buffet line at dinner if you really want oysters!  I prefer lunch because I don't eat that much crab legs, and I'm not all that hot on oysters so for me the savings of $4 is worth it.

The selection of food is pretty good at Krazy Buffet (there's more choices though at Buffet @ Asia) and they keep things pretty fresh.  Their operation is also clean, which is a big plus for me.  If you read my Buffet @ Asia review you would know that they have some sanitation issues (but why that doesn't stop me from eating there I don't know..I'm guessing it's their awesome garlic fried wings).  

Anyway, they have a lot of your typical dishes you would find at a Chinese buffet.  They have the requisite orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and fried rice and chow mein.  They also have things like sauteed mushrooms, steamed tilapia, teriyaki chicken, coconut shrimp, stir-fry veggies, and pork chops.  There's a sushi station but I kinda stay away from it because nearly everything is California roll-ish and not particularly great.  They have a decent salad station with fresh lettuce, fresh veggies, and a large bowl of shrimp for shrimp cocktail.  The soup station is limited, mostly your Chinese staples such as egg drop, won ton, and hot and sour soup.  They do have miso soup sometimes which of course is Japanese.  Krazy Buffet does have an array of fried foods (yah of course) that has fried chicken wings, egg rolls, chicken skewers, sweet and sour shrimp, sweet and sour pork, and even some Chinese doughnuts.  Most Chinese buffets have pretty basic dessert areas, and Krazy Buffet is no different.  They have pre bought almond cookies, fortune cookies, chocolate cake, carrot cake, and some smaller dessert stuff.  But they do have fresh fruit like strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, and canned lychee.  Of course there is a soft serve ice cream machine with vanilla or chocolate.  

Overall, not a bad deal for under $9 for lunch, tax and tip.  Especially if you got that coupon.  It's not a revelation in culinary arts, but the food will keep you full for 2 hours or so...like most Chinese food does for some odd reason.  Clean and efficient, not all Chinese buffets can achieve that.  I just wish their fried chicken wings were as scrumptious as the ones from Buffet @ Asia on Rainbow!"}
{"text":"A 3-star for sure.

For what this place is (a Cheapy Chinee Buffet) it fits the bill.  Nothing served here is all that impressive, but at least for the most part the place is clean.  The pricing doesn't impress me that much either, there are other Chinee buffets around town for the same price or cheaper that have the same type of food at the same quality.  I swear, you go here do not expect Cathay House type food!  Totally different!

All the usual suspects are here at this Krazy Buffet:

Fried Rice, Chow Mein, Beef & Broccoli, Sweet & Sour Pork, Orange Chicken (which by the way Panda Express does it better haha), Egg Rolls, Egg Fu Young, Mongolian Beef, various types of faux-shi (fake 'California' roll type sushi), Won Ton soup, and Hot & Sour soup.  Quite a number of dishes.  You also have the option of a Mongolian Bar included in the price where you can pick your veggies and raw meat from the serving line and have the chef du jour (in my case a young Mexican kid named Pablito..or was it Jose?) cook them for you in a teppanyaki manner.  

For the American crowd there is the added Fried Chicken Wings (the MSG added on the ones at Buffet @ Asia make them sooooo much tastier), French Fries and pizza for the kids too.  What is it about pizza at a Chinee buffet that makes it somehow good?  Must be the cheese?  Or is some secret MSG sprinkled on top for good measure?  Hmmm....

There's a decent looking salad bar but the dessert bar is a little lacking.  Come on, I love me some mini chocolate and powdered donuts... but how Chinee is that?  And of course there is the chocolate and vanilla soft serve machine.  

Food is ok, tasty if you're hungry and on a dime budget.  It will fill you up but somehow leave you feeling empty.  Then 2 hours later you are hungry again!  I'm an Asian boy (yes, part Chinee) so I'm not trying to be racist.  This is no joke for me.  Seriously.  I ate my fill here, left feeling a lil' bit queezy.  Then a few hours later I'm hungry again!  

Of course dinner may be better but I don't know.  I'm way too cheap of a Chinee at the moment to pay $12 per person for dinner.  I feel that the options for me are better for dinner at another buffet of the same type, although I will not mention names.  But I think I might have already earlier in my review.  My bad!  

Krazy Buffet is a good option for those of you on a tiny budget, but don't have a weak stomach!  Don't go here if you've got a sensitive tummy.  I know the place touts that they don't use MSG but man is some of their food a bit on the salty side!  So be sure to get an extra glass of water in to wash it down.  And perhaps a fortune cookie too."}
{"text":"This Asian cuisine buffet is cheap and tasty for the price. It's 12.99 per person and they also have crab as part of their food choices. This was my second time coming and the only complaint that I have is that they do not bring out the crabs that often. My friends and I were there for over an hour and the crabs only came out twice and was gone in less than 5 minutes. Many people wait for the crab to come, so we basically had to stare at the buffet area so we can get some when they brought it out. It's a little disappointing when you can't really go get food freely at a buffet. Also the service isn't that great either, but it's cheap so can't really complain too much."}
{"text":"This is the only location with CRAB LEGS CRAB LEGS CRAB LEGS 13.00 MUAH! 2017 I went to krazy buffet and this place is filled with Asian people like krazy lol. nice people good food no msg also. they fill up there food so fast so its always fresh and eveyone here is always nice fresh CRAB SHRIMP cali rolls FRESH OYSTERS and spare ribs so good they close at 9:30 pm so get there early.  Just dont eat the icecream arrive early"}
{"text":"This place is worth going too. I been eating here from the moment they opened but i only go for the shrimp and the crab and the unagi sushi. i dont really eat anything else i love the seafood part its not to far from my house so when i want to eat crab that evening i go with my teens and they love coming here we never got sick. nothing ever smells like its old. there is crab ever single night which is wonderful so if you want crab and shrimp come here and eat away its price never changes."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have tried both lunch and dinner and weekend for dinner is the only time to go.  Why?  Because they have oysters, crab legs, crab clusters, green shell mussels, crayfish, and clams.  In case you didn't notice - that's all seafood.  If you don't like seafood, don't bother going there for dinner.  Also don't go if you can't eat $20 worth of crab legs that you only paid $11 for.  It's not worth the price for you.  Seriously if you don't like seafood then you will not like it.  If you are a seafood snob it is also not the place for you - in other words don't bother if you ask questions like \"is this seafood responsibly sourced?\" or \"is this Salmon farm raised or line caught?\".  Just don't bother.  It's also not the place to impress a date.  Romantic? Nope.  Fancy?  Nope.  Dressy?  Wrong again.  Casual all the way.

And you have to accept this simple fact and go with it:  it's not the best place in the world to eat, but for the price it's not bad.  It has a lot of really crappy food in the pans, but it also has a few items that I really crave.  The servers work hard and are always there to take away empty plates, to bring drinks, and to take care of whatever you ask.  

I have about only ten items I eat here and I enjoy them.  I don't like their deserts. I don't like their sushi.  I occasionally eat some Mongolian BBQ.  I focus on hot and cold seafood.  Shrimp, crab, oysters, mussels, clams, crayfish, fish.  That is all.

Where else can you go on a Friday and get AYCE real crab for $12.99 ?"}
{"text":"First, it's a buffet so it's not the best food you can buy. I'm giving it 5 stars in comparison to buffets in general and other relative factors.

We went in at 3pm and it was $9 per adult till 4pm. We thought the offering might be thin due to the time but they had everything. The place is not that big and the furnishings, decor and restrooms are well worn and tired. The service, well, it's a Chinese buffet so don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. 

The food was salty as expected but still pretty good. They were placed in small trays and rotated often. Everything seemed fresh and nothing was terrible. Overall, we were pleasantly satisfied and stuffed ourselves appropriately. 

Resist the urge to go for the oysters on the half shell and crab legs they start bringing out at 4pm for the dinner menu and you won't have the rude experience of having the manager come to your table to tell you that you'll get charged the full dinner price of $13. A woman at the table next to us nearly got into an argument over that one. And, skip the soda. It's a buffet for Pete's sake! Whattaya doin' getting filled up on soda and paying extra for it?!"}
{"text":"The food here was OK, its any typical Chinese buffet/restaurant that I could find on the east coast. But I must say that the sushi section was great, along with the crab legs they had."}
{"text":"U get what u pay for. The food isn't amazing, but it's not bad. The price is great! Service is good as well. If your looking for some good cheap all u can eat crab legs and Chinese food this is the place."}
{"text":"First time coming here and the food was good. Everything was fresh and they know when to refill their food. Took off a star bc the ice cream machine was broken and they wouldn't know when the machine will be fixed. Took another star off bc toward the end of the dinner they were rushing us to pay for the check.... Sheesh just wait can't you?"}
{"text":"Lunch is the best time to go. Hot and sour soup on the buffet. It's good for what it is. It's the only \"fairly good\" Chinese buffet in the north west."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time last night and really enjoyed it. Our friends live close by to it and they eat there often, so we decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed...

I started off with a nice, steaming plate of Mongolian BBQ that I got to put together myself with what veggies and meat I wanted. I ended up getting noodles, beef, chicken, shrimp, sprouts, onions, mushrooms, bell pepper, and broccoli. I didn't add any sauce because when it was cooked, it came out perfectly seasoned from whatever the guy poured on the grill. The meats tasted very fresh and the beef was especially tender. A+ on the Mongolian BBQ!

I had one of each of several of the sushi choices. They had a nice array of different rolls to choose from. Very nice selection. The only thing about the sushi I can say is that a lot of them tasted the same, so they seemed to use a lot of the same ingredients (imitation crab, mainly). However, they did have a very good selection of sashimi, so you could try all the different types of meats that way.

The hot food section didn't have quite as much variety as other, bigger Asian buffets have, but what they had was delicious. I especially enjoyed the Sea Bass and cream cheese rangoons. The rangoons were perfectly bite-sized and had wonderful, rich flavor. They could have used a little more crab in the rangoons, but they were delicious the way they were.

We did have to wait quite a while for our check, but the server kept our drinks refilled pretty well overall. The people working the front counter and behind the sushi/Mongolian sections were more friendly than the servers, but the servers seemed polite enough. The restaurant on the whole seemed very clean. The restroom smelled actually wonderful (weird, I know, lol) and was clean. They offer a gigantic bottle of hand sanitizer at the door, which is a nice perk. (If only they could make each person use it as they walk in! But then again, you can lead a horse to water...)

So, overall, a good restaurant-going experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet so many times, and it was my favorite. I always come to eat crab legs they are the best. My sister and I came to eat today 12/9/2015 and we were blown away from what we saw. We were almost finish eating  when out of nowhere looking up at the roof we seen RATS crawling right on top where the food is at. We were not the only ones that saw it 4 other customers that were in the same section we where seated saw it. We asked to talk to the manager to tell him what we saw and apparently he already knew about the rat infestation problem. He said he had already contacted Pest Control and they have not yet fix the problem.. We were all so disgusted we did not pay for our meal. Those RATS WERE SO BIGGGGG!!! don't know how long they been there. They need to close down that restaurant. I will be reporting them to health department!!!"}
{"text":"Time of visit May 28, 2009. Not quite sure if I liked this buffet or not? It was OK priced, and the food was OK. There were some dishes that i liked and some I didnt. Ive never really been to a good Chinese buffet in the first place, so I dont have much to compare it to. I went on a Friday during lunch, it was busy, but not unbearable. I might try it one more time to confirm if its a go or not."}
{"text":"Really boring and bland food, not many options. I've been to at least 6 other Asian buffets in Las Vegas, and this one is near the bottom of the list in terms of food. Decorations are fairly decent and staff is friendly. Plus they charge 2.79 for drinks when most others include the drink. Better you go to a different Asian buffet."}
{"text":"For a reasonably priced Asian Buffet, Krazy Buffet is the place to visit. Avoid the early morning rush around 11:30am-12pm on Saturday's as wait times can get as long as up to 30 min to an hour! Food taste wise is alright, not the greatest but hey, you get what you pay for right? Although I do admit the selection of food is pretty good from sushi, to chinese, to pizza? Large dessert section too to keep the little ones, and adults happy. :)"}
{"text":"Basic Chinese food restaurant. Below average food and flavor. Poor dining experience. Saw two bugs in the main food area that looked like some sort of small roach, one of which crawled under into where food was being served."}
{"text":"Plenty of food to choose from, but nothing really caught my taste buds. Service was poor and we were greeted terribly by hostess. She would ignore the questions she didn't know the answers to or would simply look away. The price is great and cheap for a buffet but this is definitely not quality food or service."}
{"text":"Inexpensive. Delicious. Great service. Had a great time with my family. Recommend to others."}
{"text":"This buffet has a very good variety of options.  The food is pretty good, but not really top quality.  Yet the price is low.   If you  like asian food, certainly try."}
{"text":"A decent buffet, I think, but my husband didn't like it. As far as asian buffets go, Buffet at Asia is better. I was on a restricted diet (at the time) but I still managed to find some dishes to eat (sauteed veggies, some seafood dishes, steamed clams, green lettuce salad), although, I'm pretty sure, my doc would've advised me not to go here (Asian food is very high in sodium). This place was busy when we went. There was a large party (for a christening), and this was lunch time, too. The dish replacement was pretty good, maybe because this was a busy time. The manager caught a patron \"picking\" at the seafood dishes, and warned him not to do that next time. 

Large selection and choices, average rating, quick dish replacement, pretty cheap deal for lunch. But, like I said, my husband didn't like it (so I don't think that we are going back). We were celebrating our nephew's birthday. Our party was split into three or four tables. Clean dining area- tables & chairs, the booths were on the side."}
{"text":"keazy Buffet from the outside looks old BUT as soon as you enter you eill see a veey clean and modern restaurant. Looks can be deceiving from the outside. food assortment is huge. this particular location has a mongolian buffet station. it has the various seafood and chinese food. food is good and price is so affordable. if ypu check in tbrough Yelp ypu get a 15% discount."}
{"text":"Wow, really impressed. First time here. Came in on a Friday around 2:00 pm. For the price you pay ($9.50 after tax lunch buffet) the selection is big, fresh AND tasty. The service was most impressive. As soon as my plate was empty the server swooped in and cleared it from the table. My beverage was never empty either. Great experience. Not one negative here. I'll be back for sure.

My fortune cookie reads \"Don't let unexplained situations throw you.\"

I hope your experience will be as good as mine. :-)"}
{"text":"Okay buffet as far as Chinese buffets go in Las Vegas. NV can learn a lot from NY about Chinese food and especially buffets. In North Las Vegas this is your best option as there are not many of them. They do have Sushi but not the freshest I have had. Last time we ate my daughter said the crab legs were very gross, old with moss on them, so for the money and location it will do but if you have time go to Buffet Asia off of Charleston downtown, much better!"}
{"text":"military/1st responder discount!  I support those that support me.  
- hit up the mongolian buffet, once.  decent with the solid standards of veggies/meat. 
- the whitefish sashimi was crap.  tough, iced, not good.  rolls were ok. 
- the clams and mussels were rubbery
- hot entrees had a good variety of fried and sauced veggies and meat, lots of jalapeno enhanced dishes to please my spicy savory cravings. 
- wait staff were busy and prompt
- plenty of clean dishes and were good on cleaning up after messy customers.  there were more than a few fat slobs in front of me.  I mean untidy customers...haha


- overall, i'd bring a few friends there that I liked.  I'd go for the noodles and veggies, probably make a mushroom and ginger mongolian entree, served over chow mein.  

enjoy!"}
{"text":"Improper food handling on dining room tables!!! We were eating thought the food was good. All nice and fresh and warm. But they were not wearing gloves at first the. They put some on.  Prepping food at the table instead of the kitchen"}
{"text":"Totally a true shit hole. The hole place is a shit hole.
The food looked like it fall out of a shit hole. Don't waist your time go somewhere else..
I give it zero stars.."}
{"text":"A friend treat me here for dinner and this is my second time here. I think it got its name right. Crazy enough that there's barely anything to eat. Everything is dry and some trays only have a couple piece in the tray, which looks really sad. Even if I want to try the dishes they have, there's nothing in there but crumbs. They didn't bother replenishing the trays and left it there. In my opinion, buffet @ Asia is better. This is the same experience I had 3 years ago, no change. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Always love coming here been eating here since we lived in Summerlin love the cashier always greetings us with smile"}
{"text":"This buffet is pretty good for their affordable price of $12.99 for dinner. They have dinner all day on Sunday's. They have lots of seafood choices here. It includes crab, oysters, shrimp, crawfish, fish, Mongolian BBQ, and other food. I didn't try their sushi. The fish didn't look super fresh. I had good customer service. The server took all my dirty dishes away and refilled my water."}
{"text":"This is a value buffet, nothing fancy, still a descent selection of seafood like steamed seabass, spicy deep fried squid, crab legs, ceviche, etc. They also offer a small sushi corner, along with other Asian classics such as sweet & sour chicken, beef broccoli, chowmein noodles, fried rice, etc., all well seasoned. There is even pizza, fries and chicken wings for kids. A great value, a good place when you're hungry and don't quiet know what to chose; they have a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. I've been going to these Chinese buffets since I moved here in '02 but most of the time their food is sub par and the restaurant is pretty dirty, but not at krazy. The place is very clean and food is fresh. Other places lack flavor or variety, and they usually offer fried foods since its cheaper probably. Krazy has steamed fish and their chow mein was flavorful (unlike most buffets where it's just oil and sodium). They have seafood and a wide variety of meats and veggie dishes. Krazy also offers one of the biggest selection of desserts I've seen when it comes to Chinese buffets. Buffet @ Asia used to be good but maybe I've found a new favorite..."}
{"text":"We give this place 4 stars for their VERY affordable price and decent food quality. Its buffet  chinese food ok. They have good servers despite of their cheap customers. One star less because their host/cashier staff aren't great and the sushi are not good but hey, its not a Japanese restaurant.

Hubby and I come here about once every 3 months or so when we have a great crave for crab legs and feeling cheap to go elsewhere. Plus the only meat I eat is seafood and am very picky with so we like that this place always has something for me (crabs and some shrimp) instead of going elsewhere paying a fortune and I don't touch any of the other entrees. But really this place is CHEAP! The service is good. There are a couple of gals that we really like having as servers, one of them is Jenny. They refill drinks, check back on you and clean up your mess constantly. The guys not so much. You have to flag them just to get a refill. Also don't hesitate to ask for extra crackers since they only give one per table, they are whiling to give you more if you just ask. We took my dad here this past Sunday for dinner. He was amazed how cheap the price was and pointed that this place was A LOT cleaner than the other place, Buffet@Asia lol. I've been there probably 5 times. First time with my husband and the rest because some family/friends dragged me there and couldn't be too picky because I wasn't paying. Anyway, we were talking about how cheap the cost of the dine was and how worth it it was. We noticed how other tables around us didn't seem like they tipped much or at all. We weren't trying to look and talk about how much other people tipped and what not we individually noticed how cheap their customers can be. Food was CHEAP, quality was decent and service was decent. We felt bad. We follow our standard of doubling tax for a basic eh, so so service and triple for a good service. But not tipping is just plain RUDE. Don't eat out if you \"won't\" tip. Its Vegas people! Yes, it is their jobs but these employee ofter depend on tips to make a living.
We get it IF the service was bad and not tipping can probably justify that but like said servers were decent. Its a buffet restaurant, do you really expect your servers to chat with you?

This is our favorite Chinese buffet restaurant just to put it out there."}
{"text":"The Most frustrating thing about this whole experience-Rosemary's Restaurant is hidden behind this place in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday.   I haven't ate here in a long time and even though it's been that long. The food refreshed my taste buds.  So I haven't forgotten how good it is.  My friend also wanted to try because he heard rumors about this place.  I must say I was a little disappointed because they used to have anime scrolls on the walls and different anime series.  So I miss seeing them on the wall.  I wonder why they took them off the wall?!?!?  Hmm.....  Anyways, past is the past and it's time to move on.  Their sushi is the bomb.   They have more variety of sushi then any other asian 
buffets I went too.  Customer service is excellent.   They always make sure your drinks are always filled.  Your never going to be left thirsty. I'm definitely going to come back here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times, including today. Mostly for lunch. To me, this place is one of those places where you can expect good food for a cheap price. This place definitely delivers that much.

For $8.29, the food is pretty good. You have your Chinese-American regulars, such as orange chicken, wonton soup, dumplings, fried rice, chow mein, etc. But you also have steamed fish, pork ribs, clams, vegetable tempura, Americanized sushi, and... *trumpet sounds* a soft serve ice cream machine.

They have a pretty good assortment of food choices. I personally prefer to get a cheap Chinese chicken wing craving fulfilled here during lunch. Plus, their apple strudel dessert is one of my personal favorites. For those with kids, don't fret, because they have french fries and pizza for them little picky eaters.

A positive thing to note is that they have salt & pepper shrimp WITH the head and legs on. You can eat the whole thing. And I just love that salt & pepper taste.

The restaurant interior is nice, but it reminds me of when I used to live in less-than-ideal areas. The seats are kind of sticky and graffiti in the restroom is noticeable. However, I don't really mind since I know I'm getting a decent meal at a very affordable price.

Overall, this place is one of my go-to spot for a cheap lunch. All of the food here is pretty good and you won't break the bank eating here.

PS. You can print out a coupon from their website, ranging from 10-15% off, depending when you use it."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet is nice and clean on the outside as well as inside. This is your typical American-Chinese buffet food enhanced with MSG and there's also soft serve, crab legs, and those bananas in strawberry sauce - why is it always bananas in strawberry sauce?? Haha. 

SUSHI LIMITATIONS.
I honestly enjoyed the food here since I love MSG but the \"buffet\" in their name was a misnomer on this visit because the employees and sushi chefs gave dirty looks and told me not to get a lot of sushi in the sushi station. It's funny 'cause they were cautiously staring at everyone who went to the sushi station.  \"All you can eat\" is proudly displayed on the signage outside as well as inside so it's fucking CLEAR that the sushi is also ALL YOU CAN EAT - WTF? I give them the benefit of the doubt and understand that sushi tends to cost more and the labor involved in crafting the pieces entails skill and time but if they want to limit the amount of sushi a patron can indulge in, an asterisk and disclaimer underneath the \"All you can eat\" sign would help!! :P Or don't serve sushi AT ALL if you're gonna be stingy about it - Jesus Christ!

FOR EXTREME COUPONERS.
Other than that sushi BS, the lunch and dinner prices are affordable: Lunch - $8.29 and Dinner - $12.99. There's also a 10% OFF coupon on their website! :)"}
{"text":"I honestly would give this place a 1 star, but I will give it SOME benefit of the doubt.

Hell, this will be the first 1/2 star score I have given as a yelper.  

I will start out by saying that I ate at a different Krazy Buffet several months ago and it was the worst place I have ever ate food at.  I didn't have a yelp account back then but my roommate \"loved\" the place.  He convinced me to come here and I figured, \"Grand Opening, they should be trying hard to impress!\"

So, I grab some orange chicken, BBQ pork, fried rice and some sweet and sour chicken to start out with (and a side of wanton soup).  The Orange chicken was luke warm and just flat out soggy with awful texture, I wasn't a fan at all.  I couldn't finish the wanton soup, the fried rice was a nice buffer to get the taste out of the orange chicken out of my mouth. And the BBQ Pork did taste like candy, which was pretty random.

So, I was unimpressed from the start.  But hey, I got to keep trying more food.  I grabbed some sushi (they actually have a decent amount of sushi selection so that's a plus), teriyaki chicken, some \"french fries\" and a couple other random selections.

I just don't know how or why all of the food I kept eating felt like I was barely experiencing any flavor.  And it's also pretty sad that my favorite thing to eat were the french fries.  Actually, I jumped the gun, the sushi did seem fresh and I did enjoy the roll with eel on top.

The service was LOL bad, I think the waiter came by once and asked us if we needed a refill.  Then as he refilled out cups, he spilled some water (somewhat noticeable) on my roommates food.  He probably didn't notice, but the waiter completely ignored what he had done then walked off.

I'm gonna stick to my hometown buffets where the food is always fresh, delicious, and very professional, for nearly half the price.  Geez, I honestly hate giving bad reviews but dammit this place caused me to write a yelp review after a 3 month hiatus.  If anyone knows of some good Chinese buffets I am all ears

tl;dr version - bad all around, except for some sushi.  Even though it says 2 stars, I give this place 1.5 stars. I won't come back here again"}
{"text":"So...the krazy buffet gave me krazy diarrhea. We should've known that it was a red flag when we noticed that the restaurant was dead, hence the lack of food rotation. Do you know what happens to shellfish when it sits there for quite some time? Food poisoning. Which is exactly what I got."}
{"text":"Not bad for an AYCE place!  Food was fresh and hot, restaurant and restrooms were clean and well maintained, service for the semi-private banquet room was good, our server was in top of it! Kept the drinks filled, table cleared and check brought promptly."}
{"text":"Lots of variety of foods.  Lots of crab and something for everyone.

Pricey. 

However, every time my mom eats here, she gets diarrhea.  Though the food is super tasty, I always feel a little lightheaded and dizzy eating from here."}
{"text":"Not a bad deal.  There are  coupons out there for ten percent off. They keep your drinks full and your table clean.  Very friendly.  Quality is ok.  Lots of seafood selections. Skinny crab legs. Mmmm. Seaweed salad next to sushi."}
{"text":"Some items were better than average! The crab legs and fried crab were very tasty. Also the green beans were crisp and crunchy. Apple pie and pretty decent soft serve ice cream finished the meal. Place is clean for a buffet and service is attentive."}
{"text":"We came for dinner with a 10% off coupon from the newspaper.  It was located on W Sahara Ave/near S Cimarron Ave in Las Vegas.  They have a large parking lot.  I was a little scared to try the buffet after reading the reviews, but it was okay.

At dinner they serve steamed snow crab legs and clams.  They have assorted sushi, pot stickers, egg rolls, fried chicked wings, fried shrimp, won ton soup, pizza, kalbi, kimchee, and all the typical Chinese entrees, etc.  The dessert section was limited.  They had packaged almond cookies.

There was a tall set of lockers for employees to keep their belongings in the back of the restaurant.  One employee was taking her break checking her cell phone and having a beverage.  It was just odd to see her standing there behind some customers.

I would come back for $7 lunch."}
{"text":"If you happen to be driving around this area and looking for a restaurant, come check this place out.  You must try there fried rice, coconut chicken and cocktail shrimp, all are absolutely delicious.  Dining area is spacious and comfortable."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations one time and thought the Sahara property would somehow offset Rainbow. I was wrong. The food is all cheap and the $12 dinner price point is still too expensive. They may try to lure people with the crab legs but they are almost uneatable. As cheap as this place is run they would be able to turn a profit at 6.99. 
Two stars because it's still a buffet for about 10 bucks although after tax and a 2 dollar tip you're at 15. Even the lesser expensive Vegas casinos buffets are better than this place."}
{"text":"For a small convenient Asian buffet, I suppose you can't expect 5 star quality. That doesn't mean they should stop trying. We went on two separate occasions because we believe that even businesses have off days. Both times were unsatisfactory. Food was either cold, flavorless or extremely salty. If you're looking for something relatively cheap and quick. Sure, have at it. But if you're entertaining guests, I would probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My friend and I often meet here about once a week after she gets off of work because it's close to her job. The food is good and it is fresh. There is a lot of foot traffic so they are constantly putting out new trays of food. I like that they have sweetened green tea here and Lotus balls.The won tons and the chow mien are also pretty decent here. The service is very prompt because my glass was constantly filled. I didn't have to hunt down anyone to do that like at some places. The bill for two people to eat including tax and drinks was $16.72 . This was also with a 10% discount . The coupons could be found in The View in their food section. I thought for the price we paid it was a good deal!"}
{"text":"I usually frequent the old Krazy Buffet on Sahara but definitely wanted to check this place out. The decor is much nicer with their mosaic tiles and glass light wall. They had most of the same food as the other one except they have a Mongolian bowl section where you can pick your noodles, veggies and meat and have them grill it for you. It was so good! I didn't even need Siracha! It tasted better than Chow Mien ! I wanted to try to have them make my bowl with rice but I didn't know if that was allowed. I was to shy to ask ...like usual. Some of my other favorite items to get here are the baked seafood in a crab shell, cream cheese won-tons, Lotus balls and Walnut Shrimp. Yum! 

If you want to get Krazy ...it's your birthday ...yeah ...yeah. They have a private room in the back for that. It's close to the food so if you had too much birthday cake but you can't say no to another plate of food it's in stumbling distance."}
{"text":"So I tried to be nice in my original post but the hits just keep coming. Seafood is either under cooked or over cooked. Almost everything is ice cold. I tried several (and yes more than 10) different items. Some better than other but all in all they fell flat even by low expectations. The more I tried the worse it got. Our party of five (3 adults, 1 teenager and 1 child) usually eat a little of everything at most buffets we go to and we did the same here. We shared our plates with each other and it was just awful. 

I gave this place two stars for a few reasons.
1. The wait staff is attentive, clearing plates and refilling drinks quickly. 
2. The sushi station offered several different styles, although all was made with imitation crab, Andrea one of the two edible things we found here.
3. The bbq station was by far the most edible station and we actually enjoyed eating our choices.

All in all, there are hundreds of buffets in Las Vegas. As a local, I know that I will find a better one. Worse case scenario, I drive back to Pahrump when I was a decent Asian buffet without paying $100+ per plate."}
{"text":"They seasoned the clam parasites perfectly. The servers had the sharpest eyes its almost as if they wanted us to leave. The coconut chicken was bulimia-tastic. I left thinking what a great place to eat at be cause its not going to end badly like soobway. Will see how it goes down later. The food had this unique texture I think its what you call stale . the food price was weak ."}
{"text":"For the price. Pretty damn good. Lots of sea food- not amazing quality but not bad at all either. Great selection and again it's cheap AF."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet is an amazing blending of a good price and fantastic all you can eat sushi I mean seriously you cant beat this deal in vegas,

 if you attempt to you will more than likely be disappointed :D"}
{"text":"Large roach crawling under the tables. I reported to the manager and all they were interested in was collecting my payment.  They acted like it wasn't anything new to them.  I got super sick from esting here 6 months ago and decided to give them another chance...no more!  I watched a kitchen worker fill a plastic tub that was sitting on the bare floor and take it to the sushi counter...cross contamination!"}
{"text":"We went here on a friend's recommendation for a quick lunch.  We were seated almost immediately and the waitstaff was quick and attentive in keeping drinks filled.  

The selection was pretty good for a mixed asian cuisine buffet.  They had a small selection of sushi rolls (non were labeled as to what kind of rolls they were, which I did not like.)  

Every other food item was clearly labeled and nothing appeared to have been sitting too long.  All of the food was pretty good, better than many other chinese buffets around town! There is a selection of 4+ soups which is great too.  My friend had the hot and sour and did not enjoy as it seemed like a mix of hot and sour and eggdrop.  The wonton soup was tasty however, and the fried bread with sugar was a great dessert item!  

I left full and would go again.
The price for two with soft drinks was under $25."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The place is really small, crowded, run down and loud. We were also the only Caucasians. The choices on the \"bars\" are very limited. The parking and access to the front door were difficult.  We've definitely been to better buffets. Maybe the one on Sahara is better? Not sure. Probably not coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Ah, my love hate relationship with this buffet. I've been here a few times now and it's always a great idea until afterwards when I get home and my tummy is rumbling. Maybe it's the mixed of different things at one time or just plain overeating, but whatever it is my stomach just does not agree with this place.

Selection wise they really have a little bit of everything - salad, sushi, egg rolls, cream cheese wontons, coconut shrimp, crab legs, broccoli chicken, and anything else you can think of. The price is also super reasonable too, but they do charge around $2 for soda/tea so if you're looking to conserve some money, stick to water. 

It's still a go to every now or then when my boyfriend and I are just feeling extra fat and craving Asian food, but it's not somewhere I'd go on the regular."}
{"text":"First thing I notice when we walked in was that this place is nice and clean!!. Lots of food selections and the best thing is that the price is affordable!. servers made sure we don need anything. The host guy (I think was the owner) was really friendly and professional. Will definitely be back soon!."}
{"text":"Your typical, run-of-the-mill chinese buffet. Good price, fair selection, alright quality. Pretty busy and the other patrons were fairly rude/inconsiderate of other customers."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet is a great location for a quick, Asian buffet experience. It is very inexpensive and the quality is actually BETTER than the price reflects. There are more expensive places with a wider range and quality of food, but the prices are markedly higher than that of KB."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about a $10.99 all you can eat buffet (that wasn't subsidized by a casino).  But Krazy Buffet easily won me over and I will be back.  

Lots of different offerings including plenty of fish and shrimp.  The all you can eat crabs legs were good, but a little small.  They had a good selection of nigiri and sushi, and it was the best buffet sushi I ever had.  But don't go for the sushi alone, because this restaurant really shines at the tried and true chinese staples - sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, garlic shrimp, etc.

I was also suprised by how good the service was.  I will be recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"The buffet was good and the service was good. There was a good selection of food for a Chinese buffet. It is what it is plain and simple. The reason I'm giving 3 stars however is because the most crucial thing for me is that they did not have there food warmers turned up. So the food was barely warm. It just wasn't warm enough for me to eat. Also the price for 2 adults came out to 31.00 approximately. They do not include the cost of drinks. No free refills."}
{"text":"Not wanting to spend $35+ per person at a buffet on The Strip we decided to give Krazy Buffet a try and it hit the spot for only $12! There was some decent sushi, delicious clams, and great service. I never expect to have great sushi at a buffet, however, they made theirs right in front of you so it was freshly made. There was a lot of dishes to choose from and everyone was able to find something they enjoyed. Too bad we didn't go for dinner because they would of had crab legs! I'm sure we will keep this place in mind when we are back in Vegas."}
{"text":"i don't think you can get all you can eat crab legs & raw oysters anywhere else for $10.99!  those 2 dishes & the walnut shrimp were totally worth it. the crab does stick to the shell & is skimpy on meat, so u have to dig for the good legs, but that's the trade off."}
{"text":"Food was decent for a buffet, nothing spectacular but decent Chinese food. They filled the drink glasses as soon as they were empty so that was nice as well. The bathrooms left a LOT to be desired for cleanliness. The doughnuts are worth going for if you get them when they first come out! Man they were good!!"}
{"text":"For a local buffet that's quick for lunch or dinner, the place isn't bad. The only issue I have is during dinner time. I've been here the total of 5X's. Every time I've been here it's been a war when it comes to getting Crab Legs lol. I swear it's like a battle of who gets there first. The other issue I notice is the amount of Crab Legs they actually brought out. By now, the Buffet should know that everyone's here for the Crab Legs. Granted you have to wait & be patient. But by the time they brought it out, it's only a small amount. So the first ones that are there reaps the whole tray. I'm not sure if this is there way or conserving there stock for the upcoming days but I don't get how you charge for Dinner time knowing Seafood (Crab Legs) is part of the cost per person. Then again, you have those that stacks there plate up to the roof with Crab Legs and have the audacity to come back and get more lol. Oh well."}
{"text":"Always friendly service and good food. My daughter's favorite spot, close to the office so I'm a regular. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The price is great. The food is average but every time I go it is always fresh and hot. The staff are always very attentive."}
{"text":"The casino should take example from this small buffet.  They have a great selection and super price! And the food was really good, considering that it is a buffet.  Fresh sushi as well!  And only  12.95 per person.  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Usually good. Came in an hour before closing and the hot entrée were empty. Never restocked as more customers came in.  Last guest should have same experience as first guest."}
{"text":"AYCE Chinese buffets have been a favorite of mine since the mid-90s when I used to frequent the (now closed unfortunately) Top Buffet in Wilmington, Delaware.  This place has a lot going for it, but also has some not-so-good things going for it.  Mostly the good outweighs the bad.  The bad stuff primarily stems from the people that can often be seen there.  

Once when my fiancée and I went, we noticed a little boy that was dropping his food all over the floor, then proceeded to crawl down and eat it...OFF THE FLOOR.  His Mother was either not noticing this at all, or simply ignoring him.

Another time we went, we had to endure a large party of people with screaming kids whose parents just kept yelling at them to settle down, which obviously didn't help.

Again, these are matters that aren't the restaurant's fault, but I do think they should be wary of people that are making unnecessary loud noises or shouting, disturbing other patrons of the place.

The food though is delicious.  I love their salt and pepper squid, the meatballs on a skewer, the steamed pork buns, and the coconut shrimp!

Not too big a fan of their sushi selection, but thankfully I can enjoy sushi at a wide variety of other places here in town my fiancée and I frequent!

Plus, you never know who you may run into while eating! One time we ate there, we saw Joe Jackson (Michael's Father) come in to eat!"}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday for lunch at around 2 pm. It was about 3/4 full of people so the food was fresh, at good temperature and constantly being replenished. I'm not sure how it is when it's emptier. I am a huge Chinese Buffet fan and since I moved to Las Vegas I had yet to find one so I went searching for one. This is my to-go buffet for lunch now! It has all the classic favorites, some a bit packed with sodium but as is most West Coast Chinese food. I can't wait to go back honestly."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive seafood. Great quality and quantity.  Kids under 3 are free.  The food is very fresh. If you come after 6:30 pm expect to wait.  It is worth the wait. Cheapest buffet in Vegas."}
{"text":"Felt like having something that resembled Chinese food so I came back here a second time for dinner instead of lunch. They didn't disappoint. Dinner consisted of crab legs, oysters, fried shrimp, clams, white fish, chicken, beef broccoli, etc. hate to say it but they cook similar to my mom but better. Yes, it's sad. I have one of those moms. Where I really don't want to go home and eat her cooking. The selection here is pretty decent. I did not bother to try sushi bc I go to a sushi restaurant for those. But it looked ok. The oysters were pretty good.

They had 4 soups of wonton, beef, sweet and sour, egg drop, the usual suspects. So the wonton soup was only ok but I stuck green onions on my beef broth as it was good enough. I find that coming in with low expectations makes everything not that bad. They had quite a few desserts. The macaroons are soft and tasted ok. Had grapes and watermelon for dessert. Watermelon was crunchy.

Service was ok. Most smiled at me as I passed them and my plates miraculously disappeared when I came back. I dined Han Solo so had a chance to actually eat and observe quite a bit. I don't know why ppl complain so much for a $14 dinner buffet. A Korean and Japanese one starts at $26.

This is the kind of place where parents with loud screaming kids like to come. And yes, every time I am here they do not disappoint and bring their h e double hockey sticks spawn with them. Must be glorious to have such wonderful little buggers."}
{"text":"I don't really understand what all the Krazi-ness is all about? Why did they name this place Krazy Buffet? 

Well whatever the case is, for $10.99 a head for dinner, you will get your money's worth after having 4 oysters.  Yup, read 'em and weep.  They are KRAZY to charge this amount of money for all this seafood

That includes some pretty tasty snow crabs as well.  Oh how I love thee seafood!!!!

Bathrooms a wreck though.  2 stalls only, but one is out, equals disaster. 

Pretty large selection of Chinese food, but all of it tends to be on the oily side so I stay clear of it.  The salt and pepper shrimp and crab are pretty good though"}
{"text":"I love this place very inexpensive, very good food, and very friendly people. I love when you arrive and you are greeted by the great man that helps you to be seated. I love the variety of food. Food is great the people are great and the restaurant is so clean"}
{"text":"I love the food here I love the service here I went for lunch thinking that it was dinner all day on Saturday but instead it was dinner all day started on Sunday but to my surprise even lunch was good had a lot of seafood what I was looking for and great amazing customer service from the front cashiers"}
{"text":"Service was good!!! Would be better if the food was a bit fresher. It's possibly because I arrived a little bit before dinner time. I would do dinner than lunch for a bit more. Great place to go if budgeting on the rest of your vegas trip."}
{"text":"There isn't really much you need to know about this Asian food buffet. It's cheap, decent food, and it has unlimited seafood for dinner including crab legs. If you're hungry and want a massive amount of Asian food on the cheap or if you want unlimited crab legs on the cheap this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Its okay, not the greatest quality. I would rather drive up the street and go to buffet at asia. Wouldnt really recommend or return to eat there."}
{"text":"Good food, fresh crab legs. Great price. Good service.

Their sushi are normally dry, I don't normally try them."}
{"text":"Chinese buffet on Xmas was crowded. The selections were small but they had crab legs, friend said she liked it, it looked like it was the only thing she ate. The sushi were loosely rolled and had maybe 7 selections of sushi at best, where half of them were different variations of California rolls. Would go back if hungry, but not a very first choice."}
{"text":"I have been to the Krazy Buffet on Sahara, and I have enjoyed it but I must say that this one is not that good. The food was very grease and did not have much flavor. Will they say you get what you paid for and if I went to a real Chinese restaurant I would have paid a lot more."}
{"text":"I forgot I said I wasn't coming back after my last visit.
This only gets 2 stars because the sushi is actually pretty clean and a decent variety.
Positives : sushi
Negatives : the \"hot\" food is as cold as the sushi,
there is way too much american food and not enough chinese food,
those are not crab legs worth wasting the buffet space on,
the food is not good enough to warrant 12.99 plus paying if you want anything but water,
arrived at 7:30 and none of the cold \"hot\" dishes were replenished even though completely gone,
place was prety empty and the waitstaff were holding up walls, so why was my empty plate still there when I returned from a trip to the buffet?
Go elsewhere,  you can buy a lot of takeout for 13 bucks"}
{"text":"This place should give customers a free pair of underwear with every buffet purchase, because you will definitely need them if you eat here.   I used to be a professional chef.  I want to school on new York and have cooked for eople Hillary Clinton and Sammy Hagar.  I went here to meet up with friends for a meeting and I could not believe that people would eat in a restaurant that was this filthy.   If they can't bother to clean the walls or restrooms that patrons see then you can only imagine how low there food and sanitary standards are in the kitchen.  You have been warned if you go here and see the condition of the place and still eat, then I wish you luck and hopefully they will honor the free pair of underwear!"}
{"text":"It is no M or Bellagio buffet but it is for sure my favorite Asian buffet to go to..

I always end up going home so stuffed till I can't eat anymore! Food seems to be always freshly cooked and the servers are always there every 5 minutes to clear out your plates and help you. 

I would go here even only for their Salted shrimps and crab legs! I love making my own crab leg dipping sauce too.. Butter, lemon and some salt... YUM! 

For dessert try their apple pie and put some ice cream on top! Sinfully delish!"}
{"text":"Living in Las Vegas I'm surrounded by casino buffets. Sometimes you want to go to a buffet nearby your house and not be stuck in a long line or have to sign up for a players card, well Krazy Buffet is the spot. 
        I've been to Krazy Buffet more than once and I'm never disappointed. The service of the staff is pretty great. They all are very friendly and have smiles on their faces. I love the fact that 2 adults can come and eat lunch for $8.79 a person. Not bad. There a variety of food to chose from mostly Asian but you will also find your basic American food too (i.e. pizza, french fries, chicken wings etc.). I suggest you check out this spot! Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Would give 3.5 stars. One of the only buffets I've been to that actually had some decent food! Unfortunately I don't eat seafood and that made up more than half the choices.. Seafood lovers will enjoy it I assume. Overall seems fairly fresh and clean, for a buffet. In the end, $40 for 2 dinners, 2 drinks plus tip.. We both agreed that it's not worth double the price of 2 plates at panda express as we don't realllly need to gorge ourselves.. Do they have buffets in other countries?? Lol it just seems so unnecessary! Alas we might come back for the cheaper lunch one day.."}
{"text":"Call me crazy but out of all the Asian buffets in Las Vegas I feel like Krazy Buffet is the best one. It's pretty cheap and tasty! I've only been here for lunch which is around $7 ~ 

I like Krazy buffet because it looks relatively clean and they have a good variety of food especially seafood! All i really need here is a cup of hot and sour soup and a big plate of green veggies and their fish... Their steamed ginger & garlic fish is soooo good. Not the best quality but hey... $7???! 

HOT TIP: my friends tell me for dinner they offer crab legs and oysters..!!!"}
{"text":"We got there by 5:30pm and most of the dishes were cold, as if they been sitting there since noon.  They never refilled our drinks and tried to rush us out.  I would never eat at this place again."}
{"text":"After debating on what to eat one night, my house mate suggested Krazy Buffet. For dinner it's all your can eat for about 11 bucks. The food options are vast and the servers are on point with refills, clearing the table and just overall great service. 

The house mate commented on how great the soft-serv ice cream was haha.  I also noticed that the decor was very modern and clean unlike others. So far I've visited Krazy twice and the service has been consistent."}
{"text":"So I eat often at this place , why ? Because my Five year old is obsessed with \"Chinese Buffet\" and this is the only edible option I've located in my general area that not only is affordable but also edible .. I am being generous by giving three stars but that is because you get what you pay for if you come here expecting gourmet well I am sorry you deserve to be disappointed but if you enter this place understanding that they have many options some of which have been sitting out awhile and could end up being gross you'll be OK.. I won't touch their sushi or the Mongolian BBQ because I just don't \"trust\" the idea of it so I can't speak to either of those but my son loves their chicken broccoli and I am a huge fan of their chicken with jalapenos and their string beans . They have a variety of soups and the normal buffet offerings . This location gets busy enough at lunch most the food is always fresh . I've only been during the week at lunch time but I go at least once a week if not twice and it's always been good . Their service isn't \"friendly\" and lately I've been getting the short end of the stick as far as seating like today they sat us far from site  in the \"kids\" area and trust me I wasn't happy but in good faith I still have to give them a three because for the price it can't be beat.. Children under 4 are free and they are good about refills"}
{"text":"I drive by here often so we decided to check it out on a Sunday evening around 5pm. The parking lot looked full but wasn't crowded at all inside. Lots of seafood based dishes. I don't eat it but my husband said it good. Nothing I had was hot, just warm. Mostly standard buffet stuff. Warm and greasy :) but it was cheap and we got good full bellies.  Don't think we will put it on our place of regular restaurants though."}
{"text":"Krazy buffet on w Sahara was great..  the price for crab legs, clams, mussels, crabs it was great very fresh...  the service was the best so good we left a $10.00 tip the only thing I would rant about was there dessert section there was a lot but maybe not enough for one to enjoy..  12.99 for the buffet dinner start at 4 pm and we went about 5ish and still very fresh.. will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"Been to many Chinese buffet and this by far is the cleanest and friendly one, for the price you pay it is good, the fact that the food is continually flowing and fresh is a plus, but poor lady making them sushi by hand i give her a super star!"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite Asian style buffet in Las Vegas. Great value, great food, great ownership."}
{"text":"There are many Asian buffets here in Las Vegas,  I have been to a few and have had good food and bad food. A lot of them are Hit and Miss and you don't really know what kind of food you are getting.

I have passed by this Buffet several times and never stopped for whatever reason. Today I decided to stop and check it out as I always see cars parked there which is always a good sign.

When I went inside the restaurant it was packed. Obviously this is good to see as it's an indicator of what the food might taste like.

I was seated very quickly, the gal asked me what I wanted to drink and I went straight to the food. I was surprised to see the variety of food they had, there was lots to choose from and it looked very appealing.

They had the typical sections you see at Asian buffets there was a section where you could get sushi, they had the sea food section, the desert section, and the area where you can get Mongolian style food that they can cook for you and the variety of items they had their was pretty good.

I had different items, I tasted pretty much almost everything there and I have to say the food was really good. The cost was $16.11 for one person but the quality of food was actually decent, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had crab legs,oysters, and other Seafood items. The only thing I did not enjoy was the dessert, I don't think cherry Jell-O and chocolate pudding is what you should be getting for dessert at $16.11 a person but that's just my opinion.

Overall not a bad experience, fair price for the quality of food you're getting, fairly clean place and decent service, that's why I gave it a 3-star rating."}
{"text":"As a broke Airmen I use to frequent this little buffet whenever I had the urge to test the limits of my pants' waist. I can't remember ever leaving here without a decent sized food baby. The food here is definitely not 5 star, but for less than $10 dollars at lunch you can't really complain without looking like a total cheapy.

If you like crab legs, they do offer them for dinner. I must warn that you will spend more time cracking them and picking out the meat than you will eating. The legs are also pretty tiny. The price is still very reasonable for the crab leg dinner buffet, but not really worth it if you ask me. Everything else on the line is pretty much the same from what I remember, and the crab legs just weren't awesome.

If you want to (over) fill your tummy while keeping your wallet full, Krazy Buffet's lunch special is the way to go. :)"}
{"text":"This place is still in business because of their food. They have something for everyone. There's Mongolian grill, sushi, and much more. It's very good quality, especially for the price. Is it fancy, no, but I usually done for the food, not the cloth napkins. I come here often with small groups and large groups. They are very accommodating and friendly. All in all, good experience. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, a lot of options to choose from!! There was sushi and it was pretty good I watched the lady making it too. I gave this a 3-star because before I could finish my plate the lady watching us that worked there just took it away assuming I was finished wow rude! And when my mom and I went to the restroom there was a lady waiting and a stall opened my mom and I looked and there was poop just chilling in the toilet gross!! It smelled AWFUL VERY VERY AWFUL!!  I mean what else can you expect shit to smell like lol. Anyways this place is anything you'd expect from a local buffet  that"}
{"text":"Burp Grotesque....Krazy is right...Your Krazzzzzy to spend $$ here. Worst Buffet...Truck Stop Chinese Food. Your Guaranteed to Get Sick!!! Old Slimey Seafood."}
{"text":"Awesome place for the price. Dinner buffet was 13.49 plus they had a 10% off coupon. I think the kids buffet was 7.99 ages 10 and under. Food was pretty decent, they had some sushi, crab legs and then other things you would expect. Like fried rice, steamed rice, beef and broccoli, and spicy chicken, to name a few. My family and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Much better buffets in this town so look around before him choose this one it's very average food"}
{"text":"Visit here several times a year. The food is always fresh and well stocked. They have sushi, and several seafood items for their dinner buffet. The staff is always efficient as well."}
{"text":"This place certainly gives buffet @ asia a run for their money.  Food is always hot, fresh, rotated and their sushi bar is MUCH smaller then buffet @ asia but it's good, and I've seen some improvement and more selection lately.

They are a little cheaper in price compared to buffet @ asia, quality is about the same. Service is a little better though here.  The place isn't as run down and ugly and is kept fairly clean.  

I have been here many times and will happily continue to go back. Keep in mind though, the place isn't fantastic by any means, but it's certainly not bad and the food is good and not expensive."}
{"text":"one of my favorite asian buffet!  the parking is easy, the food is fresh, the place is clean, the service is friendly, and the price is cheap! that's one sweet deal, don't you think? =)"}
{"text":"Don't let the Yelpers fool you on this place because the food here tastes pretty bad. I didn't have a single dish that I would consider good and I tried fried rice, lo mein, mapo tofu, beef w/ broccoli, a spicy chicken dish, some pork dishes, steamed dumplings, egg rolls, crab rangoon and pretty much every dish except the mixed seafood one.   Even the steamed rice and basic things like wonton & hot and sour soup were not very good either. Panda Express is a lot better than this place. For the same price as this buffet, you can go eat at Ping Pang Pong which is the best Chinese food in town. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"went there today 12/21 /2018 and not satisfied with food.  left after getting my food.  Food wasnt heated!!!!!  Buffett food have to be certain temp or goes bad.  I hate to get sick from food poisoning.  went there at 11 am so place just opened and surprise food wasnt heated.  never going there again."}
{"text":"My mom likes to come here once in a while, it's pretty okay, food wise is average I would give it 4 stars but they need to be more welcoming, a smile goes a long way! Maybe next time"}
{"text":"Locals eat here next to a tire shoppe.

Don't go to Krazy Buffet and eat the clams, they gave my mom food poisoning.

The food isn't so great here, as everything was so greasy and the way they served the food looked a bit shady to me.  The coconut chicken was pretty good, but not the greatest.

I would rather recommend you go to Makino and get some quality asian buffet food than here.

{"text":"I love love love this buffet, food is fresh...lots of variety! Staff is friendly and professional to the max. Desserts are spectacular, and very unique. Their seafood is off the charts. All around great experience!"}
{"text":"Very yukky...too crowded! Smells make you Nadia, cause there's too many people. Reminds me of Circus Circus buffet, cuz it's so crowded!! They don't clean up fast enough the buffet area..its caos really!"}
{"text":"Was I starving today, maybe? For what it is, I am saying that Krazy Buffet does it pretty well. We ran in for lunch today, and the experience was one I wouldn't mind repeating, which is saying a whole heckuva lot. I generally avoid buffets at all costs, but this one offered me plenty of green items, a good tofu dish and absolutely perfect sesame balls filled with red bean. There were even plantains! Every chicken dish I sampled had a great flavor, and all of the servers were smiling and clearing plates lightning fast. When we visit buffets, I keep track of how many items I am compelled to spit out, and I am happy to report that there wasn't a single item here that didn't pass the test. I didn't love the spinach or the green beans, but they were not overly salty or flavored poorly. They were simply plain.

Is this gourmet? No. Is this healthy? Probably not. It is a Chinese buffet with an odd sushi section, congealed salads on the fruit bar, and pizza, but in that world, this is a pretty good option."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the one on Sahara which I would rate 3.5 stars as there are lots of veggies and the sushi selection is freshly made. Today was my first time at this location. It was not good at all. I will never go back. The hot food was not hot nor was it freshly prepared. It had definitely been there a while. I was a bit scared and did not take more than a bite or two of any of the dishes that I tried. The sushi rolls were not freshly prepared (rice had that harder consistency). The sesame balls were old and chewy."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and found this place. Tried it. Typical Chinese buffet . I think it is good for the price. I found each item had it's own flavor. Waitresses smile a lot but, I do not think they like their jobs. If you like Chinese buffets, this one is okay. I will eat there again."}
{"text":"If there was an option for 0 stars this would be the right time to use it. To begin with the food was very low quality, greasy, and disgusting. It left my stomach in knots. The selection was limited, the food prep was lackluster to say the least and the over all taste was just bad. I wouldn't recommend anyone spending their money here."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner today because we found it on yelp as we were driving by. It was around 3:40pm when we got seated and the man seating us was asking if we were going to do lunch or dinner. Didn't make sense at first but I realized when I was getting food it's because dinner has crab legs included (4pm dinner). I realized this because there's a sign by the crab legs stating if you get some then there's an automatic dinner charge. My boyfriend had told him dinner so we decided to try out the crab legs as well. They weren't bad. For a dinner price of $14 what can you expect. They went fast and they didn't seem to want to refill them with more til about an 30 to 45 min later. I thought all the food was pretty mediocre. There wasn't anything special. There was sushi and that was really good. I like the sake (fresh salmon and rice) sushi but they would go fast and they wouldn't refill them. I fact it wasn't refilled even when leaving. If you see ones eating those the most why not refill them? Overall the experience was okay for paying the amount we did. You can't expect much really. Tables were clean. Food seemed like they were at right temperatures for being at a buffet. There were utensils for all items. The servers were attentive. If your hungry and looking for something affordable, this would be a place."}
{"text":"I had the buffet for lunch on a weekday for 10.

- Opened 20min before opening, 11am, so food was very fresh!
- I favored the coconut chicken, wonton and hot and sour soup, egg foo young, and potstickers. 
- sushi was okay, better than wicked spoon. lol. 
- for desserts, the sesame balls and fried donut were good. 
- Fast service. whenever the water was low, they filled it up quickly.
- Not the best chinese food, but great price for what it's worth. 

^____^~ ^___^!"}
{"text":"I know the name of this place sounds cheesy and at $13 for all you can eat it may sound a bit steep for the location, but this place has a decent variety of sushi which they make fresh right in front of everyone. So it's worth it for the sushi alone. But if you're not into sushi, don't worry they have plenty of other great stuff. They always have crab legs and they never let the legs get down to the bottom of the tray. They work hard to keep all trays stocked and I believe they have something for everyone. Including those NYC style wings that I have only been able to find in one other place here in Las Vegas. 

The place is clean and the environment is pretty laid back. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the location and the parking."}
{"text":"This place looks condemned..... Horrible on the outside....the restrooms are filled graffiti, very nasty looking.....food is not all that good...

the other location on West Sahara looks alot better inside and out along with good management...."}
{"text":"They're dishonest. I went today at 3:30pm and got charged for dinner. I don't mind being charged, if you tell me in the beginning. I won't be going there anymore."}
{"text":"If I could rate this restaurant with a zero, I would. Not even worthy of 1 star. The food was not up to par, but aside from that as we're eating the mediocre food... we found a piece of hair in my 3 year old sons food. The waitress went and got the manager. At first he offered us 15% off the bill... are you serious?! Then he gave us the option to just stop eating and he wouldn't charge us for the meals. DUH. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. R i d i c u l o u s"}

{"text":"BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS!!!!! LOVE IT! cannot have any better value or selection of food its awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the variety of food options! Rating 4 stars because the temperature of food needs to be a lil warmer. Looking for a tasty, inexpensive food this is it! Staff is friendly :)"}
{"text":"We enjoy eating here after a long day of adventure. We are crazy so we eat here at krazy buffet !!"}
{"text":"So as compared to other dining experiences of the same variety this place is like a rollercoaster. Sometimes it is really good and other times it's so so. However this last time I came here with my wife and I have to say for a Friday night they were being really STINGY with the steamed crab legs.in 3 hours the brought out fresh crab 3 times. Me and my wife could hear others complaining amoungst each other at their tables near by as we sat and stalked the food restocker. The crab up on the dinner line was always just slightly more full than the water line full of broken pieces which you could very well tell contained no traces of meat left inside of the shell. My wife got ballzy and asked the food restocker for fresh crab to which we did receive fresh crab, and a fresh attitude in which the lady said \"it's the same thing, what the problem?\" Shrugged her shoulders and stompped away...not what I want to deal with after I have to work and be nice to people at my job all week long"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch last week with a friend of mine. It was cheap, fresh and delicious. They had quite a crowd for lunch, which was no problem, the dishes were filled as fast as they were depleted. The Chinese dishes were all above par. The salt and pepper shrimp and the salt and pepper squid were my faves. I didn't try the sushi because I was bothered by the fact that it was all covered in plastic wrap, which meant that one would have to touch it to pull it up to get a piece. 

Overall it's good for a Chinese buffet, cheap and fast too!"}
{"text":"We loved this place. For a cheap Asian all you can eat it was wonderful.the food was very good. The selection was comparable to other Asian buffets as far as the number of items but at this place they have snow crab legs and other dried crab. They have mussels and clams. The food was all hot and great. We didn't see any steam trays that had cold or old looking food. The place for a Friday night was decently busy but we did get seated right away. The atmosphere was nice for an Asian buffet. It was pretty clean and very well lit. It felt very inviting. The service was good as they kept the plates cleared and kept our waters filled. Overall a very good experience and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Good variety, flavor is always spot on and we usually enjoy it.  The place is always busy and we sometimes have to wait, but not long.  

They offer two types of soup, have a fresh sushi bar with quite a few selections. They offer a salad bar and the usual jello, pudding, cookie and soft serve ice cream.  My favorite chicken dish is spicy with slices of jalapeno and the shrimp with mayo and walnuts is very good.  I also love the crab rangoons.  

The service is great, the food good, the best Chinese food in a buffet, probably not, but it's a good alternative."}
{"text":"I will not return. I went for lunch b/c I heard good reviews about this place, but the sushi is not fresh, the fish did not taste fresh, the seaweed salad tasted old, but their almond cookie was ok."}
{"text":"This place was typical.  Pretty much comparable to most any Asian buffet.  Food wasn't bad but quality definitely could have been better. Waiter staff not friendly--same for the cashiers.  Tables needed to have been cleaned better (seemed really sticky).  Price was cheap $10.99 dinner.  This was our second time in about a year---don't think we will back.  Buffet of Asia is much better as far as food but service is about the same.  
E"}
{"text":"First Chinese buffet in Vegas for me off the strip.  Cleaner than other Chinese buffets in LA.  Note
Bench marking reference.
Variety is good, tasty and service is attentive rather than the typical slam it down Chinese attitude.  Off peak visit so it's quiet and relaxing.  Will come again and review."}
{"text":"This Asian buffet was cleaner than most and even provided a private room, plus 3 extra tables for our birthday dinner of 30. That wasn't even half the establishment, can you believe that?! 

Food was good compared to others and they were running out so quickly that they kept refilling the trays with fresh and hot food. Waitresses at our section were quick to refill our drinks and were accommodating to the crazy kids running around. 

Place was pretty full, but food spread was far enough apart from one another that it was hard to bump into people. Good use of space.

I wouldn't mind coming back and trying some other dishes. The kids flocked to the frozen yogurt section and filled their cones up as high as they would go. 

Thanks to Krazy buffet for hosting us!"}
{"text":"For the price, this place is great.  The ingredients they serve for lunch is well worth the $7.79 plus tax.  I always have plenty of clams and shrimp. The restaurant's decor is nothing to write home about, and there is no way I'm going there with a date or anything. But the service is surprisingly great for a buffet, water refills come very fast and they are by to clean up the plates as soon as I go back for another round.  Now if only the food tasted a bit better I could give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here many times.  My family and I come here for the crab legs, we love it!  Where can you  can you eat unlimited crab legs, sushi, & Asian food all under $14.00?  Krazy Buffet!  The manager recognizes us and smiles when he sees us.  The wait staff could be a little more attentive to their customers.  But all in all, its a great place to eat for the price."}
{"text":"About the best Chinese buffet I have seen in Las Vegas but for me personally the Chinese buffets here in LV are just average, nothing special. Very clean and open. Mongolian BBQ was a plus but needs a flavor section (teriyaki, schezuan, etc) and a little quicker (higher heat), Everyone in the party got full and enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"We went last week with my family we Love this place buffet great. All staff nice and friendly"}
{"text":"$15 dollars buffet with sushi, raw oyster (!), shrimp, crabs and many Asian dishes sure enough to fill myself and in-laws stomach happy after long drive from Utah to Vegas. At this price I guess not everything is perfect but earned my 5-stars ."}
{"text":"I love the sushi! Such a wide variety to choose.Friendly staff. Clean tables!! Thank God! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I would not go back worse than my sons school lunch. This place is so bad my son vomited because of how bad and dirty this place was. If I could give it zero stars I would in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"It's okay. I guess. . . the food isn't that good. Not as good as others. The coconut shrimp had a bit of a a side taste. Lol weird. It seemed clean but the people that go eat here. Not worth it. People are rude and gross. I guess pretty much anyone can go in if they only have to $12 a person. It's okay. But for a place like this go somewhere else. I mean there wasn't any desserts. It would be nice to have a piece of pie or cake.  But I hate people here, the types I avoid at all costs. Go somewhere else. . ."}
{"text":"Definitely better than Buffet Asia.  This might be Chinese food heaven for someone that lives in the boonies but it was just alright for me.  They definitely offer a lot for the price and I happily stuffed myself with as many green veggies/meat combos as possible.  

All the servers were really friendly and were prompt to refill beverages and take away plates.  

3.3389821 stars!!"}
{"text":"Krazy has been around for quite awhile selection is good and cheap remember you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet is krazy awful. If I could give this place zero stars, I totally would. 

The food is meh. Not a great selection at all, though the seafood delight was decent. The sushi tasted fishy and was completely inedible as far as I'm concerned. 

But the real downer for this place is the service. It's abominable. They refused to honor the child's price for my 11-year-old, though the signage clearly states that kids 12 and under ate a lower price. The entire staff wasn't just careless or disengaged, they were downright hostile. I can't understand why anyone would come back here if they are always like this. There are probably a thousand other comparable buffets in Las Vegas. Take my advice and go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"I didn't like this place at all. I got the cooties.  I don't like seafood and it was all mixed together here. The seafood, was next to the chicken that was next to desserts. They had so many ocean creepy crawlies that it just made me sick and not want to eat. Also, I felt like it was a dirty place. It's old, booth was so far from the table, I had to sit on the end of my butt. Eating utensils were very, very think and crappy. Plus, I thought it was kind of expensive for Las Vegas standards."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday and was not impressed. I've been here before for dinner and lunch and it's always been mediocre at best, it's gone down hill and I would not waste my money here ever again. The food temperate was slightly warm and with chicken and seafood sitting out I would expect them to keep it hot. There were flys around our table and there was not much variety. Spend your money somewhere else if u want decent food."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Plenty of crab legs. As a Chinese, I 100% recommend this buffet restaurant."}
{"text":"Good service. Not the best chicken dishes but the sushi was better than I expected. They were very fast on refills and they make sure you have plenty to drink. I came in at 4pm and paid 11 dollars. The Orange chicken leaves a bit to be desired but overall definitely a good experience overall."}
{"text":"I heard this place was good but was very disappointed.  The food did not seem very fresh, had odd, almost dirty taste to it, the bowls weren't very clean, and there weren't as many choices as I thought.   On the positive side, the soft serve was delish, the sushi was mostly good (although the inari was mostly seaweed), and my picky daughter found a lot to eat.  The won ton soup was the best I have had in an all you can eat chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great but not that bad either! I guess it was ok. Prices were fair. The real seafood (crab and oysters) don't come out until after 4:00 pm. At 4 pm the price changes. Overall I enjoyed myself and would return next time after 4:00 pm when they are serving the crab and oysters."}
{"text":"25 mins from the strip, not worth the drive. The food isn't that great and it looked like its been sitting out for awhile. The food is bland and the waiter isn't the friendliest."}
{"text":"Pleasant place to eat a buffet and a plenty of variety food. We tried the dinner buffet and there's a lot of seafood options such as baked mussels, crab legs, clams etc. In general, we enjoyed our visit and our fill. We didn't do a reservation, and was able to sit right away although there was a total of 6 of us. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was actually really good and cheap to $10 for a buffet is a great price  I had just bought an brand new 2017 Honda Accord hybrid touring from Honda west next door!.. which by the way those guys are awesome fabulous deals at that place if u need a Honda go see Carlos  anyway they told me to check out this buffet and it was a great suggestion!! So I
Loaded up and started heading back to the Bay Area!!"}

The owners/managers will walk around and stare at you , like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld,  while you are at the buffet. Sitting down at our table another owner was staring at people , like they dont trust anyone , really !!!! We went for Crab leg / Oysters Sun. night. The crab legs are small , spindly , and not worth it. Waitress had her back to the wall and would stare at me all night. If I looked her way , she would look away. I will avoid this place in the future. Suprised it has not been on Dirty Dining !"}
{"text":"I went here last Sunday for an early birthday dinner for my brother -- my treat. Sunday is all day dinner price which would be around $12 WITHOUT fountain drinks. For dinner, they have a variety of seafood includ. sushi and other types of Chinese food. I was so HAPPY that they had oysters, boiled crabs, and shrimp. Those were what I stuck to... But unfortunately one of those, most likely the oysters, gave me the bad case of the stomach flu. Eeeeek! I'm still sick typing this whole thing out trying not to crap my pants. Anyway, I wouldn't go back. The food was pretty yummy, but definitely not worth getting the stomach flu ever again. So unless you want to spend the next few days of the week making constant trips to the bathroom and eventually going to the hospital, be my guest! This place is perfect for you!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Las Vegas for about 4 years now. In that time we have visited many buffets. Krazy stands out as one of the best. It's much better than the over-hyped Bacchanal buffet at Caesars."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas with the family, Krazy Buffet never seems to disappoint. Yes, it is a ways from the strip, but its worth it. It's CLEAN!! The food is good, it's cheap, there are many great selections & the seafood is good for an asian buffet."}
{"text":"This was the worst food I've ever had at this place, been here about five times and this will be the last. Food is old and what was just put out was chicken and it was undercooked also.floors dirty,and sticky, bathrooms very nasty.  I wouldn't ever return to this dirty over priced restaurant..The reason I have returned five times is because I have five kids each week a different  child  picks a place and I suppose they have Hopes of getting some crab legs. lol it's fine because I'm out of Kid's.lol"}
{"text":"An adequate selection of food for the price. Service is fast. From the times I have visited it's rare to see q heat dish empty the kitchen is on a constant flow."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least once a week, sometimes twice a week.  We feel it is a healthy alternative at a great price and the food is DELICIOUS.  There is an incredible variety of food.  They also have a great salad bar section with shrimp that is already peeled and deveined.  The soups are awesome, the host/hostess that seats you are very friendly and welcoming every time we go.  If you want a great meal for a good price, this is the place."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese food nothing exciting but the price is cheap for what you get crab legs, clams, crawfish, some sushi, oysters on the weekend there is no msg which is a plus and service was normal. Good for cheap Chinese food."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 6-6-15 for dinner.  I walked in and stood awkwardly at the front for a while.  A couple of different workers smiled at me.  One finally asked if I wanted a table and I said yes.
This was your standard cheap chinese buffet ($12.99 I think) with all the things you would expect AND CRAB LEGS!!! Where else can you get AYCE crab legs for 13 bucks???  Nowhere.  And they are good, too...not small and not too fishy. I was in hog heaven.  I was so full when I left."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch. This is by far my favorite chinese buffet in Vegas. They usually have crab legs on the weekends but they have changed it to only dinnertime on the weekends-boo! Food was outstanding today. ...they even had steamed pork buns. Dirty plates were cleared quickly. I checked in on yelp and a 10% off coupon popped up...I'd never used one of those before. The cashier glanced at it and mumbled \"you have to print out\". Well geez lady sorry my phone doesn't have a printer."}
{"text":"I too like Krazy Buffet but you have to realize a couple of important things before you go here. First of all, it's an Asian buffet, if you like sushi and/or crab than it's  a good price, if you don't than there are better buffets for that price. Furthermore, the only way they can offer sushi and crab at these prices is if they stay off the strip and in a strip mall/shopping center where rents are cheaper, but will typically have parking issues. It's simply an economic decision for both you and the business."}
{"text":"This place is awesome during the weekday. The price for the content they serve for lunch very well worth it. The sushi bar is not all that but it's still worth a try. Everything else you is awesome. Dinner time is when they serve the best foods."}
{"text":"Krazy Buffet is crazy good. My family and I came here on a Wednesday night and it was packed. Food was plentiful and tasted very good. I read some of the reviews and I don't understand how people can complain so much about nothing. If you $12 for a buffet and expect that the buffet is filet mignon or lobster tail then you got another thing coming to you. Why don't you people go somewhere else and leave this place alone and let them run a good business. Thank you very much Krazy Buffet for a good meal!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Easter Sunday. 11 out of 13 of us regretted it. I heard the crab legs were pretty good though"}
{"text":"This location was a huge disappointment compared to the rainbow location. The appearance was nice and clean from the outside, but inside was disgusting. We weren't there for more than 5 minutes or so. We got our plates and took a couple bites and complained about how cold the food was. They had nothing to say and we still had to pay $45 for our family. The lady at the register was rude as well, and didn't seem concerned whatsoever about the complaint we had. We will never come here and I highly suggest you try the Rainbow location. Not to mention this location doesn't have the Mongolian bar or half the food that it's other location does. Biggest waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"Good place . Perfect for the price , 
I like that they got see food and a lot of meat.
 Smell it's not the best but again it's only 10$ for lunch."}
{"text":"I took my 3 boys there for dinner on a Friday night. It was quite a drive from the strip. When we got there it was busy but we were able to be seated.  
The food was good but not worth the drive not the price. 
Would I go back. No!"}
{"text":"This is honestly not a bad deal at all for an $12.99 AYCE.  For that price, you get crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, clams, mussels, and probably 40 other dishes that are all decent to quite good.  Plus, you can use the coupon for $5 off the bill!  Only exception was the sushi section where I thought the nigiri were not quite up-to-par.  Service was typically stiff but very timely.

Here's what I liked:
- Crab legs were great, and unlike most places not salty at all.  Only if I saw that giant pot of melted butter earlier...
- Seasoned crabs also, which I did not have but mum said was good
- Raw oysters!!!!
- Crawfish was yummy, they put some type of seasoning on it that was great.  As with any steamed crawfish, it's a pain-in-the-ass to eat though.
- Mussels in the mayo-based sauce was great, mussels were plump
- Clam in some type of garlic(?) sauce was also great
- 4 types of soups - miso, wonton, hot & sour, and egg drop were good
- Several flavors of ice cream
- Fried bananas were awesome!
- Mandarin orange - the canned kind, but I love those
- The apple strudel-looking thing looked really good, but did not have room in my tummy
 
Didn't like so much:
- As mentioned above, stay away from the sushi
- Desserts were not great.  I had the cream puffs and they were awful.
- Fried rice tasted like the ones at fast food places, not Chinese restaurants
- Overall Chinese dishes didn't look impressive
 
With at least twice as many good as the bad, and with the goods being so much bigger in stature, this place gets big ups.  4-star food, not quite, but 4-star deal, it is.

Table-for-1 Factor:  It's a buffet, not a good idea."}
{"text":"It's only 8.79 for lunch. You get what you pay for! That being said, I really enjoy the food here. When you haven't eaten all day why not go to all you can eat buffet. The food is made fresh, your drink is rarely empty. They have a great selection of food, but if your trying to eat healthy, I would avoid this buffet. They have a small selection of sushi which I didn't try and some fruits which were freshly cut. The chow mien was on point! The decor is okay nothing that extraordinary, except for the sky ceiling near the food. Seats are comfy, my waitress was nice. I suggest you give this place a try, I'm sure you will be surprised!"}
{"text":"The only thing Krazy about this buffet is you! (for dining there).
I been there a handful of times over the years and in the past and it was acceptable, howevvvvver
I been there with a friend for dinner 2 weeks ago and it was below any expectation! 
The kimchy was rotten and I brought it to the hostesses attention...she brushed me off and said it smells just fine, The dude that ran the mongolian grill looked and acted as if I'm bothering him somehow..very odd.
 My friend got the runs 20 minutes after we left the joint and cussed me out for hours for taking him there...I felt bad...

Never again at any price."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and stopped here for dinner,  good selection of foods all fresh and tasty. Place was clean and the service was good.  30 for two adults with drinks."}
{"text":"Cannot beat the selection and quality for what you're paying here. We were minutes late to be able to get the lunch price per person but even with the increased dinner price per person it was still really good sushi and seafood for a steal of a price!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple times and the food is alright. Just don't compare it to the multiple buffets we have in the fancy casinos on the Strip.

Any buffet with crab legs is a winner in my book, but for some reason the crab legs here were a little skimpy on the meat =( I shouldn't work so hard to crack open a leg to find NO MEAT inside. 

Anyways.. They offer other variety of foods here from sushi to french fries and wonton soup. They serve fruits here along with ice cream, but I did find the ice cream to taste a bit strange.

If you enjoy Buffet @ Asia then you'll probably like this place as well since they both are pretty much tied in my book."}
{"text":"Well there goes my money down the drain! I honestly would not recommend this place to anyone! There is a large variety of food but it was all so bland! The crab looked old and it did not taste right! While the shrimp they served was mushy for some reason. The only thing I enjoyed was their noodles otherwise everything else basically sucked! Their sushi was so salty that I had to drink some water to get rid of the taste. 11.99 down the drain!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and for its price it's decent.  They have a very large selection of entrées.  A lot of the food seems like actually food unlike buffet at Asia where I've eaten before tastes like cardboard. They have booths and tables for big and large groups,  ambient music and nice lighting.  Overall decent!"}
{"text":"Price is pretty good but the food is extremely greasy. Could have more variety. Seafood is a bit tasteless but the rest is okay. Atmosphere is tacky, bathrooms are so-so. I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"I was a little sketchy to try out this place because it has mostly good reviews, but the reviews recently just haven't been so great. Well, my mother and I are huge fans of cheap buffets with great food and especially seafood! This place was about 25-30 minutes away from home, but we don't mind the drive if we get to try something new.

When we came in (around 630pm) it was pretty busy, but we were seated as soon as we came in, which was awesome that we didn't have to wait. There's people that complain about how old the place looks and the seating but I didn't mind it at all. That's actually not something I really care for anyway when I go to eat somewhere.

They had a WIDE variety of food. Sooooooo much. I don't think I can eat for another two days! Their crab was delicious especially with the hot butter. They are SMALLER crablegs than what you'll get paying $20 bucks at a casino buffet but it's all you can eat so what does it matter? It was hot, delicious and sooo worth the $12.49.

They had so many different foods to choose from and it was of good quality. I'm not a massively picky eater but I can be and I really enjoyed eating here. 

*I did try crawfish for my first time here at Krazy Buffet and I just didn't like it at all. It was the only thing that I had that I didn't like. I am pretty sure it is just the crawfish itself and not the buffet.*"}

This buffet is off of Sahara not real close to the strip.  

This place is kinda in the middle of the road to me.
I have been to way better places and also have had worse.

We have been here a few times in the past as well that as before Yelp :)

We have found that the earlier you go in for dinner or lunch the better it is as with any buffet same with this one for them for bringing out hot fresh food.

The night we went in it was pretty busy and the food was being replaced pretty fast.
My husband really likes the crab legs. They are not big but they are ok to satisfy your craving!
The Sushi is not at all like going to a Sushi place but it is passable. They do put out a few different kinds of rolls.. Like I said it is ok nothing that satisfies my cravings for Sushi but I did have a few pieces and they were just ok.

The price for lunch and dinner is not too bad. Nothing like the strip buffet prices.

Over all the food is just ok, it is usually hot and the items that I did try were not too bad. I am not too crazy about Chinese food at a buffet. I would much rather have it made fresh for me. 

The staff keeps the plates cleaned up real good and drinks filled pretty fast even when busy.

Would we recommend? Sure if your looking for inexpensive buffet to get full on you will do  that here!"}
{"text":"How can anybody complain about all you can eat seafood for $10.99? This buffet has became a regular spot whenever my family visits. I have already found my favorites. They have this oyster soup that is to die for. The honey walnut shrimp is scrumptious. Decent sized CRAB LEGS!!! Shrimp cocktail and oysters. Even the chicken wings are good.

You got to try this place for yourselves. I'm sure you'll find your own favorites."}
{"text":"My wife and I like this buffet. Food nice and hot. Good selection for dishes. Nice service. Plenty of wait staff. Chinese and some American foods."}
{"text":"I just moved into the Las Vegas area. I am not familiar with the restaurants around here. I was craving some Chinese food and seafood so I decided to try Krazy buffet. Overall the food all tasted the same. I could practically taste the msg in every dish. I decided to try their sashimi which was rubbery and bland. The fish was lazily placed over a small bed of rice with no real form to it. Thumbs down to that. There was one roll with spicy tuna that was probably the only decent choice. To top it off the shrimp was SOGGY. When I eat shrimp I expect it to be fresh and sort of burst with juices. Not these. They were like mush in the shape of shrimp. Not really sure why, my guess is that it had been sitting out all day...I got there during the lunch to dinner transition and there were signs all over the buffet glass warning of an upcharge if we were \"caught\" eating from the dinner menu. I gave this place an extra star because the staff was all very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately the food did not follow suit."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out and def didnt regret coming here .. our waitress was very attentive .. we came here during lunch tym and luckily came in early cause the place got packed really quick .. food is freshly made .. must try esp if ur hungry and in a  budget :)"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it is about time as my curiosity for the last few years has been going wild every time we pass by and see a packed lot.

I used to live just a block from here approximately four years ago when they were building Krazy Buffet. I had moved just prior to their opening and wondered what affect it would have on one of my favorite Chinese restaurants just down the street (Bobo China). 

I was in the mood for Chinese and we were very hungry, wanting to resolve our lunch and dinner all in one shot.

The place is clean, has comfy cushy booths, lots of variety of food to select from and great staff clearing tables and bringing drink refills.

The food was good, not bad and not great. The sushi was better than usual buffet sushi which is usually horrid. I enjoyed the stuffed mussels, orange chicken, fried rice, fried shrimp, coconut shrimp, sushi, meatball skewers, pot stickers, cherry bananas and coconut macaroons for dessert.

Mmmmm those pork meatball skewers were packed full of flavor with a drizzle of BBQ sauce on them. Yummy. I could sit and just eat a plate of those balls and be satisfied. 

They have a great salad bar as well which was super fresh and had all of the toppings and dressing you could want.

My hubby really enjoyed the super big juicy chicken wings fried to perfection in a delicious light batter.

This visit did the trick, we came we ate and we conquered.

Their building was built new and looks nice on the outside however the inside of the restaurant was dumpy looking with old booths."}
{"text":"They were out of a lot of food. It's not as good a Asia buffet on Sahara ... But it was decent. The bathroom was disgusting, I can't stand eating at restaurants where the  bathroom is nasty."}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive staff,  My diet coke was kept filled and my empty plates were quickly taken away.  The selection is not big, but acceptable.  I was hoping that the sushi section would be larger, but then again do I want to eat cheap raw fish in the middle the desert?"}
{"text":"Ok, so the girlfriend and her daughter love this place and Ive been slowly expanding their dining out radius and when they said lets go to the buffet I couldnt say no.


What a mistake! We go here for the Seafood/sushi and it definitely wasnt fresh. I tried to explain it was a Monday and they were serving their \"c\" level dishes in order to boost their profit margin for the day. I said \"seriously, dont eat the seafood or the Sushi tonight\" but that didnt stop either one from getting a dish of Sushi and a plate of Oysters. 

From my side of the table I could see colors and shades that didn't belong on seafood and the musky Sea smell was over powering. 

After my warning I went back to my plate of spring rolls and spare ribs which were average and most likely past their time on the line.

The girls had stomach and digestive problems the rest of the night but me and my safe food had a great night. We only have two bathrooms so it worked out that we didnt need to fight for them.

If you want to play \"buffet roulette\" this is a fun gamble. Just make sure you have a clear shot to the bathroom."}
{"text":"It's pretty authentic, but good. Only give it a 3 cause the lady gave us the check with in 20 minutes, didn't even have dessert yet felt pretty rushed and orange chicken was really soggy :/ that's my favorite."}
{"text":"nice little clean place to have lunch or dinner... cheap and has plenty of food choices.. more choices of seafoods at dinner time..."}
{"text":"My parents love this place because:
1) it's a buffet
2) it's cheap (if you don't order a soda, yes, we are cheap asians)
3) it has the unlimited clams that they shouldn't be eating, but who cares if they overindulge once in awhile?

The wait isn't that bad depending on which days you go, but it does get crowded. 

One last tip: try the sesame balls, I'd eat those as dessert. :)"}
{"text":"Well, not the best Chinese restaurant buffet I've been too, but nowhere near the worst.  The prices are good, and the food is of mixed quality.   I wish there could have been more attention to drink refills, but not a big loss.  Food was either fresh or looked like it had been sitting a while.

Will I be back?  Possibly, if I don't find something that really strikes my fancy."}
{"text":"the buffet was clean and well priced. the general chow was delicious, but i was surprised not to find sweet and sour chicken nor pork egg rolls on the menu. the beef and broccoli was decent, nothing spectacular. quite a distance off the strip, wouldn't recommend the drive, but if you're in the area it's ok."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! There are so many buffets in Vegas but not for this price. Payed less than $30 for 3 adults! But the food wasnt worth it, I felt sick right after. I love sushi, yeah it was gross. The rest of the food, just as bad. But the service was not good at all. My first plate was at the table until I left. There was 5 old dishes on our table. But the BEST part? We were seated in the back by the restroom and they would stand there just talking and sitting down doing NOTHING! food was bad and service was bad. Just spend a little more money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how people think this place is so good, it's frozen food deep fried cheap buffet food. It's not good at all we were done eating in 15 minutes"}
{"text":"If you are craving Chinese take-outs, but don't want to limit yourself to just the usual 2 or 3 items, then head over to Krazy Buffet down by Sahara and Cimarron.  This Asian buffet serves up decent Chinese foods that are typically sold at Chinese take-out outposts throughout the Las Vegas valley.  Plus they have a salad bar, small sushi rolls station, desserts, and in the evening also dish out crab legs, oysters (maybe oysters are served all day. Never been here during lunch).  And the price is fair for the food they serve (10% off discount ads can often be found in local publications).

I live fairly close to Krazy Buffet, and the parking lot area in its immediate vicinity is always packed with cars during meal time.  On most of my visits, including this past Easter, the restaurant was filled with a lot of patrons.  But service was still good (drink refills and clearing the used plates are taken care of staff that patrol their assigned sections).

I am not much of a crab legs person at these buffets (just don't feel like getting my hands dirty), but at nights that is the thing everyone else goes for.  But the kitchen is pretty good about making more to refill the near-empty trays with leggy reinforcements.  Raw (Olympia) oysters are also served (not sure if this is available during lunch), which are also very popular.

The sushi is okay. Definitely can't compare them to the ones you order at Japanese restaurants.  But you are also not being charged $25 for their AYCE sushi option. The seaweed salad is great, and is just like the one served at all the other Japanese restaurants.  

The steamed fish with soy and scallions is my favorite item in the hot Chinese food section.  Get some steamed rice or fried rice, get a few pieces of steamed fish and spoon on some sauce and you are good to go.  Sauteed Long Beans, Honey Walnut Prawns, Chinese and Mushrooms, and Fried Sesame Balls are my usual favorites at Krazy Buffet.  If you are new to this eatery, try those.

Other highlights:  crawfish, fried chicken wings, coconut fried shrimps, mini-meatball skewers, Korean BBQ ribs (hit and miss), .

If you planned ahead and saved some room for desserts at the end, you can make your own pie a la mode, or go crazy with the Krazy orange slices, canned fruits, jello, or have some fried plantains.

Krazy Buffet is perfect for all of these occasions, conditions and more:
1)  You have a large party and a limited budget.
2)  General Chinese/Asian food craving.
3)  You are hungry and generally indecisive, but still gotta eat.
4)  Have family units to feed, but no time to cook or you can't cook or you burnt the Stouffers Lasagna (or forgot to turn on the oven).
5)  You are Krazy for buffets.
6)  You want to carb up Asian style before the next 10K.
7)  You are seeking restaurants with plenty of veggie options.

8)  Your Chinese heritage compels you to come up with lucky 8 number of reasons to convince others to check out Krazy Buffet.

Food:  4/5  Great selections. Generally pretty good.

Price/Value:  4.5/5  For AYCE crab legs, the price of admission is very reasonable.

Service:  3.5/5  Drinks are refilled automatically and dirty plates cleared by house elves.  But just like the famous Dobby, a little demonstration of monetary appreciation for services rendered is appreciated.

Parking:  3.5/5  You should park further to walk off those extra calories, but there will be plenty of parking spaces before you get to burn off a single calories.

Rounding up to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times I admit, most of the time its been out of desperation( that's when your stomach is growling, your family can't decide what to eat, you're looking for a place that's pretty cheap, have your cake & eat it too) although I try not to come here too often. Before you read my review take this into consideration, its $7 for lunch & $12 for dinner ALL YOU CAN EAT Asian-ish buffet....WHAT DO YOU ExPEct? Definitely NOT gourmet food!? THat would be one helluva KRAZY idea! In a nutshell salad looked unappetizing, chicken wings were good til I discovered it was because of the MSG that they use on it, egg drop soup tasted like scrambled eggs swimming in cornstarch soup, kalbi beef had an after taste as well as the baked green mussels ( I can taste/smell meats etc when they have been properly washed or cleaned, they have a certain stench to them even after they are cooked) the sushi looked unappealing and the fish did not look fresh, the desserts consisted of canned fruit of the lowest grade possible, almond cookies, chocolate mousse etc., they did have a chocolate & vanilla soft serve yogurt machine but bananas smothered with red sauce? Interesting.... At least they had sliced fresh oranges. They did have crab legs for dinner as well as seasoned crab pieces. The ok dishes for me were the chop suey, the pot sticker and the fried rice. Hey at least the food is edible...not a total waste of money. If you are looking for a place to just satisfy your hunger that is within your budget that can give you the variety you crave then you have come to the right place! Oh and by the way I think that buffet @ Asia has way more varieties and fresher more delicious food than here, it is more expensive though. Bon apetit!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I are not big people but we can sure eat and this place is so reasonably cheap and we have never had a bad experience here.  The food is always coming out fresh when the trays are half empty, the variety of food will please everyone.  My daughter loves this place since she is a picky eater.  You have to try it and for the price you have nothing to lose and everything to gain lol.  xoxoxo"}
{"text":"My fella is an Asian buffet food fiend and I try to indulge him from time to time by enduring a meal at Buffet of Asia because I'm a good girlfriend! This morning I decided to indulge him as well as my Yelpyness by trying a new place where he could eat Asian food til her bursts and I'd have the opportunity to check off a bookmark from my list. Win win. 

We arrived around 11 and the place wasn't too busy. The place is pretty clean and service was really attentive. Refills were quick and plates were cleared away quickly as well. 

On to the food. The line was kept clean and the food options were plentiful. I was impressed by the amount of veggie options that they had. That is often lacking in buffets. I will probably never be a big fan of buffets, but this is one of the better options in town."}
{"text":"We've come here and given this place another chance against my better judgment. Seems every time we come the owner or manager (or whoever he is) is so completely rude. We came in at 8:30 on Friday night and they close at 10. They started taking food off the buffet at 9:15 and asked us to pay so they could close their register at 9:30. When we said we'd pay when we were done eating he got angry and said they were closing and that everyone else had paid so we needed to as well. And when we asked why they were taking the food away so early they said everyone was done. Uhhh, no we aren't!! They were so rude and this is the second time we've been through this with them at this location. The location on Cheyenne is much better with better management and better service and they don't treat the customers like this and close 45 minutes early and ask you to pay before you're done eating. We won't be coming back. Didn't get our money's worth at all, and don't appreciate being rushed to pay while eating with 45 minutes left before closing. Horrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"This buffet is pretty standard and has a lot of seafood. We came on a Sunday which the price is $12.99 plus you have to pay for a drink which is $1.40. 

The service was okay. I had to wait until I got my second round of food for the server to come and bribg me a drink. I think if your party is big and gets stuck in the room sometimes the server forgets about your party. I had to flag our server down a couple of times to ask for drinks for some of our party as well as for myself. 

The crab legs were good. Some had barely anything inside and some had a good amount. The egg drop soup was really good and the walnut shrimp was a bit tangy. I liked the deep fried shrimp too. 

I thought it was cool that they actually had a candle we borrowed to put on a dessert for my mom's birthday so we could sing happy birthday to her. Also they have coupons where you can get 10% off and you just have to print it and give it to them when paying."}
