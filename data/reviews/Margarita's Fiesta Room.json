{"text":"Margarita's Fiesta sounds like it should be a delightful, authentic, and fun Mexican dining experience. I had extremely high hopes for this restaurant. As a self-professed Mexican food addict, I could not wait to try this place out. But unfortunately, Margarita's Fiesta was no party at all.  Friday night on Baldwin Street is a lively place with an excess of restaurants, all of them boasting lots of patios, people, music, and conversation; Margarita's is no exception. They have a cozy patio out front, a larger patio on the roof, and tons of colourful umbrellas and luscious plant life. Add in the sounds of the Gypsy Kings, and it's enough to lure anyone in.  The restaurant is quaint and decorated with traditional Mexican and Peruvian artwork, and the restrooms are an art gallery in and of themselves, a fitting homage to Mexico's own Frida Kahlo and her incredible self-portraits. Sounds fun! I know! But that was where the fun stopped...  When we arrived, we were greeted with a grunt, and then pointed to a table on the lower patio. When we asked if we could be seated upstairs, we were told it was closed, only to see guests seated upstairs within the hour. Not a great first impression...  It took a solid 15 minutes before we saw anyone willing to accept our drink order of a pitcher of sangria ($24), which arrived with more ice than wine, a few apple slices, and little flavour. Ever the optimists though, we decided to overlook those and a few small details, and we were anxious to try the food.  We decided to start with their 'famous' nacho chips and guacamole, which arrived only minutes after ordering. The quick arrival slightly redeemed the long wait for cold drinks on a hot Friday night, but the fact that plates, or even napkins, were almost impossible to come by brought us back. Apparently, according to our server, cutlery is reserved for the special people that order entrees.  Almost a half hour later, we were finally allowed to order our mains, after numerous sidelong glances and polite 'excuse mes' to our server. Between the three of us we ordered the Chicken Taco Salad ($12), Chicken Quesadillas ($11) and Vegetarian Enchiladas ($14), each with a side of salad and/or rice. When our meals finally arrived, they were much smaller than I expected, especially for a Mexican restaurant, which is normally known for their large portions size and abundance of extras like salsa, cilantro, sour cream, hot sauce; none of which found their way to our table.  Our meals were okay, but certainly not noteworthy. The taco salad was crispy and fresh, but lacked the colourful palette of ingredients normally found on a taco salad and was overall, a little bland. The quesadilla was small-one tortilla cut in half-with a meagre side salad and no additional toppings to speak of. The enchilada was a decent sized portion, but swam in so much grease and oil, it was difficult to find the substance of the actual meal, whihc was supposedly green peppers, onions and cheese. Overall, we were really quite disappointed with our drinks and our meal. On top of the unfriendly and snail-like service, I was very underwhelmed by my experience at Margarita's Fiesta.  If you are looking for a fun, friendly and rewarding Mexican dining experience, be sure to try out Ahora on Dalhousie Street the next time you find yourself in our nation's Capital, which is Ottawa by-the-way;) Until then, I will be on the lookout for a Toronto Mexican restaurant that lives up to what a Mexican restaurant should be."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill.  5years ago I found the food great. But Ihave been there a few times since and have decided not to go there anymore.  You for sure can make a better dish of guacamole on your own. There are so many online recipes. The fishbowls were always fun. Last few times I went there. I noticed the food and drinks were no longer the same.  Maybe its under new management. Overall not impressed and won't return."}
{"text":"I had the enchilada with shrimp a couple nights ago. Food was pretty decent, service was OK, and decor really is just OK. The restaurant is more for a casual student night crowd, as the tables and chairs don't match and the atmosphere is cheap/ shabby chic.   I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Mediocre overpriced food. We had a party of six, and when it came time to pay we all added in tip of fifteen percent, little did we know the waiter charged fifteen percent gratuity on our check without us knowing. He gave us the full bill as we were leaving. Don't trust them."}
{"text":"This is our favourite place!! We come whenever we can! We always order the same thing too!! The chicken enchiladas with red sauce and nachos with salsa and guacamole. DEEEEEEELICIOUS!! And don't forget about the lime margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Decent amount of people on the patio so it looked promising, The  margerita was a \"bit\" light on the tequila -& also it was horrible .  way overpriced -I understand you canucks have absurd liquor laws but  $30 for 2 margaritas , come on now."}
{"text":"First off, amazing food. If I could rate it a 3.5 I would. Burritos were excellent, I do with there was a soy meat option though. Guac, salsa and nachos were lovely and fresh.  However half the equipment in the place was broken when we went in, no blender so it was margaritas on the rocks (wtf?), no fryer so taquitos or anything else fried was a no go, and because we came in at 8pm the waiter informed us that many of the options on the menu (no including those that required equipment that was broken) were off the table.  That being said, I am willing to give this place another shot because the food we did get was fantastic.  Sidenote, while they accept credit card, they do not accept debit."}
{"text":"My first week in Toronto, having moved here from Vancouver, the sun was shining super brightly and my coworker and I were looking for a patio. We found one at Margarita's....along with some YUMMY sangria. The service wasn't horrible...although I wouldn't say above average. We decided to go back on May 5th to celebrate Cinqo de Mayo. We got there after the lunch rush...around 2pmish and it was not busy. We waited FOREVER to get our drink order taken and then even longer for them to come back and take our food order. My \"veggie\" quesidilla came with a HUGE black hair on it...so needless to say it went back. I ordered a veggie quesidilla and expected peppers, mushrooms, etc. It had two pieces of broccoli and a couple of carrots in it. How is that Mexican???? Plus the veggies were old, probably freezer burnt and tasted like crap. They then overcharged us, didn't offer anything for my hairy food and were generally angry that we showed up right before they closed for the dinner rush. I say go to Taco Bell....it would be more consistent!"}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch and sat outside, the patio is nice and cozy with greenery all around you. I ordered the chips and salsa with black bean soup. The chips said they were homemade weren't even hot, like whats the point of homemade chips if they're going to taste like they're out of the bag. The salsa and soup was delicious though, I finished the whole thing so that definitely made up for it. My sister had the salad which she said was one of the best salads she's ever had. The service was a bit impersonal, very casual. Wouldn't come back, but definitely recommend the delicious food minus the cold chips!"}
{"text":"Great service, super friendly staff. Margaritas were fairly good but were served in rather clunky glasses. The burrito I had was okay, but portion sizes were small and unjustifiable with the plainness of the fare. Perhaps the non-vegan options were more inspired."}
{"text":"Even though I've been here a bunch of times, I can never remember the name--for the longest time Margarita's has been \"that Mexican place on Baldwin\". The name is pretty generic, after all; it would be like calling a German restaurant Bratwurst Beer Hall. The food is pretty generic too, but not too bad for lunch if you're in the neighbourhood.  So I'd pretty much agree with J W.'s  assessment. Being on Baldwin Street (which is like some kind of freak zoning accident--a bunch of restaurants and shops on what looks like a residential street) is a definite plus, and Margarita's leafy front patio takes advantage of its fun location."}
{"text":"Mediocre and over-priced food with below-average service. Nice patio though."}
{"text":"Yesterday, myself and a small group of co-workers headed to Baldwin St. for dinner to see if we could find a nice patio.  Margarita's seemed the most lively on the street so we decided to give it a try.    We walked up to the sign that said \"Please wait to be seated\" and waited.  Then we waited some more.  Finally one of the guys in the group tried to flag down the waitress.  Without missing a beat she scooted right passed us with a \"wait just a minute\" and was off.  Five minutes later this happened again, meanwhile the line is getting longer behind us.  Then, the patio table next to where we were waiting finished up and wanted to pay.  They wanted to split the bill among more than one credit/debit card and were told that \"we don't do that here, but there's an ATM in the back\" by the waitress.  They in turn remarked that they had never heard of a restaurant unwilling to split the bill like that, clearly implying that Margarita's should get with the picture!  The waitress, in bad form, then proceed to argue with them and give them attitude:  \"Many restaurants don't do it.  I'VE eaten at plenty of restaurants...many many many restaurants won't do it\".  The management needs to teach servers how to graciously accept some constructive criticism about the restaurant.  (At the end of my meal I paid part of the bill on my debit card while others paid cash, so it is clear that they have the technology to bill-split on multiple cards but would rather force customers into using their in-house ATM.  Bad, bad, bad.)   Okay, so back to our experience.  We are finally seated with a different (male) waiter taking care of us.  He brings menus, but not enough for everyone at the table.  It's okay though, we share.  He then comes for the drink orders and some of us order Margaritas (at $11/pop) while the rest order water.  As an appetizer we order some Guacamole and Nachos.  The Margaritas show up in about five minutes, but we never get our water.  I guess customers not spending lots of money on booze are not a top priority.  Our nachos and some bland house salsa arrive.  15 minutes later and half way through the Nachos we have to ask about the Guacamole.  They bring it out 5 minutes later, but no more chips---the chips they brought out 20 min ago with the salsa were supposed to go with the Guacamole we never got.  The food was okay, but not great.  Passable Mexican, but nothing to write home about.  My black bean soup was a sodium bomb (not in a good way) so I would suggest avoiding that particular dish.  Talking about Sodium, it was at this point in the meal that I noticed we STILL did not have any water.  We asked the waiter again, who then brought us the water, but without any apology.  If he remembered we had ordered it at the beginning of the evening he didn't show it.    After finishing our meal, and telling our waiter we were done, we waited 20 min without any more attention, and without the bill.  We finally flagged down the waiter for the bill which took 5 more minute to come.  We then waited another 20 minutes without the waiter returning for our payment.  Finally we brought the bill inside to the bar to settle up.  Everyone inside was pleasant enough to us, but again, no acknowledgement of making us wait.  We paid (and tipped well as we always do despite the service).  We left.  Good riddance.   To sum up my impression of the place:  Mediocre food.  Inattentive and narcissistic service.  There are better and friendlier places to eat on Baldwin, and much better Mexican in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and that's 2x too many. The first time was for dinner and the experience was like that Woody Allen line from Annie Hall: \"The food in this place is really terrible. Yes, and such small portions.\"  Seriously, everyone complained about the mediocrity of their dishes then further moaned that there wasn't enough. This was across the board: burrito, quesadillas, and flautas.  My second visit was for the Yelp sangria crawl. Blech. My 9 year old niece could make better sangria--with Kool-Aid. Theirs was watery and insipid. No flavor at all. It was almost like they pre-mixed a big batch and let all the ice melt in the hot afternoon sun.  Even after two big gobletfuls, I wasn't the slightest bit tipsy. And I can usually get drunk just by looking at a glass of wine. Big FAIL."}
{"text":"Although the place was nearly empty, service was very slow and the waitress was condescending when I asked if we could order. They also said they dont offer separate checks. What a hassle. The Chips and Salsa cost extra and the salsa was like a red watery broth. Normally I wouldn't have even considered eating such lackluster salsa but since I had paid extra for it I felt obliged.  The interior was dark, and the decor a sort of shabby festive style. The saving grace was the menu. The food names were clever, and the plates offered finer ingredients. The food came up fast and it was presented well and tasted excellent. I had the ceviche tostadas, a comination Ive never seen before, and it was top notch. Still, I would not go back, the bad service and cramped environment made me uncomfortable and I couldnt wait to get out of there. Its a shame, I go to Mexican restaurants at least once a week."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday eve dinner with an ever changing group of about 8 and had a delightful time. We drank a rainbow of margaritas - all delicious - as well as yummy sangria. The beer selection was just ok, but did branch out from corona to include dos equus and negra modelo.  We ate guacamole (excellent and presented in a mocajante, which earns points for presentation) and nachos (also good). They brought two hot sauces, one of which was spicy enough to burn a bit, which makes me a happy girl. My chicken quesadilla was just ok, and the shredded iceberg lettuce masquerading as a salad brought the class level down a bit.  After our meal our server brought a round of tequila shots for the table, followed by deep fried ice cream. On the house. Which tells me that we were the most rambunctious table in the place and that we probably drank too much. But I'm a gal who loves to celebrate her birthday and this was a perfect touch.  Points off for the total lack of service later in the evening. Our original, awesome, server was cut and the fellas working in her stead were nowhere near as attentive. We had to send a scout in to place a drink order and my fella was never given an opportunity to order to nachos he wanted. The evening was getting a bit long in the tooth and they were close to closing, so I'll forgive them, but they could have done better."}
{"text":"I love their margarita and sangria! They are so yummy. I tried many foods over the years, like fajita, taco, nacho, enchilada and so on. They were all delicious, and I left the restaurant with smiles all over my face each time! Staff is friendly, but it gets too busy in summer"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Margarita's.  *Atmosphere* Typical Can-Mex restaurant. The inside was hot as hell; we sat out on the patio which is the big draw to this place. The patio is nice and quiet and very private with trees and shrubs shielding you from the street.  *Service* The service was not attentive. Draught beer wasn't available for some reason so we were stuck with $6.50 bottles of Mexican beers, or $5 Canadian/Coors bottles as our beer choices.   We only saw our waiter twice, once to take the order and once to give us our drinks.   The guy who brought our food from the kitchen insisted that we ordered one beef and one chicken enchilada meal (we ordered two chickens). He didn't know which plate was which anyways to give the \"beef\" one to the right person. I said I'd take the beef one so he'd go away and when my wife and I dug in, they were both chicken.  Our waiter or the guy who brought our food didn't bother checking in if our food was okay. We asked for the green tomatillo sauce (medium spice) for both orders of enchiladas; instead we got the red tomatillo sauce (spicy). I had to get up and go to the back to the service window of the kitchen (where I could see the cooks horsing around) to let them know they messed up 2 of our orders. They gave me some of the green tomatillo sauce in a cup. They're lucky we both chose the green sauce over the red because of flavour and not because that we couldn't handle the spice, otherwise they would have been making another set of meals.  *Drinks* Margaritas here are really good though; probably not what's considered \"authentic\" for food snobs but I enjoyed it and could have went to town drinking those.   The sangria I thought had a good balance of flavour but I'm not an experience sangria drinker so take my opinion on that lightly.  *Food* We ordered chips and salsa (not complimentary; $3), 2 orders of chicken enchiladas with green tomatillo sauce and one beef burrito.  Chips were fine but the salsa was terrible. It was the red tomatillo sauce from what I could tell and was watery. No chopped vegetables or anything else. Just a runny, watery red sauce. I don't know if this is an authentic salsa or something but it's certainly not the salsa I'm accustomed to having in Canada. You couldn't actually dip your chip into it because it would just run off and leave you will a soggy chip.  Enchiladas meals came with 2 enchiladas each, 1 cup of Mexican rice and  1/2 cup of beans in a tortilla cup. Portions were very small for $15.   The burrito came by itself with a 1/4 cup of pico de gallo. Good sized burrito. Very plain looking, no points for presentation here but whatever, not really that important.  Everyone said the taste of their food was good notwithstanding the aforementioned problems. Portions are small and overall you aren't getting good value for your money in my opinion."}
{"text":"Last Wednesday I made my maiden voyage to Margarita Fiesta Room with a group of 4 girls on the promise of delicious guac...  When we arrived there we were fortunate to get a table on their very cramped patio. Looking around the margarita's looked delicious however, my friends and I opted for a pitcher of sangria....a mistake I will not make again. It was watery and very bland. 'Very bland' then made another appearance in the guac...I felt my heart break from the disappointment. They did leave us with a side of hot sauce to pump the  guac up but it really didn't add much either.  For my entree I ordered their chorizo sausage taco's which were surprisingly filling...likely on account of the grease that was spilling from them.  Overall I didn't not find the food terrible by any means...just mediocre at best. I would recommend trying it once if your desperate for Mexican food."}
{"text":"We went with friends everyone was quite happy with their meals.  The service was good and our waitress was prompt and solicitous.  I had the tortilla soup which was passable but needed to be transferred to a more appropriate bowl.  My chicken enchilada was excellent and the large Margarita is highly recommended.  It was too wet to sit on the patio so we sat by the front window.  The decor is cheap and cheerful and the bill was painless.  Satisfying all around."}
{"text":"Food was alright but, as others have mentioned, overpriced.  Unfortunately, the service was really disappointing. We were two couples, one with a baby in a baby-basket thingy (obviously I'm no parent). Staff were rude to them as they tried to find a spot for the wee one. I realize space is limited but they really didn't have to be so rude about it. Otherwise, staff were apathetic towards us in general.  I've been here a few times over the years and this visit was definitely the last one. There are SO MANY better options for mexican food in the city. Which is a shame because they're in a good location."}
{"text":"Enjoy the drinks & avoid the food at all costs. Pricy considering the quality."}
{"text":"Will resist every request to split a bill. Will charge you ~17$ for fajitas that are of below average quality. Benefit of this place - location! Baldwin is great because it has many different restaurants, so you don't actually have to eat here."}
{"text":"Maybe its the time of year, but it was a great night here at Margaitas. The tables are full of happy people, eating and drinking. The food is a delight, I had the chicken platter with all the makings of your own fajitas. What a great street Baldwin is. Sayid was a great server, happy smiling guy. Try it right away, while its still summer."}
{"text":"Delicious quesadillas and tacos, solid guac, good (and large) drinks! The patio on the front is super cute and perfect for summer. Overall would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to visit in Toronto. The food is always super fresh and the margaritas are absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend the cheeseburger chimichanga and the guacamole dip, both are incredible!!"}
{"text":"Fucking delicious! I had the chicken little enchilada and it was a flavour blast of deliciousness. Oh and the cucumber pineapple margarita was phenomenal. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I came to Margarita's looking for a patio on which to spend my lunch hour soaking up some sun on an exceptionally warm day, and I have to say, that would be the only reason why I'd come back.  It's not even that their patio is great, it's just that they have one and it's close by.  Other than that, I found the food overpriced and lacking. The corn tortillas were dry and flavourless, and the tacos dish for $11 has two tiny tacos on the plate.  My margarita was delicious, but also overpriced."}
{"text":"I like this place. I am not a mexican food conoisseur but was very happy.  We have not tried any meat, but have had the veggie burrito, tostadas and salad. We were happy with it all.  Service is good but they really need some sort of ventilation, especially in the summer."}
{"text":"We hit Baldwin street in hopes of finding a nice patio for dinner.  Margarita's has an upstairs balcony that looks like a great place to dine, but I wouldn't know.  Even after we specifically requested to sit at the empty table upstairs, we were asked to sit on the patio at street level.  We weren't the exact number of people they wanted to seat up there.    Service was just okay.  I think we got everything we asked for, but we had to get the waiter's attention if we wanted anything - we weren't asked or offered.  Also, when we tried to ask for a dessert menu, we got the bill instead.  I think this was just a misunderstanding, but I still don't know if they serve fried ice cream.  I gave Margarita's one star because my meal was disgusting, and I don't consider myself a picky eater.  Don't order the tostadas with chicken.  For whatever reason, they used poor quality tasteless chicken that ruined my meal.  Others ordered chicken for their tacos and fajitas and got higher quality chicken, but still nothing to rave about.  Sangria was pretty good.  Next time I'll stick to drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in while in the area for a business luncheon. Had tacos pescado,  nachos with fresh guacamole and a couple of corona's. Quite an enjoyable afternoon on the patio."}
{"text":"Brilliant food and drinks... One of the best Mexican places in Toronto.. small but great service!!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"I don't want to let this place waste another minute of my life so I'm gonna keep this review very short.  Yelp should allow 0 star rating just for the sake of this place. Horrible service on the top of horrible food.   Servers weren't rude or anything, just extremely slow. May be this place is understaffed, from what I've seen...  I ordered beef quesadila and minced beef ... i'm sure it was from the can. Huh? I'm paying 11.95 for this right? Why am I getting something equally as bad as taco bell at twice the price? At least at taco bell you get what you order in faster manner!  Didn't even get the right change... I like to think it was honest mistake, which i'm sure it was... But either way it totally was a grand finale for my horrible dining experience from this place."}
{"text":"I have been to Margarita's a few times now and have decided that it's only so-so and it might be a good idea to seek out a better Mexican restaurant.  Although the atmosphere on the patio on Baldwin Street is fun, the food is lacking and the service is a little slow.  -the margaritas are perfectly made and pretty strong -the guacamole is pretty good, but there is not enough for the chips that come with it -the tacos el pastor, or pork tacos with adobo sauce and guacamole are probably the best dish on the menu, but is quite expensive at $13 for three little tacos -the queso with mushrooms is niece, but not quite your typical queso  It seems like almost everything we like off the menu comes with a \"but\" unfortunately.  Unfortunately those are all of the good things I can think of.  The fish tacos are bad.  The fishiest fish tacos I've ever had.  Bleh.  As well, the crispy crunch falutas, although tasty, were anything but crispy.  At the end of the day, I feel like you walk away with a pretty hefty bill, feeling slightly disappointed at paying that much for an unsatisfying experience."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food. Better than Tex Mex.  The ambiance felt like I was in a little Mexican restaurant. Would recommend the moo moo burrito."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. I have been here many times. Amazing menu and also great margaritas. The ambiance is lovely. The service is good. Not great, but good. It really depends on who is on. Only one of the waitresses really bummed me out once, but I loved everyone else who worked there. Great place, great music, great food , and really fun to drink here in the summer. I can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"I like going to Margaritas for a couple of reasons.  #1: the margaritas #2: the margaritas That's it really. The margaritas and daquiris are gynormous. The waiters are pretty cute too (at least the were the last few times i've been). If you want a delicious and HUGE margarita, you won't be dissapointed. The food is ok. But nothing special.  I love Baldwin St. and the patio is pretty nice. There is also another room upstairs."}
{"text":"LOVE the margaritas! The nachos are absolutely delicious but a little more wouldn't hurt ;)"}
{"text":"Nice waitress, but she kept short changing us! Cute atmosphere, other than that, I've had better Mexican."}
{"text":"On Baldwin St you usually a bunch of Japanese/Chinese restaurants, so it was a nice surprise to find this little gem. The interior is quite small but it's good for small groups. Although it does get quite loud, I think it's a good place to get food and beer.  I went on a Tuesday so they had their taco special (3 for $10). I got the tacos de pescado which basically had breaded fish fillet in it. When it came out, I was surprised to see how small my portion looked... They used small soft tortillas rather than the medium-sized ones, so that's why. BUT DON'T BE FOOLED, it was actually quite a filling meal. Each of my fish tacos was topped with a pickled red cabbage and a chipotle sauce. If you want, you can add some of their hot sauce into it as well (be careful, it's really spicy!!). Honestly, they were probably the best tacos I've had. It was oozing with goodness and contrary to what I initially though, I was really full after my meal!  If I wanted to catch up with some friends, this may not be the place to go as it's really loud. Otherwise, 10/10 I would come back for more tacos or at least try the other goodies they have!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with my boyfriend. No complaints on the portion sizes or the food itself. Delicious and hearty. Try the plates with rice and beans - I had both chicken and tiger shrimp and both meals were good. The drinks are also good, large and one may be enough to get you feeling \"happy\". Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I once brought some Mexican teenagers here and they were impressed. They thought they were going to be having \"Taco Bell\" type food (the only Mexican food they thought we had) and were really impressed.   My favourite dish here is the chicken burrito (enchilada?) in the mole (cocoa) sauce washed down with their refreshing sangria... followed by a siesta.  The place is cozy, it has character, and I've enjoyed my meal every time I've been here."}
{"text":"If you want a margarita for lunch that you can dive into and swim around in, than this is the place to go.   Margarita's namesake are the drinks undoubtedly, but besides that, the food is just ok, and not authentically Mexican in any way.  I've been there a handful of times during school and it's one of those places where you can giggle with a girlfriend and exchange drink flavours.   Nothing more to say that hasn't already been said."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch especially when the patio is available.  It is sunny and pleasant enough for a downtown area spot.  Why I like coming here is that it is close enough to my work and carries a good variety of Mexican fare.  My favourite is the Shrimps with Garlic, dangerous for my love life but oh so yummy!  I also had the fish tacos which were healthy and yummy.  If you get a margarita you will feel like you are on vacation then it is time to get back to work.  So if you work close by this is a good place to lament not being somewhere tropical and drown your sadness with good drinks and food."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food and Margarita's used to be one place on Baldwin that I didn't really care for. I've been there with people who have complained of food poisoning after eating there although I've never personally experienced that. They do serve up decent margarita's and their larger \"fish bowl\" sizes are tasty if you are looking for that sugar fix. I had not been here for a couple of years until I popped in last week for a work lunch, I had very low hopes but then realized a lot of their food have undergone a make over in terms of ingredients and overall quality. So that meant I could breathe a sigh of relief.  For that I give this 3 stars as opposed to the 2 it deserved a while back. A major negative for me here is that the prices are too steep and for a place like Baldwin, I feel like there has to be a \"lunch menu\" which they lack.  The deco is extremely Mexican and I feel like they do a lot in terms of the variety they bring to Baldwin Village, but I don't find the seating comfortable, the 2 patios do a fine job of people watching in the summer although I have yet to properly spend time on the 2nd floor one.  Overall the pricing, comfort level and my own lack of enthusiasm for Mexican food will probably keep me away from here unless it is with a group of people that really want Mexican."}
{"text":"I enjoyed coming to this place with a couple friends. Very relaxed atmosphere, nice Spanish music playing in the background and colourful and fun decor. Food was tasty and overall I would say it's authentic with a twist.   I gave this place 3 stars for the following reasons:   Could be more generous with the guacamole and salsa that comes with the chips. I thought the portions for those dips were quite small, especially since we were sharing that appetizer.   Service could be faster, considering we're not in a fine dining restaurant. There was one server working all the tables until about half way through the time I was there.   It is a little pricey overall for the portions they are giving you. The drink prices are average but the food prices could definitely be more reasonable.   Positives:   Very tasty food. Dishes are very nicely seasoned, lots of flavour. I also liked how they were descriptive in their menus in a fun way.    Their drinks are really good, especially the cocktails, you can actually taste the flavour of the alcohol without it being completely obliterated by the additional ingredients. I recommend the mango! The size of their specialty drinks are decent as well.   Cosy atmosphere. Good for a date night but at the same time good for groups as well.   Overall, I would definitely come back here, more so for the drinks."}
{"text":"I remain shocked at the fact that I am the only person who has reviewed \"La Cabana\" on the Danforth.   I'm a fan of Mexican. And Mexican done well and done by \"the little guy\" is even better than mass-produced Mexican a la Chipotle at Yonge & Dundas or otherwise.   Margaritas is a chain, yes, but it is run like it isn't. The receipts are all paper-based and your credit card will get run through one of those old school imprint machines.   Anyhow, I stepped in here one night because I was in the neighbourhood. If I was closer to home, I would have gone to La Cabana. And then I would have eaten good food, instead of the gross, over-cilantro'd stuff I bought there. Also, I think it's fair to warn patrons when they order a burrito or a quesadilla or something otherwise filled with chicken that you in fact use lots of dark meat for filling and even other parts of the chicken which many people do not enjoy. Or don't enjoy paying $12 to eat. When I dug into the burrito I ordered I was completely grossed out.   That's really all I have to say. Visit La Cabana on the Danforth for good, quality, well-priced Mexican food and skip places like this. Hype is a bitch."}

{"text":"Went with a bunch of colleagues from work. Each ordered drinks (beers are reasonably priced, margaritas are a little on the expensive side). We were in a bit of rush as we were going to an escape room right after so we were happy that the service was very fast. Each ordered a dish (tacos or enchiladas). Flavours are very good. Ordered fish tacos myself: well grilled fish on soft corn flour tortillas with pico de gallo and creamy avocado.  Portion sizes (3 small tortillas) was a little unreasonable given the prices and the fact that they applied gratuity on groups, 5 people or larger.  Would still recommend if in the neighborhood, but be willing to spend on multiple items if you are going for dinner."}
{"text":"Chill place, servers rock, food is delicious and they have awesome margaritas. They've got a huge tequila and mezcal menu which I love, and they put repasado tequila in their margaritas. The food is great value and the patio is lovely. Really great place to come with friends on a nice day! For food, the corn is incredible, so are the nachos... and pretty much everything on the menu we've tried! Oh"}
{"text":"The place is a little sticky but the food is fabulous and the margaritas are best in town."}
{"text":"Not stellar but passable is about the best review I can give Margarita's.  A 2nd theme for this review could be: \"would you like some salt with your salty salted salt?\"  Went with friends who'd been going for years and spoke highly of the venue, even tho Yelp would tell me differently.  As always, I should have listened to Yelp and ignored my friend :)  Drinks:  nice selection of mexican beers, served cold and kinda hard to disappoint with.  Margaritas in many flavours, average priced, but not made with real fruit.  For $7, I'd expect more.  Had chips and guacamole app.  Wasn't impressed.  The guacamole app was very pricy, and small - tho served in a mortar and pestle so points for presentation, but meh for all else.  The chips were just _barely_ crisp.  I think they were restaurant-made, but perhaps not cooked long enough or kept dry enough in the humid air.  Dunno, but they shouldn't be chewy.  I'd rather have commercially packaged chips than chips that aren't crisp.  2 of us had soups (one black bean, 1 soupa de lima) both soups were so salty that we could just barely choke them down.  If they had other flavours you had to work to find them around the salt.   The fish entree special was pretty good value, presentation and taste.  3 people at the table had enchiladas.  General opinion of the enchiladas was that they were acceptable, nothing special, and not worth $15.  I had the seafood stew/soup/bouillabaisse.  The seafood was good, but again the soup stock was so salty that I generally passed on it.  The soup came with a mini-loaf of bread that was bathed in salt, herbs and oil.    Finally, when the bill arrived, a 15% grat was appended to the bill.  For a table of 6? Really?!  The service was acceptable, I've certainly had better and felt happier about leaving a larger than 15% tip.  Given all the \"meh\" of this meal the 15% seemed excessive, but very much like the icing on the \"meh\" cake.  My original writing of this review had them at 3 stars, but with all the negatives that I recounted while writing this review I dropped my rating to 2 stars.  Won't be in any hurry to go back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Tony our server was very attentive. Our group had skinny burrito - they added jalapeño no charge, delicious! The tacos al pastor we good, just wish I could have eaten it all! Portion was generous. Last entree was chicken enchiladas- yum, chicken was moist and flavorful. Had guacamole that was fresh and outstanding. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not recommending! This is based on my lunch experience today! I have to confess, Margarita's up to today was my favorite Mexican place (I would give them 3-4 stars easy) but 1 bad experience and all is gone. I have been to Margarita's several times (it's close to work and cozy and I like Baldwin Ave) with friends and family. Everyone liked the place.  My favorite dish so far is French kiss tostadas )it's pretty popular and they run out quick so get there early if you want it) and I recommend the guacamole and fish tacos.  However, today was a different day and I actually complained about the food all day! We ordered the tacos al pastor and tostada de ceviches (tilapia, cold dish). The tostada was not what I will order again, it just too bland for my taste. The taco was not impressive either. There was a specific taste to it that reminds me of cooking with a burned cooking oil in addition to the chunks of fat in the meat!  The guacamole used to be very tasty with chunks of avocado but today it looked and tasted like the packaged guacamole you buy from the store without any flavors!  So all in all today was a not a good experience! I hope this was an exception and not the rule!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but I have had better.  Taco shells became mushy.  We odered chips and salsa and the salsa came in little squeeze bottles.  The flavour was good but awkward to eat every chip with.  Over priced for the quality.  The service was horrible as the man was incredibly rude too my mother more then once.  The menu says cash and MasterCard with atm upstairs however they would not take MasterCard. I wish I would want to go back as the patio is cute and its a great location. Overall there are.much better places to go."}
{"text":"Convenient for hospital employees and UofT students, but not exactly budget friendly compared to cheap hole-in-the-wall Mexican places also near the university like Sneaky Dee's. Came here late on a Friday night for dinner and found the place almost dead empty except for one large ratchet group of college students and another couple.  Service is friendly and the servers certainly have a sense of humor. The portion sizes are bigger than at El Loco Local (similar prices), especially the corn (full versus half) and tacos. But expect to drop at least $10 here per person to fill up.   There's a lot of variety on the menu - even for vegetarians! But not very vegan friendly as expected since there's a lot of use of cheese/cream. We ordered the mexican street corn on the cob appetizer, which I requested all sauces on the side. One of garnishes - tajin - which has a citrus-y taste and crushed powder appearance was absolutely amazing! It was not spicy despite having a chili red color, but rather tasted like piri piri + lime. For mains we ordered \"The Skinny\" burrito (vegetarian), which was a huge portion and a bit too greasy from a health perspective. The cheese inside also resembled cheap store-bought processed cheese as it clumped together into dense clusters and had a plastic appearance rather than having a warm, melted appearance.  The presentation of the food reinforces the student-friendly vibe (aka. no frills) and the place is kind of dirty/messy. The washrooms (upstairs), however, are pretty clean. Although the interior design is pretty colorful and cultural!  I recommend sitting on the roof or sidewalk patio during the warmer months since inside can get quite loud and rowdy.  Probably won't be back again unless in the area since there's so many other Mexican places - La Carnita, Seven Lives, etc - to try in downtown TO."}
{"text":"Initially, I did not plan on eating at Margaritas, but the place my friend and I had intended to visit was closed.  After checking out their special board, we decided on Margaritas.  We ordered pineapple-cucumber and lime-basil margaritas...both we're absolutely delicious, though I did prefer the pineapple-cucumber to the lime-basil...just because it was a tad sweeter.  For our entrees, I had the chicken taquitos and my friend has the tacos el pastor.  The food was fresh and tasty, service was friendly and fast. The price was actually pretty good.  The entire tab worked out to $32, including tip, for the both of us.  Their patio is quite cozy, unfortunately we were not able to get a table on the patio, but did get a table next to the open window overlooking the patio.    Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"sighhh very meh. We sat on the patio which was really nice, and there were only a few other people there. For some reason they took forever just to take our order and told us that complimentary salsa and chips were on the way. Needless to say these never arrived. After taking our order we had to wait again forever. Not sure what was taking so long since there were probably only 5 other tables seated at the time (and only one other when we had ordered). Finally we got our food - my huevos rancheros were actually pretty good. My friend got 3 pork tacos and only ate one :(. I asked for the bill but of course it didn't come out, eventually we went to the back of the restaurant with our money and asked to pay.   I would only back to for a drink on their patio, don't come here if you're really hungry, you'll wait too long."}
{"text":"Great food and great margaritas. The atmosphere is cute. The kind of place to being your friends... not mom and dad or the kids. The staff is friendly. A little pricey."}
{"text":"Margaritas fiesta room  A nice little Mexican restaurant tucked away on a little street. The kind of place that if you don't know where it is you wouldn't look. If that makes any sense.   It was my turn and I picked Margaritas. I've taken to walking about to find unique places to eat basing my selection on first impressions and price. I was not disappointed with my choice.   We started off with tortillas and guacamole and two large margaritas I was ravenous and they were a great start to sating my appetite. My partner had the beef burrito and I the chicken enchiladas both dishes were good and the portions were plentiful. We finished the meal with an order of churro and coffee. My only disappointment was not having cream for my coffee. It seems to be a quality of Mexican dining as even in Mexico finding cream to go with coffee is difficult.   The atmosphere was nice, cozy and the service was excellent, I felt like I would be walking out into the sound of the ocean and palm trees!  If I wasn't so hungry I would have enjoyed spending more time there, but we were done eating and were out in under an hour."}
{"text":"One of my best friends lives a block down the street from this restaurant, so on monday i decided to give a try. I went there around 3 pm got a chicken burrito and loved it ! the waiter was was a young mexican guy around 20-25. The place wasnt packed due to the time i went. I payed with my debit card and the waiter was extremely polite and gave us a menu as soon as we walked in.       Today i decided to go again because it was the best burrito i have had in a while. After today i can confidently say i will NEVER return to this place even if they payed me to do so. When we walked in the waiter didn't tell us where to seat and when we decided where to seat he said the seats were reserved....okay no problem (even though they were the seats that are there as soon as you come in but didnt bother to tell us that. We switched seats and the guy completely forgot to give us a menu. We asked him two times (ignored us) and finally he gave us one. He had troubles understanding the names of the food (they are in spanish and i'm fluent). We decided to order but after we wanted Calamares Fritos but he was no where in sight so we had to ask a really nice lady that gave us our appetizers. When the burritos finally arrived i was excited. When i bit into it the guacamole wasnt fresh...so it was pretty gross. I know it wasnt fresh due to the fact that being spanish i buy avocado like crazy ! i didnt complain or anything but if was a disappointment. I invited my friends out to eat so we were just waiting for the bill...when it does come i asked to pay with debit and the waiter told me they dont have a debit machine (it was literally behind us on the counter) i asked him if we could use the one on the counter and he said in a very rudely way \" We dont accept debit, you can go upstairs and get money out of the atm\" i did go to the atm got charged 2 dollars that could have gone towards his tip but at this point i just wanted to get out.        I got my friends to come with me telling them it was the best burrito in my life and i payed $60 dollars for a HUGE disappointing experience. I usually dont complain or give too much importance to the service but i never been treated so bad. The thing that pissed me off it's that the waiter said they didnt accept debit......are you kidding me ? On monday at 3 i payed $30 with debit, so how come i \"cant\" pay debit for my bill that came up to $56....?       In my opinion i believe that the staff that worked today wasnt good at all expect for a really nice lady with a yellow shirt. She was so nice, she was basically taking care of us. If i ever do go it will have to be mondays around 3-5 just because the staff that day were extremely nice."}
{"text":"One of the first handful of Mexican restaurants opened in the city of Toronto & in Baldwin Village, Margaritas has some history.  Historically speaking I've only been here a handful of times, and the food is decent, however, not over-the-top foodgasm.  5th time around myself and my foodie partner decided to start off with their:  Mango-mole dip. Solid 3/5- perfect amount of guacamole, however they could have added MORE mango.  I admit, it was a bit disappointing, however their tortilla chips was not oily, nor soggy.   for plata principal! I had their Dirty Miss PIggy Enchiladas: chirzo enchiladas with veggies, served with refried puree beans craddled in a nacho shell, and some spanish rice! overall 3/5........  Overall service is friendly, the ambiance is chilled out, like your typical mexican cantina, dim lighting, colorful murals, sombreros hanging on the walls, and musica blasting in the background.  Though Margaritas can exemplify a mediocre experience at times, its still brings a crowed of people...porque  es Bueno, Bonita & Barato! (because its good, pretty, and cheap)......y their Margartias are delish!!"}
{"text":"If you're nearby, and feel like Mexican, go for it. Don't expect much though. If you're thinking about somewhere to go for Mexican though, there are better places."}
{"text":"Been going for years now. Before I moved to Toronto this was a must stop on my visits to the city. The food is amazing truly out of this world. Reasonably priced and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nice little Mexican spot on Baldwin. Came here with some friends for drinks and dinner on a Friday night.   Drinks are a good size and prices are very reasonable. Food tastes pretty good too. I had the beef tongue tostada. Beef was tender and full of flavour. Only downside was that the paper lining got very soggy and came apart with my food...  They got a cute patio that I'll want to check out in the summer, but it was too cold when we went  They only take Visa, MasterCard or Cash, but there's an ATM upstairs."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to have lunch at Margarita's; reservations were made in advance.  Arrived at the restaurant around 11:40am.  No other patron was seen on the upper or lower floor.  We were kindly advised to order fairly quickly as they are expecting another three parties.    We ordered from the lunch menu.  They finally delivered the lunch at 12:18pm.  Due to a miscalculation, only 9 of 11 people were served food.  The manager eventually came up and made a scene embarrassing the waiter in front of group.  Now it was about 12:30pm.  The missing meals belonged to my colleague and I;l at this point it too late for us to sit and eat as we were due back at work.  We asked for the meal to go; in fear that the manager would take it out on the poor waiter once again if we just cancelled our order.  As we were paying for our meals, the manager was extremely rude and genuinely unapologetic.  Her attitude was truly atrocious for a mistake that had nothing to do with us!  As for the taco salad, it was pretty good.  But it was not worth the experience.  Will never return to this establishment.  The manager needs a large lesson on customer service."}
{"text":"I came here today with my co-workers for my farewell party.  Margarita is well known for their margaritas and sangria; however, I didn't have any because I wanted to be at least somewhat coherent in the afternoon.  Service was okay - but we're still not sure if we were supposed to have free chips or not.  We got some salsa, but no chips (can someone update me on this?)  I had the tacos al carbona - soft tacos with sausage.  It was absolutely delicious.  It comes with a side of salsa and guacamole.  Surprisingly, it filled me up.  Service wasn't THE best.  Granted, it was during the busy lunch time hours and they wanted people in and out."}
{"text":"i think some of the above reviews are a little harsh.   the service is something to be worked on. it's a small restaurant and sometimes it gets really busy and the staff are overwhelmed.   however, i like the food. i find it great every time i go. the menu is pretty flexible, as you can get main courses that are $11, and other mains that are in the $16 range. the appetizers are also good.  during the summer, there's a nice patio. the restaurant is also good for lunch."}
{"text":"My rating is for the margaritas. Service is mediocre as I find that I have to wait for a significant amount of time for anything. The food is below average, I find. I'm no Wolfgang Puck and I'm confident that I could cook better food. Furthermore, the food is quite expensive considering what you get.  In short, come here for a drink.... only! The margaritas come in huge fishbowls and you definitely get your money's worth. :) There's a patio so it's nice to sit in the sun while drinking (in my case it's usually chugging) a margarita."}
{"text":"The people are friendly and the tables/utensils are clean, can't really ask for more on that front.  I've been here twice and the food has been fantastic each time. Watch out though, the place can get kind of busy and you'll end up spending a lot of time waiting. You can order one of their tasty margaritas to pass the time though :)  Oh, and one of my friends thought the chorizo quesadilla was too salty. I didn't taste it myself so I can't say whether or not I agree."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant was great and the waiters were very enthusiastic. The portion of burrito and tostada were really big and they did not skimp out on meat!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a whim because we had both finished classes for the semester and decided we deserved margaritas! We were not disappointed by any means!! The drinks were awesome, cheap tequila shots and the ambiance was so nice! We arrived early during the day and stayed for awhile, the atmosphere was jut so cozy! It felts like your tucked away in a little corner of the city! so comfortable! Honestly, the best tacos I have ever had in my life!  I highly recommend the Tacos De Tinga!! Soooo delicious!!  We will be back soon absolutelty!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to my visit. Great location and setting, but the food was really disappointing. I've had better frozen burritos. My fiancé's meal was poor as well. The server was really nice and we did have a good time. Shame about the food."}
{"text":"Good ambience with Mexican decoration everywhere. They have a small to medium sized front patio with 5 tables for two and a table for 6, another for 4, but the tables can be merged together if needed.   The menu offers a decent selection of specialities, from tacos to nachos, quesadillas, desserts and many cocktails. On Mondays the large margaritas are $10 each, $3 less than the regular price. And they are tasty I would say, the alcohol percentage could be more if you ask me.   The portion sizes are big enough compared to many other places. I ordered nachos($11) and chicken enchiladas ($16). The nachos was full of Ingredients and I loved the melted cheese on top. However it lacks jalapenos and a bit chiliness in it. The enchiladas were OK portion wise, the taste was above average with chicken being tender and pulled pork style.   The reason it got 3 stars instead of 4 is the service. We had the wrong bill, and we waited for quite some time to have the bill too. Our waitress seemed busy and forgot to bring some side items too. The place being almost full is not an excuse, but still it's understandable."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that their quac is atrocious. It's an abomination and a disgrace for a restaurant that calls itself Mexican. I, a non-Mexican, make better quac at home. Their guac is watery and liquidy. I'm not sure if it's a sign of an incompetent Chef or them being greedy by watering down their guac on purpose. Either way, they should be ashamed of the quality of their guac.  Now, on to good things to say. This place feels cozy and not pretentious. In fact, it's the opposite of pretentious. I had a shrimp enchilada and it was great. Something was a little off about it to be honest, but I couldn't figure out what. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it and would come back for more in the future.  Their prices are alright for downtown Toronto. The service is friendly and prompt. Surely, it's not in my top 3 Mexican places to check out in Toronto, but then again, unless you go to St. Clair West, it's hard to find an authentic and not overpriced Mexican joint in downtown Toronto.  Don't take my word for, check out this place and form your own opinion.  To the owner(s) of the restaurant: Seriously, though, fix your guac. It's a disaster."}
{"text":"Thanks to being practically behind PMH and Mount Sinai, Margarita's serves as a popular after shift meetup for hospital staff. Their famously large margaritas and half decent sangria make this spot the better (only?!) watering hole on Baldwin. However, as mentioned by other Yelpers, this would not be my first choice of a dining spot on the block!   While I never got food poisoning, I don't ever remember enjoying a meal here that was above average in taste! The chicken fajitas, at just under $20 per dish, are pretty bland and somehow don't even have much of a Mexican flavour to them! The guacamole is the one item I've tried here that tastes like what the name suggests, and I can tell you that it's decent but again, not worth the price! 3* for Drinks 2* for Food"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Thursday.  Sat upstairs on the patio.  Great patio (my co-workers and I were hoping that these old elevated patios are inspected by the city for structural integrity).  Server was a young, dirty blonde guy.  I think he had long hair in a pony tail.  He was excellent, very accomodating.  He even over-heard that I had spilled sauce on my pants and went right away and got me a fresh cloth and soda water.  Very impressed. I ordered the naughty camarones (shrimp in a spciy sauce with tomatoe, green pepper, and red repper, served with a small portion of yellow rice).  There were 6 jumbo shrimp (or \"prawns\" as my co-worker said they were).  This dish was AMAZING!  The sauce was oily, but it was so delicious that I dumped my rice in it and ate it all.  The shrimp was soooo good.  At $13 for the dish, well worth-it.  Good food, good atmosphere, good service.  A co-worker of mine had a lemonade margarita and it tasted fresh-squeezed.  I was with a large group and everyone's dish looked delicious.  Would like to go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"The margaritas are delicious but overpriced. I recommend going for the 14 oz variety without hesitation, as you'd probably want seconds anyway. If you absolutely hate tequila, you can ask to have rum or vodka instead.   The food, much like the margaritas, is overpriced. In all fairness, you can really tell that they use fresh ingredients. The tortilla was excellent. I was, however, somewhat disappointed  with the low meat to filler ratio in my burrito. The massive amounts of lettuce really distracted from the tenderness of the beef."}
{"text":"Any restaurant  with Tankhouse on tap gets a thumbs up from me. Ironically none of us got a Margarita. The sangria was a little bland I think, but the mango guacamole (literally just guacamole with pieces of mango) was delicious, with a nice kick. Had the tacos al carbon, and although simple, were totally scrumptious. The place is in a great location nestled away on Baldwin and the atmosphere complimented it perfectly. The service was not 5-star but there were no issues at all... would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My friend goes here a lot, she took me for margaritas and calamari the other night. All were great, and it was speedy. The calamari actually came out before our drinks even came out and it was really fresh and good. The dip they give for it had a touch of spice that I liked. The margaritas come in the classic fish bowl style glasses. I got the basil lime one. We were just there for a drink and a snack but I want to go back and get tacos.  It's two floors, and both have a patio. We sat at the bottom patio and I was really into there being fans in each corner that create a nice breeze on a hot night. The atmosphere was really really really nice, unpretentious, I like that it's just an authentic Mexican restaurant, it's refreshing in Toronto since most of the taco places are trendy hipster places geared towards foodie culture. This place is better. And the service was really welcoming and fast."}
{"text":"The food is expensive and of poor quality. Would not recommend this place at all.   I came here with a couple of friends last night for food and drinks. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and a chips and guac for the table and I personally had the la ticas (chicken quesadillas).   Queue rolling list of negatives:  The chips were stale and after the top layer EVERYTHING was crumbs.  The salsa was watery and tasted like canned pasta sauce.  The sangria was super watered down AND half of it was ice. Also, the fruits had clearly been placed into the pitcher just before it arrived on our table.  The quesadillas had no discernable flavor aside from the cheese.   The service was good, but overall a huge no no. There are too many good Mexican places in Toronto to even consider this place an option."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim with some friends without checking the reviews first, which is never a good idea. I ordered the fish tacos and they were pretty bad, so I filled up on nachos and guacamole instead. I also found the outdoor patio to be really crowded."}
{"text":"I wandered in here with a boisterous group of friends and we were all very happy with our meals.  Guacamoles of regular and mango variety were also good, although it's true that the house-made chips were a little stale--but maybe I am just used to the chemically coaxed crispness of Tostitos.  We shared a seafood ceviche, which had a lime-infused freshness.  Taco salad = delicious.  The lettuce was warm from the sauteed onions, chicken, goat cheese, and rice and beans underneath.  The crisp shell, the guilty pleasure behind taco salads everywhere, was great.    It's true that it isn't outstandingly cheap, but I wonder if perhaps we're so used to underpriced Mexican, because it wasn't as though I was paying more for my meal than I would have at any of Margarita's competitors on Baldwin.  As to reviews complaining about the portion sizes, we were a large group and had no qualms about the amount of food we received.   The patio and traditional decor are great; I also give props for the Frida Kahlo wallpaper in the bathrooms upstairs.  The service was good; I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"mediocre food, slow service, pricey. great patio for a summer afternoon though."}
{"text":"Last night I went (again) to Margarita's.  I keep returning here, as it is a cozy little, warm hole in the wall, with huge (and yummy!) margarita's and guac that will knock your socks off.  I always get the same thing here, the chicken fajita's and nachos w/ guac; they aren't culinary masterpieces, but they are good.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The prices are cheap and the service is nice... but don't walk in here expecting Chef Extroadinaire to whip you up a jaw-dropping, mouth watering art piece... won't happen.  It is good. Fair. And a easy night out.. sorta place.  There is the odd time you walk in there and it smells a bit like toilet water.. just sayin'.  Also, I don't know why they never seat the upstairs?? Anyone? Is that where they hide the secret stashes of high quality sangria?  Oh ya... don't opt for sangria... I can probably make it better in my parents back yard."}
{"text":"After the Italian Fest on Bloor st., I headed to Margarita's for my first-ever margarita there.  Happy day: I was told that they could make any of the 3 margaritas... as virgins.  I ordered the lime margarita, arguably their most popular flavour (they also have strawberry and mango). It was great!  But was gone too soon.  At only $3.95 (again, no alcohol in this one), next time I go, I'll be trying the other flavours.  The weather was warm and sunny, the icy marg hit the spot.  Now, if they used fresh limes, I would have REALLY been impressed.  I was there just for a snack, and ordered the nachos. Good, they weren't mile high, but it was just enough to share between two friends who felt peckish but not hungry enough for a meal.   (To date, my fave place to get Nachos is likely Don Cherry's in Nepean, ON; they make 'em like nobody does).  SERVICE: was great!!  from both the server and the busboy/bartender. Sincerely friendly, and the food didn't take too long to arrive.  AMBIANCE: casual, cozy, and very colourful and energetic.  :) It's the kind of place that draws ppl on a reg. basis.  I'd be surprised to read about someone going in and finding that the place was rather empty."}
{"text":"Listen up Mister, and you too, Sister! I see most people aren't a fan of this place, and I get it. It's kind of like that fancy place you went in university, that now you see as kind of grimy. But! The food is decent, and definitely cheaper than those hipster tacos Toronto's sucking back, and the margs are hayuuuuge.  I sat on one of their adorably mismatched patios and had the cheese and pork quesadillas, it was red stewed deliciousness next to a simple salad. Was it the crazy best most authentic Mexican I've had in Toronto? No... Will I be back for a fun time with decent food? Yes."}
{"text":"I used to go here once in a while when I lived nearby.  I hadn't been in years but went again tonight.  The owner(?) recognized my buddy who hadn't gone in over 2 years and even remembered what he used to order.  I myself thought the food was fantastic and the group at my table also very much enjoyed their meals."}
