{"text":"I'm giving this far to many stars simply because i like going here. It started out as a five star pub but now has one down hill quite a bit. The food is great when they have any and there is sometimes a selection of beer. You would have to take your chances on them having anything in stock. 

On the other hand, the people that work there are incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is that of a local pub. it is a good place to call your \"local\" and i hope it improves soon."}
{"text":"this place closed down wonder why, shitty food, shitty service never really considered it's location in business..could be a great spot for a pub and good homemade pubgrub. Location is  for lease, hope some unique person takes up the adventure!!!  we need it desperately in the east end!!!!"}

Just got back from lunch at Seanachai and it was a little better than I expected. The menu is essentially standard pub fare with a few, interesting twists thrown in: curried cheese fries (killer) and an assortment of twice baked potatoes - the breakfast spud, for example: twice baked potato with diced sausage, sliced bacon and topped
with a fried egg. Yum.

The taps are decent ranging from Welly dark, through Harp, Guinness, and some of the lesser domestics.

They focus on live music including all 4-10 every Sunday and are hosting a summer St Pattys this Sat (June 26th)."}
