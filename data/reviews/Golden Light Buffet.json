{"text":". I have been here a few times for lunch on Tuesdays and Fridays where you can get 2 for 1 as long as each person gets a beverage which is outside of the buffet price. Good selection of different dishes featuring stir frys, noodles, assortment of grilled items grilled foods, sushi, (no sashimi), a few soups, salad bar and decent dessert table. Good value, and not super heavy with the salt and msg. Nice decor inside. If you are going on Tuesday or Friday when they have their special, you should go there by noon to see the maximum of offerings - they may stop serving some of the dishes if they are busy and run out."}
{"text":"If there was negative system. I would rate it negative. I feel the food was all cooked yesterday. I tried every dish and finished none of them. Literally none of the food was even hot. $27.99 for a meal and it doesn't even include any pop. So by far the water was the best part of my $28 meal"}
{"text":"Every dishes are standard, it's a quiet place. I came on Sunday night, the servers are courtesy, they came time to time to your table and asked if we needed anything else? Very pleasant atmosphere. Small size of foods, but a lot of choices. I have a good impression that foods were not left/waste or over cooked in the counter.  Food quality: standard Food quantity: above standard Atmosphere: comfortable  Service: very good Tips: 10% is average for me in all restaurants, if you feel that is not enough you can pay extra. Because the owner/manager has his own accounting book to calculate their profit, tips is only extra profit. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came for dinner during the holiday season and it was a full house. The dishes were always kept full and generally the service was good. The food is a mix of \"totally worth it\" and \"meh, don't fill up on that\", which is standard buffet style. The good: fresh oysters (2 at a time, but you can line up for more), peking duck (both duck and wrappers were available all evening, with rarely any wait time), half a lobster (you need to get a ticket so the limit is one serving per person), sashimi (there's also sushi, but the sashimi is better).   All the stations put out a relatively small portion of food at a time, but they are refilled frequently. I think this is great for reducing food waste and keeping our gluttonous selves in check (sometimes my eyes really are bigger tham my stomach).   Desserts are pretty unimpressive. The cakes are what you would expect from a Chinese buffet: dissapointing. The nanaimo bar will give you a sugar high that you will not recover from until morning. The waffle bowls and icecream are fun, but don't actually taste very good (in my opinion). Strangely, the one dessert I went back for three time (yeah, 3), was a mysterious item only labeled as \"sugar free\". It was sugar free coconut jello. I felt 7 years old again, eating jello at buffet dessert. And I enjoyed it. Still, can't give more than 3 stars for jello."}
{"text":"Saw an advertisement on the Newspaper and decided to go give it a try on a Tuesday evening with 3 family members. There weren't a lot of customers, only a small section of the restaurant was opened... we sat down and the waitress asked us what type of tea we wanted, and we asked for Oolong tea, which ended up to be one tea bag that was used for the entire evening.   Anyways, so we walked around the food bar and realized there was just not much to eat... cold bar wasn't fresh, hot food was mainly vegetables that never got refills, there weren't any dim sum, barbecue pork, duck, or anything like that.   Price was $23.99 per person plus we got charged $7.80 for that tea bag. Definitly not heading back to this place...!"}
{"text":"Will probably be reporting this restaurant. We came as a group for Chinese New Year, and at current count, at least ten of us have come down with varying combinations of fever, aches, chills, vomiting, and diarrhea.   The food was mediocre at best. Many dishes were unbearably oily. I avoided the shellfish and oysters, and I'm glad I did. Others were not so lucky.   Nothing says Kung hei fat choy like anal incontinence and projectile vomit."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday lunch.  I found it expensive - $17.99 especially for the food quality.  The food was lacking seasoning.  The pork served tasted off - like it was going bad. Lacking beef dishes - only had a roast beef.   Dessert:  There was a lot of variety, however what I had was just OK.  The fruits were plentiful and good.    Service:  Just OK.    I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Buffet prices around the GTA are typically around the $30 mark nowadays. For this price and at this place I thought the food was worth it. There's not an expansive variety of foods but the dishes I tried were all very delicious. They had a lot of unique traditional Chinese soups to choose from. Their sushi section actually had rolls that don't fall apart when you dip it in soy sauce. They also have crab legs, lobster, and raw oysters. I didn't try their pastries and cakes but I did try their ice cream and fruits. Can't go wrong with ice cream... their fruits section was more than the average buffet (yes they even had papaya and kiwis!) The only thing I think they could add to would be the selection of sashimi - there was only salmon. All in all I had a wonderful experience dining here. Would likely come back again for a birthday or celebration of some sort."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for Chinese New Year celebration. We were a group of 28 people.   In short, I would probably not come here if it weren't for a family celebration.   Short points:  Ambience was OK, be location itself is kind of random and in the middle of nowhere.  It was great to see the accessibility options available. The bathrooms were also very nice and sort of didn't match the outside decor.  The food was OK, they had fresh shucked oysters and lobster tails, both of which were mediocre. They had a good variety of food. Some things that you wouldn't normally get at a Mandarin were: Peking duck, taro pudding, sweet tofu pudding, and fresh oysters. Albeit these items were available, the quality of them was definitely lacking. The food was also not hot enough, the serving platters at the buffet were more for looks than practicality.  In addition, our tea pot and teacups had a soapy taste to it, so we opted for regular cold water.  The service was OK. Because we were a large group we got some special items served to us separately. Which was nice, so instead of having to wait for the lobster tail and free run chicken we were served those items at our table.   There was also some slowness in refilling the water. And the hot towels at the end were not given in a timely manner.  In sum, I would not go here again and would definitely waste my AYCE calories elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice place for family dinning! Worth!  they have snow crab, lobster & oyster! Foods are fresh."}
{"text":"About 35$ a person tax and tip in on weekends, selection of food was bad, but the all u can eat cold crab, hot crab, cold shrimp, oyster, and a lobster dish was good, sashimi was only two kinds, white tuna, and salmon, and the sashimi was not cut professionally, I have seen metro stores with better cut fish :| over all the place looks amazing, nice decor, clean washrooms, tons of fruits and other stuff, but at the end of the day it is a Chinese Ayce and not the Japanese style I like. Room for improvement here"}
{"text":"This place is a \"meh\" on the buffet scale. Let me preface that I really do not expect much from most buffet places. Food just needs to be kept hot and our plates need to be taken away in a timely fashion. I came here for Chinese New Year Dinner and it was really busy. Our server Jason was very attentive to our table of 28 people and was quick and efficient with collecting our plates and giving us our drinks.  However when it comes to the food at this place they really need to invest in some heat lamps or heating trays or something that keeps the food hot. Most of the food is served on a regular looking dinner plate and I guess the expectation is that people take all the items quickly. Most of my food was cold unless you stalk the staff and wait until they put in a fresh batch. They have everything from Lobster, Chicken Balls, Salmon, Veggies, General Tao Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork, Peking Duck, Deep fried fish, Pizza, Salmon Sashimi, Oysters (not really good), Ice Cream, Crab Legs, and a bunch of other items that all really have no taste to them.  It is $26.99 for dinner on holidays and weekends and a little cheaper during the week. I do not think I would come back here and would choose Mandarin over this place anyday."}
{"text":"For a buffet, I think this place offers decent food. In some ways it exceeded my expectations and in others I was disappointed. But overall I am satisfied enough that I would seriously consider returning. They have a buy 1 get 1 free deal on Tuesday. I'd return for this.   $22 for one person makes it about the price of AYCE sushi. Although it has a sushi section, it's not very extensive. It's mostly rolls plus squid sushi, shrimp sushi, and salmon. I'm happy with the rolls. The rice to stuff ratio is excellent for a buffet. Though I didn't like the rice they used.  The food selection is mostly \"Chinese\" with a decent selection of \"other stuff\". I'll highlight some items that are worth mentioning. -Chinese style lobster, though the good pieces go pretty quickly and the tray is usually left with just legs. -Lobster roll (sushi). Didn't taste that special, but hey, it's lobster! -Roast beef was really tender and flavorful -Salmon Sashimi -Ribs, garlic and BBQ flavors -Steamed turbot fish -Grilled squid  Some items were less than good but still edible. The wings were so tiny I almost thought they weren't wings. The tempura were not fresh and it's obvious they've been out for a while. Sweet & sour chicken, lemon chicken, and general tao chicken were not that good. I tried almost everything else and if I didn't mention them, then they were just \"ok\".  At this price range, it's a decent choice for a buffet. I think part of the problem is that people need to set their expectations straight. I think for $22 you are getting decent food."}
{"text":"I knew after reading the reviews on this buffet restaurant that it would be a mediocre dining experience and for sure it was! Came here for Chinese New Year dinner with a group of 28 guests. We had our own section of the restaurant which was nice and comfortable. The service was pretty decent as they cleaned up our plates and filled up our tea/water quickly.  Aside from the service, the quality of the food was disappointing, almost every dish lacked in flavour. There was also a limited variety of food items as there were mostly veggie dishes in comparison to meat dishes. I also didn't like how the buffet area was so small, it was super crowded and it felt like fighting through traffic just to get your food. Lastly, I found that most of the dishes were cold to warm since they didnt really have heat lamps to keep the food fresh. The sweet and sour pork in particular tasted spoiled!   I know you can't expect much from a buffet restaurant but if you're seriously looking for quality tasting food, you're better off paying a few dollars more and go to Dragon Legend or Mandarin."}
{"text":"Update:   We keep coming back to this place coz it's my dad's favour place apparently.  Today I found there were quite a bit of improvement. The food were kept much warmer and the servers today were very attentive. They anticipated our needs and brought us extra napkins and volunteered to take photos for our groups. Today they also gave us warm towels and fortune cookies after we were done.   Tip: seniors gets discount  Also, if it's your birthday and you come with at least 3 adults you eat for free. This was a very nice surprise when our bill came."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on Canada Day and as another Yelper has mentioned, there have been numerous Chinese buffets that have opened at this location, probably at least 4-5 in the past decade. So I was really curious to see if Golden Light Buffet would be any different.  The price was $28.99 for adults (Friday, Saturday and Holidays) and it was suppose to include crab legs and lobster but for some reason crab legs and lobster were not available for that particular day, so they had a buy one get one free promotion instead.  The decor is quite nice and modern and the service is reasonable but if your planning to charge $28.99 the food should be on par with Mandarin or Dragon Pearl Buffet since you are at the same price point. The food selection is decent but the quality even by Chinese buffet standards is really not good, I can't recall one dish that was really good but there were quite a few that were pretty bad, one dish in particular was the honey garlic ribs that had so much garlic and the meat tasted like it had freezer burn. If your planning to go to a buffet, I recommend going to Dragon Pearl Buffet and paying the extra $1 per person."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Mother's Day. The food on the buffet was not very fresh.  Seems like they just add food on top of food and you will have a few fresh veggies then mushy old ones on the bottom.  The service was not so great either having to call over a waiter anytime we needed something as none came to check in us.    Overall the experience was mediocre at best.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a sunday after the thanksgiving weekend.  Living in mississauga, the only reason we made this trek out here was because we had a wagjag deal which was soon expiring.  To my suprise, the restaurant had taken over the previous buffet which our family had gone to frequently in my younger years.  They had a great selection of food, even serving peking duck! My expectations had heightened after remembering such fond memories.  However when I got there, said expectations were shot down.  I was not very impressed by the selection of food they had... rather, I may have been, had there been any in stock.   Nearly every time I went for food, the best of the items were empty (tempura shrimp, chicken wings).  Around my third plate in, I was able to finally snatch some, and they were of average quality.  The food I did get to try was quite good however.  Their grilled food is nice, sushi was slightly above average, but their maki was terrible.  Their version of spicy salmon roll used what I know to be the spicy seasoning they give you at ramen shops(?) and did not sit well with me at all.  Dessert was average, but they had a waffle maker + waffle bowl station for ice cream so that is a plus.  At the end I was rather dissappointed with my overall visit; yes the decor was nice, but we can't eat that."}
{"text":"For recent months, I noticed major renovations was happening at this place as I drove past here.  Most of you probably know that there had been many other Buffet Restaurants started up at this specific location.  Oriental Feast was the one I remember that lasted the longest.  Don't know why many others closed, some mentioned it's cursed...  others saids the Feng Sui is bad.  Months after the renovation was done I decided to dropped by here for lunch during the Civic Holiday Weekend.  As I entered the doors and walked up the flight of stairs to this restaurant, definitely Feng Sui won't be the problem if this restaurant does bad.  There has been a tremendous make over.  Very chic and modern design with chandeliers hanging above head.  It almost has the \"Romantic Feel\" dark yet well lit enough.  Especially for a new place like this, it wasn't as busy so I didn't need to yell across the table to ask my wife to pass the salt.  Comparing with Mandarin, Imperial Buffet and Dragon Pearl, I would say that the selection is very limited.  It obviously won't stacked up to over 200 items as most of the buffet restaurant boast.  However limiting selections shouldn't be their weakness, in fact it could also be refreshing concept as long as the food is served fresh and good with consistency.  How often, I would walk into a buffet and I see the usual slices of pizzas, fries, sweet and sour chicken balls, corns and saute mushrooms and other dishes tasted either cooked from frozen, reheated from night before, or worst left out barely touch for hours while it gets dried by the heating lamps.  I also notice what they put out to the buffet is smaller portions, but with the number of people showing up for lunch and on top it's a good way control food wasted and freshness.    Sure there's no Alaskin Crab Legs to pick at with my Chopsticks, or Lobsters which I needed to trade a ticket for.  But I'm sure the non- stingy sashimi they have and Made to Order Tempura (Fresh and Crispy) more than made up for it.  Other items it had that day was Roast Beef was amazing.  The Char Siu Ribs was a little on the sweet side.  Cocktail Shrimp was normal large size and fresh.  And yes I'm an Ice Cream Fanatic!  So I thought it was awesome that somebody for once made waffle cones or waffle bowls at the dessert station from scratch which then you can cross over to the fridge scoop yourself.  And the fruits were great too.  One couple who sat next to us kept on complimenting how huge and sweet the cherries and grapes were.  The only time I saw the size of those grapes was in Costco and probably the buffet got it from the same supplier.  Service wise, the waiter was really tentative.  Consistently checking in with us every 10 mins to see how things are.  Refilled our teapot during the course of the meal like 4 times and always made sure we didn't run out of napkins.  My Cons are that the Hot and Sour Soup was a little watery and little taste, for some reason the ice cream station is not together with the dessert station where they make the waffle cones (weird layout) and the pot of tea kinda lack quality and taste.  Overall my experience have been satisfactory.  I will come again and why not, it's close to where I live and work."}
{"text":"Pretty good place considering all the other Chinese buffet joints found everywhere in the North Scarborough/North York.  Some things are great and some are just okay..  I highly recommend the Steamed Turbot, Beijing Lettuce wraps, yam pancakes, ginger chicken soup, and dessert bar. They carry all sorts of mousse cakes on the side and make waffle cones in house. The veggies were fresh which is also in part to the fact that they only cook in small batches++. No added MSG which is a big factor for a buffet.  Unlike at Dragon Pearl where the sauce could be seen drying, there was none of that here.  The okay.. I wish they wouldn't serve the grilled salmon as its probably just leftover from the sushi bar and it's just the belly area..   Went on their Tuesday BOGO promotion so it was a pretty busy evening. Really nice and clean interior. No complaints about the service as it was excellent.  My 4 star rating is factored on the food coupled with the superb service.  Not the best, and not the worst."}
{"text":"Actually a 3.5  I frequently come here on Tuesday as part of their buy one get one free with the purchase of a drink. Although the prices have gone up a couple of dollars over the last year or two, it's still worth it. I've also came here on a Friday night in the past and they used to have have a lobster (no limit) but not sure if that changed.   I find that there's a lot more veggies compared to other buffets, so if you're a meat lover, this might not be the best place.   PROS:  -Soup is gooooood..especially the herbal ones/chicken gingseng  -Cake is refrigerated and server will help you slice the cake to serve  -Waffle cone is available if requested. Freshly made! Other times they'll have it ready for you -Some ice cream flavours are different from other restaurants (eg. Coconut, orange-chocolate)  -Occasionally they change up the food or try to create new food -Lots of fruits available and different from other buffets (eg. Kiwi, papaya, raspberry, strawberry, pineapple, watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe  -SOMETIMES crab legs were available on Tuesday but it wasn't that good.   CONS:  -Some dishes need to come out quicker as they run out the moment they hit the counter (fish fish, not sure of the exact name) -Love the steak cube with zucchini, however at times they would put some other meat instead of steak..cheap out on their ingredient  -I believe some dessert is store bought 'cause I've seen them take them out of boxes -No sashimi available for dinner (perhaps it's because there's a promo on Tuesday, but it'd be nice to have some sashimi even if it's limited quantity  Service is excellent. Servers are attentive to our needs and clean up our tables efficiently except the occasional times when the restaurant was busy. The manager himself would also walk around and clear the tables, however it is sometimes annoying when he stands there and observes the customers eating.  Overall there is less selection of food but for the price, I'm definitely coming back and I do enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give two stars but that wouldn't be fair to the two star restaurants out there.   First off, sketchy parking. Really really sketchy parking unless you are lucky enough to get one of their parking spots outside.   When we come in, they are half empty, yet refused to let or group sit together. A couple was already seated, but they had not even started eating yet. Okay so we ate separately.   Food. Where to start? Of the rows of food laid out, 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 was filled. Can't rate a place on food if they don't have any. There were more empty trays than there were ones that had food. And this wasn't just a periodic thing. Throughout the entire dinner (1.5 hours) they were not refilling their stations fast enough or they would just tell us they ran out. Keep in mind, we ate at 7pm. Aka, dinner time, honey!    Food was either bland or really salty or fried to death. There's very few things that tasted okay, but nothing that we thought were good.  On the bright side, fruits were good. I sliced some strawberries up and put them over some ice cream and fresh waffles. Squeeze some chocolate sauce on top, and I've just made something out of nothing. :) basically, the food that didn't get cooked by them was great.  I think my one star is really because I made an awesome waffle.... And it was good. Really really good.  Decor is fine. Clean. Good space. I like the color choices. Uniforms were clean looking and it's easy to tell who is a staff and who isn't.   Trying not to be too hard. The staff are pretty nice. But as a buffet restaurant called GOLDEN light buffet, it finishes at a last place bronze for me. I don't recommend this place and I surely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The worst buffet ever. DO NOT GO. went for lunch and 50% of their food trays were empty. When i asked where the food was i was rudely told 5 mins every 5 mins. There was solid 15mins with no food available."}
{"text":"I came back here to try it again after eating a few times here last year with Wagjag vouchers.  Golden Light Buffet replaces other buffet names that have changed a few times over the years.  The longest standing one was Oriental Feast and I remember how much I loved going there as a kid.  It's now 2015 and they have completely renovated the place.  Looks very modern and beautiful inside, and much different than what it used to be.  The first thing I notice was the parking lot is more busy.  I think the cars must belong to either the skating rink or something else in the building, because there weren't too many patrons in the restaurant when I arrived early.  I could hardly find a parking spot today and was considering leaving.  The quality of food and selection is pretty good here.  Most of the patrons I see are older HK people, especially during lunch.  So you know it is authentic Chinese.    The items were the same as the last time I was here last year, except I noticed they added something new : Beijing lettuce wrap.  Unfortunately the lettuce smelled funny so I ended up throwing it out.  The contents though were yummy (diced meat, veggies).  Still it's nice to see here at a buffet though since it's usually found at upscale Chinese restaurants.  I also noticed the Singapore Rice Noodle this time isn't as good as it was very bland.  And last time the saury fish, soup, sushi wasn't done too well.   Overall we enjoyed Golden Light Buffet which is very convenient close to work for many people.  Love the clean washrooms and lovely decor.  Will come back next time I'm in the area (and assuming I can find parking).   Pricing for adults :  Lunch buffet  Mon-Fri     $14.99 Sat, Sun, Holiday   $17.99  Dinner buffet  Mon-Thur     $21.99 Fri, Sat, Sun, Holiday     $27.99"}
{"text":"The ambience was quite modern and the service was very friendly. For the food, there wasn't much of a variety compared to other buffets. The stir fried dishes weren't as tasteless everything else. But, not warm at all. The BBQ meats were also nearly cold when I got them. As for the grilled salmon, it way over cooked, dry and tasteless. I also tried the sushi and I was a little underwhelmed with the options. The ratio between the filling and rice was about 3 to 7. I guess the unlimited salmon sashimi kind of made up for it, but that was the only option they had for sashimi. Next, each person was given a lobster tail which got me quite excited as I was hopeful it would cheer up my experience. Unfortunately, it was extremely chewy! Not the fresh chewy taste, but the overlooked rubbery kind! After that, I moved onto the desserts, not much of a large selection. The tiramisu actually had some taste to it, but you have to order it through the dessert counter and they're very stingy with the servings. Also, the cheesecake, wasn't exactly dry, it was dehydrated! Overall, I won't be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasted great.  In my opinion worth the extra money over places like The Mandarin.  Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"My daughter had 100 days celebration party in their vip room .  they have many variety foods ,good and fresh .stuff are all very friendly. overall i am satisfied with  their service.  Only one suggestion to the manager  ,put more  waiter or waitress in the vip room to serve ppl better. Honestly,one waiter to serve 10 tables.that is not enough at all"}
{"text":"As other Yelpers have mentioned, the best deal for this place is on Tuesday nights where it's BOGO with the purchase of a drink. I don't think there's a ton of other Chinese buffets left in the Toronto area with the exception of Mandarin which is completely overpriced in my opinion. The restaurant doesn't look like it's been renovated since the 90s but aside from the outdated decor, the restaurant, buffet area and washrooms were clean which is what really matters. You don't expect much service at a buffet but my waiter was great.  I was pretty impressed with the food. This buffet doesn't feature the large hotel pans of food. Instead the trays are large plates which is reminiscent of what you'd see at a more upscale buffet honestly. The smaller \"tray\" size was a lot better because they were making and refilling plates as they were emptied, rather than keeping old food warm under heat lamps. We were eating towards the end of the dinner service (we left at about 9:30pm) and I was surprised the were still bringing out new food. Some of the more impressive hot food dishes included sauteed king oyster mushrooms and salmon rice. They have a few different stations including a sushi bar, grill, and dessert bar plus ice cream area. The sushi bar had real fish offerings (very unlike other buffets that only stick to vegetable or cooked rolls) and sashimi! The fish I had was cold and tasted fresh. The grill area had roast beef, whole grilled fish and accompanying sides like corn and mashed potatoes to name a few items. The dessert bar had whole cakes on display and fresh waffle cones being prepared for ice cream. One thing that I really enjoyed was the chicken ginseng soup. Not really what you go for at a buffet but was kind of nice to clear my palette after throwing everything and the kitchen sink into my stomach."}
{"text":"Stuffed! Decor is nice, service is mediocre.   Food is above average. Enjoyed the sashimi.   Happy Chinese New Year!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for birthday dinner and parking was horrible. We had to park in some sketchy parking garage, also the entrance was very weird, odd looking. As soon as we walked in, we were welcomed by a lady who directed us a table. We did not have a server and no one would bring us water when we got there. We literally had to wave someone down to get us some damn water.   As for the food, it was meh. They gave us coupons for lobster and that depended on the amount of people that were seated. The sushi was HORRIBLE, inedible and their deserts are DRY.  My mom's friend recommended this place and they said it was good- it is not.  WOULD NOT COME BACK."}
{"text":"Buffet was ok...  Price was cheap.. Nice selection of food and desserts. The service was good."}
{"text":"This is oook!  AMBIENCE  It was a good size, lots of seating everywhere.  It was a little bit more modern looking than a typical Chinese buffet place.  FOOD  There were hits and misses.  More misses. Hits - fresh oysters, tofu pudding, salmon sashimi only, roast beef and some of the Peking duck and snow crab legs.  Misses - sushi was oversized more rice than meat, salmon sashimi was not replenished very slowly, lobster tail not very tasty, veggies was oily, the shell for the Peking duck was very doughy.  Overall, it was oook.  SERVICE It was good, slow at times as we were a group of 20+ and we had one server.  But they bring our own supply of the chicken and lobster tail.  I might go again, maybe not."}
{"text":"This is a new buffet that has taken over what use to be a buffet.  the location is now infamous for buffets coming and going for almost 20 years.  So i am not sure why they would want to open it here as it seems cursed..  anyways.. decoration is nice in the place.. food comes out in very small portions so that you dont have to worry about freshness... they also have a tempura station where a guy will freshly fry tempura for you on demand.  this is a timely process and you will have to wait maybe 3-5 minutes ...  the sushi station is small but they do serve huge pieces of salmon sashimi and they are not stinge at all..  no limits.   and they have seared tuna sashami which was a very nice touch.   overall compared to other buffets its quite average..   hot food selection is so so and limited.. not the hugest selection of food but the fruits were very fresh and well laid out.  The best time to go to a buffet is when its first opened and quality is still good..   One thing that i did not like what the fact they asked when we sat down wheter we wanted to drink something.. water? tea? pop?  we opted for asian tea.. so 1 pot of tea and 4 cups... turned out that was $11.70 .... disgusting.  thats all.."}
{"text":"Would love to rate this restaurant but I couldn't get in. They are not wheelchair accessible except for the ramp and powered door. I called ahead and was told that they were accessible. The staff actually asked if I could get out of my wheelchair and climb the stairs to the buffet."}
{"text":"First time here. Great selection. Way better than the other buffet places. Food taste Great!  You get lobster and crab legs. Price is creeper than Mandarin and better selection."}
