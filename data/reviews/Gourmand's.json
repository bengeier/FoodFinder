{"text":"I always hear coworkers raving about this place, so I decided to stop in for lunch today. First impressions upon walking in were that it was a little small, clean and very busy. They have a huge selection of sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery to choose from. Everything is fresh.  While placing my order, I was warned that it would be a 20 minute wait for sandwiches. That was fine with me. I went ahead and ordered a Ruben, along with a side of beer battered onion rings. While waiting I noticed that they also sell beer, wine and cigars. It took almost exactly 20 minutes before my name was called, I grabbed my food and took it back to work.   The onion rings were awesome. You could tell that they use fresh onions, batter and clean oil to fry them. First thing I thought when I took the Ruben out of the bag was wow, this thing is HUGE!\". They definitely do not skimp on meats and other ingredients. I ended up giving half of the sandwich away. I knew that if I tried to eat the other half I would be in a food coma for the rest of the day.  Needless to say this may become a regular spot. The food is awesome."}
{"text":"Simple awesome sandwiches. A wide variety of sandwiches. Priced fair and good a size."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and head over to Gourmand's! 4 of us went for lunch today and each enjoyed their sandwich tremendously - Cajun redfish, Tuna steak, Pisano (sp?) and beef something or other. In addition to the delicious food, the people are friendly and they have an interesting assortment of drinks, cigars, coffee, beer, wine. Will be back."}
{"text":"This was a great place for lunch. My boss and I split a fajita wrap and pulled pork. The wrap was tasty and grilled to perfection. The pork was decent, a nice taste. The sauces were fantastic! BBQ and whatever they give for the amazing potatoe chippers. Four stars and will definitely be back, I recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good lunch or early dinner!"}
{"text":"Gets very busy at lunch and dining in can get cramped with groups of more than 2.  But hands down some of the best sandwiches around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for breakfast. The food is to die for! I would've posted a picture but it was devoured in minutes. This deli is such a hidden gem. I came in feeling under the weather and the owner gave me a cup of tea on the house. They have something here for everyone. Can't wait to stop in again. They should definitely put a location in Treemont."}
{"text":"The first time I visited was a few years ago and the coffee was amazing then. I just visited again the other day and my wife and I both agreed the coffee is still amazing. I am not sure what they do to make it that way but I hope they never change. Good food, amazing coffee and wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Gourmand's Deli today. It's a little hole in the wall on the outskirts of an industrial park, but they make a wicked sandwich. I got the chance to try the Cajun Chicken and \"The Mad Cow\" sandwiches, both of which were excellent.  The zucchini fries were really good too, but don't order them if you are looking for the healthy option. They are battered and fried and served with a ranch-type dipping sauce, but they were very tasty. One order is big enough for 2-3 people.  The one bad thing I had was the coleslaw, which seemed like kind of an afterthought. It was too lightly dressed and lacked any flavor. That said, I would have no hesitation going back there. I simply would not get coleslaw."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I have yet to find a sandwich I don't like, and they have a huge selection. The pulled pork is my favorite. I make a point to eat here whenever I am in the area for lunch.  The lunch crowd can be heavy, so I suggest getting there by 11:30. Otherwise you could be in for a 20-30 min wait for your sandwich. But the wait is well worth it. You could also order ahead for carryout to avoid the wait.   Also, they are good recyclers."}
{"text":"If you are in the area, don't waste time with the chains on Rockside Rd.  Support the local people's business and besides this place is great.  A little cramped and sometimes there is a decent wait to get your sandwich (read call ahead if you don't get there before 11:30 or after 1).  The ingredients just seem better here.  The bread is always just right and dependent on what you order.  My favorite is the Po' Boy but the Buffalo Chicken and Italian are great as well.   They sell Rising Star coffee as well as beer, wine, and cigars.  Lots of deli style bottled drinks as well (no Coke or Pepsi products)"}
{"text":"Who wouldn't love this place and it's larger-than-life owners? This is one of those Delis where everybody knows your name. Well, everybody who matters - that is, those folks serving food.  The menu is extensive - with chalk boards filled with the Deli's gourmet sandwich offering on every available surface. As well as the sandwiches, you can buy the regular supply of chips, drinks, coffee, and some less common items such as beer, wine, and cigars.  The vegetarian offerings are not too shabby either, with a good selection of salads and meat-free sandwiches.  The Blue Shroom is one of the best sandwiches I've had, and I'm a dedicated meat-eater.  Serving sizes are good, and the prices are about what you'd expect. If you're in the area and looking for lunch, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"A favorite place of mine for lunch in Cleveland.  I feel very lucky that it is so close to my company's Cleveland location--I rely on it for catered business lunches, a quick bite to eat, and a place to jog to at lunch for a smoothie or tart cherry shot (the cherry shot and wheat grass shots, by the way, are excellent and make you feel super healthy!).    I like that this place is local and doesn't feel corporate and soulless like other fast casual lunch places that are just chains.  They also are very knowledgeable about what they are serving and happy to answer any questions I have.    It is advised that you call ahead during the busy lunch hour and then pick up your sandwich ready to go once you get there."}
{"text":"I stopped in after reading the reviews on yelp. The staff was warm and outgoing,my sandwich, the Paisano was delicious,and they have real ginger beer in the soda fountain. Next time I'm in the valley I will stop in again."}
{"text":"I really love this place! They have a huge selection of fantastic sandwiches, as well as yummy drinks, chips, and cookies. They also sell beer and wine, and cigars. I wish I was in the area more often so I could stop by. The owner and employees are also very nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches!! They use great cheeses that really bring out the flavor.  The vegetarian Gourmand was my favorite of the three our group tried out.  They were all excellent- the pulled pork has a great sauce and we had a chicken that was topped with a mild coleslaw that gave the sandwich a fresh from the garden feeling.  The staff was very nice even though they were very busy.  There might be a 10 minute wait if they are busy."}
{"text":"Very nice selection on their menu, and they are superfriendly here.  Prices reflect the quality that is on the menu, it's definatly not subway in prices, not it is their quality- everything is better.  The zucchini fries are delicious, and I don't even like zucchini (until now).  I've only had a couple sandwiches and sampled my friends, and all have been great.  Love the toppings they jazz it up with, they have a Thai that has peanut butter, turkey with chutney, and sweet onion relish on some.  Their hours aren't great, they close at 3 weekdays, and aren't open weekends, but if you get your but in for lunch, you won't regret it.  They have a great selection of beer, desserts, and even cigars, not to mention a plethora of tea and coffee.  If their prices were a little lower it would be a five star place for sure, but even given the high quality, they seem a little higher than they need to on everything, especially for the location."}
{"text":"I kind of feel like knocking myself in the side of the head for not knowing about Gourmand's Deli earlier. Seriously, why did it take 3 years of living in Cleveland for me to find out about this place? I've passed by countless times and never knew how great it is.  Part deli, part coffeehouse, part seller-of-cool-imported-beer, part hangout, Gourmand's is the type of place I would have loved to have hung out in the early/late mornings as a childless, jobless individual. You know \"that\" coffee shop, diner, etc. that just makes you just want to drink coffee and nibble on a baked good for hours, lazily reading a book and soaking in the sheer delicacy of having nothing better to do? That's a missed opportunity on my part. When I first moved here, I had trouble finding a job and didn't have kids for over a year. I could have totally done this. Now, not so much. But that's why walking inside made me feel nostalgia for that specific type of opportunity.  Now, onto the food. I love having everything meticulously written out in color-coded chalk: red chalk for hot sandwiches, blue for cold. I had the Turkey BLT: a good staple. It was on foccacia and it was delicious. A little salty, but very good overall.  The staff was extremely friendly. You could tell they love what they do. It's like Luke's Diner from Gilmore Girls, only a little more perky and with less sarcasm. Or like Karen's Cafe from One Tree Hill, only with fewer tragedies.  I issued restraint and did not order a smoothie (which seems to be my job these days) or a muffin/cookie. Weird, right? But they looked great, specifically the White chocolate raspberry muffin or the chocolate caramel cookie.  The sandwiches are fairly large, but don't feel like a pig if you finish it all in one sitting. 'Cuz I did."}
{"text":"Such a great place! High quality food, cozy atmosphere, and such friendly people... I thoroughly enjoyed my turkey club and hope to make a repeat visit again soon!!"}
{"text":"Why the hell I have wasted time and money eating at chain sandwich joints on Rockside Rd is beyond me.  Thanks P.W. for writing a review that sent me straight here.  *Extensive* sandwich menu from turkey, chicken, pork, veggie, beef, salads, sides, wow.  A nice little wine shop, too!  Big chip selection (including my fave brands of Zapp's and Dirty chips).  Kudos to this independently run, family-owned business.  I got the turkey club on toasted ciabatta and it delivered.  They serve their sandos toasted so if you want it cold, speak up.  I wouldn't say the smoked turkey is high quality (I would guess Sara Lee) so a big bummer for that... next time I will opt for one of the house meats for a better quality play but I dig a small place like this and I will be back."}
{"text":"This place had everything I want when I think \"deli\"; good sandwiches, a great chip selection, and a great drink selection. I got the 'all Italian' sandwich and added giardina peppers, the bread was great. My friend got the 'chicago beef' that came with an au jus that I could have drank if he would let me. Reasonable prices and I found a great beer that I like on my way out, all I can say is that we went at noon and it probably took 20 minutes to get our food, but busy is a good thing."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Fantastic people. I plan to eat my way through this menu. I've eaten the Polish Steak, the Hawaiian 5 Oh, and the Bueno Puerco. Big lunch crowds; plan to wait a bit. Completely worth it, though!"}
{"text":"Absolute best service I've ever had, anywhere. I understand it's a sandwich shop and not a five star restaurant, but every single person I spoke with was nice, helpful and just wonderful. The staff went above and beyond and truly made me, as a first timer, feel like family. This spot is off the beaten path and doesn't look like much from the outside, but is a true gem of delicious food and Cleveland hospitality.  I tried their traditional veggie sandwich and added chicken, and it was amazing. I'm not even usually a sandwich person, but this was so worth it. I ordered the soup of the day, which tasted like something your grandma made and passed down for generations! I also ordered the zucchini fries which were just ok IMO and a smooth, full bodied coffee to go.    The menu is also very extensive so I'd recommend going back to try a few options. Loved, loved, loved this place  thank you yelp for directing me here!"}
{"text":"Selection of sandwiches is great makes it really hard to pick just one. I would pick a meat and just go from there or else it would take you 20 mins to make up your mind. Not a bad problem to have tho! Order the Cajun Chicken sandwich which lived up my expectations. Only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is I received uncooked potato chippers. (Which are fried potato chips with seasoning) Seasoning wasn't bad but a generous amount of the chips were soft and barely fried which ruin the potato chipper experience for myself. I would've taken them back but it wasn't until I left that I realized how undercooked they were. See picture below, went through to show undercook ones Cashier made a honest mistake and charged $114 for a $11.95 sandwich which was promptly fixed. First time experience  was \"so-so\" but the sandwich was worth going back for."}
{"text":"I heard about this place years ago and was told they had the best sandwiches. The other day I was stopped at a light and saw the name on a sign and had to go in. My first stop will not be my last. When I walked in and saw the place packed, I knew it had to be a great lunch spot. Best sandwich I have had in a long time. Amazing chicken, bread, condiments, virturally everything! The staff is friendly and who uses the honor system anymore? They do! You can grab any drink or chips you want before your order is up and then pay. What a great establishment!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I found it on Yelp and thought I'd try it out. I've now been back about 8 times since. Each time I try something new and bring someone new. Everything I've tried has been great and everyone I've brought loves it. The staff is very friendly and personable. If you're going once, I recommend the no phoney bologna. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Have gone twice and loved it each time. A huge variety of sandwiches with good portions. If you eat there, drinks and chips are done on the honor system as you pay at the counter afterwards. It can be very busy around lunchtime but it is worth it."}
{"text":"The Best Sandwich selection! The Tuna Panni Rocks, Yellowfin tuna steak grilled w/ seasonings served with carmelized onions, coleslaw, and pesto on a grilled panni sourdough bread. The vegetarian selection is one of the best in the city. A must for Clevelanders since we are deprived from great sandwich shops like in my home town of New Orleans."}
{"text":"My husband goes here all the time for lunch since he works nearby. I've been wanting to go for so long but it's not open for lunch on the weekends. Finally we got a big snow one day so I played hooky to come here. It is such a cute local place. I got the no phoney baloney which was very good. The hubs says the best sandwich he has had is the gourmand."}
{"text":"This place, simply put, makes the best sandwiches I've ever had the pleasure of consuming.  The menu is downright expansive, the prices are great (given the quality of ingredients), and the owners and staff are awesome.  Seriously, you can walk in there, order anything on the menu, and walk away happy.  My personal favorites are the Paisano (best pastrami ever) and the Mai Thai (spicy peanutbutter and bacon are all you need).  Seriously, go eat there, you won't regret it.  The only downsides: - You have to wait a bit for your sandwich (especially if they're busy, and they always are around lunch). - The ventilation is kinda weak, so you may come out smelling like the place if you're not getting your sandwich to go (it's worth it, don't worry). - There isn't a ton of seating."}
{"text":"In a location that can only be referred to as \"completely out of the way\", even if you're from Garfield Heights or even Cuyahoga Heights, Gourmand's is quite possibly one of the best sandwich shoppes in the Cleveland area, location be damned. The wannabe strip mall that houses this hidden gem is bookended by a sign shop and a Mr. Hero that looks like it was transplanted straight from Beirut itself.  Forget the ambiance, forget the location. Let's talk turkey -- which is fantastic. If we talk beef? Fantastic. Pork and Chicken? Equally fantastic. Breakfast sandwiches and bagels? If you guessed anything other than fantastic, you probably need to take a remedial course on reading.   The best thing about Gourmand's are the owners and staff. Always friendly, always willing to chat for a minute or two while you wait for one of their creations. Most of the time, they'll talk you into trying one of their smoothies -- just a taste. I've done wheatgrass shots with them two or three times, and I've gotta say that wheatgrass is pretty darn tasty. It's disconcerting when you start burping up a flowery, grassy taste when you've been chugging beer, but whatever. It's the shot that keeps on giving, I suppose.  In our office, the Fajita Wrap is Queen Sandwich. Fajita seasoned chicken, peppers and onions in a wrap make for a quick, tasty lunch. The Buffalo Bill with nice, tangy buffalo sauce and cooling blue cheese combine well with the broad leaf lettuce and tomato.   If you want corned beef, go to Slyman's. If you want a good, tasty sandwich made with just about anything else under the sun, take a hike down to Gourmand's. Just get there before 2 -- if they're not busy, they're not going to stay open for one or two customers, maybe. They say on the menu that they might be closed -- believe them. They will be."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place off and on since '98 when my office was just up the hill.  Now days I'm only over in this area every couple of weeks but whenever I get a craving for a BLT, I go to Gormand's.  Hands down the best BLT in Cleveland area.  Loaded with hot, flavorful bacon, crispy lettuce, and ripe tomato (which can be hard to find in off season), all on perfectly toasted bread.  I feel bad because they have a great selection of sandwiches but I always get the same thing, my beloved BLT.  I've also used this place for catering; ordered big variety sandwich tray and side dishes for lunch presentation at customer; food was well prepared and fresh, and ready when they said it would be.  There's a reason this place is still around,and I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"This place has always taken care of me every single time I've gone.  Whether at 6:30 in the morning when I can't decide which amazing coffee to pick out or during the noon rush.  Amazing food that never disappoints and an incredible staff.  Their smoothies are fantastic, their sandwiches are fantastic, and their breakfast is fantastic.  If in doubt, eat here."}
{"text":"When my office moved from downtown to valley view I was pretty sad. Then I remembered that we would be down the street from Gourmands. They are open for breakfast and lunch. Great coffee, egg sandwiches and pastries for breakfast.   They have Fantastic sandwiches. I'm a vegetarian and there's like 12 to choose from. I love to have a choice and not have to settle on the one \"vegetarian\" sandwich at other places. Everyone I take here loves it.   The staff is helpful and friendly if you can't decide. And they have weird but lovely selection of wine, beer, and cigars.   It's more expensive than the mr hero or Bk next door but that other stuff is barely edible compared to the artistry put into Gourmand's sandwiches. Try it- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's my first time in Cleveland and by some stroke of awesome luck my team put me in charge of the food. We didn't have time to do much other than work and eat, so needless to say I took my job very seriously. Gourmand's is truly a gem and definitely worth checking out (or frequenting) while you're in Cleveland! The outside is pretty unassuming as it is located in a small shopping plaza behind Burger King but inside you can find cigars, beer, and some of the best deli sandwiches I've ever had. Personally, I tried the mad cow and the old smokey and both were fantastic! I don't know what else to say other than I'm from Florida...the land of Boar's Head...and this place's deli meat was..dare I say...better. Oh and the toasted ciabatta! Yum!  It's tough to please a crowd of 8 people but I can honestly say everyone was happy with what they ordered (twice) this week. Within our group we had the BLT, the Reuben, and the pork cutlet sandwich among others. They also gave us pickles and candy with our to-go food :)   If you're in town, go to Gourmand's! I'm looking forward to eating the banana nut bread I grabbed on my way out and visiting y'all again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, Greg the owner has created a great atmosphere.  Nothing but good things to say. I usually get a chicken sandwich with cheese, grilled onions, and peppers, but not a shortage of other tasty items. Did buy a couple cigars and they were good also."}
{"text":"In a deep valley this neighborhood gives the illusion of being surrounded by mountains. The canal can pass as a mountain creek. This area is a testament that China or no China industry thrives in Cleveland. Other than the striking bridges of the bicycle trail  the architecture here is about as pleasing as Florida carports. For the many who work in the area Gourmand's is one of several lunch destinations.   Gourmand's is a very busy place, with small tables squashed together, very little floor space available for ordering, waiting to pay or picking up carry out. On one visit I got up to get a Coke and someone took my seat. On the bright side there is no room for children to run around terrorizing while inept mothers look on adoringly.   The main events are  countless unique sandwiches. On my last visit I had a so called Chicago Beef. It was definitely not a Chicago Beef. It was not beef long simmered in a broth with Italian seasonings and pepperoncini. It was a big sandwich with excellent roast beef topped with pickled jalapenos and giardiniera served with a container of au jus gravy. Gourmand's has a wide array of drinks including Italian sodas and unusual bottled iced teas.   It is necessary to wait in two lines. First to place your order then to pay. I am past the age where small things upset me but those who anger easily may find having to wait twice frustrating.  This is an excellent place for well made sandwiches at a reasonable price for the area's workers. The friendly people who work here seem to know almost every body. For those who work in this area or who come for business,  Gourmand's is the place to be at lunch."}
{"text":"When I worked down in Valley View, I would frequent Gourmand's for breakfast and lunch.  Whether it was a nice chai tea latte - bigger than and cheaper than what you'd get at Starbucks - and a muffin or one of their salads or their sandwiches or their soups, anything I had was delicious!  Greg and Andrea really bring a lot of creativity to the table, with fun named sandwiches and odd creations.  Who would think that putting bacon and peanut butter together (for their My Thai sandwich) would be good?  As absurd as it sounds, it's delicious!  If I'm on that side of town for lunch, it's at the top of my list for places to go!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I haven't reviewed this place yet!   I love a good deli sandwich and this place always satisfies! The food is fresh and tasty. There's so many options to choose from and you can of course customize it a bit if you're not 100% sure you want it the way the menu reads. The sandwiches are generous in size. A sandwich alone will leave you feeling full.   The staff is always very friendly and accommodating!   They have some crafty beers, some wine and cigars if you fancy such things.   This is a great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices. Service was a little slow. Cigars and craft beer for sale as we'll"}
{"text":"The food produced by this small shop is incredible. My friend and I sampled the All Italian and the Chicken Club today along with half orders of onion rings and chips. The food was delicious. The process needs improvement. We ordered our food. We waited 25 minutes to have our name called to retrieve it. All good. We ate. Then we stood in line for another 25 minutes to pay. Not good. This site needs to separate pick-up, coffees and smoothies and customers trying to pay. As it is today, we all queue up on one big line. I was late back to work as a result."}
{"text":"I saw this place featured in one of the Yelp weekly emails and I knew I had to try it right away! They are only open until 3pm and only during the week, but luckily I was only working half a day so I could run over and grab a variety of goods off the menu.   I was waited on by one of the owners and he was so patient with me while I figured out what to order. I LOVE that they let you get half sandwiches without charging you extra, it's no big deal to them and they actually wish more people would do that so they could try more off the menu. Also, they don't mind a little customization so if you want to add garlic mayo or swap out grilled mushrooms for grilled zucchini on your sandwich no problem! I went with four halves (two total sandwiches), an order of homemade chips and a side of coleslaw.   While I waited for my order to be ready I perused about the store and saw that they offer a variety of wine, craft beer, cigars, chips, coffee, and sodas. To me it seemed like a great place to pick up quality items for a tasty lunch without encountering things like Miller Light or Lay's Potato Chips. I also noticed that I had just walked in before a rush! This place gets pretty busy but staff stays calm and friendly which makes you chill out too even with 15 people standing around you in a small space.   When my order was ready I paid a reasonable price and was surprised to have four cookies from a local place thrown into my bag. Hells yeah!   Now time for the food: No meager fillings for these sandwiches! While all were good, my favorite was probably the The Philly. Just hearty messy no frills goodness. The Gobbler was similar but had a kick to it, there had to have been some hot peppers in there! Cajun Redfish had a great crust and flavor while the Apple Porkling was good even eaten cold the next day. My order of homemade chips and dip was huge and I had to break that up into a couple meals as well. It was nice to have some crunch to go along with the sandwiches. The coleslaw was lackluster, but still fine for a topping on some of the sandwiches. The cookies, oh man there was this oatmeal apple one, this chocolate and nut one, oatmeal raisin and this one with toffee or caramel? I had a bite of each but my favorite was the chocolate and nut one, just soft and delicious.   All in all my first visit here was a success! I am bummed about the hours though, I'm not really able to stop in again unless I have time off from work. So go in my Yelp friends and eat up the sandwiches for me!"}
{"text":"Out on the motorcycle for a ride before work and needed to pick up lunch on the way downtown; since I was coming up the Cuyahoga Valley I remembered that I had heard great things about Gourmand's.  Located in a small retail plaza at the intersection of Canal and Granger Roads is one of a wonderful surprising deli, coffee shop, wine and cigar store.  From the outside you would never what you find inside.  Walking in Gourmand's you find a very nice and well organized shop.  Half the room is set up with tables that you can seat yourself at, the decor is attractive and casual.   I found myself almost overwhelmed by the huge menu boards with more choices then you would expect.  Luckily the menu is well organized so I zeroed in on the fish and seafood choices and ordered the Shrimp Poboy.   Since I was taking it with me, they packed the vegetables and sauces on the side so everything was perfect when I put it all together at work.  The sandwich was excellent, a large portion of battered shrimp were crispy and plump.  The bun was toasted nicely, crisp and tasty.  The lettuce and tomato were fresh and crunchy.  The sandwich came with a tangy homemade tarter sauce and zippy sirancha.  All of the elements worked well together and it was as good as I have had in Cleveland.  Stopped by for a second visit and had to try the Redfish Sandwich based on the review by Jason Y.  He was so right as this is one of the best fish sandwiches I have had.  You get 3 good sized fillets of ocean perch with a crispy coating, a very good and very hot sauce, coleslaw on slices of excellent toast.  The fish was perfectly cooked with the hot sauce just at the edge of being too hot, but then balanced by the crisp and cool slaw.  The only problem I had with the sandwich is that it was messy to eat; I would rate this as a 4-5 napkins required.  Gourmand's lives up to its name, the food is excellent and you get great food for a reasonable price.  If you are anywhere close, check them out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff is wonderful and the food is always yummy! We are teachers in the area and Greg takes such good care of us every time we come in. If you are in a hurry, call them and they will have it ready for you whenever you want it. We have about 40 min for lunch and they accommodate us every time!   The sandwiches are all amazing and they have such a wide variety... I have yet to sample the entire menu. Their soup is always great for the cold winter days and they keep you updated daily of the choices through their Facebook page. Greg keeps his store full of beer and cigars that we like to take with us for after hours ;)   Our only complaint is that we wish they were open just a little bit longer during the day so we could stop on our way home from work to bring food home to the family.   This is our weekly choice because of the amazing food and wonderful staff! Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Read about them from the \"Cleveland is serious about Sandwiches\" article from Yelp and knew I had to check them out.  They are real super nice, friendly and patient.  The pulled pork sandwich and the Apple Porkling were both really great.  Lots of sauced tender pulled pork on their homemade bread.  Doesn't get any better. The Onion rings were not the frozen Gus's Onion rings most places have (unless I'm mistaken) and they were really tasty.  The fries are hand cut and a pretty large portion.  The drink selection has lots of different drinks (no soda fountain here)  I had the Coconut Colada Limeade and my son had the Nantucket Nectar Lemonade.  I thought the price was a little high at first but, I couldn't even finish the sandwich.  I will be back to try something new very soon.  I just wish you guys had later hours so I could get here on regular work days."}
{"text":"How did I miss this gem when I was living up here?!  What isn't to like? The staff is incredibly friendly even as busy as they were. The dining area is comfortable and I noticed people sitting at tables drinking from assorted mugs. Really felt homey and warm.   I ordered a bagel, lox, capers and cream cheese. Just the right level of chewy in the bagel, love the flavors. NY quality lox.   I also ordered a cup of hot water for my own teabag. The gentleman ringing me up recognizes the teabag - his Gran gave him the same tea when he was small. I loved the attention to detail and the personal treatment. I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I had to bump this place up because the food and people there are so awesome.  They have a GREAT mix of fantastic coffees in the morning, I think six are going on any given time.  The price is pretty reasonable, and they're always so friendly in the morning.    The FOOD is even better, broken down by type (chicken beef veg etc) on various menu boards on the back wall.  It would take about 10 minutes to read them all   =)    I try to vary it up every time - and quite honestly I have never had a bad experience there.  Everything is exceptionally fresh, with great bread, and other unique items that not every deli/ sammich shop provides.  The owners or whoever is always there will even customize it for you, offer advice, and BS while you're waiting for the well prepared food.    OH and there's also Beer and decent cigars and wine!    The only down side - for those who don't work in Independence Tower... Its at the bottom of the hill on Granger, and I don't know how they get any business on the weekends.   Also price is fair for the quality you're getting, but expect to drop around $7 for $10 worth of deliciousness."}
{"text":"New to the area, and in search of a great place to get coffee, I found this place and have been back 4 times in 2 weeks! Quaint and delicious! Every time I go in I see something I didn't the last time.  Great selection of wine and beers, a deli, made to order lattes and cappuccinos, locally made treats and a few tables to dine in!! I was nervous that chain coffee shops were my only options.. and Gourmand's is only 3 minutes away from my house."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday; amazing but get there early! I arrived about 11:15 and was able to order and sit down to eat, but the place filled up quick! Amazing sandwich (Cajun Chicken) and good selection of chips and beverages. All on the honor system, just pay for what you ate on your way out the door.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite deli.  Very friendly.  The variety of sandwiches is great.  Make sure to get the pickle.  You like baloney.  Get the no phoney baloney.  An almost 1 inch thick baloney steak sandwich with Dijon mustard and smoked cheddar.   Also for sale are many choice European beers.  Including great polish beers.  The kind that even get your dad drunk.  10% AC?  Who needs 10%?  Yes, 2 please. They have great cookies.  To top it all, sometimes you get some double bubble with your order! Right off the towpath, and hidden by a BK, I recommend a visit.  But do it during the week, and in the day, Gourmands is open early and closes early."}
{"text":"Legit the BEST service EVER, always super busy but that's for a reason these people really know what their doing here! Absolutely love them!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have never had anything here that wasn't extremely tasty.  The Owners are SSOOO incredibly nice, and helpful.  You MUST try the chips!!!! I dream about them!!  It may be small, and you are elbow to elbow with others, but you really can't do better. Since I work nearby, and work weekends, I really wish they were open then too. You really need to try the \"All Italian\" at least once in your life."}
{"text":"Delicious. This is the kind of place you can't find unless you travel off the beaten path, or have Yelp! If I ever find myself in this corner of Ohio again, I will make it a point to come back.  Fairly small dining area, but lots of character and the staff was very friendly to us first timers!"}
{"text":"For a out of Towner, this was so amazing of a place to visit and the food was next world good"}
{"text":"I cannot stop thinking about the sandwich I had today for lunch today from Gourmand's. The Hawaii Five-Oh is the bees knees! And the portion sizes are great!  I went about 1pm and it was still fairly busy. Next time I will order ahead. They have a great selection of drinks and chips which I loved. They have something for everyone, wine, beer, cigars,coffee and food! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A nestled little gem.  The service was great, soda selection was great, the sandwiches were great.   What else can I say but this place is great!  They let me split an order so I go the ha chance to try 2 sandwiches, an they gave me the option to try the soda fountain, and I I didn't like it to grab a soda out of the cooler, all around nice people.  They look to have a great breakfast an coffee selection.  Hours are a little different, they close at 3pm and are not open on weekends, but I'm not complaining!  Great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Cajun Redfish sandwich- this about my 5th time of coming here and 4th of getting this sandwich. Flavor and texture explosion. Pure heaven. So glad I found it and it's 0.2 miles from the office I'm working from. I LOVE it! Amazing."}
{"text":"Great food.   Excellent sandwiches and breakfast foods.  Lunch can be VERY SLOW, even when you call ahead you will wait for 15 minutes.  Worth it, if you have the time."}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh I got a BLT and soup combo The BLT was 90% bacon and 10% everything else which in my book is a win and the soup! I got the chicken and rice soup and it was amazing- fresh, homemade. Tasted almost like my grandmas soup. Regardless it was everything I wanted in a soup- hearty, warm, filling and most of all tasty"}
{"text":"Great place. A lot of options for people who can't decide like me. Loved everything I got. And there's  no pressure. Everybody was so nice."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute must try if your in the area for lunch. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the people working there are about as pleasant as it gets.  Aside from the good selection of unique beers, wines, and cigars, the food in my opinion is one of the best sandwiches in the area.  Despite other people telling me how wonderful the other sandwiches are, I can't seem to get over the chicken club. It is a chicken breast breaded to perfection with cheese, ranch, lettuce, tomato, and bacon!! They even put this heavenly creation on a toasted croissant! You can definitely taste the fresh ingredients. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This review is based on one event.   I made a mistake. Gourmand Deli sells bagels from Bialy's Bagels which are generally thought to be the best in Cleveland.  They were nice enough to call and let me know they were in and I committed to a dozen.   The mistake I made was assuming Groumand wouldn't try and rip me off. I have bought them at Corky and Lenny's--probably the most expensive deli in the area--and they are 9.99 a doz.  I figured, ok, if Gourmand adds a small premium, fine. I could deal with $1,$2, even $3 more. I mean, how much could they be? Hell, in Manhattan great bagels are $14.99/doz.  They were TEN DOLLARS more than the most expensive deli in Cleveland charges and $4.00 more than in NYC. That's right, $19.50 for a dozen bagels. Am I an idiot for paying that? Absolutely.    Later I called and spoke to someone and asked why they were $10.00 more per dozen than elsewhere. I was told: \"We have margins. If you don't like the price buy them somewhere else.\"   Like I said, I made a mistake. The mistake of thinking that these people would act with some sense of business ethics and general fairness.  Based on this experience it appears they may be more interested in price-gouging than keeping customers. Great, now Yelpers know, too.   Hey, Gourmand management: Let's say you had charged a $3.00 premium instead of $10. I would have continued coming to you for them every other week or so, and, like today, bought something else. So, YOU decided to give up those more consistent longer-term profits for one $10.00 score. Is that smart? Was it worth it?   So, as W once so smoothly put it: \"There's an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee -- that says, fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.\""}
{"text":"This little off the beaten path deli is our new favorite. They have been in business for 18 years and finally checked them out. Fun beer selection, great wine deals. Delicious coffee's, sandwiches. Bagels, and muffins. Greg the owner is charming, and funny."}
{"text":"Do not let the location in a small strip mall deter you from walking in. Do not let the overwhelming menu offerings or the wait for your meal deter you from ordering. Do step up to the counter, place your order and then wait for the sandwich gods to blow you away. While you wait for your food and a table browse around. This place is terrific, craft beer, wines, soft drinks and cigars. Oh, did I mention the fresh brewed coffee offerings. You can also call ahead and place your order. I could go on but our sandwiches are here, a Chicago beef, a breakfast sandwich, a Cuban Puerto and breaded deep fried mushrooms."}
{"text":"Favorite deli spot in Cleveland. Their hours are from 6am to 3pm most of the time but you know the food is good if they are able to close so early in the day.  From the moment you walk in, the staff greets you and you see a huge menu written on a chalkboard overhead. They have so many options from poultry, beef, seafood, to delicious breakfast sandwiches. My favorite go to is the Cajun redfish. Hands down, best fish sandwich I've ever had and I usually get this when I come in. Occasionally I will try a different sandwich but man is the fish sandwich good. Everyone should try it out if they like fish!  They also have hot chocolate and good coffee. Their beans are from Rising Star so you know it's good. Nice and hot.   They also sell beer, wine, and cigars so go check this place out if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  They serve some great sandwich combinations. Well priced for what you are getting.  If you eat there, they serve all sides on the honor system.  Bring your chip bag and drink to the counter and pay after.  Kind of cool since most places wouldnt think of doing that.  If ordering lunch takeout, call ahead.  It could be a longer wait than expected."}
{"text":"Gourmand's Deli is one of the best sandwich shops in Cleveland. The menu has a myriad of unique options of sandwiches that you can only find in an independent shop like Gourmand's. The staff is terrific. I go to lunch here with one of my best friends that I went to Kent State with. We both worked in a sub shop there (Bombers Deli) and this place instantly reminded us of that experience. It felt like home. They carry Rising Star coffee which is also commendable. I plan on riding my bicycle down the towpath this summer and this will be a stop on my journey. I highly recommend this as a regular lunch stop if you work in the Independence / Valley View area."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Unless you work in the are you've probabky never had the chance to eat there, but it's worth the trip.  Great sandwiches and salads and if you want a wine, beer, or cigar recommendation Greg can hook you up.  They are very busy for lunches so calling ahead is probably a good idea.  I can't pick a favorite sandwich, they have too many good ones!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. I have to restrain myself from going to often because the sandwiches are delicious. Make sure to order the potato chippers with any meal. What tips it off is the staff. No matter how busy they are, they're always nice and kind. This place can get busy for lunch but that's what you expect from a great place like this. I recommend everything!"}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast sandwiches and really good coffee and smoothies! When I worked in the area, it was an every morning MUST. The owners and staff are so nice and it's easy to get caught up in a conversation with them. :) Also, check out the beer collection!"}
{"text":"I rarely give five stars to a casual dining spot. I usually reserve the five star ratings for fine dining choices.  I have been going to Gourmands for a LONG time, and have never taken the time to write a review. After leaving there today, I realized they deserve a few minutes of my time.  If you are looking for cookie cutter food, service and ambiance.....go elsewhere.  If you are looking for great simple food, service with an attitude (and that is meant as a big compliment) and a special treat like a six pack of craft beer, a specially selected bottle of wine, or maybe an equally hand selected cigar....Gourmands is your place.  If you live or work locally....make this a regular spot.  If you are just passing through.....you will not be disappointed."}
