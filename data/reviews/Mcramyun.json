{"text":"I had a fantastic experience. The food was unbelievably good - fresh, tasty, plentiful. The wait staff are adorably sincere. We had japchae, chicken katsu, and ramyun wings. 

The price is great, and the location is way handy. Note: if you want to have alcohol you have to stay inside. The patio was not yet licensed when we were there.

Bonus: Kekou Gelato is only a few doors away on Baldwin - crazy good gelato in exciting and unusual flavours!"}
{"text":"So, this place is a nice change for those who have had enough of Japanese style ramen. They use Korean instant noodles but with a unique flare and a tasty twist. I tried their Hong Jjambong, which is the spicy seafood ramen. First of all, the portion is huge! well, at least for me it was. So go with an empty stomach! It also has a variety of seafood including mussels, shrimp and squid. My favourite part was the soup-it was perfectly spicy and hearty that my hangover was instantly cured with the first taste of it. I actually let my friend finish the noodles and asked the server for a bowl of rice to finish up the soup and feel all better. It's definitely lighter than the usual go-to for hangover cures, the pork bone soup. Definitely going back soon to try other ramens on the menu!"}
{"text":"Echoing some of the comments below. I have no issue restaurant serving instant noodle, but it should really be informed upfront, charging like $12-14 is sort of deceiving!!

Ordered a beef ramyun and a dumpling with rice cake ramyun. The beef was lukewarm and dry, but still kind of edible. Half of the rice cake are undercook and still hard in the centre, not edible. Both noodle came with the same soup base, and yes, it tastes very much like the instant noodle soup base. I had the same brand of instant noodle since I was a kid, and it is sold under $1 in the grocery store. Very disappointed with the food quality to say the least.

The only reason that it is not a 1-star? The wings are different, taste good. And also the restaurant serves both Korean and Japanese beer, which is a plus.

Definitely not going back.........I got $1 in the pocket and a pot at home for instant noodle."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was a let down for me.

I had the ramen with dumplings and pork belly.
They use INSTANT noodles!!! The broth wasn't anything to go home about, and the pork belly was quite dry. The only saving grace was the dumplings, they were actually quite tasty!!

the service staff were very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Go to any Korean grocery store (or many Chinese stores carry them, too), and pick up one instant noodle package. Go home, read the instruction, and cook it. It's really simple. If you can fry an egg, you can do this. Could be easier. You may want to throw in some left-over veggies or canned tuna if you like. Now the whole thing probably would cost you around $3 after tax. Here at McRamyun (now MoRamyun) they ask you to pay $8 to $14 for what is essentially the same thing. The owner's got to be a f-ing genius, right?"}
{"text":"Food:
Kimchi Ramen: simply instant noodles topped with some kimchi. Spicy but not flavourful.
Jajang Ramen: the sauce was a bit too salty but I liked this one better than the kimchi ramen. 
Ramen Wings: the coating was interesting but again on the salty side, and it was hard to bite.

Service:
Friendly and fast.

If u are a huge fan of instant noodles and u are super curious abt this instant noodle place, give it a try. Otherwise heading to somewhere else would be a wise choice."}
{"text":"I just happened to notice a new restaurant around the corner of Baldwin street so I went in with my boyfriend. We tried McRamyun and Ton Katsu for lunch. Keep in mind these are Korean noodle, it's got a bit of spicy kick to it. To be honest, my tastebuds are easy to please but he is NOT. He's quite picky about his food and actually he was really happy with his choice.   The portion for the noodle was huge we couldn't finish it all. We highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"This one's a bit delayed but after seeing a posting on BlogTO i felt it was right to give my input on this place... McRamyun.

Located at the corner of McCaul and Baldwin Street, you will find the area slowiy turning into a hipster area but quite comforting. Parking is easy to find on McCaul and everything is walkable.

Once you arrive to the restaurant, you will find a very comforting patio at the front and a fresh spacious design inside. They have a large bar on the right with a limited selection of alcohol. One beer tap (Sapporo) and a large stack of Soju bottles at the back. As of right now they won't allow any alcohol on the patio so you'll need to have your beer indoors on a nice sunny day.

As for the food, well i was surprised at the selections they had. As the name of the restaurant states, it is mainly a Ramyun restaurant. The menu has a large list of Ramyun choices taking over the whole middle section of menu. I ordered their most popular McRamyun. It is half size larger than their normal Ramyun bowls. They give you two pieces of pork belly, few slices of grilled chicken, veggies, dried and cooked ramyun and one whole soft yolk egg. The broth that comes with it is a stone pot stew broth. Something similar to Jjamppong. This ramyun was $13.95. A little pricey for a bowl of instant noodles but definitely worth trying once. I would likely try the other ramyun's for my next round.

Another popular dish is their McChicken Wing. For the A La Carte menu they will sell them in 3 or 10 pieces. But they have a combo where you get 1/2 lb (4 pieces) with a pint of Sapporo for $9.45 which is quite a good value. The chicken is served on a plate as if you were at a normal bar, with celery and carrots. It comes with two sauces, caesar/blue cheese and some hot and sweet sauce. I have to be honest that I love the chicken. It is battered in crispy ramyun making it super crunchy. It was tasty and still juicy. I would definitely come back for this. 

One big disappointment was the Asparagus wrap. It is 4 sprigs of asparagus and crispy ramyun wrapped in rice wrap and deep-fried. They serve it on a massive plate making it look very minimal. I don't think it was worth paying $4.49 for it. 

The service was great. They were quick, informative and they were able to communicate the dishes quite well. Being a korean restaurant you would expect some language restrictions, with the exception of those hipster korean joints lately, but this was definitely quite pleasant. 

I would say that this is more of a bar atmosphere, not a sit down restaurant. I would have Sapporo and their Ramyun chicken any time. Too bad they won't allow alcohol on the patio. I will definitely be back. I sure hope they did their homework when it came to the 'Mc' referencing of their restaurant and food. I would hate to see this place get into trouble and leave me without their chicken. 

Ratings:

Atmosphere - 3 out of 5

Food - restaurant style 2 out of 5, bar style 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"I had a white ramen soup with pork belly in it. I thought it was great!"}
{"text":"The service is great, really attentive and prompt.

Although the entire restaurant had a neat concept of presenting Ramyun with a quirky twist, the overall food was underwhelming for a couple of reasons.

The McRamyun was huge, probably enough for two to share. The egg was done right, not over cooked. However the flavour was a bit bland although it had the max level of spiciness. The biggest let down was probably the cheese. A Kraft single like cheese that was too sweet to compliment the dish of which costed $1 per slice. 

The McFried Chicken was alright, neat concept but had too thick of a layer of ramyun on top. 

Overall, I wouldn't come back. But it was a pretty neat experience to try it once - just be prepared it's not cheap for what you're getting.

Hopefully they'll revisit their business plan!"}
{"text":"Great place, awesome food and friendly staff. Really liked the seafood Ramen, will definitely come back"}
{"text":"My friend and I got the McChicken wings (4 wings for $6) and Bulgogi ramyun
What I liked about this joint: 
- Large portion sizes for their ramyun
- Bulgogi had good flavour

What I didn't like:
- McChicken wings are overrated (thick breading, overpriced for 4 small wings)
- Quality of the ramen was not great (\"creamy\" broth diluted from cabbage and bean sprouts)"}
{"text":"More towards a 3.5. Before I start this review I want to clarify that the noodles at McRamyun are in fact instant noodles, and it's supposed to be that way. I make this clarification because I read a blog post where the reviewer bashed the restaurant for using instant noodles and compared it to the likes of sansotei and santouka. These comparisons are unfair because that's not what ramyun here means. Ramyun is korean, and often used in reference to instant noodles. Most items on the menu use instant noodles and combines it with a korean soup (ie. doenjang chigae) or a korean dish (ie corn cheese). I thought the construction of the menu is pretty clever. Now that terms have been defined I will move forth with my review!

I ordered the corn cheese ramyun and was too cheap to add a protein to it for extra $$. It was a wise choice on my point because it actually came with pancetta (i believe), and the cheese sauce itself made the dish real filling. Overall I enjoyed what I had. The sauce had strong cheese flavour and was not just plain white sauce and fresh veggies were included to balance the heavy dish. I do have trouble with the price point though. The dish is about $11 and since there were only a few pieces of pancetta I don't think that price can be justified due to low food costs. Unless the cheese for the sauce is really expensive?

What made McRamyun lose points was my friends dish. She ordered the ddeok (rice cake) ramyun, and unlike my dish, hers came in a soup base. It's supposed to be spicy but they were kind and accommodated her with a non-spicy soup base. On their menu they advertise that they will balance the unhealthiness of instant noodles with fresh ingredients. The soup however tasted too instant in both of our opinions and detracted from the restaurant's promise of an \"upgraded\" ramyun experience. My friend also mentioned that the ddeok were under-cooked.

Overall, I think this restaurant is novel enough for a single visit, but I have difficulty imagining myself returning due to the price point and the quality of the soup-based ramyun since that's the majority of the menu."}
{"text":"Ate here blindly without reading any prior reviews because one of the other ramen shops in the area didn't have any low seating available for my elderly mother. We didn't realize their \"ramyun\" was actually INSTANT NOODLES until after they sent out the food.

Ordered curry instant noodles, which was topped with potato and carrot cubes, and a few bacon slices. The cubes were uncooked and were only softened after several minutes in the broth. Even the curry broth was made from the powder packet. You can add 4 slices of pork belly for $2.50, but this isn't the tender pork belly you get at the other ramen shops. It's about as tough as pork shoulder, and less flavorful, too.

With two other real ramen shops within a minute's walk of this, the only reason to eat here is if you're really short on money: during \"happy hour\" (2-5pm), their basic \"ramyun\" costs $5 including tax, and the curry \"ramyun\" costs $8. But perhaps it's just better to hold your appetite."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the McFried Chicken Wings here so that into account.  But what a delicious, interesting and unique item!  Chicken wings covered in fried noodles served with sweet chili and a garlicky mayo.  Service was excellent.  Very sweet and attentive. When I asked about ordering a side of fries (since there are fries in the poutine but not offered as a side alone)  they were given to me on the house!  The pint of Sapporo + half a pound of wings (4 of them) deal is great."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers on a Friday for lunch. We didn't plan ahead so ended up here since they had space on the patio to fit 8 of us. No alcohol on the patio which is fine. It took us over 30min for food although we are a bigger group and it was packed inside. One of us waited for 40min for a kimchi ramyun, which is a bit ridiculous. Besides that the waitress made a mistake with someone's order; she brought out bulgogi ramyun instead of basic ramyun but she gave it to him for the price of basic ramyun. 

Before I say anything about the food, I did find a small clear piece of plastic in my soup. I'm personally not very bothered by it as it looked like the wrapper of some spicy sauce. Either way it's unacceptable. 

As for the food, the chicken was well seasoned and tender. Broth was not as salty as I expected, which I like but since i don't eat very salty its most likely bland for most people. It had a decent spicy kick and probably would've tasted better with extra spice. The noodles are the normal instant noodles. Besides that there were some bean sprouts, sliced cucumber and I added half an egg for $0.50. 

All in all it was a mediocre meal with decent service, and slow food at lunch time. It's also a bit over priced for a bowl of instant noodles but that's to be expected. I would not recommend if you are a Korean food lover since it's nothing special, but if you've never tried Korean style ramyun, its worth a try."}
{"text":"The spicy cheese pork rib is incredible! But be careful about the spicy level. It has options for regular, spicy and extra spicy. We chose spicy and it was REALLY spicy! 
We also tried Don-Gol Ramyun and Bulgogi Bibim Ramyun, both of which were pretty good! The soup of Don-Gol was creamy and rich but not too thick. The bulgogi Bibim had a sweet taste.
The dining environment is cool too. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Really good ramen. One of the best places! Everything is literally just so delicious, a must try! Looks like Kinton's got some competition!"}
{"text":"*As expected from the name, the main focus of McRamyun is Korean ramen with some traditional Korean dishes. 
*Free Wifi 
*No alcohol on patio
*Great service

My friend and I ordered the Kimchi Ramyun ($8.95) and Bulgogi Ramyun ($12.95). 
The noodles are instant/from packages which is ok, considering the name. 

But if a restaurant is going to charge $8 - 13 for a bowl of instant noodles, then there better be some gold flakes or luxurious ingredients come with my bowl of soup. Why should I pay more than $10 for something that is easily made at home for less than $5, and perhaps even more flavourful?

The ramyun were decent sizes. All the ingredients were done right and were ah-okay, not memorable at all. Although the soup had the right level of spiciness, the broth was extremely bland and had no flavour. Albeit it is definitely healthier compare to those packaged seasoning, but I rather have some of that than drinking a bowl of water and noodle."}
{"text":"Not a good value for its price.
Cant justify instant noodle for 14 dollars where you can get authentic ramen from scratch with same price. Blogto is getting sloppy with their review. 

The food came out delayed which go agast their name mc something - indicating its fast food."}
{"text":"Treat this place like your regular Korean restaurant then you wouldn't be surprise that they serve you instant noodles (aka ramyun).

My husband and I walked into McRamyun for lunch and the smell of their bibimbap that another customer was enjoying made us hungry!

We ordered:

Soontofu Ramyun - the portion are quite big, I was so stuffed and struggling to finish. It had a piece of mussel, a shrimp, some squid rings, chopped veggies, tofu and ramyun. It tastes like your typical soontofu minus the hot vessel. It was a good and satisfying dish.

Corn & Cheese Ramyun - it's like a carbonara with noodles instead of your pasta. If you're looking for a fusion dish, this one is for you! My husband loved it!

Overall, the service was really good and the food tastes good, and the portions are satisfying. We will definitely be back to try their noodles chicken wings and bibimbap!"}
{"text":"McRamyun is a Korean fusion restaurant with a itty bitty patio on the outside, on the corner of the infamous Baldwin street. I came here, after a friend's wedding ceremony, and was starving. We sat on the patio, which meant we couldn't be served alcohol.

Ordered the wings to share, and I ordered a Duen something Ramyun, which was the soft tofu broth, and added on 2 pieces of pork belly for $2.95. The wings came, but they mistakenly gave us the McWings instead of normal wings. McWings is their \"specialty\", which is covered in crushed dried noodles. We'd already dug in, so they graciously put normal wings on the bill instead. These wings were delicious!

The ramyun itself was just ok. The broth was spicy, and the noodles were just...noodles. Pork belly seemed dry and none of that fatty goodness. Overall, the ramyun cost about $15, which did not seem worth the money.

I would come back for the wings, but in my mind, the ramyun was just a 2 star."}
{"text":"I totally knew what I was getting into before I came to this restaurant, aka that the ramyun is basically just Korean instant noodles, so that was fine for me. Actually, my main reason for coming to this place was because I wanted to try the fried chicken, which is coated with a layer of fried ramyun. With regards to the chicken, I think it's kind of a cool idea and props to them for trying something different, but I actually didn't like it. The ramyun coating is super hard and crunchy, and while I get that some people might like that, it just wasn't my thing. It just made it kind of difficult to get at the actual chicken meat, and overall took away from my enjoyment. The flavour wasn't bad, but I've had much better at a few other places, so I can't say I was impressed. I forget what bowl of noodles I got, but it ended up being HUGE... and definitely could have fed two people. It just felt like an endless bowl of instant noodles, and I couldn't even finish, especially after eating like 2 pieces of the fried chicken. This is one of those restaurants that is maybe worth trying once if you're really curious about the chicken, but not really worth any repeat visits."}
{"text":"Ordered spicy cheese pork for 2 people and a salad. Super delicious. Gonna try their Raman next time!"}
