{"text":"Amazingly great place to chill. Although the food is not quite like Harbour sixty or Canoe, it offers up bite size snacks with an asian flare that will satisfy your hunger without killing your wallet. They have $10 mega pints of Sapporo, so happens to be my favourite beer. I went on a weds night, which is half price grill night, so the wallet felt a whole lot heavier than my usual nights out. They have a half price wing and poutine night on tuesdays, so I think my next trip will be this coming tuesday."}
{"text":"I got a message on Yelp from the owner of Yakitori Bar. He told me that they have hired a new chef, changed up the management team, and asked me to come by to try their food one more time.  I came by on a Saturday afternoon with the same friend who visited this restaurant with me the first time around.  This time the food and serve have definitely improved! The server was very attentive. She constantly made sure we had enough water and brought extra sauces for dipping. The food was also much better this time around, kudos to the new Chef. Every thing was fresh and hot, as what it should be.  After this dining experience, I will definitely bring my friends by and support this restaurant!  Thanks Yakitori Bar!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable experience with great food and drinks. Interesting fusion dishes - kimchi poutine and the squash with pork/glutinous dough is a must try! Pork belly yakitori was grilled to perfection. Friend had a yoghurt with sake drink which was quite interesting. Only thing I didn't enjoy was the ramen - tasted somewhat \"instant\" - but then ramen is not their specialty. Staff was also quite pleasant."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and every time has been amazing. Their food has improved drastically over the past few months and service is always top notch. If your looking for a place whether it's with a date, a small group, or want to host your birthday party here your guaranteed to have a blast!"}
{"text":"Not sure what I was expecting, but I was definitely expecting more.  Came here for an impromptu dinner and was excited to try something new.  They have a small menu of featured skewers that were inspired by other known chefs so I was intrigued by the collaborations.  Ended up trying the dragon piri piri chicken skewer and the Alabama skewer -  a beef carpaccio skewer wrapped in bacon with maple.  The piri piri skewer was nice and moist, but the piri-ness was really lacking.  You could smell it, but I couldn't see or taste it.  The beef carpaccio skewer was delicious - you can't go wrong when you wrap anything in bacon  My friend and I also ordered the kimchi fries and the braised pork butt in a steamed rice bun.  The kimchi fries were good - the fries were nice and crisp and the gravy was great.  I wish the kimchi had a bit more flavour.  The pork bun meat was plentiful and moist.  I just wished that there was more sauce on the sandwich.  Overall these 2 items were tasty, BUT in comparison to Banh Mi Boys, they don't stack up in taste or price.    Probably wouldn't make plans to go here, but would pop in if I was in the neighbourhood needing a meal."}
{"text":"After the last failed restaurant experience for yakitori, this is attempt number two at this place at Baldwin Village. It was a weekday so it was not crazy but it there was a few tables eating. There was a lot of interesting things on the menu. I started off with the 'gangnam style' - soju, Korean yogurt & orange frizantte. My first time trying soju and I never knew you can mix Korean yogurt with alcohol. I love drinking Korean yogurt so this drink is perfect for me.  They had Tuesday special - if you buy a drink, can get poutine and wings for half price. AWESOME!! We got the kimchi fries with pulled pork. Also my first time trying kimchi fries, yummy!! We got the kimchi honey wings. The kimchi had a good kick to it, spicy and then with the honey to even it out.  We had the mixed yakitori platter - mixed vegetable, shrimp, chicken thigh, beef ribs and pork belly. The best skewer was the beef ribs, very flavourful and tender. I was disappointed on the pork belly, there was no belly fat on the skewer, only the meat part and was very hard.  We also got the beef tataki - seared angus beef in ponzu sauce with garlic chips. The beef was very thin and good, it went really well with the ponzu sauce and the tasty garlic chips! The tuna carpaccio - seared tuna with maple tamari sauce. It was fresh tuna, the sauce was good. But out of the two, I like the beef tataki more.  Finally, we also got the takoyaki. It was small ones served on a skewer like the Chinese style fish balls. There was a big piece of octopus meat inside. It was alright, not the best or the worst one I had.  It was a nice atmosphere to hang out in small group and talk all night long. We were there for over 3 hours just chatting, time flies. I think if we weren't like the second last table or that we had to work tomorrow, we would have stayed longer. The food came pretty quick, the food came faster than our eating speed so we were never waiting for food. Definitely a better dining experience than the last place."}
{"text":"You know someone cares when the paper napkin is thick and quality!  Service = great. Food = great. Ambiance = great. Need I say more.  Couple of my favorites: Kim Chi is refreshing. The cheese burger and phillysteak are almost. It is pretty awesome! Chicken wings were pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Not that many people for the whole dinner till 7:30pm.   It is easy to spot and ask for the waitress as the restaurant is not that large.    The kimchi flight 1 day old, 2 week old and 3 months old kimchi each has its own flavor.  1 day old is spicy, 2 week old a bit bitter and 3 months old the spice is soaped deep in the kimchi.  The oxtail is very tender and the meat just split from the bone when you touch it.  It is marinated enough and not too salty. The scallop with bacon skewer is the best with the scallop smell really good upon delivery.  The scallop is juicy and just cooked The spicy mussels seems to be in a kimchi like sauce with 2 pieces of garlic bread provided.  The mussels are fresh. The baby bimbimbap don't know what kind of egg it provides as it is very small.  Since it is not in a stone bowl, it cools down quickly. It comes with the Chinese vegetable The chicken thigh has 3 sauces - sesame, teriyaki and sriracha sauce.  I like the teriyaki sauce.  The chicken is average The pork kakune in apple-soya sauce with layer of fatty pork belly between the lean pork.  It is soft but I did find boiled egg instead served with vegetables  Overall, the food is not hot enough.  Next time if I come, I will have to split into a few orders.  The restaurant is clean and my tea gets refill many times with hot water."}
{"text":"This place looks very cool! The design is nice, a little small resto that my friends and I were really looking forward to seeing.  We arrive at this place without reservation for four people on a Wednesday night (around 9pm) and the only seats available were on the patio. It was a bit chilly though so we asked if we could be moved inside once a table cleared. They said of course and after forty minutes or so we moved inside. The place looks nice and clean and so do the bathrooms, our plates looked freshly washed and the utensils were spotless.  THE FOOD In one word, disappointing. I LOVE Korean food and was firstly surprised to see that you had to BUY the banchan which is usually supplied with the meals. However not a huge deal since they aren't going for your typical kresto feel anyway, I ordered the kimchi udon and some veggie skewers. The skewers were COLD. It had clearly been made a while ago and just left waiting for someone to order. It was also over cooked. The sauces provided were alright, we weren't told what the sauces were nor were they listed on the menu. The kimchu udon was delicious, however VERY OILY!!! Kimchi was very good and it was served hot!  Vegetarians, limited options!  DRINKS We ordered the makkoli which personally I wasn't a fan of but the rest of my friends enjoyed it. I ordered the house white wine and was pleasantly surprised. It was very delicious and probably my favourite part.  SERVICE There were only two waitresses, which considering how small the place is, is fine however we didn't get a lot of attention. She was very nice and polite but once our food was served we were basically left alone.  Overall it was OK, I likely won't be back since I've had much better Korean food elsewhere. It's a nice place if you just want a drink and some (sub-par) appetizers, otherwise I'd skip it."}
{"text":"This place is good! AND FUN!  I won't comment on any specific dishes, only because their menu is not totally set and is likely to change in the next while, but the food at this newly-opened joint is really yummy!! Their sake-based cocktails are also addictive--Bombay Tokyo was by far the most popular at our table, and the guava one was also pretty tasty.  I haven't tried much in the way of their yaki-stuff but it's nice to know that yakiniku is now available /downtown (minus the few dishes on offer at the izakayas). I will definitely be checking this place out a lot as I work nearby."}
{"text":"Tasty food. The Bulgogi burger was rich and flavorful. Definitely something special. Also, the kimchi in the poutine was....interesting. For something out of the ordinary, check it out!"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Yakitori Bar Cuisine: Korean/Japanese Location: Baldwin Village Address: 1 Baldwin St Price Range: $10~  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4  Service: 4  Ambiance: 4 Overall: 4  Extra information:  * Takes reservation * Open late night * Serves sake/beer/soju * Vegan friendly  I was lucky enough to be invited to their Media opening party at Yakitori Bar back in December (Click here to see) Ever since, I've been meaning to go back but I never got a chance to until late January.  There were so many things I wanted to try from their regular menu, I was so excited for dinner. Yakitori Bar owned by Sang Kim, is fusion of Korean and Japanese cuisine with interesting twist that can't be found at other izakayas in Toronto.   Ordered: Spicy Chicken wings  * Chili pepper & rice battered chicken wings for $6.95 * This was one of the dishes that triggered my interest during the media launch * It is your regular chicken wing but the batter has chili pepper in it which gives it that extra kick * Rice in the batter gives it that chewy texture * I loved these chicken wings, they were perfectly marinated on its own   Ordered: Squash DdukBbokKi  * Spicy rice cakes baked in a buttercup squash for $7.95 * This is a dish that is quite popular in Korea * Many who likes Korean food is familiar with the spicy rice cake (DdukBbokKi) but not in a butternut squash * It is topped off with mozarella cheese which adds that extra richness to the dish * I found the ricecakes to be little on the sweet side but nontheless they were delicious * The rice cakes also have fishcakes (oden) * They cut the squash into 4 pieces for you and you can scoop the inside * This is a must order when you visit   Ordered: Kalbi Philly Cheesesteak  * Sandwich made with beef short ribs, cheese, pickles and olives for $9.95 * I wanted to try one of their sandwiches and my friend wanted to try this specific one * I liked how used dense bread that could soak up all the sauce * Kalbi was marinated well and very tender * Tomato and pickles added some texture to the sandwich * I actually really liked the sald that was served on the side   Ordered: Chicken thigh skewers & Pork belly skewers  * 2 skewers for $4.95 * Skewers came with 3 different sauce, I liked the spicy sauce the best * I would recommend you try the special skewers that are made by   Complimentary: Kimchi flights  * 1 day old, 2 week old and 3 months old kimchi for $3.95 * With this, you get to try kimchi in different state (fermented for 1 day, 2 week and 3 months) * You can taste the different texture, smell, saltiness and acidity as it gets older * If you love kimchi, this would be an interesting dish for you to try * You can purchase their kimchi from next door, Seoul Food  Complimentary: Today's Banchan  * 3 types of fresh marinated vegetables for $3.50  * This changes day to day and it's like the side dishes you get when you go to regular Korean restaurants  Summary: I really enjoyed my meal at Yakitori Bar- I had high hopes and they def did not disappoint. Their dishes are new and innovative, most which can't be found at other izakayas. Yakitori Bar is the only Korean fusion izakaya in Toronto (others are Japanese izakayas with some Korean influence) which serves soju infused cocktail. If you already love Korean food, make sure to try Yakitori bar for a different experience. You will leave full and happy :)"}
{"text":"My cousins and I came to try this place out. We had the kim chi fries,  Squash DdukBbokKi, Spicy Chicken wings(fried), Honey Garlic wings(baked), Kalbi philly cheese steak, baby bibbimbop, Jap Chae, and Aphrodite's salty and sweet beef satay.  The restaurant is very small. We went on a Tuesday and it was half price wings that day. We tried one fried and one baked. The fried spicy chicken wings were great and flavorful and spicy. The honey garlic wings didn't look as appetizing baked, it was okay. The kim chi fries were a disappointment, it was covered in gravy and very strong and sour kimchi that over powered everything. I prefer the kim chi fries at Banh Mi Boys. I thought the Squash DdukBbokKi was too fishy tasting for me and there was no cheese! =(  I did enjoy the fact that it was baked in a squash, i love squash! The Jap Chae is as it is at any other korean restaurant. The baby bibbimbop wasn't how i pictured it to be. It was tiny and came with a vinaigrette instead of the spicy red sauce I'm used to. They were out of the  alligator bites so we got the salty and sweet beef satay and that was delicious and so was the kalbi philly cheese steak yum.   I would come back again just for wings, kalbi sandwich and satays."}
{"text":"As of January 2015 appears that both the Yakitori Bar/Seoul Food Company have closed (window are all papered over-inside is being cleaned out)--not sure why this failed--but clearly the number of customers was slowly but surely declining (some evenings only saw a few people eating there with the waitresses essentially talking to the cook)---I hope they put an Italian place in here next time--I understand it was supposed to have been a Wild Wing but the other restaurants stopped them from getting a patio liquor license"}
{"text":"Wondering if this restaurant requires a name change as I found that I enjoyed their korean snacks much more than their yakitori.  The ox tongue lacked flavour and overly chewy, and pork belly was tough and again lacked flavour. This might be the first time EVER where I didn't enjoy an order of pork belly. There are also special yakitori items, but I didn't think the two skewers justify the price of them. My favourite dish here was probably the squash dukbokki. They went easy on the spice as opposed to original korean dukbokki, plus the sweetness of the squash helps to cut the existing spice level which is good for people like me who don't handle spice very well. Also had the mussels in gochujang&butter sauce. The sauce was delicious, but the mussels were terribly tiny and weren't meaty enough for me to enjoy it I also the ordered the gangnam style drink, and found it very overpriced considering the size and amount of alcohol that was actually in the drink.  Overall I think there are too many better places in the downtown core offering a similar format of food and drinks to justify a return visit here. If anything I may come back for the squash dukbokki or to try one of their burgers."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurant/bars in Toronto!  Almost every thing is perfect in this cozy corner restaurant!   More like a restaurant in the day time, but at night it turns into the local hot spot! Live dj on Thursday and Fridays, always has great drink and food specials!  They have an amazing chef that makes masterpieces every time! I love the food here! Love the area! (Baldwin is torontos little hidden gem) I love the super nice servers, and the atmosphere this place gives off! A must try!!!! They have a cute patio as well!  Don't forget to try their yakitori sticks, and the hot stone pot! And  wash it all down with an XL mug of their sub zero cold sapporo!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people and it was okay. The menu didn't look too appetizing but we came up with a yummy solution. They sell skewers of meat and bowls of rice. One of my friends and I decided to each order a bowl of rice and two skewers. It was definitely a nice sized portion and we each enjoyed it. We had the salmon skewers.   If you're struggling with the menu, that is definitely a good choice.  It's worth trying if you are craving pure protein.  The ambiance wasn't anything special and the menu could definitely be updated to look more appetizing. I think it would help their business. :)"}
{"text":"Alternative to the izakayas with a Korean flare! Nice intimate place on Baldwin St. perfect for an after work drink/snack or a tasty lunch! Tried the pork belly, chicken gizzards and Hokkaido scallop skewers. The pork belly and scallops were pretty good to me. Unfortunately they were out of the pork neck and black cod skewer that we wanted. Also had the salmon tartare in wasabi mayo. The salmon was fresh and the hint of wasabi in the mayo was a good kick in the dish. The fried shrimp with kimchi mayo was nice and crispy. I love anything with mayo and the kimchi flavour sets it apart from the usual Izakaya. I also tried the takoyaki also served w kimchi mayo. I was a little disappointed since I had expected okonomiyaki sauce with bonito flakes but it just came bare and was smaller than I had expected. But the taste was good and it had a small piece of octopus inside. Since they didn't have the skewers that we had wanted, we decided to try the tsukune burger skewer which was ground chicken with cheese. Was kinna disappointed because of the price and it was a chefs recommended dish. The chicken was dry and lacked flavour and the cheese was this unnaturally bright orange piece inside the \"burger\" and it had a hard texture. I've never had cheese like this, considering it was hot I had expected it to be melted so I wasn't sure if there was anything else (additives) in it.   Overall, they had good snacks that will go well w drinks. They also had many korean dishes like duk bok ki, bibimbap and ramen. Since they are called Yakitori Bar I think they should have more stock in their yakitori ingredients (it was still early in the evening). Also the parking situation is not great, parking garages are pretty expensive and street parking is hard to find. Mainly for people working or living in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good service, cool atmosphere, too bad there are so many 'buts' to follow! We were the first ones at the restaurant on a Friday night, and found to our chagrin that they were out of at least two of the items we wanted - the jap chae and alligator. The squash with the rice cake and cheese was OK, though from the reviews I think my expectations were a bit too high. The chicken gizzard and pork belly skewers we ordered were still raw in the middle.  I think this restaurant will do well due to the marketing hype, the genuine care that you can sense from the people working there and the fact that yakatoris are so hot right now."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a while. So when my friend suggested that we go here for dinner I was happy.   Food 2.5/5 I tried the Albacore Tuna dish. The tuna was nicely seared, and I liked the sauce and salad that accompanied the dish. I really enjoyed the Takoyaki dish. It was fried nicely and served hot. It's a good way to start the meal. I also ordered the slow cooked pork belly. The pork was too fatty for me.  The fattiness of the pork overpowered the pork meat. I also had the kimichi poutine. I didn't enjoy this dish. The fries reminded me of over fried McDonald's fries; they were super crunchy and greasy. The pulled pork and kimichi topping was good, but fries brought the dish down. I also sampled the Chap Jae. This dish was tasty. It's a bit different from the traditional Korean Chap Jae.   Service 3/5.  The service was ok. Our waitress was okay, but she could have been more attentive.   Décor/Mood 2.5/5  The colour scheme was black and red. There wasn't any one thing that popped out to me. It was pretty quiet for a Saturday evening. Not sure if it was because of the holidays. The place is bigger than I expected with lots of seating."}
{"text":"Sleek modern decor. Ok food, over priced for what you get. Service can be slow during lunch time. Yakitori was ok, too much glaze and sauce. Nothing like what you can get in japan."}
{"text":"Korean food is making a comeback with restaurants like OddSeoul, Yakitori Bar + Seoul Food Co. popping up in 2012, expect more from this reborn food trend.  The decor at Yakitori Bar is not dissimilar to the harem of izakayas you find in Toronto.  Wood, wood, and more wood.    For those of you who don't know Yakitori = food on a stick, think Asian equivalent of a kebab.    The restaurant itself has a large communal table, a few smaller tables (4-6) and cozier ones for 2 near the front.  For me, the interest in this restaurant lies in the menu items done by guest chefs (Matt Basile of Fidel Gastro, Francisco Alejandri of Agave y Aguacate).  While the starting point is Korean cuisine, the path leads in all sorts of delicious directions.  Take for example the Gochu Rellenos, deep-fried korean peppers stuffed with pork and encrusted in Panko - Mexican + Korean?  I'm all for it!  The Kimchi Poutine here I daresay rivals the one over at Banh Mi Boys as this one has actual cheese curds and a rich and thick gravy.  A true poutine with some fermented goodness.  Those who want to go all out can add pork bits for $2 more.  The Bulgogi Cheeseburger was also a winner for me, even if it was a bit messy to eat as the burger falls apart with each bite like a sheet of phyllo pastry.  The meat is caramelized and sliced very thin.    The actual yakitori wasn't bad, though I wish the pork belly was more fatty and melt-in-your-mouth.  The beef tongue was extremely tender and flavourful and the short ribs were delish!  One of the more disappointing dishes for me was the Squash Duk Bok Ki, spicy rice noodles served on acorn squash.  The squash didn't do anything but serve as a presentation vessel and I would've been just as content if you had just served me the rice noodles solo.    Their lunch menu is slightly different and much more compact.  The name of the game is combos here.  I had the Panko Cod Burger which featured an egg salad in place of mayonnaise that was a great sub as it added texture but maintained the creaminess of mayo.  However, I urge you to stay away from the Japanese Beef Curry which to me tasted quite artificial and while I love my curries, this one was so overpowering that it was the only thing you could taste.  Overall a great place to go with a group to sample a variety of dishes while washing back some drinks.  I'm interested in checking out sister company Seoul Food Co. (just behind via a separate entrance) whose specialty is bibimbap."}
{"text":"My friend and I came around 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday night.   Very clean, great service and free wi-fi!  We ordered slow cooked pork skewer, scallop with bacon skewer, beef tongue skewer, baby bibimbap, squash tteokbokki, Korean chili rellenos, pork kakuni and bulgogi sandwich.   Slow cooked pork skewer: melts in your mouth- grilled to perfection, comes with 3 different sauce but you don't really need it.   Scallop with bacon skewer: yummy, scallop was cooked perfectly.   Beef tongue: was my first time trying any kind of tongue. Was served with lemon wedges and beef tongue was sliced very thin. Tasty but a bit salty for my taste.   Baby bibimbap: big enough to share. Not a typical bibimbap. Ton of fresh veggies (julienned carrots, chinese broccoli, bokchoy and a fried egg on top) served on a bed of brown rice. You will get recommended daily servings of veggies.   Squash tteokbokki: one of the last dishes to arrive b/c of cooking time. Rice cake and fish cake gets cooked inside the squash and the server will cut the top off and cut it in half for you on the table. It was divine!   Korean chilli rellenos: super spicy but was stuffed with the right amount of meat. I dipped mine in pork kakuni sauce to neutralize my tongue.   Pork kakuni: fatty chunks of pork belly with half boiled egg in abundant apple-soya sauce. Can't go wrong with this dish.  Bulgogi sandwich: we were stuffed so boxed it to go. I had it for lunch the next day and it was delicious!  Bulgogi was marinated perfectly and crunchiness from kimchi and cucumbers added nice texture.  Can't wait to go back soon.  Tip: get slow cooked pork skewer, squash tteokbokki and bulgogi sandwich"}
{"text":"First time here and was not a disappointment.  Think I found good summer of 2013 drink too in the \"Gangnam Style\". Great location and ambiance inside. Service was attentive but not obtrusive.  Some foods I found to be a little on the salty side but most were absolutely delicious and the flavours were definitely not lacking! Tuesday promo of half price poutine and wings and $10 Megamugs of Sapporo to boot!"}
{"text":"2 words. Kimchi poutine.  Service is a little bit slow, but very friendly.  Actual yakitori skewers have been hit and miss- it was my least favourite part the first time around.  Sandwiches are delicious.  But seriously...   kimchi poutine.    Horrible music/music videos though.  And always on repeat.  You cannot escape them!"}
{"text":"Just visited here on a Monday night for a drink-turned-into-two-pitchers with a buddy.   Had the pork belly yakitori and the squash ddukboki with our drinks. Thought the pork belly was great - hot and crispy, just like how I would make it at home. The squash ddukboki was definitely a fusion dish - thought it was tasty and interesting but it was a bit difficult to eat.   Agree that the service was good and staff was friendly. Sang, the owner, also took time himself to show us around the restaurant, talk about his inspirations and give hints of his plans for the back of the restaurant.   As the whole world knows, this place was originally to be a Wild Wing. I am glad we're seeing Yakitori Bar in the space instead. The area, to me, is an eclectic mix of ethnic foods and diversity and this restaurant only helps to add to it.   Definitely will check back again once the full menu is available."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go back because food wasn't awesome :( great service, very clean, extremely polite. If it wasn't half price Wednesday skewer nights, I would have been really upset with the bill. Came to $65 taxes tip, items below and 2 sapporos.  Kimchee poutine: perfectly marinated beef an gravy with kimchee. This is the only thing I loved and truly enjoyed on the palette. Scalop skewer: meh. Tasted black pepper more than the scallop. Tuna tartare: tasteless. Not sure how it was so bland even with the marinade! Chicken thigh skewer:dipped in sriracha sauce. Nothing creative. Lamb chops skewer: no flavor, perfectly grilled and tender though."}
{"text":"MEGA MUG!!!!  Huge fan of their mega mugs. One big mug of beer for a great price any day. One of the best beer deals in the city.  Also had their Kimchi Poutine with pork,, loved it, a little spicy but great"}
{"text":"If you don't like meat then this restaurant may not be for you. I enjoyed the alligator skewers and other meat kabobs but there is not many veggie heavy foods here. The best thing on the menu is the bulgogi burger, its PERFECT. Will be back for that dish alone.  This place can get really cramped for a large group of people so book ahead. Also be prepared for kpop madness on their TVs!"}
{"text":"Tried the lunch combo. Butternut squash soup was the highlight. Great side salad and good salmon yakitori.  Service was fast and efficient. Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of about seven people for dinner to try something new - Yakitori!   The restaurant is fairly small with a bar taking up about one half of the space. It's a dimly lit interior with a bit of a rustic Asian feel.   The menu is quite extensive including bibimbap, side dishes, and grilled dishes with some unique offerings. I decided to play it fairly safe and I ordered the following items:  1) Black Tiger Shrimp Grill - this came with four decently sized pieces of shrimp that were cooked well, but were not particularly flavourful and weren't  too special  2) Vegetable Jap Chae - this is a dish of sweet potato noodles and vegetables. I didn't like it very much. I found it to be pretty oily and flavourless. It also didn't come with many vegetables and was mainly just slivers of onions with a few pieces of peppers and a few pieces of mushrooms. I wouldn't get it again.  Others ordered the vegetable skewers which looked good. I found it interesting that they came with pieces of corn on the cob. Some of the other meat pieces that my friends ordered looked a little sparse. For example, the chicken skewers didn't look like they came with much meat on them.  Service was sufficient, although we all noted that they could have been better at refilling our drinks. It was also a bit frustrating how there were sometimes significant time lags between when different people got their dishes (which may be just a feature of dining at a yakitori style restaurant), meaning that some people had finished their meals while others were just starting on theirs.  Ultimately we had a fun evening and my friends commented that they would return, but we wouldn't rush back, and I would not consider it a group favourite."}
{"text":"Servings are a bit small, but go on certain days and the specials will make up for it.   Of note, the Sapporo mega mug, the kimchi poutine, and the wings, which may just be the best in the city. Seriously."}
{"text":"Okay - I have to admit. the Service is impeccable here.  I came here with my friends for our Christmas dinner last year, and we had SO much food. Like, a ridiculous amount. We had about 12 people, and we had split up the tables into three different \"sets\" (since one \"set\" of my friends were vegetarian and all).  My table had ordered a variety of different things (which I don't really recall thoroughly since I didn't take pictures this time).  However, this is what I can recall: 1) BULGOGI CHEESEBURGER: Big, but a tiny bit underwhelming. However, I did hear from my other friends that the kalbi philly cheesesteak was amazing. 2) SPICY CHICKEN WINGS: Pretty good. 3) GOCHU RELLENOS: It was good, but not amazing. 4) KIMCHI POUTINE (update): They had totally upped their game this time. It was SOOOO much better than the first time I had them, I was quite impressed.  I'm sure there were other things, but I actually dont' remember which skewers we had. They were definitely good though.  What really made my night was the service. We had a few things that didn't arrive yet, and Sang (the owner) being awesome as he is, gave us a few plates of food on the house. We were awfully full by then, but we were sooooo grateful and happy that he gave us extra food (I mean, we're Asian after all). I really appreciated this amazing gesture.  In total, with all the plates of food that we had (... we had A LOT), plus the alcohol, etc. etc. (and 25% off due to a previous coupon), it came to about $20 between all of us. I would have to admit, that was a hella damn good meal."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a reservation for 4 but it was quiet in there.  Since Yakitori is the latest trend in Toronto, with the owners of Kinton ramen opened a new one, decided to check out this spot on Baldwin-knowing it's more Korean style. We ordered the kimchi Poutine-yummy and creative, the premium Yakitori platter:   Angus beef, chicken, shiitake mushroom, scallops etc-not bad overall but don't recall much about them. We also had the chicken skin-which was great. The drinks special is a great deal. Good value for money I would say, service was slow and the food came slow too.  Be patience.   Plus two TV screens, the decor reminded me of modern Asian bar more than an izakaya."}
{"text":"Instead of going anywhere fancy for my birthday this year, I was really just craving some comfort food with variety and creativity.  It was this past Saturday, and they only take reservations after 9pm.  It was packed when we went in, but no line.  The owner managed to squeeze the two of us in at the bar.  Even snuggled in the corner right at Baldwin and McCaul, it's a great location for this little place!  The decor is a split between Guu and Kinton, but much... cozier.  The big PLUS, is the two plasma TVs they have on the walls.  I heard they usually play Kpop repeats, but that night they were playing the football game (Go Vikings)!  Lined up behind the bar are 3 flavours of mixers for your choosing, ready to be mixed with 3 oz of soju.  They also have different soju cocktails, beers on tap, and several wines on the menu, all fairly priced.  I opted for a boring glass of pear juice from the carton.  Really, I wish I wasn't so hungover from the night before 'cause it definitely suppressed my usual appetite to get EVERYTHING on the menu.  Instead. we got...  Kimchi Poutine: $5.95 (4/5 stars) So for those who know me, or at least read my reviews, you'd know I would have to get this! I mean, it's a POUTINE!  My date and I are not usually a fan of kimchi, but this was really good, with actual cheese and gravy.  Too bad they weren't actual curds, and definitely NOT ENOUGH CHEESE!!! (I think I've said that in EVERY ONE of my reviews by now).  Kimchi 3 Ways: $4.95 (2/5 stars) This is not the same dish as the kimchi flights.  This is a trio consisting of ssam- 2 mini packages of pork wrapped in cabbage leaves, 2 mini takoyaki balls, and a mini dish of kimchi over a little bit of cold tofu.  It was ok, not really worth it.  Panko Cod: $9.95 (1/5 stars) Biggest disappointment of the night.  I really wanted to get the Bulgogi burger or the Kalbi philly cheese, but being a sucker for fried fish really screwed me over this time.  Cod filets fried probably ahead of time so that it was cold, dried, and NOT crispy, over a light smear of egg salad (yum), sandwiched between 2 slices of boring white bread that was barely even toasted. Shootballs!!! Consider yourselves warned.  Grilled Beef Tongue: $5.95 (4/5 stars) I LOVE tongue!! Oohhh yyeeaaaa!! Pretty good portion too! Some places braise it to its max tenderness, they grill it here.  Still super tender with thicker pieces.  On it's own it's bland, but I guess that's why it was served with 3 dipping sauces.  Squash Duk Bok Ki: $5.95 (5/5 stars) By far my favourite here! Novelty, taste, spice, rice cakes, CHEESE... This one WINS! Baked with oozey cheese inside a squash, cut and served tableside. The only thing that MIGHT make it better... maybe, just MAYBE if it was bacon-wrapped, then deep-fried, then drenched with gravy... am I the only one in another world?!  PEI Mussels: $5.95 (4/5 stars) Cooked perfectly, a small portion of mussels in a gochujang sauce (although it tastes very similar to a red curry broth). Simple pleasure.  Service: (3/5 stars) Very pleasant and knowledgeable servers.  However, the food does take quite a long time.  The server although very nice and all, did forget a few simple things such as water, side plates, etc.    All that for two people only came up to just under $60!! I really wanted to try a couple yakitori and the chowder, but they ran out!  So of course I have to come back... also for the bouillabaise, the pork kakune, the gochu rellenos, the burger, the kalbi philly cheese!! Oh, and next time, I'll definitely booze it up!  Anyone??"}
{"text":"Very great atmosphere. It does the munchies bar food very well, it's quite fun to try the fusion concoctions (the kimchi dumplings were awesome). I'd avoid the kimchi wings and grilled wings however. Kimchi wings was sickly sweet with too much batter on the wings, the latter was just charred and salty."}
{"text":"What makes Yakitori Bar stand out is its warm atmosphere and genuine vibe.  Immediately upon arrival, the owner of the restaurant introduced himself to us and brought us into the back area of the full restaurant where we were offered free edamame.  I have to say that I was immediately sold!  The owner was friendly, well-spoken, passionate and very professional.  The edamame was perfectly cooked, salted and had a zing of lime.  Yakitori Bar has a tapas style menu that was perfect for sharing with a small group.  The menu had many different and interesting dishes, which is great for the adventurous foodie.  I also want to make a point to say that there were no raw items on their menu, which makes it a good restaurant for people who are squeamish about eating raw fish.  The items that I was most excited to try on the menu were the grilled alligator, kimchi flight (1 day old, 2 week old, 3 month old), and the squash duk bok ki.  I have to say that the squash duk bok ki is a must-have.  It is a baked squash with spicy rice cakes and cheese inside, yum!  This place has a liquor license and a variety of bottled and draft beer.  I had this soju, cucumber and sprite mix that was really refreshing.  Interesting fact, the owner opened this place in 31 days and blogged about it every step of the way on the restaurant website."}
{"text":"Maybe Tapas isn't my thing? I don't eat meat, so the choices here are pretty limited. I usually enjoy Korean side dishes though, so I wanted to try this place out. I enjoyed the baby bibimbap and the Kimchi (1 day old, 2 week old, 3 month old). The drink I had was the Jubilee which was also really good! The food is okay, but the service is exceptional. Both were quite filling. Still I think for tapas, this place is sort of pricey. The atmosphere is quite relaxes and casual, and the owner is super nice. The food: nothing to rave about. There's Kpop playing on the TV is a source of amusement, but is a little too loud."}
{"text":"We mistakenly went into this restaurant while looking for manpuku.  Anyways we decided to give this a try since we were hungry.  The decor was nice, inside looked very new.  Given its name, we decided to try the vegetarian yakitori.  Well it didn't live up to the expectation.  The veggie were burnt on the outside and still raw on the inside, dry and awful.  Portion size was tiny, and for a few pieces of burnt veggie it was super expensive.  Not a place I would ever recommend.  I would give this zero star if allowed."}
{"text":"I've only been to this place once so I won't be too aggressive with my opinion, but my first impression is really good.  Dishes are small and seem to be intended for sharing. You can order a sandwich for yourself to eat if you don't want to share, but it won't fill you up. From what little I've eaten (I had the bulgogi cheeseburger and the deep fried peppers with pork inside), I like it a lot.  Beer selection is not really that big but they have the Granville Island Winter Ale that I really wanted to try (I swear to god I can taste chocolate or something in there) so... I approve. They have a lot of cocktails and stuff that you can order, but I haven't had the chance to try them.  Service seemed a little clumsy/awkward and the waitress messed up one of the orders (I don't think she was too familiar with the menu, but that's understandable since the place opened not too long ago), but they fixed it up really quickly (like... the right dish came back out within 3 minutes) so it was all good."}
{"text":"Nice corner location, you really can't miss. Great interior decorating and ambiance. Waitress was really a sweetheart.   We were looking for a late dinner around 10:30pm and you fellow Yelpers sent us there! We had no idea we didn't have access to the full menu after 10 but that was alright because the half price grill, wings, and poutines made up for that.  Since it was half price wings, we decided to try an order of each flavor including Kimchi Honey, Sesame Garlic, and Teriyaki. We couldn't get enough of the Kimchi Honey. The other two flavors were barely touched because of this amazing creation. Delicious.  Kimchi pulled pork poutine. I have no words to describe how addicting it was!   I'm used to eating Americanized Asian dishes but this one actually had me at hello.  We ended up taking two more orders of the Kimchi Honey wings to go! Yay for a happy tummy!  Definitely wished we could've tried other things on the menu too though :("}
{"text":"As part of my baby friendly hunt for babyandlife.com we ventured out to Yakitori. The space is narrow but well decorated with a woodsy, cabin feel and while the path was narrow, we were warmly welcomed and our stroller was dealt with with no hassle to us. They do have one highchair but be sure to reserve it if you need it. We were fine using our My Little Seat, so it was no issue for us. The Little Monkey, my brother and I were the first to arrive and we started off with some drinks to get us warmed up while we waited for the hubs and my mom who were to join us after their movie date. The Sake and Soju infused cocktail list caught our eyes and we started out with  Jubilee (sake, gin, muddles berries & orange frizzante) and Samurye (sake, rye, black walnut bitters & maple syrup). Both were very well made, innovative and highlighted the key ingredients really well, the Samurye was my favourite!  The servers and Sang were super friendly and humoured the Little Monkey. There isn't much room to walk about but luckily for us, we had the corner table which had some room on the side, near the Tv  (with K-POP,yes including Gangnam Style, on repeat). This meant that she was able to take a quick stroll every now and then without being in everyone's way. Ofcourse on occasion she wandered towards the bar and not one person shot us a dirty look. You wouldn't expect to see families in a bar-resto but there were quite a few, and Sang encourages families to come out and enjoy his culinary offerings.  We did our best to try out at least half  of the menu and needless to say, we were well fed by the end of the evening (luckily for us, we had a 15 minute walk home to help burn off some calories!). My mom's a vegetarian so it was great to see veggie friendly items on the menu and we didn't feel too guilty stuffing ourselves with the pork belly. Top it off with the fact that Yakitori has freshly squeezed OJ.. my mom was well pleased! Veggie highlights included the Squash Duk Bok Ki (inspired by Sang's travels and love for street food. I loved the rice noodles, as did the Little Monkey), Baby Bibimpap and Flights of Kimichi (love this idea!). Good old meaty and seafood highlights included the Seafood Miso Soup (very close to the one at Ki), Alabama Yakitori, Dragon's Piri Piri and Kalbi Philly  Cheesesteak.  All said and done, if you're looking for a relaxing , friendly neighbourhood joint to enjoy some great conversations, fantastic food and delicious cocktails, look no further. I love the 'everyone's family' vibe that Yakitori exudes and may have finally found the perfect hangout when we have friends in town looking for a \"classy watering hole\"! I can't wait to try out the other half of the menu very soon."}
{"text":"This is what it is all about. Great food, a relaxing and upbeat atmosphere, excellent service, and most importantly great company.  Here are several of my great friends who accompany me to restaurants around the city. Eating would not be the same without them. After all, good company makes a meal taste that much better. On this particular evening every one of my friends looked content and excited about the food that kept coming out of the kitchen. It warms my heart to see that the people who I care about dearly, laughing and cracking jokes together while passing around food to each other. This is what it is all about.  Moments like this you cherish forever and Yakitori Bar had all the necessary elements to make this moment an unforgettable one. Thank you."}
{"text":"I love this little Baldwin gem!   Beautiful patio, check! Extensive menu, check! This is the perfect spot for lunch!   They have skewers, salads, sandwiches and my favourite, the raw bowls! Raw salmon or tuna on a giant bowl of brown rice? OK! I've been here with big groups and there is definitely something for everyone.   Just a note that I find when they get busy, the service can get a little slow. Also, there are lots of hornets on the patio in the summer. To the point that I remember it, even though I'm writing this in October. They need a hornet trap.   This is definitely my top Baldwin lunch spot."}
{"text":"Just did the Sunday $6.95 ramen  special with purchase of alcohol for dinner.  For starters, I had the Kimchi poutine.  It was okay, but I've had better.  The chasu pork butt ramen was pretty tasty and this is the first time I had absolutely zero allergic reaction to this type of dish.  Woot!!!  I actually finished it all and enjoyed it.     Our server was great!  Totally attentive and personable.  The place itself is cute too.   For the price, this was a decent meal and a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Well... it may improve with time for sure... but for now it is better to look elsewhere...  Tiny, expensive and cold/not warm-served skewers. Limited choices in addition for a yakitori bar. Not even the beef and cheese skewers! This is what I will remember for now... the place was not crowded at all, thus there is no good reason for the skewers to be served that cold, on a cold wooden plate. No reason neither for the waitress to come 5 minutes after we ordered to inform us that they were out of kimchi poutine (no one else ordered anything in the place between our arrival and ordering).   Cocktails are OK, but not flabbergasting neither, hey people! curb your enthusiasm!  Will follow reviews on yelp to decide whether or not it becomes more worthwhile to pay so much for so little food. Owner is nice but I wish he puts now more on the food and less on the TV screens with dancing hot Korean girls!"}
{"text":"I looooove Yakitori Bar! The servers are super friendly and there is a huge selection of food ranging from yakitori skewers to Korean fusion food. My boyfriend and I ordered the oxtail, kimchi poutine, kimchi flights, pork belly skewers, beef skewers and the cod sandwich... all for the reasonable price of $35. Sang Kim also came by to say hi and asked how the food was. I would come back here again...and again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Have been seeing quite a few tweets about How to Open a Restaurant in 30 days where Sang Kim (@koreanjohnsmith) blog about how he sets out on his quest to open the doors of Yakitori Bar (@YakitoriToronto) , the sit-down eatery and Seoul Food, the fast food take out area in 30 days.  It sounded like an unimaginable feat but Sang Kim Succeeded and opened Yakitori Bar on December 1st and officially open Seoul Food Co. Toronto's first build your own bimbimbap joint today Dec18th. I finally made my way there last Friday and was greeted by the owner Sang Kim himself who took the time to chat with us about the concept and inspiration behind the restaurant (he actually ask me if I was Korean). With Sushi making classes already available, it sounds like he's got some really great things lined up like having Korean grandmothers come in to showcase their kimchi and sake tasting.  We arrived at around 8:30pm and there wasn't any wait but within half an hour the place just fill up.   Gangham Style Cocktail $7.96 ~ Soju, Korean Yogurt & Orange Fizantte  I was really disappointed in this once since I can barely taste the soju and didn't really have any orange flavor... in fact it tasted just like what I throw together at home all the time :(  Granville Island Winter Ale $6.19 (also available for $17.69 a pitcher)  Their drink menu wasn't very extensive, wish there was more soju or sake to choose from or maybe some Korean rice wine (Makkoli)    Kimchi Flights $3.95 ~ 1 day old, 2 weeks old & 3 months old ~ The brightest color on the left being the 1 day old, it was real crisp and watery and then the 2 week flavor intensified as all the flavor got absorbed with a more complex spicy flavor that takes a few more seconds to be detected and Sang later told us that's what's use in all his other dishes on the menu with kimchi...  ~ I find the the 20 weeks old and 3 months old incredibly similar but somehow it tasted somehow a bit less spicy and a bit bitter to me.  ~ Me and Ben both voted for the 2 weeks old as our favorite     Pork Kakune $5.95 ~ slow-simmered in apple-soya ~ This was just melt in your mouth good    Squash duk bok ki $5.95 ~ spicy rice cakes baked in a butternut squash  ~ As soon as I mention about coming here for dinner, a few people immediately told me about this must try dish so it was the first thing I looked for on the menu. ~ This smell so good as it arrive and it was cut at the table for us, it was just an incredible sight just looking all the string of cheese inside. ~ The 2 of us finish this in no time and we both agree that it was the most memorable /favorite dish of the night. It was incredibly filling thou and I was surprise that it's under $6 where most other places would easily charge you $12-13 for this.  Gochu Rellenos $4.25 ~ deep fried Korean peppers stuffed with pork ~ A twist to the mexican version, this was very tasty with a very thin crispy batter  but it wasn't spicy at all.    Yakitori ~ 2 skewers per serving served w/ 3 kinds of sauce (kimchi sauce / soy sauce / sesame sauce)  Slow Cooked Pork Skewers $4.95 ~ This was my favorite out of the three we tried, it was just melt in your mouth fatty goodness and grilling it just give a crispy outer layer to the soft gooyee inside.    Pork Belly Skewers $4.95 ~ Although this was pork belly as well, this was  ut I find that there's really nothing special about it.  Bulgogi Cheeseburger $9.95 ~ marinated ribeye & caramelized kimchi ~ The bulgogi was very flavorful and tender but the bun was rather airy dry.... we mention it to Sang when he came over to ask how it was and he told us he was trying to find a better alternative.... and today I saw some tweet pics and it looks like they changed it so I can wait to go back and try.    Verdict : ~ I swear I must be Korean my previous life since I love my Korean food and I  Yakitori Bar ~ I find it rather affordable here compare to Izakaya ~ Love everything here and can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu especially the Kimchi Fries (will it be comparable to Banh Mi Boys') and try the items on their Chef's Selection Menu."}
