{"text":"We made our annual, hot summer trip to Kierland about a month ago.  While on vacation we always like exploring new dining opportunities.  Good News; this year we discovered The Mission in the Commons.  Bad News... it was on the final night of our visit.  Loved the space, the ambiance and the entire experience.  We always enjoy sitting at the bar to dine.  Never want to pass up a chance to meet new people and keep a close eye on the bartenders to see what's new and creative.  The food is Amazing!  Unique, flavorful and wonderfully elevated Mexican cuisine.  Of course we had the \"bar\" side guacamole followed up with the skirt steak and short rib barbacoa tacos.  We seriously savored every bite.  Neither my hubby and I are big tequila drinkers, but we both had excellent margaritas and some quality sipping anejo chased with orange slices dashed with cinnamon.  Our experience was taken to the next level by the knowledgable and sincere service that Riley and Sean at the bar provided.  They have a true passion for their craft and were able to give us honest recommendations about menu.  Hello big bosses... these are the ambassadors you want on the front lines for you!  Can't wait to get back and only hope we get to see that duo behind the bar again."}
{"text":"I have been trying to get Eliza to the The Mission for 3+ months and apparently, the stars were all in alignment, today, and what a treat it was! We had the most amazing server, named Amanda, and she truly loves her job and made the whole experience that much better! The food was outstanding and the service above par! She gave us a tour of the restaurant and a history lesson about The Mission and introduced us to several staff! My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Was recommended to me so when we had visitors come to town we tried it. The roasted corn gordita appetizer was excellent but the mahi mahi tacos were only so-so. Also $17 for a glass of Chardonnay? The restaurant itself is. Beautiful especially the bar."}
{"text":"The food, service, and environment was great! If your looking for a change of pace Margarita.. Try the Avocado Marg. It is delicious... We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, delicious food, and the BEST margarita in Scottsdale. My family came in for brunch and we are very pleased with our visit!"}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday dinner and was so glad that we decided to go to Mission. I am a vegetarian and so always hesitant but the server here was so good. I wish I remembered her name. I first ordered the corn gordita and asked her if it has any meat in it. She immediately understood abt me being a vegetarian explained all the ingredients and even suggested to order the cauliflower pibil. Just by how she described i was convinced to order the cauliflower pibil as my main dish. Loved it, felt so good eating real food and not just greens or bland pasta. The portion was good enough to take back some for a midnight craving. My husband ordered the brussel sprout taco and it was yummmy. I had some from his plate too. Had a great time, lovely people and really appreciate how they take interest in making good tasty healthy vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they opened this new location. The one in old town is wonderful and this new one is just as good with even more amazing staff. We stopped in for a drink and decided to stay for 3! The atmosphere was open and fun. They have an upstairs bar and a downstairs bar. As well as patios on both levels. When we went to the upstairs bar, we were greeted right away despite no open bar stools available and the bar staff came out from behind the bar to take our order. As soon as bar stools opened up, they pointed them out for us. The downstairs bar staff (especially Stephen) was friendly and attentive. We made reservations to come back for dinner on Friday. I'm sure it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and our waiter JJ was incredible! He was amazing at describing the dishes. My only complaint was the music was so loud we couldn't visit, which was disappointing. The decor is lovely."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar today, we were served by Brandon. He was wonderful, attentive and courteous. He made our experience amazing, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It's a good addition to the Scottsdale dining experience. However, it is over priced. Yelp shows   $$ but it's more like $$$. Regardless of the price, I will be back again."}
{"text":"Went in to just enjoy a cocktail at the bar. Every time I've been the rules have changed. They always had shared tables in the bar area but tonight they just happened to have it reserved. The upstairs bar was closed even though restaurant was packed. For two loyal locals we were treated poorly. They seemed to care more about tourist business rather than those that will support them through their slow months - Arizona summers. Thought this would be a great go to place after work (next door), but thought wrong. Very disappointed.!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great.  I am sorry that we didn't get our servers name,again he was excellent. We ordered the table side guacamole,it was fine,though I feel it was overpriced.  Our cheese plate was good though sparse.  I ordered the clam stew,however the clams were almost non-existent .   There seems to be a a theme that could with little effort be greatly improved, that being if you let the main ingredient of the dish actually appear on the plate, without doubt, I would give five stars. As an added critique the hard surfaces do not contribute to good ambience.  Turn the music down a notch."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous food. Table staff was incredibly friendly. The food was delicious. The tequila was awesome. And the cocktails were some of the best I've had. I highly recommend The Mission."}
{"text":"I had a business dinner tonight with a group of people who had never eaten at The Mission before and I assured them that they served nothing but absolutely fantastic food. I have been to The Mission in Old Town Scottsdale many times and always get the Chorizo Porchetta dish. Because I enjoy it so much I recommended a few of my guests to join me in getting it this evening. When our main course arrived and I tried to cut into my first bite I was shocked. The pork shoulder was harder than a rock and burnt to a crisp. It was dry and nothing like I have had previous to this experience. I looked at my colleagues who also ordered the Chorizo Porchetta and they too had experience an over cooked, dry, crispy pork shoulder. I felt embarrassed that I made them order a $30 dish to have it come out the way it did. I really hope the Kierland location doesn't lack the quality in the kitchen or I won't return with guests."}
{"text":"I have never wrote a review for Yelp... this warrants starting now! We are HUGE fans of Mission Old Town, how this location could be so incredibly opposite in every way truly puzzles me. Food, drinks and service are absolutely horribly. Zero quality control and consistency with their other location. After a bad first experience we decided to give it another shot last weekend. The bartender took our order and then proceeded to crouch down and hide under the bar to use her phone. We had to ask her to come out to make our drinks! Our guacamole never came and that was that... we left and never got our drinks... nothing!! Will never be back. Such a shame!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at The Mission, after we got our table.  The host staff was overwhelmed and a little slow.  The food more than made up for the wait, and the service was terrific after we were seated.  Our meal started with table side guacamole, which is outstanding, though the portion could be bigger.  The house salsa is smoky and just spicy enough to delight the entire table.  We also had the tostadas which were outstanding.   One member of our party had the swordfish entree. It was outstanding, but the portion was a little small.  We also tried the squash, short rib, and mahi-mahi tacos. Each was good, but our favorite was the squash.   Save room for the pumpkin bread pudding - a home run."}
{"text":"Terrible service but great food. The Mission in Old Town is way better for both service and ambiance! They lost all of the originality and character of the original Mission at this location. They tried to make this one hip and trendy but it was just unremarkable and generic. Exactly like any other restaurant you would find in a mall type setting. The manager at this one should be fired. There was zero customer service or organization. They seated us without menus because they were apparently out of menus...how does this happen?! The restaurant wasn't even completely full. It took about 15 minutes to get us menus! The food did not disappoint. It's too bad they don't have their act together! We will not being going back or recommending. If you do go, caveat emptor, but try the short rib tacos and the grits. Delish!"}
{"text":"Superb! Excellent service! Our waiter Jemar was phenomenal! The tableside quac was fabulous! Lovely setting! Great dinner!"}
{"text":"The food was very good....I just wish the style of the restaurant had the same intimate look and feel as the Old Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Been here a few times everything has been great! The fish dishes were all excellent, but the show stopper was definitely the filet.  The drinks and table side guacamole are also good here. Can't really go wrong with anything. Expensive, but worth the price.   We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our recent dinner at The Mission. However, it could have been much better and we left a bit frustrated. Due to aggressive upselling and pushing, we over-ordered. First, the server totally skipped the taco page when she \"walked us through\" the menu. That should have been our clue that clearly she wanted us to order drinks, appetizers and the more expensive entrees. Then, she said the tacos were so small, that we should add a forth. Maybe, if that is all you are eating. But, after chips and delicious salsa, guac and other food, the tacos were more than enough for those who ordered them. We were so full, we didn't finish the tacos and barely ate our more expensive entrees. The server realized we ordered too much and took something off the bill. I appreciate that; however, it really wasn't enough. Due to her pushing, our bill was still at least $25++ more than it should have been. Also, being so full and not able to enjoy our meal and the birthday dessert put a damper on our enjoyment. I would go back, but beware of Simone. Advice to Simone--happy diners leave better reviews and better tips. Don't work so hard to pad the bill."}
{"text":"Started out as a great holiday get together with friends.  Pepe was the waiter, was pretty friendly and helpful at first, after we ordered tacos, never checked back. .was it because we ordered tacos rather than more expensive entree? Not sure, but we were neglected after that.. It was so obvious...he really needs to improve his skills..it was pretty bad"}
{"text":"Had a delightful evening celebrating our 32nd wedding anniversary. Our server Joseph was kind, attentive and knowledgeable about all of their tequilas. As long time Valley residents we are particular about good Mexican food- this is great Mexican food and worth a fist full of dollars!"}
{"text":"I visit the restaurant on Saturday 8-2-17 with  2 other friends . We spend almost $300 in Drinks and appetizers.  Food at was good,  services great but  to our surprises it's when we ask for the bill we notices  $85 dices steak  in our check he ask why and request to speak with manager and  to my  other surprises the manager on duty Handel the situation horrible .  I been in The Valley for 11 years , Own Franchise restaurants for 16 years and  10 years as at restaurant consulting Firn . I have never witness something like this .  I hope corporate/ investor or ownership notices this   so this will not happen to any one .   It's not about $85  appetizer it's lack of Handel correctly the Situation and been professional to customers as well have the proper training to run at Restauran   I will never go back to this restaurant ."}
{"text":"I love the Mission - and would normally give them a five on all fronts - food, atmosphere and personnel/service.  I most frequently go to the old town location but met a friend at the new location in Kierland last night as she lives further north.  I still love the restaurant, however, I was very put off by the attitude I received from the host when I arrived.  Our reservation was for 6:00 and I arrived 10 minutes early.  When I checked in there were plenty of available tables, but the bar was completely packed - no chairs and people standing.  The host's response to me was, \"Perhaps a little closer to 6:00.  You're welcome to have a drink at the bar.\"  Really?"}
{"text":"We love the new Mission at Kierland.  We have always been fans of the original Mission in Old Town.  The new restaurant is very well done.  We came in for dinner on the 9th day it was open.  There was a good crowd and we let our waiter Pete know that we were in a slight hurry.  The drinks and food were amazing and the service from Pete was top notch.  Overall a great dinner spot and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot, went there for a business dinner and was instantly taken by its relaxed rustic but modern vibe.  The table side guac was unparalleled I could have feast on just that.  I ordered the Green Chile Duck Confit.  It didn't look like a big portion, but it was very filling.  The flavors and textures were very sophisticated and leaped out all over my palette.  I would simply say, there was nothing to be done to make this dish any better.  This is not a casual dining experience and the prices are what they should be for this level of quality. My cohorts had the flat iron steak and had nothing but praise for how good it was.  I would recommend this place for business, a date or to treat the wife for a special night.  We were seated upstairs which is what I recommend...downstairs seemed more if the the after hours business suits meet the Scottsdale women on the prowl kind if crowd.  Will be back often."}
{"text":"I like what they did to the former Bobby's. The restaurant has a great ambience and the food is very good as well. The guacamole appetizer at the table was prepared to order and quite good. I like their chips as they are of the thinner kind. I had there chicken taco as my main entree good but not great. However my wife's steak taco was excellent and this is what I am ordering next time. The waiter was a terrific guy with a great sense of humor. Lastly the climate in the restaurant was perfect not chilly and not warm."}
{"text":"Four years ago on a business trip to Scottsdale, my wife and I along with another couple went to The Mission in Old Scottsdale (the original location). All of us found it to be among the best meals we'd ever had.  So, four years later, the same four of us, plus four others, wanted to go again. The Old Scottsdale location was booked up, so we made a reservation at the Kierland Commons location.  The place is lovely. The decor is very nice and does a decent job of paying homage to the original location. I liked the upstairs area. Our server was excellent -- perfectly attentive, friendly, etc. All of use enjoyed our cocktails (a few beers, a variety of types of margaritas and a mojito).   Most of the food was quite good. However, it simply wasn't as good as it was the previous visit to the other location. It seemed a slightly less skillfully made version of the original. I had recalled the Almejas al Vapor as among the greatest single dishes I'd ever had and was sooo disappointed with it. Perhaps an unfairly high bar had been set in my mind, but I actually didn't even bother to finish it.  Also on the downside was the remarkably long time between drinks & appetizers and the entrees. It was, I think, unusually long.  Worst of all was the maitre d'/hostess station. We arrived early for an 8:15 reservation (the woman who took the reservation, knowing that I had hoped for an earlier time said to come early and it was \"likely\" that we could be seated before 8:15 ... no promises, no expectations). Instead, we were seated between 8:35 and 8:40. And, while I get that this type of thing happens and it's neither a big deal nor something that can necessarily be avoided, what I really didn't appreciate was the dismissive and unfriendly demeanor of the folks at the desk. One time, I asked what was up and someone was sent up to have a look. That person came back, reported to the two people at the hostess station and that was it ... a whisper, a look and no reply to me, the customer, still standing right there.   By the way, downstairs, there was an open table that would accommodate all eight of us that was never offered (and never filled, as far as I can tell).  Service? Great. Food? Good, but not great. Location/decor, etc.? Terrific. Host/hostess? Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night to celebrate a cousins birthday with a bunch of girlfriends.  It was my first time there, and the atmosphere was awesome.  It was very different and lively; I totally loved it.  We started off with some yummy drinks and some of the best guacamole I've ever had.  Our waiter was nice, a little all over the place, but nice.  He knew the menu very well, and had great recommendations.  He recommended the duck to my cousin, and this is where it goes downhill, lol.  She has the worst case of food poisoning!!!  Every symptom google has to offer, she has it.  That just totally freaks me out, hence the two stars.  Everything was  until she got home that night.  Bummer.  Hope they take care of whatever is going on in the back of the house."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Our waitress came and explained each dish to us. I recommend the sword fish and table side guacamole. Try the smoke house margarita. Take a sip, then wait...... Even the menus are awesome. There made of leather."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I sat at the bar this afternoon and were greeted by friendly staff.   We have to say, McCasey is a TREASURE and must be rewarded for his sense of humor and margarita skills!    He was beyond knowledgeable about the spirits offered and suggested some uber yummy snacks.   We were entertained the entire time.   Food was incredible, cocktails on point, service stole to show.   PS whomever designed this bar nailed it, stunning!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible way to treat locals!  We walked in, a party of three for dinner, the snotty little hostess guy asked if we have reservations? If not the patio is open (it's what 95 degrees out) or the bar or the community tables. Then he slides me the business card to make a reservation for next time...they had no more than 2 parties of 2-3 seated and the entire restaurant open. Not a good start Punkin'  We went around the corner to Zinc, seated inside, great booth, waitress super friendly, superb service.  As we walked back to our car we looked inside, not even 1/2 full, patio was 1/2 full as well, bar had 6 people.  The Mission in Old Town will be our place, not here."}
{"text":"Struggling a bit with opening at the new location.  If a totally new restaurant then it might explain running out of standard items early dinner service on Saturday night.  But with namesake down scottsdale road in Old Town, and sister restaurant Zinc virtually across the street, there really is no excuse.  The chef should be over buying during the soft opening to help get it right.  Finding out 3p minutes after ordering that you have to find something else just isn't right.  Gordon Ramsey would not approve.   I'll try again with a return visit and hope for better results."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say I loved my server Josh! He was awesome. We loved him tonight!  Thanks for the service and experience josh!"}
{"text":"Went there with a girlfriend to celebrate my birthday. We started with the tableside guacamole. It was fabulous! We both ordered the street tacos; pork and steak. Also very tasty. The server found out it was my birthday and brought out a pumpkin bread pudding. It was decadent and so delicious. Service was excellent. Very attentive, filling our glasses of water and tea. Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"My wife coaxed me into writing a review. I have agreed because our experience was that good. I travel the country for business so I have a solid baseline for dining out.  Our dinner this evening was very good. Our service was even better. I would suggest the guacamole that is mixed to order at your table. If you like a kick make sure they add the special peppers.  Our waitress was great and so was the rest of the staff. The food was fresh and the dessert was very good.   Try the fancy street corn appetizer and for the vegifan order the brusslesprout taco's."}
{"text":"Service here as always is THE GOLDEN STANDARD!  They never hurried us into ordering even though the kitchen would close soon."}
{"text":"Our Uber driver said that we absolutely had to check this place out during our stay and we are so glad we took his advice. I had a Basil Watermelon Mojito and it was to die for. Refreshingly sweet and flavorful...I could have had a few more if I was there longer. We all agreed that ordering the Table Side Guacamole was a must.  It didn't disappoint. They give you options of how spicy you want it, which is a plus. Their salsa had a great smoky flavor with just enough heat.   We all ordered tacos. The waitress told us that they were the size of street tacos and she was right. That was fine though, they were still plenty filling. Paying a few dollars more for this wonderful experience was well worth it."}
{"text":"Really loved the pork shoulder and chorizo meat dish. The pork was on the sweet savory side but fantastic. The grits are a great side as well. But my favorite were the chips and chipotle salsa. The best chips I have ever had so crispy. We also enjoyed the pumpkin bread pudding.  The Barbacoa street tacos were great"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants ever! 2 visits this week. The wait staff is so professional and helpful.  Seated outside both times. Duck empanada one of the best dishes we have ever had in a restaurant. Guacamole was superb.  Salsa was delicious.  Tacos excellent. Barbacoa  and skirt steak. Wings very good. Bean purée delicious. Blood orange margaritas heaven.  The missionary cocktail is awesome.  Can't say enough about the restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch ordered guacamole, tacos, shrimp and a cheese plate. Bill was over $100 and left hungry. Also we were almost finished with our food when our drinks finally arrived."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service made reservations here in advance before I came to town for 8:45 they must have been having a slow night and didn't feel like keeping hours so sent me a text to try to make me change my plans. When I couldn't change my plans I was then informed the kitchen would close after 15 minutes of me sitting. I own several restaurants and I am a chef also and this is awful I'll make sure everyone coming from Chicago not to waist there time I would have given it a zero if I could"}
{"text":"Great place. Cool vibe. Check out the salt block wall. Ericka was an outstanding server. Our first visit to the Mission and Ericka made some great suggestions, including some tequila. The pork tacos rocked. We are definitely coming back. When the weather improves sit outside on the 2nd floor deck."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great feel. From the moment you walk in, the beautiful architecture and decor made me love the venue. The wait staff was very friendly. That's where it stops. Our drinks took forever to get. Our dinner entrees were very pricey for the amount of food. The food descriptions were over the top and then very disappointing. There were tiny drops and smears of what we thought would be a side dish on the plate. In other words, be sure to order a side or starter or you might leave hungry. The second round of drinks took over 20 minutes to receive. The small piece of salmon was very good, however, my husbands filet was cold and contained 2-3 little slices of meat and a few smears of something we couldn't recognize. Did like the fact that we weren't rushed and the restaurant wasn't too noisy. All in all, nice place but too expensive for the small plates of food."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of The Mission in old town and I'm ecstatic that it's now located in North Scottsdale.  We had no idea they were opening a second location and we saw it listed on Yelp last night so immediately walked over to give it a try.  We tried to call for a reservation but couldn't get a phone number so we just sat at the bar.  The interior is beautiful and they were well staffed for a new place.  The staff was trained at their other location which made the service solid.  The menu is the same as the other location.  We shared the Tostada appetizer which was amazing.  I strongly recommend that appetizer.  I had the tortilla soup for my meal and my boyfriend had the skirt steak tacos.  Both were delicious.  I can't wait to go back.  I am so happy they opened this second location so close to my house."}
{"text":"Same great menu in a beautiful new location.  Great view of the sunset from both levels of the patio.  Still the best table side quac in Phoenix.  The mini tacos are small in size but big in flavor."}
{"text":"We were skeptical after reading these reviews, but had a great experience with drinks and appetizers at upstairs bar at 6pm on a Saturday. Skewers were fantastic and drinks were very good. (Not amazing but good enough.) Decor is a bit bland but it's a nice place. Maybe bar service is better than at tables. We'll try again."}
{"text":"I love the food and the vibe at this place!! Definitely order the roasted corn gorditas. The table side guacamole. The salsa they bring is incredible."}
{"text":"Well. Our experience is because of Steven - the fabulous, entertaining, fun bartender!  However, besides the great  service - The Mission offers a really interesting atmosphere, yummy food -(get the street tacos!! ). Great decor. Music. And environment.  Super happy they opened in Kierland.  But Steven - who has the best personality - made our night for sure!"}
{"text":"Hey there friends if your looking for a great atmosphere and great tasting food then this is the place for you ! I highly suggest sitting upstairs outside to capture the spectacular sunset paired with cocktails .  We sampled multiple appetizers , the duck was my favorite . Service was dead on and prices were affordable . If go let me know . Enjoy my friends"}
{"text":"My turn to pick a place for birthday celebration and I want a do over. It took a while to get service and then slow service after that. I asked for a Diet Coke and had to ask couple of other times. Refill never came. Some of the food was very salty - guacamole , grits, corn.  I had the skirt steak street tacos and they were very good and plentiful.  On a Wednesday night it was very loud - so much we couldn't hear each other talk (group of 6) and the music was loud which didn't help the atmosphere. Disappointing evening. Best service received was from an African American woman who went out of her way to help us. Smile exuded warmth!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican / Spanish food so my girlies thought this would be the perfect place for my birthday. We started with the guacamole, corn, and pork belly. After waiting 30 minutes they brought the guacamole. Once the guacamole was finished they brought the other two appetizers. We ordered three different tacos and the grouper. All the food was amazing. You could not go wrong with anything ordered. The guac was especially delish!  The drinks on the other hand were less than exciting. I ordered a mojito and had to stir/ muddle it myself.  My friends ordered the Caipirinha. The first time it came out it was all tequila. They sent it back and requested it be remade. The second  round was brought out and we were told it was made by the owner. It was one of the best  Caipirinhas.  Another round was requested and it was back to all tequila. We were told by the manager our drinks would be taken care of, but they weren't. The second round of mojito's tasted like all juice. No liquor.  Bottom line-They need to work on their slow service and their bartenders. Otherwise the food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"We came here for our lunch break on a Wednesday. Mainly came for the amazing guacamole and chips but ended up leaving without it. Waited 45 minutes before the gentleman came up to us to prepare our guacamole table side, at that time we had to return to work. Pretty disappointing because it wasn't even busy :( The hot tea was good and the vibe was nice."}
{"text":"Never received dinner! Never going to return! We had a reservation and were promptly seated at 5:45.  At 6:10 we interrupted a passing employee and asked if he could find the waiter assigned our  table. At 6:20 we receive drinks and ordered dinner. 6:40 (nearly an hour after seating) two of the three dinners come but the third was  \"put in\" incorrectly \"will be out immediately\". 6:55 the third dinner arrives and we send it back as rest of the party are nearly done eating.  Here comes the manager, wants to \"buy a round\". No thank you! Never again! Promptly served elsewhere in Kierland. We are told EVERYONE is reporting the same experience."}
{"text":"The Mission is a gourmet restaurant dressed up as a bar. Loud and dark, I had my doubts about it. Little did I know that I was in for a very big treat.       The first thing I noticed about The Mission is that it is alarmingly dark inside. I saw many people using their phones and candles just to read the menu. The second thing is that it had a very casual bar type aura. I expected to have bar type food, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the menu. The Mission has Latin inspired cuisine and is actually extremely delicious and upscale.       We started the meal with a Duck Empanada. The filling was creamy and delicious. It could definitely get by with less filling though, while we were eating it, the goodies were spilling everywhere. We also had a Pork Belly lettuce wrap, which deserved a standing ovation. The Pork Belly was fantastic, well cooked and not grisly.        For the entree I had the Salmon. The salmon was really something else. It was tender and flaky- but not mushy. My one complaint is that it would have been better served with something more substantial than salsa. The flavor, though, was a ten.        For sides we had the Poblano grits which were very spicy and a little too corn-y tasting (funny to say, but it's true.) We also had the White Bean purée which I could not stop eating.       We finished the meal with Espresso churros with a milkshake. It was so extremely delicious that I was smiling from ear to ear.       From what I could see, the plating was very nice. All in all, I think the food was an 11/10, but the restaurant presented itself in a way that tainted my opinion of it. If they just turned up the lights and tidied the restaurant a bit I would give it five stars. For a restaurant with food of this pedigree, I would like to see a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Margarita with no tequila in it (no joke).  Hot entrees served cold.  Waiting 30 minutes+ for appetizers.  Broken heat lamps.  $14 guacamole that serves 2.  +Not a staff member over the age of 21 _________________________ = Sellout of a great downtown restaurant. RIP Mission. Your move North wasn't so smart. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing! I'd heard it was Mexican food. It's not, so don't be expecting green chile burritos! The food is Peruvian/South American inspired. Also, the food is very flavorful, but modest proportions. I recommend ordering a starter or two.   Speaking of starters...I had the Pork Belly Pibil. WOW! Absolutely fabulous. It was crispy and flavorful. And don't get me started on the table side guac...best I've ever had! For the main course, I had the chicken tacos, which were almost a wing-style flavor. The tacos are street taco sized so be forewarned. Very satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner at the beautiful Mission. Sarah was a fantastic server, recommend her if you can request. We had the alemejas soup, grouper, chorizo porchetta and salmon. All phenomenal. Also the blood orange margarita was great. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Erica our waitress was awesome. Super service and great food.  The atmosphere was the best part.  They really put a lot of thought into the lighting, music, and ambience.  Don't skip the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place and beautiful experience! The staff was very helpful and nice. They truly make the full experience worthwhile, especially for the price you will end up paying. The food was seasoned great and our waitress was the best. If you drink, the bar is nice with their pouring! This location is sooooooooooo much better than the Old Town location. Plus, the area where this is located has a lot of places to shop at if you have to wait for a table. Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and service in a cool atmosphere. Maybe not as fun as the original but the food is just as good."}
{"text":"Rude waiter when we didn't order the priciest items on the menu. Small portions, pricey drinks, but a beautiful facility, especially the main bar. Trendy, hip place to be seen."}
{"text":"What?? I don't understand all these less that wonderful reviews. I've been to the one in old town a few times and it's great. A bit too dark but it's worth a visit (or 10). Kierland is very different. It's large, two stories, very open. We were seated with our guests right on time, service was perfect from start to finish. We ordered the fancy organic low sugar margarita (delish) and the tableside quac. So good... I almost wanted to cancel my dinner order. I think we went through 3 baskets of warm salty chips. I had fish tacos, hubby had he sword fish special, our guests both had the classic pork shoulder stuffed with chorizo (I think). The pork was AMAZING. I really can't imagine what there is to complain about. Too good? Ignore the bad comments and def give this place a try. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation 2 weeks ahead of time.  Showed up and was told the only seats available are outside on their patio.  The patio overlooks the parking lot, has no misters, and it's 105 degrees out.  Ummm ... no thanks.  I guess making a reservation is pointless."}
{"text":"overall mind blowing experience from start to finish. table of four split a little bit of everything. papas and chorizo were ahit and so was the bread pudding. can't go wrong with the grits or tacos either.  margs were also fire"}
{"text":"Went to Mission Kierland on 1/24/17 and really enjoyed it.  Have been waiting for the space to open and it was worth the wait.  It's interior is better than all the other commons choices, very open room with excellent 2nd level overlooking main bar, and a 2nd bar snuck in up on 2nd level, and nice outdoor upstairs too.  Food and service were very pleasant, we received a comp side and desert as they were in their first week open and really promoting.  It should be on your next North Scotts list."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful. It gets 5 stars because the Pumpkin Bread Pudding is the single greatest thing I have ever eaten in 51 years of my life. Absolute game changer a must must try!!!!"}
{"text":"When I go to a bar to have a drink I do not want to witness an employee  soap opera behind the bar. I want to interact with happy joyful people who are at least pretending to be happy to be there and happy to bring me my drink.   We had drinks and dinner there about a month ago when visiting friends.  Our drinks were good, not great. Our food was good, not great.  What we experienced while at the bar really turned us off.  The woman serving us had notably heavy eye make-up. She was pleasant to us when she took our order but then as the next half an hour progressed she became agitated, frustrated and acted patronizing towards the employees who came behind the bar.  One employee was clearly shaken and disturbed. She was visually fumbling and had a worried look each time she came behind the bar. Another employee was clearly angry about what had been said to her.  Our bartender didn't hide her attitude from us either. It was very distracting and off putting.  We went there to have a good time with friends, not watch people get upset because they were treated poorly."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  No matter what people say this is an excellent experience restaurant.  The margaritas are well made.  The food is excellent, I had the duck confit which was terrific,  Expensive YES, Beautiful people watching YES, WAIT staff excellent.  Bottom line 5* restaurant."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed with The Mission. We had a 7:30 reservation and the noise level was beyond our tolerance level. We were in the upstairs section and I don't believe they have a bar upstairs so all drinks came from downstairs.  I ordered a dirty martini that was not very dirty! The menu was not exciting to us. We were looking for a lite bite but they don't offer the tortes at night. So we decided to leave and the server gave us our check which was $66.00 for 4 drinks. I was shocked when my friend told me my yukky  undirty martini was $25! .... the highest I've ever paid!  Glad we didn't stay any longer.  And we won't be going back."}
{"text":"While their food and restaurant service is great, they are not convenient for carry out. Going into the restaurant to place the order is counterproductive and disappointing so that's why they're getting 3 stars from me. Dine in for a great experience, go elsewhere for carry out."}
{"text":"Great food, but the service and management made for a sour memory. Very disappointing!  The unprofessionalism of the restaurant manager was astounding. Our entire table witnessed him ignore and then snatch the receipt out of someone's hand when the bill was wrong. I believe he's the reason the staff is poorly trained.  I would stick to The Mission in Old Town if you want great service and great food."}
{"text":"My Family and I come here all the time during holidays. Big parties, usually 10 ppl or more. And they always do an excellent job. Great service, the tacos are excellent, brunch is very good. I recommend the chicken and waffles. Don't forget the Margaritas. The Primarita is on point. Highly recommend. Cantenn, our waiter, did an excellent job and he made sure that we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by what sounded like a southwest/Mexican style charcuterie plate on the menu.  We went to check it out and there were so many things on the menu that sounded good, and there were only two of us to share, we let the charcuterie go.  Definitely something I would go back and try.  We ate outside, as the weather was very comfortable.  The service was impeccable, food and drink were amazing.  Highly recommend the street corn appetizer.  This is for sure on my list of places to come back."}
{"text":"We left! The boy at the hostess stand was so unfriendly. We were sat outside and it was a bit too warm and too many fly's for us. We asked if we could be sat inside. The boy told us we would need to wait 45min to an hour. We had reservations by the way. And they had multiple tables open. So we sat down with one menu. And the hostess told us they would bring us another menu when there was another available. Not impressed with the service so we didn't wait to try the food."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Seems to cater to skinny always-starving Scottsdale girls. Went for lunch, got a snack. Ordered the tacos, got little, tiny disks of corn tortillas with just a few strips of meat. Stay away if you are hungry."}
{"text":"I had never heard of the Mission was looking for tacos the first time. I assumed it was Mexican food but the waiter politely explained the menu was Latin American with a French touch. I was apprehensive at first. But let me tell you. Best. Tacos. Ever. I started off with a pomegranate margarita. They tequila selective is amazing. The decoration behind the bar and the faux white marble on the walls makes the place feel so comfortable and relaxing. The lighting makes for an intimate experience. The table side guacamole that is made to order was a great way to start the night. The chips were warm and perfectly salted. We next ordered, skirt steak tacos, Mahi Mahi tacos and the pork shoulder tacos for two. I was scared of the pork shoulders because it said pineapple habanero glaze. It was amazing. It was spicy at all. It is a bit sweet. But not too sweet. We also ordered the papas y chorizo for a little side dish. The tastes are mouth watering. I would recommend this place time and time again. The tastes are unbelievable."}
{"text":"I went here for a weekday lunch, and I highly recommend it. The food is elegant and well prepared. I began with a steamed clam soup, which could have been a meal unto itself. Followed with a brisket sandwich, which was large and spiced perfectly. The pumpkin bread dessert is a luxury. Service was prompt and attentive. The weather was pleasant which made sitting outside a nice bonus. Will definitely repeat when visiting Scottsdale"}
{"text":"The service pretty much don't exist. We had our main course before we got our drinks. We always had to look for our server. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Once again I wish we could give half points.  The service was very quick. I think it had to do with the fact that we were a walk in and we took a table that had a 7pm reservation. When I say quick it was lightening fast. Dishes were served within minutes of being ordered and whipped away as soon as finished.   The guacamole was flavorless. I would not order that again and. The chips while super thin  and crispy were so salty.   The tortillas were so tiny that it made a knife and fork an absolute. The chicken was very tasty.  The sauce on the pork tacos was amazing.   The pork had a lot of fat    There should have been virtually no fat with the meat.   As mentioned before the sauce was very tasty"}
{"text":"We should up without a reservation and they accommodated a large group (6) without a hitch. We were warned that we only had 2 hours for us since that table was reserved for later. No problem!  The server was professional yet friendly.  The menu at his Mexican restaurant has your usual dishes (tacos) and some other ones that are not as common. Even the usual dishes have distinctive variations.  They also have a few vegetarian options. The Brussels sprout tacos were so good."}
{"text":"The Mission restaurant is a five-star hit and is my go-to for lunch or dinner whenever in Scottsdale. The modern Latin cuisine is fresh and fabulous with a fun, innovation, and unique twist. The ambience is elegant, classy, beautiful, and romantic. There is both indoor and outdoor seating.  The service was fun and professional. The salsas and tortillas are homemade. The meats are prepared on a plancha using mesquite and pecan. You can smell the smoke from the fabulous wood before you enter the restaurant. The tableside guacamole is prepared with the ingredients you like and to your desired level of hotness.  Unique ingredients such as EVO, chipotle purée, cotisa, and roasted pepitas made the guac absolutely delicious. We loved both the crispy rock shrimp and Tecate skirt steak tacos. We adored  the espresso churros with the accompanying Ibarra Mexican chocolate milkshake. There is a very nice offering of tequilas. It is hard to make a decision here...everything looks and sounds fabulous!  I cannot wait to go back!!! Reservations are recommended for lunch and dinner.  www.themissionaz.com"}
{"text":"I love the Mission in Old Town Scottsdale- but I have tried to eat at this one twice now - and it is so unbearably loud it is ridiculous. Imagine wonderful food - visually appealing atmosphere and then screaming across the table at your dinner date. It's worse than a crappy dance club. I know I sound petty- but acoustically it's a nightmare. It really ruins the experience- and while the food is good, the price point conflicts with that experience. Any kind of sound dampening they could do would probably send this place's value off the chart. Bottom line - go the other one!"}
{"text":"God I hate this place. Gave other location 4 stars if that tells you anything. Sourpuss hostess pissed at world because ... who knows why? Terrible acoustics, can't carry on a conversation in here. Mission margarita is terrible which puzzles since they're great at other locale. Leaving as fast as we can to go elsewhere even if it means driving extra 20 miles. So sad, been going to their other location since it first opened. But will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"The duck carnitas empanada is my new favorite food in the world. Our waiter, Mario, was phenomenal. He was very personable and full of great recommendations. We tried the chorizo porchetta. It was good but a bit dry so our waiter brought us a side of grilled street corn. We weren't hungry so we just agreed to taste it. Well...it is like a drug and was gone in moments. The reposado tequila flight was so smooth and the Bitter Bees was delicious. I like this location better than Old Town because there is so much more space and it's not as dark. I can't wait to try the chef's other restaurants."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The hostess was snotty and rude. I asked to be seated on the patio and she said it was all reserved. Hard to believe on a Thursday night...of course when I left 2 hours later hardly anyone was sitting outside. Food is ridiculous...I ordered a taco dish. 3 two inch taco are on an oversized plate....presentation is stupid. This restaurant doesn't cater to local folks who know and love Kierland for it's easy, accommodating outdoor eating ventures."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and sat outside enjoying the sunshine. Food was delicious and fresh and service wonderful.    I have celiac disease and our waiter was fully knowledgeable and even offered substitutions for dishes that I was interested in so that I could enjoy them.  Would recommend eating here for sure."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go to a different restaurant. This restaurant and the owner are on par with the current trend of poor customer service. News flash...your restaurant isn't that great to where you've earned that kind of an attitude.   We were there to celebrate a special occasion (not that customer service should be different from a regular dinner to a celebration). From the time we arrived  to when we left, we were shown nothing but hostility and rudeness to the point where we wish we hadn't gone there. It was very uncomfortable, unprofessional, and a huge disappointment. I don't know how this restaurant / person continues stay in business, but if this trend continues I'm confident to say they won't be much longer. They're easily replaceable."}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't think I could dislike a place so much.  We were excited that the Mission was opening another restaurant closer to us, but now, not so much.  We got there around 6:20p.m.  The girl at the door asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't so she told us to go to the hostess stand.  The girl there was scribbling on a pad, eventually I asked her about the seating by the bar, without even looking up, she said it was open seating.  I asked her again since I saw a bunch of \"reserve\" signs on the high top... crickets, nothing, nada, again I asked, so she annoyingly  said it was open seating, again without even looking up at me.  Since there were some purses on the chairs I was not sure if we could find two seats together.  I was still standing at the hostess stand without being acknowledged, I asked her then how long for a table for two, without even looking up at me she said 45 minutes.  We ended up walking to the high top table and asking if the chair with the purse was taken, it was not, so we sat down, but I was not enjoying my experience.  Our server was nice, Simone brought us the menus.  I ordered a Moscow Mule and my husband a Mission Margarita.  The music was so loud my husband and I couldn't hear each other.  I was starving so I ordered the shrimp anticucho.  My husband knew I was not happy, so he offered to cancel the order and move to another place, but I hadn't had anything to eat since breakfast so I needed something.  I got my 3 shrimp skewer, gave one to my husband, ate the other two and got the bill.  I will never come back.  Management, please train your hostess, she had a horrible attitude."}
{"text":"A must-try for the area.  Definitely order the guacamole and corn appetizer dish.  Sitting outside adds to the atmosphere.  The restaurant can get very busy and loud, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Tres Leches and Pascual Toso Malbec are absolutely fabulous! The bartenders were awesome! We had a wonderful Saturday evening! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Loved the decor. Food was good service ok but not worth the extreme prices. Would not recommend even for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Cool interior design!  The lit-up stairs are cool.  Got tacos with my daughter - we both enjoyed our choice (and preferred what we ordered to what the other ordered - gotta swap them to make sure!)  Rice/cheese side was kind of blah..."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the service lousy, the venue gorgeous, the portions miniature and the prices sky high.  Don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see the Mission open up at Kierland as I am a huge fan of the one in Scottsdale.  I ordered a glass of Clasa Azul but got a double to make it a standard Scottsdale cocktail size to enjoy.  $90 was a bit obnoxious considering an entire large bottle is only $99.  The waitress never mentioned the excessive cost of Azul there so after 2, I was astonished to get a $300 bar bill for 4 people (others ordered a margarita).  Dinner was so salty I couldn't sleep that night.  Ambiance was fantastic but have to say the food was subpar.  After 2 nice bottles of wine, dinner for 4 with cocktails set me back $800.  At this price point, there's better options in town.  I have to say, not worth it."}
{"text":"Incredibly loud and dark inside. Still the ambiance was not that bad. Very expensive. Poor service especially the runners and bus staff. Need to learn about silverware etiquette. Food was good however. Unhappy that I got tricked into a upcharge on a margarita that wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Came in tonight after a SF Giants spring training game. My dad and I came in around 9:55pm wanting to grab a bite to eat,after reading the reviews and plus it closed at 11pm. When walking in I noticed there were a few tables empty and no people waiting. I went to the hostesses (there were 3) to be specific to ask for a table for 2 while my dad was behind me waiting. One of the hostesses which was a short Caucasian woman with blonde curly hair looked friendly and was ready to give us a table. She was interrupted by other hostess that was on her right,a brunette long haired woman looked at my dad and I and said \" we don't do walk ins.\" After, I told my dad what she had said and as we were talking the hostess made my dad and I feel very uncomfortable because she kept looking at us. My dad and I felt as if the hostess was profiling us because we were latinos. My dad and I left feeling very upset and didn't feel welcome at all."}
{"text":"Dined there this past Saturday.  Walked in at around 5:30 w/no reservations. Next available table at 9pm.  Luckily upstairs bars was open seating. Love the house Margaritas. Bartender was attentive as busy as he was. Had the duck carnitas empanadas & chorizo porchetta (thought it was slightly dry but the flavor was there!)  I don't understand their seating arrangement. From the time that we sat down, drinks, dined, and left (about 2hrs) there were at least 2-3 tables upstairs with no one there."}
{"text":"The food was amazing as well as our server! She was very knowledgeable on al the menu items!  It was a little bit louder then most location but you can definitely get over it.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for Cinco de Mayo dinner. We arrived around 8:30 without a reservation, told the wait would be roughly 30 min, so we went to enjoy a margarita at the bar upstairs. At the recommendation of a patron at the bar, we tried the standard margarita smoked, adding a little spice... we ended up having 3 more lol. We were stay with a great 4 top table in the corner downstairs, overlooking the entire restaurant. Our server was Riley, she was sweet and attentive, suggesting what was the must haves on the menu, she was right! Table-side guacamole was prepared by a great Horizon High-school student named Cole. We just loved the kid and in part, is the main reason for the review. The food was phenomenal, the staff was helpful and attentive. We will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"The Mission in Old Town had been on my list of places to eat in the Valley based on the love of their cocktails and food by so many, I just hadn't had the chance.  We walked by the new location in Kierland about a month ago and said: \"Oh, we need to check this out.\"  My parents were in town on the way home from their yearly vacation by road trip and I decided we needed to check this out.  Although we sat at the community table there were no issues with our table mates at all.  But I will point out that the largest reservation you can make on Open Table for peak hours is 6, so be prepared to use your phone to call in, I know you don't like people that much, but the interaction will set you up for success. On Saturday morning I received a call confirming my reservation.  Upon arrival we were greeted, my only complain is that there is no waiting area where the front desk is.    Our server was extremely attentive and full of spunk.  She offered multiple recommendations, know the menu as if she had tasted it all in the hours prior.  We got our water often.  The Chips were delicious, one of the things you may get out of this is the customized guacamole, we had some that was super spicy and one mild.  For those that want to feel the heat they also have Ghost Pepper sauce to make you wail for milk.  I shared the Grouper with my girlfriend, although the flavoring was on point I just don't think I'd order it again.  The paella reduction just didn't suit me, the fish was excellent though.  My mom had the Fried Mahi tacos and chili grits on the site.  I'm not much of grits person, they tasted good, but if you don't have shrimp I'm probably not ordering it.  The mahi tacos were delicious as well.    A great night out, sadly I was unable to enjoy a libation. A bien tote."}
{"text":"I've been to The Mission in Old Scottsdale and loved it. Decided to try The Mission in Kierland with my kids since I live in Kierland and WAS NOT IMPRESSED!! Went at 3 PM, restaurant not full but the 3 Managers had PLENTY of time to stand around the hostess stand doing NOTHING (except talk to themselves and be on their cells). Service was slow, asked for water THAT took forever. Our server disappeared for long stretches. IF YOU DON'T want to be open at 3 then CLOSE and be open for ONLY lunch and dinner or dinner only!! But, if you have hours and you're supposed to be open then HAVE MENU'S as the 4 of us had to SHARE!! FOOD was excellent, but the lack of professionalism from the staff is pathetic!! NOT IMPRESSED!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed -- over priced food and drink service is poor at your table - had to ask the waiter and waitress for my drinks and water . I do like the bar service as we stopped and had a night cap on the way out!  I will chalk it up to being new . Let's see if there in business in 2 years ? Lots of competition in Scottsdale and Phoenix. Foodies paradise!!!  Love the location in Kierland and good additional much needed restaurant-- The best thing going here is the outside patio seating as the nights are amazing in AZ."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner on Saturday night. I have to say... it was one of the best food and service experiences I have had in quite awhile. We ordered several of their taco options for dinner along with their guacamole. Our server, Rodney, was very attentive to our table and super friendly!  After dinner we thought we wouldn't do dessert because we were so stuffed. But the Manager insisted that since it was our first time that he send over some desserts for us to try. This picture is of the bread pudding, the churros and the milk shakes they sent over. All were so wonderful!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First what a great location LOVE The restaurant hasn't had its grand opening yet so there are still some kinks but nothing way bad   Food took a while to arrive but it was a Saturday night and very busy   Let's say if you like margaritas omg so good there  Had a tableside guac #yummy Shrimp starter (like amazing sauces) Skirt steak with these crazy food cheese balls, I literally can't even put in the calories on MyFitnessPal but that's ok a cheat day now and then   Overall really good.   We had a great time there was 6 of us and the whole experience was DaBomb"}
{"text":"The service was great, food Delish and ambiance enjoyable! The pricing for food decent but the pricing for drinks was a laugh. I wouldn't return for brunch but dinner for an occasion maybe! $15 mojito, $11 mimosa...not worth it! Trey was great!"}
{"text":"I usually wait to post reviews but tonight was a terrible experience and I wanted to make sure I included all of the pertinent points. So I made the reservation by walking in earlier today and the hostess asked if we were celebrating something special and I told her it was mine and my husband's first married valentines day. I had gone to The Mission in Old Town in May during my bachelorette party and the service wasn't great at that time either but the restaurant keeps coming up on \"best of\" Scottsdale lists (lord knows why) and it is near our hotel so we decided to go here tonight.   We came back this evening for our reservation and there was a long line at the hostess desk. Another hostess who was walking around asked if she could help us so I gave her our name and res time. She went to the desk and disappeared to seat a different group. Ok weird. Then there were three hostesses at the stand and we were standing there in front and they literally didn't look up for two minutes, not even to ask us to give them a few minutes. Finally they got someone to seat us. I forgot his name but he was soooooo nice and literally one of the reasons this place is even getting any stars. We were seated in a nice spot on the upstairs patio.  We ordered two sangrias, tableside guacamole, and two entrees (chicken and duck). It took 20 min until someone even checked in on us after ordering. The guy who made our guac was super nice and also the second reason we aren't giving this place 1 star. We ate the guac but our sangria still hadn't come out. It came out just before the food which took forever. The chicken was boring and the duck was just not good. The sauce was chalky and the meat wasn't flavorful. I had asked for hot sauce twice and it never arrived despite reminding the waiter.  We also didn't get any special treatment even though we had told them what we were celebrating. Why bother asking if you're not going to do something?   Our water got refilled once throughout, and that was once we had finished our meal. Cool. Both mine and my husband's plates were pretty full because we didn't enjoy our food but no one asked us if we wanted something else. At that point we didn't want to eat anything else or spend anymore time dealing with the poor service or food.  We got our check and a staff member who hadn't waited on us all night picked up the card and bill. He may have been a manager who noticed we were not happy. We paid and got out of there as quickly as we could. We are back in our hotel now and contemplating ordering delivery - should've probably done that in the first place."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 7:30 on a Saturday night.  Many tables were still open and we wanted to be outside on the front patio.  They said they were for larger groups.  They took us to a lousy table inside and I asked to be seated outside again.  We found an acceptable table outside.  The server was pleasant and made recommendations.  We ordered and enjoyed the salad and appetizer, however it was 1.5 hours before the entree was served.  I had asked how many ounces in the fish and she said 6-7oz.  Okay, that's reasonable. I was served two small pieces of fish. I would say the portions are small and inconsistent.  When asked for the manager the manager told the waiter to take off the appetizer and never came to the table.   My recommendation is get a good front person that greets and helps to make the customer happy with their seating, second, get a manager that understands customer service.   The food was good, but needs to get a better handle in the management.  I really should give the whole dining experience a lesser rating.  There are better places to dine for the price."}
{"text":"It was ok. Stopped in while we were at Kierland between Christmas and New Years. Drinks were good but the 'so called' table side guacamole was not made tableside... some guy asked if we wanted mild, medium or hot and next thing we knew we had a bowl of bland guacamole. Not worth $14 -- I can make it better at home!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they finally opened this location! The atmosphere is great. The service is excellent. The food is yummy!   I went here for my boyfriend's 21st, and our waitress treated us all (there were about 10 of us) like royalty. She explained the whole menu to us, and even brought all of us tequila shots AND dessert to celebrate his special day! It was a very nice experience.   I ordered the salmon, and it was delicious. My only qualm is that is was overpriced in my opinion for what it was - a simple filet with three small puff pastries. Many of my dining compatriots said the same - the food is excellent, but overpriced for what it is. However, the mission is still an excellent restaurant and I will most likely be back, despite the prices.   For my drink, I had the elderflower margarita. I just returned from Europe and elderflower is Huuuge there, so I was excited to see it on the menu here as well. It was perfect, and for once my rim was not over-salted. Make sure to try one!"}
{"text":"Food was good, small Portions if your looking to split appetizers. We took a shopping break for some cocktails (which were fantastic!) and some fuel. It was 2/3pm and though it was dead the (only) bartender just couldn't get her game together. Inattentive, not very friendly, and I couldn't see why she seemed in the weeds. Whatever, it turned out ok!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and brunch, and I really enjoy this place. The food always is really great quality and the service is usually pretty friendly. It does feel a bit overpriced sometimes, and the salsa - I can take it or leave it.   Today I had brunch, and the skirt steak was fantastic. Perfectly cooked, sooooo flavorful! Coffee was delish too. We were served by Ricardo and he was so attentive and kind!"}
{"text":"Horrendous customer service or lack thereof.Was infotmed the wait would be 15 minutes. Seated non reservation customer who came after before my party. I was then told wait would be another 15 minutes after already waiting thirty minutes. I guess you have to be old and white to get seats here first. I find it comical that of all restaurant a Mexican restaurant does this. Took my business elsewhere and will continue to inform all friends, family, and colleagues to not go to such establishment as this.  Will pass the word on."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, came in from Portland Oregon to have a great meal and was highly disappointed. I've eaten at the old town store last year and it was the best! This place is not being managed correctly to keep their brand alive. Waited an hour to go through this horrific dining experience. At the end they gave in the wrong check."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We checked them out for Valentines Day and couldn't believe how great the food was. We are scheduled again for our anniversary next month for a date night again. Loved the presentation and great drinks."}
{"text":"Great food and even better margaritas! Kendra was an amazing waitress and helped us order tapas style! Do not miss."}
{"text":"The Sunday Pig-out is a MUST DO! Unlimited pork tacos for $17. The customer service here is the best I've experienced both times I've been here! Waiters have given our table complimentary chips and desserts to make up for busy times. Several servers (that weren't ours) approached us to see if we need anything and give their recommendations. The Pumpkin Bread Pudding is by far my favorite dessert! The butterscotch sauce and pomegranate seeds give it a gourmet taste and texture! My husband and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This Latin American trendy spot at Kierland is best described as plain cool. The decor is stunning. Gorgeous chandeliers and lighting add to atmosphere. It is intelligently designed with a second bar on the upstairs level.   We perused the long list of tequilas and ordered it on the rocks. I sipped on the cucumber jalapeño margarita which was spicy and delicious. Our server was charming and attentive.   The tableside guacamole does not disappoint. It is fresh, chunky, seasoned with cotijo and Pepitas and has a beautiful kick of jalapeño. Their Smokey version of salsa is also spot on. And yes, the chips are crispy, super thin and salty... but very good.   The Florida Grouper a la Parilla (on the grill) was flavorful and nicely presented. The fish was cooked perfectly and the croquette (albeit fried) was unbelievably tasty with a herbaceous filling I still can't quite pinpoint. Sufficed to say I finished my entree, which was a nice size portion but if you're super hungry you might think it a little skimpy.   Other entrees included the porchetta which is so decadent but clearly delicious as reviewed by our friend. The grilled Jidori chicken also a hit. My husband ordered an ahi taco appetizer along with the chicken tacos on corn tortillas. He enjoyed both. I tasted the ahi mini one which was overflowing with uncooked tuna which was delicious. But the filling sat atop a thinly sliced greened apple which to me just didn't work. I would have preferred a thin round of jicama as an alternative flavor profile.   The papas y chorizo side was a messy dish of undercooked French fries and chunks of chorizo. A little on the disappointing side.   The server sent out a sparkler in a lime for my birthday along with pumpkin bread pudding served with ice cream in a bowl with a delicious butterscotch/caramel sauce. Scrumptious! We finished the whole dessert. Others ordered the fried bananas with cinnamon ice cream and a peanut butter mousse. That seemed to be a hit though we all agreed the pumpkin dessert was the highlight.   The menu here is so expansive it just beckons you to return. Would be curious about the old town location but this one clearly has a fun, clubby vibe that's just plain fun. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful!! They did an amazing job remodeling the old Bobbys in kieraland. I absolutely love the cucumber jalapeño margarita and lamb tacos which you can share. Most of the food is pretty small but very delicious. Get table side guac and street corn!! FYI make sure the hostess gets your number right or you will be waiting till the cows come home?"}
{"text":"If you're under the impression you're incapable of shitting your pants as an adult - think again. You won't have to wait until you're in a raisin ranch fashioned with Depends, nope.  The pleasure will be all yours when after a couple of beers, tequila shots and chips/salsa, the waitress bestows you with the damages.  To say this place is expensive would be a total insult to the word expensive. In fact, if the word expensive could take human form, it would walk in here and fucking die.  No joke. If you want to impress someone with how much you can pay for small bites, have at it."}
{"text":"Nope, nope, nope. The service kinks have still not been worked out. Dined here on March 6th. The hostess underwhelmed twice - once taking reservation and also when we arrived. Waiter seemed like it may have been his first night; frequently just wandered around his assigned tables. Had tableside quac prepared by an individual who self-identified as a busboy who was just helping out making the guac....we apparently were his second table and he \"hoped\" it was alright. It wasn't....way too salty.   Good news is the food (chicken tacos and mahi-mahi )was good and the drinks were really, really, good. For the price, however, all aspects of the experience should be good."}
{"text":"Okay! I have to confess...I haven't even eaten here yet!! I'm an avid diner and love to explore new places...so I'm scouting all the time!! I work at Scottsdale Quarter so of course I'm gonna check out the New Mission here!! I'm Super Impressed!! Why you say??  Tammy greeted me and I believe she is in management there...I casually mentioned that I was Yelp Elite and was scouting out the joint! BAM  It was like I was VIP instantly!! Tammy toured me about showing off the place! Which is Gorgeous!!! When I mentioned that I worked next Store and do our event planning for our company- she gives me her contact number at the restaurant AND her CELL! WOW!! Tammy has got her Game Face on and knows who to treat a Guest! I'm planning on dining there soon to scout out the service and food...I will keep you posted! But, if it's half as Amazing as Tammy...it will be Outstanding!!! Well done Tammy! Great Job Mission on the stunning presentation of your establishment!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience here! Our server was amazing, and she was really knowledgeable of the menu! Everything we tasted was incredible. Truly a good experience! Great customer service. Great food. Great vibe."}
{"text":"Sarah at the hostess stand was amazing. Polite. Sweet and beeeeeautiful. Katherine was our server. Her menu and tequila knowledge were exceptional. She was patient and always seemed to be available but never seemed to be lurking. Our food was amazing. Fresh and hot. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavors!  Excellent. Great service. Highly recommended. Had the chicken tacos, poblano grits and pork shoulder chorizo dish. Very rich and oh so good."}
{"text":"First things first. This is a really nice and posh restaurant. Very affordable and you get the value for money.  Was here on fine Sunday afternoon, a guy comes up to us and asks if we needed any chips and guac to stay with. He makes guacamole right in front of you and totally fresh ingredients. I ordered a black bean tortas. Was a spice level alert and yet I had it. So amazing and delicious. Totally loved the experience would visit this place again."}
{"text":"After the shitshow that was Fat Ox I was cautious AF plunking my hard earned American dollars here. But rest easy it's beautiful and delicious and what everything I thought it should be. We much prefer this location to the Old Town location. Something about the menu is a bit cleaner and reads a bit diner-friendly. Great for a girls lunch, family in town dinner, Friday night people watching, etc. Zinc Bistro is still my most favorite restaurant of all time but The Mission is a solid addition to the Kierland hood."}
{"text":"I have been to both the location in Old Town and this one. In comparison, the location in Old Town carries much more ambiance with it and the feel of history. However, this location offers great outdoor patios that extend on both the lower and upper levels of the restaurant.  The service was good and the server was very attentive to my needs. Parking can be a challenge during busy times at this mall. Often times it may be better to park across the street and then walk over.  I would have given them 4 stars but the portion size to price to me is out of whack. I have developed and implemented many menus in my day and the portions seem lacking. However, this may be due to the rent in this area for the facility; not sure of the rent cost per SQ FT here. was   My Southwestern salad was very tasty and the presentation was visually enticing. The plate was chilled \"Class Move\" and the dressing that accompanied it was delicious.  I like this area because you can get about anything you want (Ice Cream, Coffee, Sexy items at PINK, grab a movie or take the kids to the outdoor water features to cool off).  Give them a shot because I can't voice for all...  #Mission #Missionkierland #Irishcatv2 #Vino2 #Vinosquared #Vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"We've been to both Mission locations. Both are fabulous!  Still the best Mexican/Latin in Scottsdale. Everything's always delicious and cooked to perfection.   Jamar's service is always out of this world. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today with my daughter , Monday 13th march . What a disappointment , completely overpriced and the portions were miniscule ! We both had tacos which apart from being small were completely tasteless . I will probably not come back again , there are other and better options in Kirkland  , for example Postinos . We both left still hungry !"}
{"text":"The location is a perk and the trendy vibe fits nicely for the demographics of this part of Scottsdale. That being said, I'm not sure I can totally see myself wanting to come back here for several reasons.   The interior decor is very clean and aesthically pleasing to look at. Went during happy hour on a recent Friday afternoon. If you happen to be seated inside where you have a seat that faces west/the entrance of the restaurant, bring your sunglasses. You will unfortunately be in the direct path of the sun setting for a portion of the meal, and my friends at those chairs had to dodge shadows and hold their hands up to shield themselves from the blinding sun for part of their meal, which was not fun. The Mission does not have any blinds or shades that they can lower to alleviate this.   Next up is the menu. Our server was attentive and made it a point to articulate details of anything we asked about the menu. I'm sure hype drives up the cost, but I could not see myself wanting to order half of the items off the menu due to the overpriced pricepoint. Drinks were good, but nothing spectacular (mojitos and margaritas average $14-15/glass). We ordered the tableside guacamole, which was excellent and nicely presented, and enough to share between three to four people. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos. Keep in mind that their idea of tacos are three miniature discs (no more than 3 1/2\" in diameter) of corn tortilla with the respective filling presented nicely on top. Any sides are ordered a la carte. I enjoyed my mahi mahi tacos which were nicely garnished with a touch of cilantro and a slice of some sort of red pepper on top. It was a nice girls' dinner for me, but if I had brought my husband, he would have left hungry.   It probably also does not help that we recently moved from Texas so we have an affinity to Mexican food, and have a certain expectation of what we consider to be great Mexican food. While the food here is good, I would not consider the food quality or service five star by any stretch of the means, nor does it justify the cost. Looks like the Old Town location gets higher reviews so I'm inclined to think maybe I needed to try there first."}
{"text":"Our waiter RICARDO was awesome! He was literally the BEST server I've ever had.  He really made us feel special. The vibe and ambiance is really cool so having Ricardo as our server made the whole experience fantastic ?  The street tacos  are so fresh and delicious my personal favorite was the barbacoa and the asada  We also had the table side guacamole! Wholy guacamole it's was fresh, made to order and it was very filling.   The place gets very busy on the weekends so I suggest you book on open table.    The price range is averaged or the Kierland area so for two ppl expect it to be at least $80-$100 including drinks & tip"}
{"text":"The new uptown Mission located in Kierland Commons is a nice option for those living in North Scottsdale. Unlike the Old Town location, which is dark and mysterious inside, the new location is bright, swanky, more Vegas than Scottsdale.  The menu is the same, which is a good thing. The staff is friendly, as exhibited by our server Kathleen.  We started with the Mission margaritas and the famous tabled prepared guacamole. It's always satisfying and a great way to start your meal. Always a difficult choice to make but for dinner, we went with the Pork Shoulder tacos for two. The tortillas are heated by a warm brick of salt. The meat was very tender. The sauce was good but a little too sweet for me. The street corn side was very tasty."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. The pumpkin bread pudding is one of my top five best deserts in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Came in on a weekday, and it was very busy! We were able to sit at the open seating near the bar and we were served right away. The waitress seemed new, but I believe the restaurant is also very new. She gave us her recommendations and allowed us time to look over the menu. During that time, waters arrived. We ended up ordering a selection of appetizers and entrées. The guacamole was made tableside! The cheese platter was plentiful. For dinner, I ordered the Florida grouper. It was fantastic. My only wish was for it to be a bigger portion size! My guests enjoyed their tacos and roasted chicken dishes. The bus boy brought chips and salsa and made sure our waters and sodas were refilled often. Or dessert, we ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was recommended by the waitress, and the fried bananas. We also had the French press coffee service which came with a spicy homemade shortbread cookie, which I loved!The waitress was hard to find when it came to dessert and paying our check. But we were able to flag down someone else to help us. The manager came by at least once during our visit which was very nice. I highly recommend this upscale fusion style Spanish restaurant. There are so many other things on the menu that I want to try"}
{"text":"Great dinner, nice ambiance. Perfect date restaurant. Table side guac was so delicious! Plates and flavors were very well thought out and balanced. Our waiter Jeff was perfect, service was great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the other Mission and was hoping it would be the same. It is!  It's close to my office so I've lunch there 4 times already.  Great tortas and tacos.  Table side guacamole is always recommended.  The decor is different but well done.  Diners are hard to get into without a reservation but worth the effort."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Outstanding staff. Every time I step foot in this establishment, I feel home! After only two times, the waiters recognized me and went out of their way to ensure I had a great experience. However, it wasn't just with me; the staff truly cares about every customer! And with a menu as delicious as this one, it has become my new go to. The tacos are by far my favorite, specially the steak tacos and butternut squash. The table-side guacamole is a must as well!"}
{"text":"We are there on Fathers Day. The service was not good. Server overcharged   big time. It took forever to correct. No manager was around. Food was good especially the pork tacos. Kitchen was slower than slow. And the place was not real busy."}
{"text":"The pork belly pibel, the skirt steak taco, table side guac and the street corn is all great! Chips and salsa were good too. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Have been to The  Mission a few times and love the food and up until this evening the service was always great.  We brought our daughter and friends here for a birthday celebration and the food was as fantastic as always.   Our service from our main waiter was terrible.  It took him 20 min to come and greet us, then we didn't get an ordered side dish till the meal was over.  After the meal he did not come back to ask about dessert and coffee.   We reminded him we had a birthday and he said \"why didn't you tell me\"  when we actually did twice.  After asking the birthday girl what dessert she would like he walked away not asking any of the guests if they wanted their own dessert or a coffee or after dinner drink.   When he brought the dessert, two guests wanted coffee, but he only took one order.  Then my husband asked for a cup to share the other guests coffee and the waiter said, oh I didn't charge you for the other cup.  What???? Funny thing was he picked the bill immediately after we signed the tab.   I have never had this happen at a restaurant of this caliber.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Fantastic venue and delicious food. Dinner doesn't start until 5pm, but you can go earlier and sit at the community tables for drinks and a smaller appetizer menu. The process of making a reservation was a little frustrating as the restaurant only has one computer, so they will likely put you on hold if they are busy.   On the appetizer front, please make sure to get the guacamole. They come out with a tray of all the ingredients and make the guacamole right there in front of you. If you love spicy foods, I highly recommend asking your server to add their additional hot sauce which helped kick it up a notch. On their scale of 1-10 spiciness, we ordered an 8 and it still could have been spicier.  For dinner, the tacos usually just come with 3 tacos, but there are a few options that come with 10 and are great for sharing. If you're looking to go a bit on the fancier (and more expensive side), the general trend is to get the filet or the chorizo pork, which are both very popular.   A huge shout out to Ricardo (Ricky) for his excellent service, hospitality, and overall enthusiasm. He was a fantastic person to interact with, knew everything about the menu, and made excellent recommendations."}
{"text":"The raw chicken tacos that they served up pretty much sealed the deal on this review.  We're talking as pink as a rare steak - I've never seen anything like it at restaurant.  They comped our meal, but still - not acceptable."}
{"text":"Just came here for dinner.  This is one of the few times I really felt like I needed to write a review immediately after getting home to share my dining experience.  First off the entrance to this place is so terribly conceived.  There's this gated front patio, where you need to enter from the side.  Then the door is about 5 feet from the gate.  Right next to that door is a point of sale station.  Then once you go in there's the host stand to the right and a bunch of people standing around and then the bar to the left.  What you'll notice is the volume in there is about as loud and sitting next to the tail pipe of a Harley Davidson.  My ears are still ringing as I right this and I left 30 minutes ago.  We were seated immediately and had waters brought out to us.  Almost immediately after our server Tiffany B. greeted us with a warm smile.  She asked if we wanted any drinks which we did not, cause I thought if I drank my head would hurt even more and my gf is on antibiotics.  Anyways she explained the menu and pointed out her favorite dishes and then gave us a few minutes to decide.  We ordered the Chorizo Porcheta and the steak tacos.  The steak was good but a little lost in the tortilla, sort of bland when eaten with it.  Also the small parts of the steak were pretty much charred.  The Chorizo Porcheta was SO VERY DRY.  When our waitress came back and asked how the food was, I told her it was dry and she asked if I wanted anything else.  I said no and she said she will bring over the manager.  The manager never came over, but she came back with more sauce and told me they would give us a free dessert and to make sure we stay for that.  Since it sounded like I would have to pay $30 for the Chorizo Porcheta, I hunkered down and ate this expensive CRAP.  I had to have Tiffany get me another bowl of sauce, break up all the meat and let it sit in the sauce.  It was still dry as hell, but I was hungry and had to pay anyways...  I'm still quite annoyed that I had to pay for that.  I still have pieces of dry pork in my teeth.  Anyways our server came back and wanted to make sure we were ok with the dessert she picked, which was the pumpkin bread pudding.  It sounded good and tasted amazing.  My gf even said she would go back just for that.  Well I still regret not following my instinct and leaving immediately due to the noise level.  Great service from Tiffany B., great dessert but man inedible food that did not get removed from the bill.  Needless to say I left annoyed that I paid for crappy food.  I'll just have to put you guys on the never again list."}
{"text":"Such a cool decor and vibe but food had been very hit or miss. Margaritas could use a refresh as well. Hope they dial it in because I want to like this spot."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous dinner at the mission at Kierland! The at the table guacamole  was some of the best I've had. Will definitely be going back for their margaritas. Love the restaurant, the layout with outdoor eating space for perfect spring evenings like tonight and overall great vibe. Jamar went above and beyond on his customer service one of the reasons we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"On vacation from Atlanta with the entire family and wanted a great meal on the last night. The Mission didn't disappoint. Ava the Hostess went way beyond expectations and was able to make it happen. A table for 6 in the upper deck at night all by ourselves. It was a beautiful night and it was amazing to be able to have just the fam up there. Mario our waiter was very professional and knowledgeable and able to satisfy all our questions. All in all, the Margaritas were outstanding, the table side guacamole delicious and our meals were enjoyed by all. Although the ribeye was a bit pricey, there was not a bite left on the plate. Kudos to the chef and his team, thank you for making our final evening a memorable one."}
{"text":"We joined friends for dinner on a Saturday night.   We had reservations and there was no wait (but we were there early, before 6).    The waitress was friendly and helpful but there were a couple of missteps in the service (silverware removed and not replaced, coffee ordered but not served).  We had mixed opinions on the food.   The salads (Kale, Spinach) were good.  The Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze lettuce wraps were very flavorful.  The Grouper was not memorable.  The Flat Iron steak was very tender and had good flavor.   The Chocolate dessert was average."}
{"text":"Finally, they are here!  Working right across the street from Kierland we have been waiting with baited breath for months.  Well day two after opening we got our opportunity.  It was a nice day so we decided to dine outside.  Of course we had the the Tableside Guacamole made at our, you guessed it, tableside and it was excellent where our waiter took extra pains to make sure EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING was just as we expected.  The heat level of the guac was perfect.  He was clearly one of the best from the Old Towne location brought in to make sure the new wait staff were trained peoperly.  I'll call our waiter Mr. Miiiiichigan!  He was wearing U. of Michigan wrist bands.  He was fantastic.    The Pork Shoulder tacos were so flavorful and tender.  My only regret is that they were not serving the lamb shoulder tacos on Day 2.  Our group was really interested in that one as well.    A coworker had the pork short rib that they said was excellent which I have had on many occasions in Old Towne and it never dissapoints.    The only reason i give a 4 and not 5 star is because after sampling my coworkers pork shoulder tacos my  Chorizo Porchetta was not nearly as tasty.  And the chorizo was hard to taste and not nearly enough spice, meaning none.    I also had a spicy margherita that was very tasty.    The service was A+ Food taste was A (except for the Chorizo Porchetta, that was a B-)"}
{"text":"What an amazing lunch the hubs and I just hoovered! I have always loved this place and was so excited to try this newest location. It's awesome and consistent with the OG spot but better becAuse it's not tiny.  The food was fantastic from the chips and salsa to the pumpkin bread pudding (which I never would have ordered but please try it -- you will not be sorry). It is pricey at $14 per cocktail and around that same price for a lunch entree. But really good and great service."}
{"text":"The Mission is fantastic!! Amanda was our server, she told us the history of the restaurant and all about the chef. Her recommendations were spot on. Harrison made some killer spicy tableside guac and Josh's Primarita (I had him add jalapeño) was to die for. We had the chicken tacos and the Tecate skirt steak. The chips are fresh and salty. Yummm. I would definitely recommend The Mission."}
{"text":"Tre was fantastic, food superb and service was top notch. The table side guacamole is to die for and 4 of us split 3 different taco platters more than enough food for all of us. Chips and salsa also superb. We didn't get the white bean dip but I've had before and it's superb as well. I still like the ambiance of the one in old town."}
{"text":"The Mission never disappoints. We typically frequent the old town location, but stopped into the kierland one today. Had superb service by Ruthie (who recommended the skirt steak-which was phenom.) & Dustin, who made an awesome extra spicy cucumber jalapeño Marg. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner meeting here, everything was delicious, the servers were super friendly and knowledgeable, the ambiance was great."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were there for our 30th anniversary, and had what can only be described as one of the best meals in my life.  Our server,  promised us the \"Mission Experience\", and there is no other way to describe what we encountered.  Our entire meal, from before-dinner drinks, to appetizers, dinner and dessert was nothing short of extraordinary!  Service was fast, friendly, and they really demonstrated the art of culinary service to a fine point.  Our server was very attentive and we never lacked for a refill, or a fresh idea. The service was a spectacular, and they obviously take pride in their work!  We had the table-side guacamole to start that was made to order (I like it moderate to hot).  The flavorful was terrific with the warm tortilla chips!  We also had the pork-belly appetizer (I was a little skeptical, but it was terrific!).  We tried a Bailey's and Tequila aperitif to accompany the appetizer and it was a nice complement with the spicy appetizer! My husband had the flat steak which he loved, and I had the Swordfish which was very tasty!   We topped it off with a dessert the pumpkin bread pudding which was fantastic!  I wish that the restaurant was closer so we could visit more frequently, but I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"The Mission is an experience. We had a truly enjoyable evening and our server, JJ, took every opportunity to be courteous and accommodating. We were just out for a \"normal\" dinner, but they went above and beyond to make it memorable. Yes, you should make a reservation, and yes, it is \"loud\", but honestly after you are there for 10 minutes you adjust and it all becomes a part of the vibrant, yet intimate, atmosphere; please don't let other reviews mentioning this sway you from giving this place a try. The drinks were unique and artfully crafted. The guacamole was great and we enjoyed sharing a delicious entree for two. The most pleasantly surprising thing however, was the sashimi style appetizer on the summer menu. All in all - we found a new favorite spot for our date nights and were genuinely impressed. As a side note, we both have food allergies (dairy and gluten),  and our server and the chef did an exceptional job making sure that it was a non-issue while still informing us of any necessary substitutes and creating full-flavor dishes for us. Amazing job! Thank you for a great night out."}
{"text":"The Mission Kierland delivered on everything my husband and I could have asked for on a Friday night out in Scottsdale. We live in San Francisco and eat our way through every city we visit, and with that lens, we were a little nervous given the recent opening/obvious kink working out from other Yelp reviews. However, everything was perfect - we sat nearly on time (which gave us an opportunity to experience their hopping bar), got a great table, and had insanely professional and prompt service from our server, Riley. She knew the answer to all our questions on the menu, was a delight to interact with, and ensured a perfectly executed night. You can't leave without having Juan's spicy guacamole prepared table side, the street corn, and the margaritas. I had the grouper - really good, and my husband had the Brussels sprouts tacos and mahi tacos - both were excellent. Like Mexico, the tacos are on the smaller side, so feel free to ask for extra - they're happy to accommodate! Be sure to top your meal off with the churros + milkshake. Waddling home but worth it! The place was buzzing, people watching so fun, food delicious, and service great - what a wonderful addition to the Scottsdale dining scene. Only drawback was the bathroom - they have 3 or 4 unisex stalks and the line was long!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to have dinnwer here and I must say I was quite impressed.   I've been to the Mission in Old Town and to start, this location is much more space.   The server, 'nugget', was nothing short of amazing.  And the food: Appetizers - Shrimp on skewer, corn gorditas and roasted corn all made perfectly   Dinner - mahi tacos, swordfish, brussel sprout tacos - #amazing  This is a Modern Latin restaraunt. Expect creative offerings with great flavors"}
{"text":"I am so sad to say this location does not have it together even after our 3rd time.  Train the staff please! Buy some new menus, we always have to share. The timing of service is off (lots of ground to cover for staff). Our cocktails came after our apps, food delivery people are always confused what table number they are going to, and at least one dish has had to be sent back each time. The Old Towne location has perfect salsa every time, this one has very little flavor. The waiters are not refined. They need training on the food and the basic do's and don'ts. The woman we had was always stressed and asked us to move food from one plate to the other so she didn't have to carry 2. The guy we had told my husband \"I won't tell anyone it's not real\" when he ordered a non-alcohol beer. He had never heard of one when he initially ordered it. We have gone to The Mission in Old Town for 7 years and loved it! This one is so close to the house but 3 times is just too much."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! They couldn't even get our reservation correct!!! And they did not want to fix it!! I will never go back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What amazing service!!! The tableside guac was so delicious with the corona cheese and sunflower seeds. Then the street corn on the cob came out and bam party in my mouth. Shared the steak tacos with my friend and that was about all I could eat I was stuffed. The chips were probably too salty but not too bad.  They say it's kid friendly but I probably won't bring my child again. Too many things that could break or catch fire from all the candles."}
{"text":"This was our second time dining here with a gift certificate given as an engagement present. The first time we had an exceptional experience however the second was just plain awful. We made a reservation for 6:30 and granted it was a Friday night and they were also having a large party being put on the second level. We did not get seated for 25 minutes due to them \"not having enough menus\" okay, no problem. We were seated on the upper level where our server Pepe greeted us. He asked about drinks and we were actually there just to have dinner. He took our order and we steadily received our table side gauc and salad and soups. However, an hour nearly passed as we saw him attentively check in with other diners and tables and as trays of food go by we began to wonder where our tacos maybe. So after An hour and a half Pepe decides to inform us our food should be here shortly the chef was not happy with the tacos and threw them all out. We politely said ok no problem. 30 minutes later our food arrived... mind you we asked him to box 1 of the tacos because we were now in a hurry after being at the restaurant for 2 hrs with only appetizers consumed. He did not box the tacos and everything we ordered mission fries, short rib tacos, vegetarian tacos were cold and not even worth eating. The only thing that was edible was the fish tacos. At this point we wanted to walk out, but we tried to consume what was brought and politely asked for our check and boxes, he grabbed all of our silverware which was odd because my fiancé was still finishing up. He brought it 15 minutes later where we then had to scoop our chipotle grits into our takeout container with a tortilla chip. I'm serious. When I called to make the reservation they asked if we were celebrating something special--- I replied out engagement. Is this how you treat people there for a special occasion? Yikes, I live across the street and would have been a frequent customer, but after this disaster I am not sure I will return."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this restaurant on our first visit to Scottsdale. The restaurant is in a shopping area, very walkable. The hostess was snoody so our first impression was not good. She practically threw out menus at us. Our server was good once she finally made it to our table. Tableside guacamole was good. The chips and salsa also good. We had the short rib tacos and the pork tacos. I had the Paloma cocktail. Very tasty. We had made reservations for the patio. There was no seating available. Again the snoddy hostess was no help. It's amazing how a first impression can make or break your opinion and review of a restaurant. Would have given 4 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"We had hopes that the new Mission would be better than the original, which is average at best.  Unfortunately the new one is a step down from the original.  Poor service and the food leaves much to be desired.  Not sure where they get their cooks, but they need to read a Diane Kennedy cook book on how real gourmet Mexican food is prepared.  The roast chicken has some strange orange sauce and the chicken was stringy.  Has a hot look but if you want good Mexican go up the street to the Laredo Cantina.  Much better service, food and atmosphere.  The Mission needs to get on a mission to improve or they are not going to make it.  Of maybe they will survive on the \"snow birds\" who most likely do know good Mexican from a Big Mac.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant in old town Scottsdale last year and this is the new Kierland location. It is big, spacious and has a second floor. The menu is same as old town location and staff are very friendly and helpful, especially Jeff, our movie star looking server. The decor is nice and has a huge bar on the main level. Individual washrooms are clean and nice. The chips and salsa are good and have a chipotle flavour. Hubby got some ghost pepper sauce. The table side guacamole was delicious. Hubby had the creek side filet which he rated 5/5 and said it melted in his mouth. It came with poblano grits. My son had the grouper with a crab/banana croquette and crunchy quinoa....he rated it 4.5/5. I had the squash and black bean taco without cheese. I did not enjoy it at all. The texture was hard and seemed not fully cooked. For dessert hubby had the chocolate mousse pastille, which was good but both he and my son agreed the pumpkin bread pudding was excellent. The bill was $160 before tip for 3 of us to eat, with 2 margaritas."}
{"text":"I ate dinner at The Mission last night with my husband , and we were so disappointed. Having been to the one in Old Town, we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner. The food was as good, however the service was some of the worst I have ever had. Especially in a fine dining setting!   The server was clearly overwhelmed and had way too many tables. Our drinks alone took 15 minutes to get. Table side guacamole took a very long time to come out as well. When our food did come out, our server never returned to see if we wanted more drinks (water glasses were left empty) or to even see if we were enjoying the food. We sat finished with empty dirty plates for quite sometime before he finally came over to check on us.   When we were ready to pay we sat, yet again, as he walked past or table many times leaving the check presenter on the table. We finally decided to take our bill to a manager to run our card. This was the part that upset me the most!! I expressed the lack of service in a kind way to the male manager, and he didn't say anything! He simply ran my card and told me to have a good night. Not I'm so sorry, or how was the food....nothing! I have worked in the service industry for 15 years, and have never experienced a manager that didn't care that his guests received terrible service and had to walk to find someone to check them out. I was appalled. Needless to say we will not be spending our money at this location again. We will make the trip to Old Town instead."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for lunch or dinner.  Food is small and average.   Service this was great.  Great for bday celebration."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the Mission, both locations. Being in the industry I have always valued great service, atmosphere and food quality which are the three pillars of any great restaurant. Last night I dined at the Kierland location to celebrate my wife's birthday and it was probably one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  One of guests had never dined at the Mission before and was blown away by his experience. What made it better than usual was our server Jamar(JJ). He was extremely charismatic and his menu knowledge was on point. The manager Jenn made sure our experience was next level as well which I appreciated. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to The Mission for dinner and sat on the patio. Trendy but laid back atmosphere. Every single staff member we interacted with was beyond helpful and nice. I got the Mission Mule which doesn't have any ginger beer in it but tastes like a delicious limey ginger beer without carbonation. We had the table side guacamole, of course, and as all the other reviews have said, it was amazing. The salsa was really good too. We also had the chicken wings. Omg yes. So tasty. I got the grouper entree. It was my first time having grouper, so maybe I am just not a grouper fan. It was just ok, but it came with a crab cake and quinoa and brussel sprouts. I could've just had that without the grouper and it would have been perfect. Two of our group got the tacos, which they said weren't anything special, but still tasty. The best part, though, was our waiter. He was so sweet and helpful and called our hotel to send over the shuttle when we were finishing up without us even having to ask. I wish I remembered his name, because he was amazing. Overall, service 5 stars, food 4. A solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed drinks and meal at this new-ish restaurant at the Kieran's mixed-use development on Tuesday 4/9.  Bartender Ilana made what has to be about the best margarita I've ever had (included the splash of Grand Marnier). Table-side guacamole was very good, although I would have preferred more cilantro (which is an issues for those folks who have the gene that makes cilantro taste like soap).  Ample chips and the staff accommodated our request for sliced veggies for our gluten-free friend. Other than Ilana's margarita, other highlights from the menu include the pork shoulder tacos (tomato-pineapple sauce), which were accurately billed for two (delicious leftovers), the swordfish served over a paella rice and the porkietta. The grouper was not as a big of a hit because it was not as flavorful as everything else, but not a bad dish.  The salsa is also delicious - smoky and substantial. We sat outside and that was great.  Inside has a great vibe, certainly noisier but didn't seem over-the-top.  I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"We had Canton as our waiter and had absolutely a great time and meal. Super attentive, ensured our gluten free person was all taken care of. The food was great as was my post meal French press. Definitely ask for this guy as your waiter!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, but very expensive on their food and beer.  My wife and I had only four beers and after tax it came to $50.00.  Outrageous !"}
{"text":"This place has been on our \"Gotta Try It\" list for months. So glad we did!  Atmosphere 5 stars, service 4 stars, Skirt Steak Tacos 6 Stars, tequila selection 5 stars, table side guacamole service 5 stars.  This is a happening spot we will frequent! For starters any place with my go to tequila (1942) gets a positive nod. My wife likes a good sangria filled with fruit. The pulled pork was terrific. I can't wait to have a party on the upstairs outdoor balcony."}
{"text":"Very good street tacos . I was a little surprised by how small the tortillas were which made them hard to eat and a traditional street taco always has two tortillas layered . However the mahi mahi was very good and wasn't dry  I also had the street corn and i think it's a nice touch that they take it off the cob for you .  The service was excellent even on a busy Friday night and the location is ideal .  If I'm ever in the area again i will be back"}
{"text":"SO GLAD THIS IS IN MY HOOD NOW! The entire set up is absolutely stunning, our bartender went above and beyond to keep us satisfied and even gave us a free shot of the house tequila which is delicious! All in all we were blown away by the service, the architecture and of course the food. This will definitely be our new spot!"}
{"text":"Went there last night there were 6 of us. Seated upstairs, extremely noisy. Food was really just average. Service ok.  Will never go there again not worth it. Too many really great restaurants in the area. Don't waste your money or your time!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas and bartender Brandon!! Had a blast , great food and guacamole with chips and salsa!!"}
{"text":"I think that The Mission at Kierland is probably one of the best examples of a case that, even if service is poor or the environment isn't optimal, you're still willing to overlook these flaws if the quality of the food is good.  My girlfriend and I dined at The Mission in Old Town a few months ago and were very impressed with the food. Service? No. Food? Definitely! Since we've been over at Kierland a lot recently, we decided to give their other location a try.  The \"vibe\" of this location is a little different than Old Town. I guess it makes sense, as the setup fits this particular part of Scottsdale nicely, but it was so bloody loud that we could barely decipher what the server was saying to us, let alone have an actual conversation. It's not a freaking dance club, people! I mean, I get it. You're in North Scottsdale. You're fancy, lack wrinkles, and despite being in your 40s, like stumbling around in ultra-high heels that make you walk like you have a pestle shoved up your - well . . . you know what I mean.   We ordered the tableside guacamole, expecting similar quality to what we received in Old Town. Sticking with only a \"mild\" spice, I can definitely vouch for the quality and complexity of the flavor. My girlfriend even struck up a conversation with the guac maker. She claims that they discussed the layout of the restaurant, as well as their sister-restaurant (Zinc), although since it was in Spanish, they could have been making snide remarks about her white boyfriend who still admits to eating Taco Bell every Monday.  Anyway . . .  We also ordered a cheese board, carefully choosing two cheeses to go with the bread, nuts, a bit of chimichurri, apples, and some mind-blowingly good Chilean honey that included a bit of black truffles sprinkled in. No, there's not a lot of stuff here, but there's a wide variety and everything was excellent. I highly recommend trying it, especially the honey!  Originally, we had planned to order two taco plates, but ended up cutting it down to just a single shared order of three tecate skirt steak tacos. We ordered these in Old Town and I place them right up there with some of the better asada tacos we've ever tried. Once again, they did not disappoint.  For dessert, we opted for the Guatemalan chocolate pastilla. A weird name to say the least, as I've always associated pastillas with medication that temporarily solves problems. In reality, it's a long strand of chocolate that also includes a scoop of tres leches ice cream and some fig and guajillo glaze. Overall, it was a decent choice in comparison to the churros we tried previously.  Server was kind of iffy. We were never asked if we wanted drinks, so I had to request one. Refills on chips took forever and our server, despite being very polite and friendly, seemed to disappear for very long amounts of time. We were seated at a tiny table in the middle of the ground floor that was barely able to accommodate our plates. Therefore, I can definitely see why a lot of people are complaining. One would assume that a place like this would have their service down to a science.  Griping aside, the food here is extremely good and for that and that alone, I'd feel dishonest in giving it anything less than a solid four stars. Overall, I still like the Old Town's more \"rustic\" feel as opposed to what this place is shooting for. But like I said, the food is where it counts.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to the Kierland Commons location.  The venue is beautifully redone with bright natural light and wood furniture. An intimate space with a good vibe.  Attentive staff.  Impressive bar.  Nice patios for cooler months.  For brunch, we had the deliciously, spicy, stew as a shared app, Mission Marys were a nice pairing.  The waffles chicken entree was amazing.  The green chilaquiles fell a bit short of expectations, needing either more sauce or fewer tortilla chips.  Will return to try the tableside guac as well as huevos rancheros available on weekends."}
{"text":"I had a delicious meal here last night while I was visiting for a conference. Our table started off with some guacamole and street corn- both yummy, but the corn was definitely the real star! We got 3 different types of tacos (3 to an order) so we could try one of each-- butternut squash, barbacoa (minus pickles & raisins), and the steak. All pretty tasty, but the steak was my personal favorite. Due to some service challenges, the restaurant sent us a complimentary pumpkin bread pudding dessert, which was amazing. We all left stuffed and happy!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful ambiance! The service we had was attentive and the drinks were executed perfectly by Tommy our bartender for the evening. We recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Kierland dining scene. A bit expensive but that's to be expected from this area. Food is fantastic and very flavorful. Servers are attentive. Sat inside but really looking forward to sitting out on the balcony. Dogs allowed on the patio."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and both times have had a fun and tasty time.  BUT IF YOU WANT A CONVERSATION - EAT OUTSIDE.  Especially on the weekends.  The upstairs - outside eating is fantastic.  One gets away from the street noise.  Now for the food.  Very unique flavors and spices.  We love everything we have ordered.  Some more than others.  So far, we have only eaten our dinners by ordering all appetizers - they are great.  They dinner look fantastic though.  If you like complex flavors and out of the ordinary food - GO.  Looking for Meat and Potatoes - not so much."}
{"text":"One of my friends was the head chef at Mission in Old Town, then was asked to open Kierland location. This restaurant is quite literally THE best restaurant of its type in the area - hands down. Its a busy place because its so good, but the wait is worth it if there are any doubts. Service is excellent and consistent. Staff know their stuff and if its slow, its likely very busy. I can't really fault any of the food - the portions, flavors and choices, as well as the presentations, are all excellent. I have been to Mission many times, with friends and without, as I fall back to this place because it is always consistently excellent.."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the tableside guacamole, duck carnitas empanadas, grilled street corn, and pork shoulder tacos.  Red sangria was a bit bland."}
{"text":"After leaving Tommy Bahamas because the service was so incredibly slow we came to Mission.  Great service, really well made drinks and delicious food. Can't recommend this enough. Cool atmosphere, fun crowd, great food. Just go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Delicious food, moody atmosphere, and pleasant staff. I was hesitant when I saw this newer location with a lower rating, but I was not disappointed. I only wish I would have saved more room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the old town location for years. The lack of professionalism and customer service at this location is disappointing. My experience tonight will make me reconsider visiting the mission, zinc, fat ox or house brassiere in the future"}
{"text":"Not really impressed with the food at all. Giving three stars simply because we loved the table side guacamole and the man who made it! Our server really really REALLY hyped up the concept of the food, the business itself and the creator of the menu and made it seem like the food was \"to die for\". I ordered the green chili duck confit which she mentioned was the best duck in Arizona and my husband ordered the Jadori chicken. Neither one of us truly enjoyed the food. Both plates came out in less than 10 minutes on a Friday night (weird) and mine was barely warm more on the cold side, doubtful it's supposed to be that way. The duck is supposed to be brushed with green chili but the dish itself has no flavor of that at all so that was misleading. The meat was dry and tough and the mushrooms were so hard and chewy I couldn't even bite into them or cut them with my fork. Not a fan of the Jadori chicken, too many flavors going on that don't really mix with the palette. If we came back it would definitely be for drinks and guac only and that's about it."}
{"text":"Taco meat was fatty and the shrimp was not cooked all the way. The table side guacamole is always a winner."}
{"text":"Great food.  Wow.   Service was impeccable.  Food was delicious.  Wonderful atmosphere.   We sat outside as the weather was gorgeous.   Thanks.  Kathryn was phenomenal."}
{"text":"The absolute worst restaurant in Kierland Commons. Nasty hostesses, INCOMPETENT managers, untrained waiters and fair food.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The service is phenomenal. I love the atmosphere. Definitely one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Shattered glass and more shattered glass.  When you thought that it was done, crash of glass can be heard.    Considering there were only a dozen people in the place when we were there, our table was the only one that didn't break glassware.   Who knew those uptight Scottsdale folks could be so clumsy?    In any case, the tacos that I had were very flavorful. It was rather odd that the tortillas were a little larger than a silver dollar and I had to eat them with a fork.  I understand what the chef was going for, but it was still odd.    I also had the duck.  It didn't live up to the hype that the server praised it to be.  I would recommend it still.    Overall, I recommend the place on a not so busy day because the acoustics can easily be deafening with large numbers and all of the glass breaking."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!   Been to the mission in old town and was not impressed because of the service was terrible but this experience was completely different.   Our server Alyssa was extremely helpful, nice, and knew her menu well. All her recommendations were superb and the margaritas were excellent.  The decor was very impressive, from the chandeliers, comfortable seats, and marble walls.  Will surely return, very excited I found a new spot!   5/5"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very loud, the temperature fluctuations were uncomfortable and the price is extremely high with small portions.  It was a frustrating and awkward experience."}
{"text":"Safe to say I won't be back.    Came here as I've heard nothing but great reviews from The Mission Old Town.  Well this was plain and simple an utter disappointment. The only reason for two stars was the service was decent.    First off, let me start by saying no restaurant especially one that portrays itself as a finer dining experience should ever offer its guest water that taste of dirty dish rags.  Immediately that set the tone for the evening.  Mentioned it to the server who even acknowledged that yeah our water is bad, but we can buy a bottle if we like.    The food while wasn't terrible it definitely wasn't exceptional to justify $14 for tacos.  The Mexican corn we ordered off the cob had far too much dressing and was over seasoned with what seamed like last minute dusting of chili powder.   I love spicy but it tasted of raw spice.     Thanks but No Thanks Mission; sadly you aren't worth a second chance with so many better options to choose from."}
{"text":"Posh restaurant near the Scottsdale shops. The ambiance is romantic and trendy.   The service was friendly and attentive by all.  We drank the Tempranillo from rioja, the Malbec and a Cab - no one complained. And we all ordered a 2nd, so I'd say the wine selection was pretty good.   For an appetizer, we ordered the guacamole. This is a MUST order. They make it at the table and have a smorgasbord of add-ons; onions, garlic, tomatoes, pepitas, cotija cheese, Serrano peppers,etc. They also provide a chipotle salsa. The salsa wasn't for my taste buds as I'm not a fan of smoked but my friends seemed to like it. And there was more than enough guacamole.   For dinner I ordered the spinach side salad and the filet mignon skewer. The salad was way overdressed and I'm not sure I believe the steak was filet mignon.  Other than the guacamole, the food was just okay. However I'd go back for the guacamole and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"We had an opportunity to enjoy a delicious meal at The Mission Kierland. A very unique and delicious menu. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night as well."}
{"text":"We had reservations for a dinner out and was appreciative they actually seat you at the time you make your reservation for. No extra waiting etc. Great ambiance. If sitting inside, the acoustics is the place doesn't lend to much talking and it's very dimly lit. We got the table side guacamole and a few of the cocktails for starters. The table side guac was good but kinda lost its charm when it gets scooped out of the mortar bowl it's made in, into a swanky silver, tall goblet looking thing. Oh well...  We got the sea bass and the chicken. I forget what they were called. I can attest they were tasty. I think my husband enjoyed his sea bass much more than I enjoyed my chicken. It was good. Just not wow tasty good. We got this chocolate thing for desert which was probably my favorite of the night :)  I plan on trying the mission again during the day and hopefully I can see my food and enjoy it more. Overall 3.5 star experience in totality, but rounding up."}
{"text":"The service was great here. Friendly staff, seated us quickly, very friendly in general. The reason for the three stars is the food was mediocre in my opinion. For what we paid for it, this was restaurant is extremely overrated. I'm ok paying a lot for a meal but this was just simply not worth it"}
{"text":"Great food & service, only problem is the excessive noise.  We could barely hear each other talk...."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant. The ambiance is cool and slightly upscale. There are two bars that you can walk in and sit down at, the wait is usually a little while. I went to the upstairs bar and the bartenders were really nice, I didn't catch their names but they (man and woman) had an awesome way of paying attention to each person there and making all the drinks upstairs. I had the crispy cola-lime pork and some homemade flour tortillas. The pork was AMAZING. I had the pumpkin bread pudding for dessert and it was so, so, so, good. If you're in the area, go!"}
{"text":"Totally overrated and overpriced! If you're looking for trendy this is for you but our experience was disappointing from start to finish. The entire menu is way overpriced for the quality of food and drink. The service is another issue, not very attentive or knowledgeable and very quirky staff. Only 2 draft beers on the menu which we tried to order both and they where out of both. Way too many other choices to think about coming back here again. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Ate at the bar and service was on point. I believe his name was Shawn...could be wrong but really liked him. The food was amazing. The tacos were great and the table side guac was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"We were greeted and service was great!  Once the waitress knew that we weren't going to order the $42 tacos or any of the very overpriced meals, we never saw her again! Our party of 4 had 3 margaritas, 2 beers & 2 glasses of Chardonnay and an order of guacamole & chips.  Our bill was astronomical!!!!"}
{"text":"Update - I had such a great experience here initially that I brought my family for Christmas Eve. Very rude service. I get that it's rough to work on the holidays but my family wasn't getting the dry humor and felt a bit ignored early on. Portions are very underwhelming. I was ultimately a bit embarrassed to have suggested here. The kind blonde waiter who made our guac was wonderful and redeemed the experience a bit by being super friendly to everyone, but he was not our main waiter. This place is too pricey to have bad experiences over bad attitudes. :(  We love this place! We ended up at The Mission after celebrating a birthday dinner at Postino (which never disappoints!) and actually wished we had started here once we saw the menu. The service was outstanding, so fun and friendly. Beautiful ambience. Can't wait to come back here for a meal!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at The Mission! We were frequent goers to the old town location and were ecstatic when we heard about the new location opening in Kierland Commons. The aesthetic of the new location is amazing! And the food + drinks are just as incredible here as at the other location!  We were a party of 7 and were well taken care of by all staff members. (TIP: call and make a reservation, we did and had no issue being sat right away!)  MUST HAVES: - table side guacamole - street corn (I recommend off the cob, perfect for sharing)   - tostadas - crispy pork + cola lime glaze - any + all tacos (we especially enjoyed the sharing option) - pumpkin bread pudding   Delicious and did not disappoint!! We loved the friendly and attentive staff! Our server Kace was great at explaining the menu, as was Jamar.   We can't wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Fantastically delicious food with great presentation along with outstanding service. My wife and I were here for a special night out during our honeymoon to enjoy a nice meal without the kids and with out any sort of a rush to eat and leave. Our servers, Jaimé(in-training) and Pepé(the trainer) we outstanding. They answered any questions that we had with impeccable detail, were not short recommendations when asked, and did not make us feel rushed at all. They made sure that we had a truly amazing experience to celebrate our honeymoon. We had two appetizers, two orders of tacos, two cocktails, a hand crafted tequila flight(put together by Pepé based on experience and knowledge of tequila), two entrees, and two deserts. Everything was impeccable looking and tasting. They made the evening even more special by paying for some of our order(greatly appreciated). We will definitely be back and I recommend this place to anyone looking to have an amazing dinning experience."}
{"text":"This place was really good.  I had the best meal so far this year here.  I ate the swordfish over paella, very flavorful and fish was cooked perfectly.  I considered returning. The following evening, but we had a group dinner at the hotel.  I'll be sure to return here in my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this is one of the best dining experiences that I have had in a while. A good friend recommended that i try this restaurant, and she swore that i wasn't going to be disappointed. hate to admit it, but she was right. from the moment that we walked in, until the moment that we left, the service was top notch.   We were greeted by friendly smiles. sitting down we were greeted by our server, Erica, who is amazing. She is sweet and is knowledgeable of the menu to a point where she makes everything sound so appealing. She knows what to recommend as well depending on the taste that you are going for. Try the avocado margarita, its refreshing, yet creamy at the same time.   Erica was so thorough on the menu. so thorough that she was able to say how great the duck was going to be cooked in the duck empandas. she knows that duck is a touchy food as it can sometimes be over cooked and dry, or chewy and not flavorful. the pork lettuce wraps were delicious, and the meat was cooked to perfection. so tender, and flavorful.  for the entree, i had the chorizo percheta(sp)... good heavens. so tender and so flavorful along with the white bean puree. the flat iron steak was also tender and juicy where it was so soft in my mouth and i had no problem chewing it.   for dessert we had the pumpkin bread pudding and the churros. delicious! the pumpkin bread pudding had the perfect consistency, and it was so soft that my friend and i wanted to order another one.   the restaurant has a modern feel to it, and it reminded me of dining in vegas.   between Erica, Andres, and the delicious food, this was a great experience, and i highly recommend that you visit this restaurant.   keep up the amazing work! :)"}
{"text":"The Mission is clearly the the most trendy place to be at the Kierland Commons, yet we were able to find a table without a reservation on a busy Thursday night. The inside is quite beautiful, and is worth seeing if not for the food, but that reason alone.   We shared chips and guacamole, as well as the complementary salsa which was deliciously spicy and hearty, not a watered down salsa like you so often get at other restaurants. Our waiter also sent out what we though was a complementary bowl of street corn, which was to die for. I started with the chipotle gem lettuce salad, which was very small but packed with flavor. They were a little heavy handed with the dressing as well. I then ordered the mahi mahi tacos. Our waiter warned us that they were small, but I thought, \"I've seen small tacos before.\" These would probably be eaten while wearing a pair of magnification glasses because they were in fact the smallest tacos I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, they were very good, just SMALL.  Overall our waiter was great, except at the end of the night we realized that the street corn which we hadn't ordered had been charged to our table as well as a beer that someone in our party had initially ordered but then cancelled. Our waiter had brought it out anyway sayin that it was on the house. Apparently that was only in spirit, because we ended up getting charged for both. I wouldn't let that deter you from going, it's worth trying their food, just be weary of any free offers."}
{"text":"Side note before the review: One reason to visit this place for me was that while visiting 'Mission Taco' in St. Louis, it was a crazy success! If this place was a success, I was going to visit every place with 'Mission' in the name without hesitation. It is my mission and I accept.   Why this place only has 3.5 stars is beyond me. With my brunch meal, it's worth five stars easily... and I'm sure with your meal/experience it's certainly worth four stars.   While looking for places in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go on a brunch date with my lovely lady, I asked the Phoenix Yelp community manager. One of the places on the list was The Mission. As I glanced over the brunch menu, I noticed Red Chilaquiles and Green Chilaquiles. I knew that I just had to go!  We went ahead and made reservations with OpenTable for Saturday morning when they open. We didn't need to though. There were a few groups that came in during our hour there, but it wasn't overcrowded at all.   Upon arrival, we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. With the warm weather, OUTSIDE was obvious. I had a few issues with sitting on the patio outside. 1: The birds endlessly flying around. 2: That particular shopping mall intersection allowed for more through-traffic than I wanted. My meal was still flawless but I think I would've enjoyed myself inside more this time.  The Food: When I looked at the menu eariler in the week, I knew I was going to have a tough time choosing which Chilaquiles I wanted(The red or the green). The red ones have red chiles while the green ones have serrano peppers.   I eventually decided on the green - Fried corn tortillas & smoked chicken, serrano, avocado, cilantro, fried egg & cotija. WOW! What a dish! For the Louisville audience out there... I've found Chilaquiles better than Con Huevos. The cilantro stood out to me. There was something about the cilantro flavor clashing with the chicken and serrano that really brought out the right kind of spice.   My date also devoured her chorizo scramble.   Since it was a vacation, I decided to splurge a little and order a third entree. This third entree acted as part appetizer-part dessert. I ordered the blueberry-banana pancakes with bacon maple syrup. The caramelized bananas stood out. While the syrup was tasty with the bacon floating in it, I didn't need much of it. It was still a worthy dish although it had nothing on my green chilaquiles.  I don't have any real complaints here except for the mimosas. Eleven bucks for one mimosa when you can go anywhere here in Louisville for weekend brunch and get one for a few bucks.  Special shoutout to the guy refilling water. I tend to gulp the water when I eat out. He kept me filled! Kudos to him!  I'll be sure to stop in here for those green chilaquiles the next time I'm in Arizona. My only regret is waiting until my last day to visit this place. I'm sure they have many other things on their lunch and dinner menu that would knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Very disorganized new start.  Waiter making guacamole had to keep being interrupted. Other wait staff kept moving around patio chairs. Chips and salsa was good . Salad was good. Tried to go back Friday evening and was basically chastised for no reservations and told that the kitchen was so backed up even though plenty of open seating. One hour wait so said forget It - went to Zinc instead. Surprised to find out same owners. Need to get it together at mission."}
{"text":"I love this place! Staff is always wonderful. Food is delish. The guac is amazing. Ambience is awesome, though a little loud."}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome staff.  We came here for dinner to celebrate my birthday.  Everything that we ordered tasted fresh and flavorful.  The complimentary chips and salsa are tasty.  I also tried the Grilled Street Corn, Roast Corn Gordita, and Brussel Sprout Tacos.  I would order all of them again.  Definitely a must try if you haven't been.  One of the best experiences ever."}
{"text":"I take what I said back-  the only thing worse than the staff is the food.   You be the judge!"}
{"text":"I would like to preface this with this fact: This is the first time I have ever given a restaurant a one star review or even thought about giving less than a 3 star. A group of me and my friends had a reservation for 9pm. We arrived at 8:50pm and an old man at the front (who was using a walker), that honestly looked like he was a guest of the restaurant, just standing on the patio not wearing a uniform or name tag and told my friend, \"We are at capacity.\" When my friend told him we have a reservation, and continued to walked pass him, he became very upset and yelled at him in an upsetting tone to come back. My friend could not hear him because it was very busy. After my friend checked in and came back outside, a police then came up to us and told us that he was the owner of the restaurant and that he did not want us to dine at his restaurant. WHAT?!? We were all shocked and confused. It seemed as if the owner got his ego bruised that we did not know who he was?? Two of my buddies are people of a different race than white and we all feel the real reason that he didn't want us to eat there was because he did not want people of those middle eastern cultures eating at his restaurant. This was such a disappointing experience and really made us all upset.  Some people saw what happened who were leaving the restaurant and told us, \"The food wasn't great. You guys are better off going somewhere else. This place is way overrated.\" We took their advice and left and went down the street to Tommy Bahamas where we had a wonderful meal and experience.  None of our group of 7 will ever support this restaurant again and I hope none of you reading this do as well. It was honestly the worst experience I have ever had a restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, gotta try the Margaritas the MISSION MARGARITA is the best margarita I've ever tasted. The table side guacamole is literally delicious. My wife and I took a friend who hated guacamole then he had the Mission Guac, and he became hooked. Immediately. The street tacos are small in size but bursting with flavor. This is a must."}
{"text":"Matt Carter's incredible food, at the Kierland. Not the incredible decor of the original Mission in Scottsdale.. but fabulous service. Kenneth was absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Food excellent. Service painfully slow (over  2hours) Manager was very. Understanding and comped 30% of meal. Will be back because of that. Guacamole a must. Duck confit and pork bellies also terrific."}
{"text":"While on vacation in Phoenix/Scottsdale, the fella decided that we would be brunching on one of our last days in town. He made a restaurant selection and made reservations on OpenTable for when they opened on a Saturday morning. I am not sure if it is well known that they do brunch, or if in the area brunch is more a Sunday thing, but reservations were not needed. By the time we left only two other small groups had been seated. But it didn't hurt to earn OpenTable points...  We were staying at the Westin Kierland, which is very near the Kierland Commons, so we were able to walk to the Mission, window shopping along the way before the restaurant opened.  The fella already knew he was going to get chilaquiles and only had to decide on red or green. I don't tend to look at the menu ahead of time, so I had some choices to make. We decided to also share the banana blueberry pancakes, and I settled on the chorizo scramble.  The pancakes were fine, but the syrup really is what is special about the dish, with bits of bacon in it and a smoky flavor. I'm glad we shared it, and I am also glad I went with the scramble. Because the chorizo scramble is DELICIOUS!! So so good. It has slices of cased chorizo sausage, rather than the always overly greasy ground/crumbled chorizo. It was super flavorful, the eggs were great and the grits! The chipotle grit were a wonderful element in the dish. Not too spicy, the right consistency (for my personal liking)...I had to remind myself that I was in public, where an adult licking the bowl is frowned upon.  Our server was friendly and the space was nice. We were able to sit outside because the weather was lovely.  The one star is knocked off because...$11 for a single mimosa is mind boggling to me. There are places you can get a full pitcher for only slightly more than that...and the bloody marys cost way less. There was nothing particularly special about the mimosa either, so I would encourage everyone to...drink something else. It isn't worth the money here.  But everything else about our brunch experience was wonderful! It made me wish we had more time in the area so we could have come back to try their regular dinner menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to check this place out. We were going to leave however Kat and Shawn made us feel so welcome so we ended up sharing some appetizers. Am I glad we did. I thought my guacamole was the best. Not anymore! This was the best guacamole I ever had and I nearly fell over dead when the gal made it in front of us! The roasted corn was PERFECT everything was delicious. We really liked the service. As restaurant owners we can only dream of hiring such wonderful employees! See you next year!"}
{"text":"Years ago I thought The Mission was one of the best in the Valley. Now, I don't think so. The poor service, poor menu selections, and ARROGANCE from the wait staff has moved me to never return and never recommend. Too bad and sad but true......I feel compelled to tell others....I guess I just did! :("}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab High end Mexican cuisine in Phoenix! I love this new location, I personally feel the old town location gets a little too crowded. The table side guacamole is a must and my husband is in love with the short rib tacos! I enjoyed the butternut squash tacos with potatoes and chorizo on the side. Service is excellent and table presentation is very pleasing to the eyes."}
{"text":"SUCH A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL LOCATION but I've been to this location twice now and I must say I am not impressed with the service, sadly. The food is ALWAYS delicious I've never once had a bad experience with the food at either location. I can always depend on the mission for delivering outstanding meals consistently THAT I will give this place but the service I received was not only embarrassing (because I was brought a first timer here after ranting and raving how amazing it usually is) but it was not up to the standard of service I'm used to receiving at the mission. Our sever was rushed, busy, forgetting drinks, menus, food items entrees brought out at separate times stuff like that. I will definitely be back to the old town location... the Kierland location... ehhh maybe not"}
{"text":"Ate here May 6th for my son's birthday. We had reservations, and we were shoved into the corner near the LOUD TALKERS.  Almost requested to move - sad I didn't.   First, slow service to start. Waited too long to get a glass of water. Chips and salsa were at least 10 minutes after being seated.   Came time to order, the waiter was knowledgeable. He directed my hubby and I to split the rib-eye - shouldn't have listened should have gone with the other steak. Ribeye was ordinary at best.  My son had the other steak - delicious. Ordered the guacamole - oh my YUMMY!!!!!! They said table side service - kinda thought it would be fun to watch. Nope they did it behind our backs- oh well  Coffee press coffee was yummy.   For the money, I would not return. My son liked it for his birthday - that was all that matters."}
{"text":"We didn't have a reservation and there were several open tables. Even though they were booked with reservations they still found us a table. They are still training everyone, but I think this is going to be a great team once everyone gets more up to speed on the restaurant details. We have also been to the other location in old town, but this location is much closer to us. The food in our opinion was more flavorful then the other location. Strongly recommend people to check out this place at least once."}
{"text":"RESOLUTION CLOSED BY ME - Tammy the manage never returned my call or email after our initial conversation where she stated she would do this and that (which was reasonable) she did not keep 100% of what she promised.  She did however credit back one food item.  Back story -  It was my birthday dinner, been wanting to try it  forever - our daughter and son in law LOVE the one in Old Town.   My husband made a reservation making sure they knew it was a special occasion.  In addition my son called from Chicago and spoke with some at which time he ordered 2 raspberry martini's and a dessert and left a personal note for me; he was required to send via email his credit card.  Well, unfortunately, not only was the filet mignon Med rare verses the well done that my husband ordered (waitress didn't come back to see how things were until we were over it, it was too late at that point) they never said a word about the special occasion, nor did they bring our martini's or desert our son pre-ordered!  So needless to say, they blew my birthday.  I think just one of those issues is one too many but shit happens right?  But to have so many things NOT come together is so very significant and to blow us off like they've chosen to do us unacceptable.    Don't waste your time or money here - go to the one in Old Town or somewhere else.  There are many, many awesome places - like this kind of food, like hot spots.....check out Richardson's or Rokerij         Put of respect I'm show some respect given their reputation and see how they resolve a major issue we had.  If it is not resolved to our satisfaction I'll provide more details!"}
{"text":"Came here for girls night on Wednesday. We made a reservation for 7 and only 5 of us ended up showing. Arrived early and was told our table wouldn't be ready for another 15 minutes after the time our reservation was made... annoying but ok we understand you can't really make the previous table leave.. anyway finally 25 minutes after our reservation and after paying 15$ per for the basic margarita at the bar we finally sat.. overall we left full and satisfied after dinner. This place is a little expensive for what you get.. I paid 14$ for 3 TINY corn tortilla tacos... but I ate enough chips and salsa to leave not hungry...  Beautiful restaurant.. ok service.. we had empty cocktails and waters most the time but she was a nice girl. If your looking for a pretty restaurant and are willing to spend a pretty penny this spot could be for you. It was my first time here and on a special occasion I would come back."}
{"text":"Per the thanksgiving holiday- I want to give thanks to Mario our waiter at Mission- my boyfriend and I are avid Spanish restauranteurs and what better than the heart of Scottsdale to fulfill it. Aside from the ambiance you will be spoiled with bar-nun service and one-on-one catering to your likeness to make sure your visit is hands down the best. Mario we appreciate your service and better yet becoming a friend that we enjoy visiting when we come in town from Kansas City!  We asked him to sign our cork. That's how much we adored him. Thankyou for spoiling us. We appreciated your time and consideration"}
{"text":"I will start with the positives.  The waiter and manger apologized for ruining our meal and the manager eventually made it over and sent my friend dessert and the table some shots.  Would I ever come back here? Absolutely not. We were here one time before with excellent food but horrible service so we were willing to try again. Last night the food and the service were both horrible.   Even though I made a reservation a week in advance for a birthday celebration and the restaurant was not busy, we were placed at a boring table up a huge flight of stairs that stared at an elevator.  (If your restaurant is empty, please give you guests a choice of where to sit). Or when you confirmed my reservation on the phone, please ask my seating preference. That was the worst table in the restaurant.   We started with drinks and chips and guacamole. They told me they would bring me a separate salsa since I have a gluten allergy and they put soy sauce in their salsa (a first for me). Well I asked for that salsa at least 3 times and it took 20 minutes to get it to me.  One we ordered our entrees, it was a 60 minute wait. The dirty chip dishes were not cleared for 45 minutes. The waiter approached my husband and told him he \"forgot\" to put his order in.  So we waited another 15 minutes and all of the food came out together. My medium rare steak came out well done so I sent it back and did not get a replacement for 20 minutes when our party had completely finished their meals. I had the pleasure of dining while everyone else watched me. My husband's chicken was dry. He said it was not good. The other 2 guests had the grouper which was pushed hard by our server. They both described it as \"okay\". They also ordered a side of fries and had to ask for them twice and they were brought during mid-meal. They needed ketchup so they waited an additional 10 minutes for that.  People who work in the food industry need to be trained on food allergies. Our server asked me 3 times to describe gluten and then proceeded to recommend some cheese bread as my side. He also kept asking me if I was allergic to cheese so to say he was confused is an understatement.   Always so disappointing when you plan a fun night for your friends and the meal/service  was a disaster. $300 for sub par food and bad service is not acceptable. Thanks for the dessert and shots but that really doesn't cut it. We won't be back and I imagine the Mission may not make it very long at the Kierland location if they don't greatly step up their game."}
{"text":"Let's just say this was a horrible restaurant from start to finish. The menu selection is very weak. I asked the waiter if I could substitute beef instead of chicken in my tacos and he said \"no, the chef doesn't like that\". I asked to speak to the chef and was told he wasn't there. So, let me get this straight, no where on the menu does it state \"no substitutions\" and the guy who doesn't allow them isn't there??? What the heck?! Even after politely informing the waiter that I am the customer, he didn't care.  Ok, so I ordered something I didn't want because it appeared to be the most palatable thing on the menu...the chicken tacos. Warning, they are 3 inches in diameter and you only get 3.  You better not be hungry if you come here because the food is tasteless and you barely get any. I got about 2 small bites of chicken on each taco. One of my table mates got a steak order and he couldn't eat half of it because it was too fatty. My chicken was fatty too. Gross. The food is over priced, the food is crappy and the service was mediocre at best. The waiter tipped over a beverage. I will NEVER return here. Every aspect of this place is bad. A very poorly run restaurant. The customer should be top priority. Anyways, you can judge for yourself if you so choose."}
{"text":"Delicious!  The food was outstanding!  The table side guacamole was probably the best guacamole ever had.  I had the flat iron steak and my husband had the pork/chorizo dish. Outstanding!  Joe our server did a great job!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the friendly bartenders, specifically the gal with the heavy eyeliner who's a total doll, but that is about it. The drinks are incredibly overpriced, as is the food which is absolutely some of the worst I've ever had. I've given this place no less than 10 tries, which admittedly is probably overkill, but hey... Slim pickings in Kierland, you know? Anyhow, I've tried a lot of the different items on the menu, and they're all disgusting. Seriously - I wouldn't toss that around if it weren't the truth. The ambiance is so-so, but it's always so loud (hello, accoustics?) that it's impossible to hold any type of conversation. Mostly, I just smile and nod while at this particular restaurant.   Overall, avoid. The takeaways: Overpriced, and gross."}
{"text":"Went for cocktails and an appetizer early Tuesday afternoon and sat out on the patio. Our server was great, very professional and attentive. The cucumber jalapeno cocktail was delish! The Savignon Blanc was one of the best I've tried, and the shrimp appetizer was amazing! Looking forward to coming back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!   You feel good as soon as you walk in.   The bar is gorgeous and the ambiance is warm and relaxing.     The cross behind the bar is striking. The service was terrific- very pleasant staff.    The guacamole was made eight at the table- simply divine!    I enjoyed the fish tacos and my friend enjoyed the pesole.    Definitely a place to go for a drink and appetizer or to enjoy a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"Have made it a priority to visit this restaurant for the outstanding food and exceptional service. Due to scheduling issues, I wasn't able to make a reservation and was worried that I wouldn't be able to get a table. My girlfriend and I went early to see if they would be able to accommodate us in the old Scottsdale location and we were amazed that they were able to seat us very quickly without a reservation on a Saturday night. To make a long story short, our service was exceptional, the food was amazing and the manager, Noah, went above and beyond to ensure that we had a memorable and amazing experience. We cannot say enough about the knowledgeable staff and outstanding food."}
{"text":"The food is quite good here, but you're definitely in for a longer dining experience (reading the other reviews, it looks like they are still working out the process kinks). Overall, I don't think it's worth what you pay for in terms of service/taste. We were able to get seated at a common table right away near the bar, but the service was slow and took a while to even get water, which is a must for me in these warming temperatures. The kitchen was also pretty backed up so it took a while to get our starters and then entrees. I would have expected such a large restaurant to also be equally equipped to handle full tables.   I got a taste of the guac, tacos, fries, green beans, grits and grouper entree. The table side guac is amazing and will make you want to devour it by the spoonful. I think it's pricey for something I can easily make at home, but I will happily eat it if the company is picking up the tab. The grouper was very good, as were the Brussels sprouts that came with it, but the other food wasn't too special. I also thought the tacos, while they looked very good, were a little ridiculous since they come as three two-bite morsels... They weren't so good I would choose them over my cheaper food cart tacos."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are outstanding. So was service and the decor. Highly recommend the beer battered shrimp tacos. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Had reservations at 8:30pm, got seated at a tiny table that felt like we were sitting in the middle of the hallway due to all of the foot traffic and it being right next to the kitchen & bathrooms. We requested to move and we did, table was still poorly located but better nonetheless. Took 20 minutes for a waitress to get our drink order, and then another 30 for her to bring them. The table next to us however were seated after us, received their drinks, appetizers and put in their dinner order before our waitress ever stopped by again to get our food order. Overall, sat there for 57 minutes and never was asked what we wanted to eat. We asked for the check and the waitress practically begged us not to tell the manager (we didn't request a manager, just the check so we could get out of there after wasting an hour). Overall, poor service and will not return."}
{"text":"First things first, the bartender Sean, made this experience too notch. I love a server that knows enough about the menu, is excited about the food, and gives great reccomendations. We started with the Mission margarita.  I have not had a good margarita in a long time. So many places think sweet and sour and tequilla a margarita make, Don't let the egg whites scare you, it is truly a draft cocktail. Opt for the Gran Marnier float.   The tacos are outnof this world. We did the pork shoulder for 2. Great fresh ingredients.   Sadly we didn't have it in us for desert. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this relatively new spot and its first impression was incredible. The space is very well decorated and has a great open feeling to it.  We started with drinks at the bar with a very friendly (and fast) bartender. A few rounds of skinny and strawberry/banana margaritas and we were sat.  The food was all incredible, from the guac, to the tacos, to our main courses. Everyone was friendly, but the service was very slow, almost to the point of it seeming intentional.  Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Second time at the Mission for a business dinner. Unique decor with mission theme. Amazing tables side guacamole, and unique variety of American Mexican style entrees. shareable include pork belly, sweet corn, and empanadas. Overall very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times and always had a good time. They completely changed the interior and exterior from the former restaurant and did an excellent job at it. Has a very upscale yet casual feel to it. Bar staff and wait staff are friendly and knowledgeable of the products. I've been going to their original location and Old Town for many years. They are different but the same. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is perfect, great energy and the decor is amazing.  Prices are a bit high in the bar for the wine by the glass.  Ordered average wine and 2 glasses with tip was $42.  Then dinner was good, close to great, but for $38 for the filet, I would have expected more than about 4 oz of steak with no more than 3 bites of the poblano grits (they were great!) and about 6 great beans.   We ordered the table side guacamole before and was concerned we would not be able to eat the main dish, but based on the size, no problem.  Service was excellent.  Disappointed with the meal portion based on $38 for the main dish."}
{"text":"...a wee bit pricey ...comparatively speaking.  BUT, it's a wonderful setting. Whether you're inside or out.    Margaritas are good ...but not divine.  Gotta say Barrio Queen does a teeny better. Is more competitively priced.   I do love their guacamole.  Gosh it's GOOD.    OVERALL someplace I keep going because the service is great.  The food is better than ...and the setting is charming"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of enjoying a delicious brunch with a few friends here at the gorgeous Mission Kierland. The restaurant is stunning. High ceilings throughout the whole place. The center piece for this restaurant is definitely the ginormous cross which is displayed prominently behind the bar. It's hard to not marvel at its beauty when it's lit up so beautifully even during lunchtime.  Let's get down to the food. The guacamole was prepared tableside for us. All the fresh ingredients sat neatly atop a cart. After a few preferences questions, the waiter got to work prepping our guac. As you can see from my photo, it so pretty, and trust me on this.. it was delicious! Next up, we had the chilaquiles. To be honest, I have never had this dish before, and man, I was in for a treat. The perfectly cooked sunny side up got my attention right away. My 3 friends told me that this dish was their favorite. Next, we had the Kobe Dog {Kobe dog, wrapped in bacon, deep fried, smothered with green chili pinto beans, ahi ricotta sauce, and topped with radishes, red onions, pickled fresno, and mircro-cilantro}. Did you get all that?? All of this translate to one delicious bite and one happy belly. A must order for me. The tostada with ham hog and chicken were yummy. The chicken tacos were tasty and refreshingly light. We also had street corn on the cobs. The corn crab pancakes were very unique. I love the savory spins on an old classic. One of the many perks of brunching is I get to eat dessert for breakfast. The cinnamon waffles with candied pecans topped with  dulce de leche got me licking my plate. Sooo goood!! Chef Matthew came out to explain some of the dishes to us, and and the beautiful manager, Tammy, was constantly making sure we were having a great experience. I love how happy the staff here were. There were so many little celebrations going on while we were at brunch here. This restaurant is a fabulous place for getting together with friends or to celebrate life's little awesome moments. I'm so glad my friends and I came here for brunch. We left here full, satisfied, and definitely happy."}
{"text":"Very modern restaurant decor, with a massive cross at the bar, there is an upstairs also for seating.   Asked if we wanted chips for $6, they do table side prepared guacamole for $14.  Arrived at 12p on a Wednesday and was kind of empty and by 1230 started to fill up with people.   We ordered the pork shoulder tacos and the cubano torta with fried egg. The food was very good, 3 street size tacos with good portion of meat on the corn tortilla. Very juicy and flavorful street tacos. Originally when the cubano was served, I did not see the egg and later as a third of the sandwich was eaten they brought out the egg on a separate plate. The cubano was pretty tasty with the pork belly and ham with the pickle in the mix. Later when the egg was added, it got really messy with the egg dripping all over the sandwich.   Our waitress Maria, asked us if we wanted anything else and we said we were done and instead of bringing us the check, she placed on our table a pumpkin bread pudding dessert topped with ice cream sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and scotch. Was very warm and delicious, plus a nice touch and surprise.  The restaurant is very chic and upscale and also on the pricy side.   Will be back to try more items and probably the table prepared guacamole."}
{"text":"May have moved up North but going Downhill fast!!! The service was SO slow and the waiter was super nice (only reason for 2 stars) but he could only do so much and while he very purposefully wrote all my allergies down the kitchen kept serving me everything I can't eat...20 min to get a drink, $30 for a steak cut into three thin strips with no side offered and our old faves like the duck empanada were nasty. Never going back and not recommending to friends again! Better off going elsewhere like los somburros and saving the money, food is better there!"}
{"text":"Six of us dined at the The Mission, Kierland on December 22. Needless to say, the place was hopping. We had a great dining and service experience. The table side guacamole is some of the best I have had (and I do not usually like guacamole). My dining companions either had the salmon or swordfish while I had the beef filet and found the entrees to be top class as were the deserts. The service, led by Patricia, was flawless. The only reason for the absence of a fifth star is the the horrific noise level in the restaurant. It is not been buffered/padded for the number of patrons and the restaurant insists on blaring techno music through the loudspeakers. If the restaurant cares to attract customers who wish to have a pleasant conversation, please do something about the noise."}
{"text":"I love the mission, it's one of my top choices for a nice night out. I have made reservations and then had to alter them and they were always accommodating. The food is delicious and the service was great. I went for my birthday with a party of 12, where we sat downstairs; and a romantic dinner for 2 where we sat upstairs. I felt like they were 2 different atmospheres and both had a great feel. This location is new, with a more modern and open design, I also enjoy the closer, intimate atmosphere at the old town location. Don't forget to get the table side guac! It's a must."}
