{"text":"We had a $10 credit for skipping maid service during our stay so applied it to a couple slices of their pizza.  The employee tried to serve me cheese (I corrected her as soon as I saw her heating it up) and argued with me, saying that's what I ordered (I never order cheese) instead of pepperoni.  She did change it but it wasn't very good.  After eating it I wished I hadn't.  Costco pizza is far better.  Skip the pizza here unless it's for a little kid who isn't picky.  Go to Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan if you want amazing pizza.  It's worth the walk.
Next time I'd use my credit for bottled juice or water.  You can't really mess that up."}
{"text":"If ordering for more than 3 people, check out the High Roller special! 1 topping 18\" pizza, buffalo wings & garlic breadsticks for $30! good value because those items ala carte would equal $40 roughly.  pizza comes out in about 20 minutes for dough to rise and the fresh wings to cook through, they also deliver to the poker room for all you \"high rollers\" out there ;~)"}
{"text":"Compared to other pizza places in the Flamingo, you get good quality food at about half the price. We went here at 3am for pizza and around 11am for breakfast. Stop by if you're looking for something fast and cheap."}
{"text":"This is for 04/24!
I wanted to see if they can brew fresh decaf and when I asked the guy did it!
Wow! That is very nice service!
And their coffee is not too bad!"}
{"text":"It was a convenient spot on the way back to my room from a long day. I can't say the service was great because everyone looked ready to clock out and go home, they weren't much of the service with a smile type. The cheese pizza I got was terrible, I wish i would've gotten maybe a muffin instead."}
{"text":"Check out the garlic Parmesan chicken wings. The single slice and beer combo is the best value."}
{"text":"This is a cute little pick up& go restaurant inside of the Flamingo. They specialize in Pizza and wings, but I came during their breakfast special.

They have a beautiful wood burning oven in the back with a lot of different breakfast selections. They had delicious breakfast pizzas with eggs, sausage, and cheese, muffins, fruits, juices.
 
Also, right across from this eatery are tables and chairs for people to sit and enjoy their delicious breakfast. Right outside of the window there is a nature walk with Flamingos, pelicans, and other wild life animals."}
