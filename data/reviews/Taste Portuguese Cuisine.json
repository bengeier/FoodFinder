{"text":"Awesome little spot to get away! Great, simple menu which they stick too and specialize in. Amazing house salad with their home made cucumber dressing. A yummy app is the cod cakes which they make there. The chicken and F&C's are fab choices in picking a main. Also, who could pass up one of Grace's homemade desserts she bakes everyday!!! They also have daily lunch specials which are soooooooooo reasonable!! As good as it is, it could be better. Sometimes its a little too simple but I've always gone back no matter what!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with friendly service. Love the cod cakes and the steak platter for two. Prices are reasonable and the place is very family friendly. Also some nice micro brews on tap. Have been here multiple times and always a great experience."}

{"text":"Very nice place.  Reasonable prices. Good food.  Delicious desserts.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Simple, to the point and delicious. Not sure why it has 3 dollar signs, it should be like one dollar sign as the prices are more than reasonable. A nice dinner for two not including wine was only about $40 bucks. Will be back for sure."}
