{"text":"I stopped by Howards tavern on a whim.. from the outside it didn't look like much boy was I surprised.. I spoke with the young lady tending bar who informed me the bar was family owned for over fifty years and has over come tragedy when it burned to the ground a number of years ago.. she told me the family was determined to rebuild   anyways I ordered a fish and a side of fries for a lunch and not only was the food a good sized portion but tasted fantastic and there was something about the fries that were amazing.. I sat there talking with the smaller crowed of what seemed to be locals who informed me the every item on the menu is good..  there seemed to be a since of pride in the neighborhood (mostly guys) who were in there at the time that this was where they wanted to be because of the family values of a small business having lasted so long and it made me wonder if they were there because they new what an amazing impact they were probably having helping to support a quiet neighborhood bar as this..   since attending a number of weeks ago I have raved about the place and told many family and friends who too my surprise knew where it was and spoke of the rowdy rooters apparently a north hills football fan club that can be seen frequenting the tavern during indian football games..   I have recommended this place to my family and friends and encourage everyone to stop by and try it out"}

{"text":"Nice, quiet neighborhood bar.  A welcome change from it's noisy, somewhat unsafe neighbors down the road.  Only downfall: watch your language. Owner/bartender apparently doesn't like swearing, even in a bar.  Fair enough.  Older crowd, mostly beer drinkers.  They serve food, but don't seem to advertise it much.  Too bad, the burger I had there was very good, fresh and well made."}
