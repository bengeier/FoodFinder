{"text":"It's packed!!! it's buffet and there's food everywhere!!!  The ice cream bar lineup was 10 minutes long!!!  The food area feels a bit stuffy due to the crowds and the steam coming of the food counters.  This place is very popular, and it seems very family friendly. Lots of people, the food is decent, and there's a huge variety from sushi to salad, general tao to rosbeef, pasta to pastry, there's something for everyone, if you are craving a little bit of everything it's a good place to go.  As it is with all buffets, things tend to be sweet, greasy to help fill you up faster on less food. generally, it's quick and easy to come here, and for the price it's pretty good, however there are no stand out dishes.   All said and done, you are still gonna come here and eat, cuz we're all too greedy not to... :)"}
{"text":"I was there with my family , my son and my husband are vomiting with diarrhea. Very bad hygiene."}
{"text":"I had a good experience with my family  on Friday night. Courteous service. Food were well organized. Not too many pork dishes. Only two tables were withe 3 dishes of pork,usually tat is a problem 4 me. Cleane. Well aired,big windows, not too crowded. Foods r fresh.  I liked-   rose beef was the best ,two salade bar, garlic bread toasted, shrimps r really good. Not big desserts collection, I liked mile foil. The kitchen staff's were very helpful, n available.    Wat I didn't like: meats were not too hot, usual buffet quality sushi, I wished for more dessert.  Frog legs weren't fresh or not tasty, not alot of good looking waiters or waitress. There's was no labels for the food to know regardless staffs were available for  information.   I enjoyed it more than Seoul Chako. Not the same kind of food but environment was better for me, spacious. Overall I will go back.   So, bottom line is, if u r looking for spacious, kink of quite, well aired, wan to avoid pork, like rose beef,salads, garlic bread, sea foods. U will like it."}
{"text":"Buffet fourre-tout typique. Pizza, pâtes, steak, bouffe asiatique, à peu près tout y est à une qualité plus ou moins bonne selon le type de plat. ça me fait un peu penser au buffet à l'hôtel où j'étais quand je suis allé à Cuba il y a quelques années, mais sans la plage et les Cuba libres. Ah oui, et il faut payer aussi, c'est une autre différence. Et c'est assez cher, d'ailleurs, surtout quand on considère qu'on est loin, très loin d'un grand restaurant. Pour ce genre de buffet, je m'attendrais à payer 10$ environ, pas 15$ ou parfois plus, selon le moment choisi pour y aller (brunch, lunch ou souper)."}
{"text":"Went there for a weekday lunch. Decent, but not spectacular. They had a wide variety of meats, sometimes a little dry, and it seemed like most of the food on my plates were fried...but not complaining! Sushi was subpar, but expected, and most of the sauteed vegetables looked old. But they did have a large salad bar, and a variety of desserts. The red heating lamps annoyed me little, made everything seem way too similar. Lunch was definitely cheaper than dinner or brunch on the weekends. I'm not too sure if I would go back, and not because I did not like the food. I just can't afford the surgery for a second stomach."}
{"text":"Le choix pour la nourriture n'était vraiment pas grand, surtout les desserts. Le service était .. ordinaire. L'expérience dans ce restau ne m'a pas marqué disons. Les toilettes .. sans commentaire (j'y était en 2016, peut-être qu'ils ont rénové). Le point positif c'est qu'il y a du parking pas trop loin du buffet."}
{"text":"Casa Corfu was a hot mess.   It's a large buffet with a lot of variety but NOTHING AT ALL WAS LABELED. It was also just under $17 per person!  Everything is under red lights to keep things hot and to also hide the unappetizing look of the food.  Really poor food quality- most things were bland and uninteresting.   There's not a lot of room to move around with the massive crowds of pushy, hungry people. The staff were also pushy, rude and always seemed to be in the way.   Do not go especially if anyone in your party has allergies.   There are so many wonderful and more affordable places to eat in Montreal. Don't waste your money or belly room."}
{"text":"I came here last Wednesday for dinner and it was a little underwhelming, but expected. It's really your typical buffet - it's got a wide selection of food, but the food just isn't great. I would say out of everything I tried I enjoyed the mac and cheese the most.   The service was subpar. I was with a large group of people (around 30 or so) upstairs where we had reserved a few tables. We had one waitress who was clearly overwhelmed. She spilled water all over my feet and my friend's plate of food, didn't bring us our drinks until after we finished eating...someone definitely should have been helping her.   It's definitely not the newest, trendiest spot, but it's pretty clean. It's loud and cramped - at least on the night I went. Only other complaint would be I wish they had their food labeled because I didn't know what some were. All in all I probably won't return. If you're looking for an average price-friendly buffet, this is your spot though."}
{"text":"Very expensive 19.99 per person for week end and children 12 years old count as an adult, coffee very cold then I ask to reheat the waitress then want to charge for an other coffee... 2 adults and 4 children it end up to 115$ with cold coffees. Never go back again it is a worst buffet... Out there lot of choices and I like Score better they have nice salad and fruits bar.... Soft drinks and coffee all you can have... Specially healthy foods and soups all you can eat. Where as Casa Corfu  the soup is hiding with the waitress you don't even know as they have soup and  waitress does not even ask you anything for that at the end when I asked it was too late ... I don't feel like having soup any more ... Everything is poor in quality in the way they acts so cheap!"}
{"text":"What is good about this place? It's huge! Tons of seating, tons of food to choose from.  What is terrible about this place? Where to park? In the street? Good luck! What to eat? Good luck!  The food looks all yellow under the heat lamps and nowhere is any of the food tagged with a name. The salmon and cod looked like the same thing under their yellow heat lamps. I had to ask a \"cook\" what was what but his enormous accent made it difficult to understand anything he was saying.  All of the food was luke warm.  None of it was good.  And this was sunday on Mother's day so plenty of people around, how can anyone find this good?  I MUST MENTION that their restaurant that seats at least 500 people should think about renovating their 1970s cruddy restrooms/bathrooms/toilets. Unbelievable.  I've been coming here (dragged by family members) for at least 10 years and this place hasn't gotten any better.  Probably worse.  When most restaurants become better with experience these guys get worse.  It is hard to find a decent buffet, the best I found (and I'm not searching) is at the Casino.   This Casa Corfu has got to be the worst.  At least at FuLam the food is hot!  Casa Corfu is in my opinion Terrible."}
{"text":"Went on a thursday cost was $19 .I orderd a pitcher of coke and they said they had no pitcher of coke only by the cup and she also said no refills.We were 4 people so 3 out of 4 had water instead that was there lost . So i got my coke and had more ice than coke so i used the ice for the water.They do ave pitcher of beer.funny they dont have for soft drinks,anyways I ate and will not be returning anymore there.Better off going to fulam at least they serv pitchers of soft drink.I should of listen to my friend who also said the food is not as good anymore Goodbye corfo and hello my future restaurants"}
{"text":"Very blah food, barely even warm, who the heck knows how long it's been sitting in the pots? One waitress serving the entire main floor, doing several tasks at the same time, forgets your table, understandably so. Price for the early bird buffet is cheap, but you get what you pay for, better to pass."}
{"text":"Very diverse buffet, from sushi to pasta, BBQ meat, salads and desserts. I believe it is one of the best of its kind 24$ on a weekend evening is a very good price for what they offer"}
{"text":"Un buffet quoi.... Ordinaire... Les plats sont mal exécutés...ils sont fait en trop grande quantité.  La viande et les pâtes sont trop cuites. Les sauces trop salées.  Les plats de friture sont trop grasses... Et quand même dispendieux..."}
{"text":"A couple words about this place...   You get a lot of selections from pastas, meats and pastries. Not much is expected of the qualities of the food but the quantity is enough to suit your appetite.   The soups are not displayed with the rest of the food, the server brings you the soup of the day.    Overall, great place to hang out with the family. Don't expect a fancy night out."}
{"text":"Il y a plein de monde qui ont une opinion négative du Buffet Casa Corfu, et je pense à tort. Là si on se met à comparer un buffet all you can eat à un restaurant classique et bien on compare des pommes avec des oranges. Rien à voir :D Le Casa Corfu propose des plats dans des réchauds, qui évidemment peuvent être de moyenne qualité lorsque ça traîne un certain temps, mais je vous rassure la rotation des plats est systématique, rien ne traîne bien longtemps. Je suis habituée de venir pour les brunchs du week-end. Pour un prix assez raisonnable (environ 17$ par adulte) vous bénéficiez de nombreuses sections de nourriture: section à viennoiseries, plats chauds pour déjeuner (ufs, toasts, pancakes, saucisses, fèves, bacon....) autres plats chauds (différentes pâtes, riz, lasagne, légumes, frites, pizza), puis la section des viandes, la section sushis, le bar à salades et la section des desserts. On sort de là rempli, assurément. C'est parfait pour les enfants, car ils ont une gamme variée de nourriture qui plaît à tous les goûts et ils ont un tarif moindre pour les jeunes. Le service est efficace, on vient rapidement nous servir de l'eau et nous proposer thé, café, jus d'orange ou soupe du jour. PS le café n'est vraiment pas génial. Ils l'ont amélioré au cours des années, et encore ils peuvent faire mieux !"}
{"text":"Too cramped, too expensive and way too noisy.  First off, this restaurant should have a website. They have a few different pricing promotions depending on age, group, day of the week and time, plus they seem to increase costs every year. It would be nice to keep track. After browsing through reviews on other websites, I thought Casa Corfu was cheaper, had I known it was 22$ a person on a Sunday night - probably wouldn't have come. I later learned that kids 4 and under eat free, 5 to 10 years old pay 10$, which explains how packed this place was with annoying kids running left and right. I eat out quite a bit and haven't been anywhere with this many brats under one roof, with the exception of a Mcdonald's playground.  When it comes to food, there is a nice selection but nothing really stands out. Like another reviewer mentioned, they use red heat lamps on everything so it's hard to identify what you get. What looked like salmon ended up being something else and with so much melted cheese on their pastas, stuffed peppers or meats, it's a challenge to know what you're eating. It all looks the same! Normally I say cheese makes everything better, but they're really just masking the lack of flavor. The mac and cheese was the most disappointing to me, it looked like a wonderful creamy mess but it was just a pile of starchy and soggy white goo.  Highlights were the sushi, I filled up on salmon nigiri and the desserts. Some of their cakes were very moist, I loved the light sponge cake with a citrusy mango glaze.  Come here for brunch or on a cheaper weekday, or if you're just really hungry and low on tastebuds."}
{"text":"went back to here again. It's Sunday evening, buffet was medium. Some of their meats are too dry, hard to eat. Their rice is also too dry and too thick. The taste is really different for a normal white rice.   Their smoke meet was not bad. Always well cooked."}
{"text":"It's not the best food you'll ever taste in your life but  it's not the worst either! The ice cream was disgusting though."}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast and they have a lot of choice. Pancakes, pastry, eggs, bacon etc. The food isn't the best i had but it's nice to choose what you want from the buffet."}
{"text":"Super bon le choix est grand et ya vraiment de tout pour tous les gout et de plus les dessert sont tres tres bon et un grand choix  QUALITÉ PRIX EXCELLENTE  si on compare  a d'autres buffet chez casa corfu cest meilleur. Nous etions un groupe de 12 et tout le monde a aimé"}
