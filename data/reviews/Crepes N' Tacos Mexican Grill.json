{"text":"Been here once, never going back. We came in around opening and we were seated by a lady who was talking on the phone. She did put the phone down to take our drink order im assuming she is the owner or manager. 15 minutes passed and we never got our drinks and no one came by to take our food order. We waited 5 more mins and nothing not even the water my mom ordered. We decided to leave and as i look back i see the cashier brushing her hair. Not even a good bye or have a nice day. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The manager did write me a message to go back and have a free crepe. I also saw that It was posted that I was never there. First Impressions are everything for me I will not be going back. Last I didnt know that mentioning another business \"affiliated\" me to them. Nice try at an apology."}
{"text":"I like the location & how spacious it is inside the restaurant. Interior is not too all that but the food is great. I've got to say hands down their chicken tortilla soup is simply delightful & ever so flavorful. Will be coming back for more sopa."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the crepes a lot, The food was ok but I think I'd stick to just the crepes next time!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped here and breakfast. Food was really good. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food for a good price, only thing is they forgot to add cheese on my burrito. $5 for a burrito that would normally cost me $8-$9 anywhere else. They have this house made chile rilleno salsa that's so good, gotta try it if you go here."}
{"text":"Tacos are ok- Crepes are great, but they are a little heavy handed with the toppings. Service is hit or miss, there is a woman that will take care of you, ask you if you need anything, refills on drinks, etc. Or you get the girl that acts like you are bothering her for ordering food. Doesn't check in on you and you gotta pursue her to get check and pay.  I have been there a few times. It's quiet and never busy-   They do make good iced coffees. They offer lots of choices for drinks- smoothies, shakes, Italian sodas, etc.  I love the variety, but unfortunately, I don't think they will be in business long if they don't up their service."}
{"text":"The food is okay and its usually empty so you don't have to wait that long to get your food. But I just love going here for their crepes  they make them really good."}
{"text":"Been curious about this place for awhile and we finally stopped in for brunch today.  My husband had a chorizo breakfast burrito.  It came with crema and lettuce & tomatoes on the side.  He really enjoyed it!  My son and I ordered crepes.  Mine was strawberry banana with cream cheese sauce and my son chose apple banana with chocolate sauce.  The crepes tasted delicious though the texture was not what I expected.  Texture was more tortilla like with the taste of a crepe.  Again, they were still delicious and I left nothing on my plate!  Service was good but slow as there was only one man running the place when we arrived and he didn't speak English so communication was difficult. Luckily two others eventually came in to work and sped things along.  The coffee was surprisingly fresh.  We would probably stop in again if in the area."}
{"text":"So first time and last time going here. Didn't even get to eat. Came before closing hours and they just signaled me and my boyfriend to leave. I was really excited about this place after my boyfriend's brother recommended it. Horrible treatment."}
{"text":"I love it, I had 3 tacos de asada and a strawberry Nutella crepe, I reccomend the salsa verde with your tacos it taste sooo good if you're into salsas, it's pretty spicy, the tacos are average but the crepe was delicious and beautifully presented. The agua de jamaica is also delicious! I would recommend this place to a friend!"}
{"text":"Very clean but food is a little on the pricey side considering there is a taco shop across the street. I was disappointed with their aguas frescas because their menu makes it sound like they carry different flavors but they only had horchata and jamaica. The only reason I would buy food from here again is because they deliver for free since I work close by."}
{"text":"It's supposed to be open Monday-Sunday 9am-9pm, I showed up Monday around 11am, and their doors were locked. What a disappointment, if you're going to close on certain days out of the week at least make sure you update your info online."}
{"text":"Little gem on the east side. Crepes were the best I've had. Fresh fruit: strawberry, mango, and banana. Filled with Nutella, cheese cake, and lechera. Topped with ice cream and whipped cream.   I'm coming back for the N' Tacos portion next."}
{"text":"Our first time here.  I would give it a four or maybe a five if I was rating on food alone but this place has some serious tacky going on.  When we entered the hostess greeted us immediately from across the room behind the counter asking if we were dining in our out.  We said in but were confused at the set up/greeting so we walked over to her.  Then a lady behind us told us to sit.  Oh okay.  Weird?  We were given nice big menus featuring Mexican food and paninis and a 1/4 sheet of paper with a crepe menu.  We started with chips and salsa for $2.50 but wow the tiniest salsa and chips I've ever seen.  Both the chip basket and the size of the chips were tiny but tasty.  My sons crepes were served with plastic silverware but my chili relleno was served with silverware and was the best I've had in a long time.  Rice and beans were good as well.  Our table number was paper and stained.  Could have at least been laminated.  We ordered drinks and soda came in cans, water in a bottle.  We had to ask for cups with ice--that really irritates me."}
{"text":"Good crepes. Food was good as well, but pricy for the portions. I agree with others that their salsas are pretty bomb."}
{"text":"I never would have thought of crepes when eating Mexican food, but it was an excellent dessert treat. The chili rellano was good, the sauce was different, but overall, tasty. The crepe with peaches and blueberries with a cream cheese topping was excellent. It was my favorite of all the crepes I have eaten anywhere. Strange combination, but good."}
{"text":"We saw the cool name and decided to go. The place recently opened. It was clean and the service was good. We had the crepes (banana foster and a la mode) The crepes were delicious and a very good sized portion."}
{"text":"The food is GREAT, but the drink service leaves much to be wanted. Bottled water and canned drinks? Not really what I generally want from a place, but it's not enough to keep me from coming."}
{"text":"Very good spot. One of the best on the east side. You must eat the desserts. The crepes are to die for."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm at a loss of words. There must be a million places in town and although the name seems hesitant, don't let it fool you. I've really let myself down by not coming by here sooner. Don't make my mistake! The tacos the rellenos, yes rellenos! The shrimp cocktail omg and the guacamole. My mouth is still watering.  Crepes crepes crepes, 1st time customers get a free ice cream with your first purchase of a crepe, ummmm Awesome! Let's not forget our waitress the total gem, Kathy! Thank you for the service you provided. If you are reading this, you are greatly appreciated"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out. I got out early from work before noon and decided to check them out one more time. And ta-dahh! They are still in business. Lol. I was mainly excited to try their crepe, i got the banana cream cheese crepe, I also ordered two burritos, lengua and asada. I appreciate the size of the food for its price, but not the taste... :( Waste of money!!   The place itself is clean and very spacious! There were only 2 employees, 1 in the kitchen and 1 lady takes the orders and cleans the tables. I waited about 25 mins for my order, I didn't mind since I wasn't in a hurry..  The burritos consist of meat, rice, and beans only. I asked the lady if the guacamole is an extra charge, she said they ran out of guacamole... I was like, WHAT?! How can you serve burritos and tacos without having guacamole?! :( And it was only noon! Too early to be running out of stuff! Lol  The crepe? It was ok. Ive tasted better! When it said on the menu, Mexican with a French twist, I said to myself this should be good! But nah. Id stick with Robertos across the street, and Ihop for crepes, which is on the same shopping center, just to satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Big portions of food and servers were nice. The food was delicious. Im usually picky when it comes to mexican food but i definitely recommend this place. Me and my bf are gonna come back"}
{"text":"This is a must if you are in the area!! If you want a crepe with your Mexican dish this is the spot. They do make some great tasting crepes here. I was impressed with the quality of Mexican food and everything about their crepes. They make it however you want it, you have a variety of fillings, toppings etc. This is a place I will be stopping by more often when I'm craving some crepes."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new place. As I drove by, I noticed the cool name and immediately got excited to try it out! Went one night, very hungry, & dined it. Overall customer service & dine-in experience=  Pricey, Little flavor, Unenthusiastic.  & The horchata tasted as if it went bad...  Although, they did have some seriously bomb salsa !"}
{"text":"The place looks dead when you walk in and there is only one server and cook but they are very tentative.  The big minus is that DO NOT have High Chairs. The food was good. I ordered sopes and I had to try their crepes. The crepes were great ..maybe a little less chocolate next time. Will return I would definitely return but once they have high chairs available.   I rated a 4 mostly for their crepes they were delicious.  Food I would say 3-3.5"}
