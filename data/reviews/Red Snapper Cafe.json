{"text":"LOL.  This has been my go to place for take out Jerk Chicken in the Jax.  I've been going here for the past 2 years pretty consistently ( at least once a month).  Fast, friendly service.  They always cater to extra requests, which I appreciate.  The chicken has always been fresh.  I've actually seen them go to the bbq drums out front of the restaurant to get the chicken, hot off the grills.  4 stars as I'm obviously a fan and will repeat, however I must note that this has always been take-out and I cannot comment on the eat in services."}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time today and ordered some jerk chicken and fried dumpling. That was easily once of the best jerk chicken I have ever had! I've never really had it bbq before and I must say did I ever enjoy it! It had an awesome smokey flavour that I absolutely love! The rice & peas, as well as the pasta salad that came with it was very good as well! The dumpling was also excellent! 

The ladies that were working there today are very friendly and do a great job! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken not that flavourful. More sweet than anything. I've had much better. Maybe other menu items taste better."}
{"text":"This Ajax eatery is a hidden gem for sure. Starting from the point I walked through the door I was greeted with a most warm Caribbean welcome.

Lets talk food, wow !!!! My first visit I ordered the Jerk Chicken & rice and peas. I can't say enough great things about the chicken, it tasted like how BBQ should, taste that rich smokey flavour, crunchy edges, soft juicy meat with a nice jerk sauce, fantastic job !!!

Then moving onto the Roti, I ordered the curry goat. My lord it was Heaven on a plate. The roti so soft and warm and the curry was made perfect. The goat was tender and flavourful and the potatoes cooked to perfection. 

Last but not least their Ox Tail, great flavours and quite a bit of meat. i will always be happy to return, 
I was impressed with everything I experienced.

The friendly service was stellar and the price couldn't be beat. All in all for an off Main Street eatery, I would say a delight for the Caribbean atmosphere and service and exceptionally good BBQ and food."}
