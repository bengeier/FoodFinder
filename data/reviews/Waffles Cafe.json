{"text":"You people are crybabies. This place is more like a Carl's Jr. where you order at the register and the food is brought out to you. It's not a 4-star restaurant so quit complaining about the silverware and paper plates. It was not difficult at all to cut the waffle with a plastic knife. Not like you a have to be a ninja to master a plastic knife.   On to the review; The food was pretty good. Ordered a waffle with strawberries, blueberries and chocolate chips with a side of eggs, bacon and a hash brown. Food was good and came out quick. Staff greeted us the moment we walked through the door. Yes I had to get my own coffee, but come on, some consider that an inconvenience? It was one more step than getting my coffee at Starbucks where the only difference there is they pour it for you. So can't complain about that either. By the way, the coffee was good too.   Overall, good experience and I would come back again."}
{"text":"We will be going here often.  Plenty of choices, both sweet and savory, modest and indulgent. The owner (or manager maybe) was delightfully friendly and accommodating.  The spicy sauce that comes with the chicken & waffle is addictive."}
{"text":"I do love me some waffles...So why not try Waffles Cafe?   Located on Durango and Centennial near 7-Eleven and Slidin Thru. I decided to give Waffles Cafe a try since I haven't had a decent waffle in a long time. I was greeted by the cashier who was very friendly and helpful. As I looked at the menu, I asked him about the pizza waffles and waffle sandwiches. I thought it seemed kind of odd but he suggested that they were really good. They had a variety of different waffles to choose from, I didn't know if I should be bold and just go for the pizza waffle or play it safe and get a regular waffle with any fruit topping I wanted. Decisions, decisions, decisions...I ended up getting a chocolate waffle with bananas, strawberries, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. I was not disappointed!  I also ordered a iced Chai Tea, which was okay.   Not only do they serve waffles but they also have Boba, what a way to finish up your meal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here with friends and out of town family all the time - we love it. Food is always SO yummy and all the ladies always have a big smile and are so friendly! They could step up their coffee game a bit, but that's really about it!"}
{"text":"Decided to take the family for a late Saturday breakfast .  The waffles were quite tasty, and the fruit toppings were fresh.  Great selections and variety.  The place had a \"local\" moms/pops feel to it which was nice.  The breakfast waffle came with eggs and choice of meat...and unlimited coffee.  My daughter ordered the Yooni special which was so yummy- strawberries, bananas topped with chocolate sauce and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream, almost too pretty to eat!  My son devoured a plain waffle topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream (we added bananas for a small add'l charge).    Pros:  Variety, taste, fresh fruit, price and friendliness of staff.  Cons:  Waffles were kind of cold, no refills on soda (cans)  Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"First time here and let me just tell you that their food speaks for it self. I got chocolate and flaxseed waffles with eggs and sausage, it was delicious."}
{"text":"It was our first visit here and I think we all enjoyed it!  I first had the waffle with fruit and whip and I have to say it was just a little too crisp and airy for my liking. I replaced it with the bacon ham and egg sandwhich and OMG!!!!!!!! YES YES YES! It was perfectly sweet and salty and filling! YUMMMMMMM I can't wait for my boyfriend and I to have another day off so we can enjoy breakfast at 2pm again!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. I had the breakfast combo (coffee, 2 eggs, sausage patty, and a huge waffle) and was satisfied . The food was delicious and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I visited Waffles Cafe while recently in town after finding this place through Yelp. I saw that the reviews were \"okay\" so decided to give it a chance but unfortunately, the food was really bad. There are a a variety of menu options; which I thought was a good thing but my meal left a lot to be desired. My friend and I decided to split an order of chicken and a waffle. Do NOT order this! The \"chicken\" was a serving of frozen chicken fingers aka not real chicken and the waffle was completely bland. Thank God for the strawberry butter they gave me to spread onto my waffle because it made it edible.   It's unfortunate that I can't rate this place higher because the atmosphere inside is truly adorable and their staff was outstanding. Everyone I came in contact with was extremely friendly and helpful and they all were wearing a smile; which was really refreshing.   I liked the idea of this place much more than I liked the actual food but for the most part, I enjoyed my experience there, thanks to the great staff. One really cool thing that I liked was the wall of names, sayings, etc...   Tip: If you ask the server to use the label maker, she'll print off your name or whatever you like for you to stick on the wall. As a tourist, I thought that was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I was very excited to see this place. It looked so great with many options but I wanted to start off simple so i ordered just a regular strawberry waffle. Sure the waffle was crispy but it had no flavor. I had the whip cream on the side and I had to eat it with each bite. So I didn't even eat thecwhole waffle. They had many different flavors and options though like fruits and nuts. Candy toppings and waffle sandwiches. But I'm not rushing back to try them."}
{"text":"It's always hard to find a great family owned business. although you may pay a little more than you make think is necessary, their customer service and friendly demeanor is well worth it. I recommend the waffle pizzas! Very simple yet delicious! I always get a strawberry banana smoothie with boba, and its my favorite smoothie in town!"}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast waffle sandwich, which has egg, cheese, ham, and bacon. It was also served with chips.   The food was good, but the wait before we got our food was so long! There was only one other group of 2 people waiting for their food in the restaurant, and it took 25 minutes before we got ours!   I give three stars because the food was good (not good enough for me to want to return), but we waited so much longer than we should have for our order that it's not worth it."}
{"text":"The best waffles! I always order the breakfast sandwich, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is very helpful and friendly to all customers. The food is always perfect. Great waffles with so many great options. I come here at least once a week. If you enjoy good waffles and good service this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"I was there today with my mother, and the owner and staff were very kind and loving to her. She has advanced alzheimers, and there are not many places we can take her anymore.  We had a variety of foods from the menu, and it was all delicious. What a treat to have the syrup warmed!"}
{"text":"I came from a place that didn't have really anything for breakfast other than Denny's and Cracker Barrel. Vegas is definitely the spot to try new breakfast spots and this is one of them. The prices are great and the service is friendly and quick. You can get so many things on waffles. Waffles with strawberries, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. Waffle sandwiches. Waffle pizza! Go there and get a waffle or two."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"sweet p\" which is a pumpkin waffle with apple pie topping, caramel, cinnamon, whip cream, & ice cream, but I switched the waffle to an organic flax one & put the ice cream on the side for later. It had pretty good flavor but it got soggy quick from the toppings even without the a la mode so eat it quick! My daughters eggs & sausage were great. My husband ordered the waffle breakfast sandwich, it was good but didn't quite compare to our waffle sandwich place in Portland OR, the flavor spot!"}
{"text":"This place needs to invest just a bit on their marketing and signs. They are not very appealing and they seem to make the place look rundown. But the employees are always very friendly. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Ordered a waffle and two eggs with bacon (the breakfast special) sat for 26 minutes waiting for it, when it came it was room temperature and sub par. Bummed because I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Great light waffles on the breakfast special. Nice friendly service Cheap.  Very, very casual seating with small tables. Not the best for large families bigger than 4."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this place since it has such great reviews. I ordered a plain waffle, bacon, and a hash brown. They were all terrible. The bacon was so burnt I wouldn't even give it to my dog. Nevermind that everything had a sort of medal taste to it. I don't know how they cook the hash browns but it had the weirdest flavor. While the waffle was light and crunchy, it also had a weird taste of aluminum. I don't know what caused the flavor, but I suggest they by better ingredients and clean their cooking mediums. Could not eat any of the food."}
{"text":"Place was too run down, old dirty tables, chairs, and bathroom. Very disappointed with price for precooked bacon, frozen store style hash browns, and ate off of paper plates and plastic utensils. Coffee tasted watered down too."}
{"text":"Love this place! I usually just get the waffle breakfast but the environment is very chill. The owners are young and very friendly. My daughters favorite are their smoothies."}
{"text":"I can never get enough of this place!   This is a place I can go to have breakfast every sunday morning with my mom and have my daily favorite the Ham & Bacon waffle together with an oreo shake yummayyyy! I just love it! I would suggest this place any day!"}
{"text":"Food is great and very reasonably priced. They are fast, courteous and there's never been a long wait when we have gone. No frills place, but hits the spot when you're in the mood for a good (not so healthy) breakfast."}
{"text":"I love waffles, and this place has pretty good waffles... But it has an amazing waffle sandwich! I went here with my boyfriend and played it safe with a chocolate waffle with strawberries.  The boyfriend got the turkey waffle sandwich, and I ended up eating half of it because it was so tasty!  Worth a trip for sure. :)"}
{"text":"We were greeted as we entered this store front cafe and the staff was friendly and helpful. We had the $5.49 breakfast special (egg, meat and waffle) that included coffee and the food was served hot and well done. The waffle was tasty and the sausage I had was flavorful. Decor was bare bones, as well as seating. Great place for a quick, cheap bite.  I would have given it 4 stars, but the floor needed a good cleaning."}
{"text":"I've actually been to waffles twice and both times I was very happy with the service and my waffle. I def recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! So friendly, always delicious and always satisfied with my meal. Also I don't even like waffles, but I like them here! I've been going since they opened!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Waffles and boba tea are two of my favorite things, such a treat to have them together. My usual is the plain waffle with strawberries and walnuts and milk tea with lychee flavor and boba. Best waffles around!"}
{"text":"Of coarse looked on yelp for a quick decent place to grab some breakfast. Came here, don't expect a IHOP or CoCo's setting. It is simple and the food well, we all absolutely enjoyed it. It was our first time at a waffle cafe. The employees were nice and helpful. All in all our experience was great!!"}
{"text":"I love Waffles!  The waffles are so good, sweet and savory!  My friend said her waffle wasn't as crispy as she wanted, but if you prefer a little crunch to your waffle, just let them know!  They'll make it crispier for you.  The bbq chicken waffle is so good.  Sounds weird, right?  Wrong!  Everything about it is right!  The crispy waffle, the bbq chicken are a perfect match.  Who knew waffles are a good substitution for bread?  The employees are super nice and I love this place!"}
{"text":"Most unique breakfast place in town!  All their waffles are made fresh.  You have to option of experimenting with your own creations or trying out one of the MANY creations they have displayed on the menu.  Everything I have ordered thus far has yet to disappoint me.  Definitely try the waffle sandwiches!  Their secret special sauce makes everything taste fantastic, whether it be a sweet waffles meal or a savory one (like the breakfast waffle sandwich or turkey waffles sandwich).  They also make great smoothies and pearl tea drinks, though I am not sure that they use fresh ingredients for all their smoothie flavors.  Also, grab a stamp card so you can get a discount after your 10th combo purchase.  The ambiance of this place is quaint and welcoming.  Colors are bright, displays are cute and bubbly, much like the servers are.  Everyone seems like they enjoy work as well as each other's company.  Definitely reminds me of the cute little shops/food trucks on Taiwanese and Korean dramas.  I love it!  Only reason why this place isn't 5 stars is because it is a little pricey for the amount of food that you're getting, but the special sauce really makes up for it!  It still didn't stop me from filling up a stamp card or two. :-P"}
{"text":"Yes!   I have been in Vegas for years and by now I am almost afraid to try new places but  today is a new day!    WaffleS Cafe is phenomenal, great prices, very cool people and delicious.  I work at a great bakery and am blown away at how good these waffles are...  I wish I would have taken a picture of my order but it was gone in a matter of minutes.  This is seriously the YogurtLand of breakfast places!  They are open 6:30am to 10:30pm, who knew just blocks from my house I could be enjoying waffles 16 hours a day.  Seriously, really good."}
{"text":"Omg, the waffles here are so good! I had the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter and strawberry syrup. My fiance had the best friend waffle that has nutella, peanut butter and bananas. The employees here are so nice and helpful. I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at noon and the place was packed.  That got my hopes up that this place was going to be great.  After some confusion trying to figure out the menu on the wall, I finally found a waffle that sounded amazing.  I ordered the Best Friend.  It is an oat waffle with bananas, peanut butter, nutella, and whipped cream.  My husband tried to order a breakfast combo, but swap the meat with hash browns.  For some reason, this was an impossible task and they wouldn't allow it.  So feeling pressured from the growing line behind us, he reluctantly kept his order but without the meat.  They would, however, let him chose the batter type and toppings (he got pumpkin with nutella).  Not sure why they couldn't exchange the higher priced sausage and bacon for some hash browns....  After waiting for sometime, we finally got our waffles.  Mine looked amazing and tasted pretty good too.  Not the best waffle of my life, but a nice crispiness on the outside with a soft inside.  The peanut butter and nutella worked really well with the banana and made my breakfast super filling.  My husband's food looked pretty \"meh:\" a plain looking waffle and soggy scrambled eggs.  I guess the waffle is his fault since he could order more toppings, but the combo seemed a little bare... more like a waffle with a side of eggs.  The pumpkin waffle was pretty good and I'm guessing would be a lot better with different toppings.  The eggs were eggs, nothing special.  Same goes for the coffee.  So, did Waffles end up being amazing like I assumed when I first walked in and saw the crowd?  Not really.  It was good and the prices were great.  I'm thinking now that I know how to work the menu a second go might be in order.  Until then, I give Waffles an \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Fabulous!! It's simple, very clean and DELICIOUS. Me and my girls new favorite place for an amazing morning. :)"}
{"text":"I'm a big fans of this small waffle eatery. It's one of those things that makes you wonder why you don't eat waffles more often. Love the pumpkin waffle with apples and caramel sauce. Great customer service and a nice alternative brunch and dessert spot. When you're feeling that sweet tooth coming on, venture to someplace new and treat yourself and someone you love to some waffley goodness."}
{"text":"I have only tried lunch so far...been there twice. The sandwiches are delicious and taste clean and fresh. Having the sandwich made with waffles offers a slightly sweet twist to the usual lunch and it makes it taste better than the usual sandwich I think. Ran by a very sweet family, the service was great."}
{"text":"So, so good! Love the light crispy waffles. Only had regular so far, gonna try pumpkin (maybe even chocolate) next, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I like it! Close to my house, reasonable prices, friendly service and most importantly delicious waffles. I really loved the strawberry & kiwi combination, see posted picture, yum!"}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. The good was amazing, a little spendy but you definitely get what you pay for, so come hungry!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great breakfast waffle with delicious side items then rhis isn't the place. The food is terrible. ..no flavor and nothing special. Taste and looks like it was microwaved. If u listen closely tou will hear a bell ding going off ever so often. Thats the microwave.  The Columbian coffee taste watered down. Maxwell's House coffee would be an improvement. Dont waste your money and dont get fooled by the name of the joint. Pedestrian food and service at best."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had the breakfast bowl.  Be forewarned, it is served in a waffle cone bowl.  I mistakenly thought after looking at a pic of it thought it was made with actual waffles.  It was good but not what I had anticipated.  While they do have breakfast options I think it's more of a lunch/dinner/dessert menu.  Their specialty waffles come with ice cream on them and to me that says dessert, not breakfast.  I'd like to come back and try their sandwiches and pizza (both made on waffles).  Also, I think they should get some booths in there instead I'd the hard plastic chairs and tiny tables.  It would be a better use of their space.  Cut out the foam plates too and spring for real plates.  Cutting food on foam never ends well."}
{"text":"Tried this place today as an alternative to ihop. Waffles were crisp on the outside and perfect inside.  The toppings are a plenty and options all fresh and good quality.  For a family as large as ours the price is great. The service is slow, but friendly and the waffles are cooked to order so you decide if the wait is worth it. If you are starving or in a hurry try them another time, but I would try them if you like quaint local shops."}
{"text":"Love  the food   Whenever someone visits us here in town we always take them to the waffle cafe. Our grandkids came to visit today so we stopped by but we had Horrible service!  20 minutes before closing and they were asking us and others if we wanted to pack our food in to the to go container. We finished our food because we had ordered the additional food to go. But other customers had to packed there food and leave right before 4pm.  Now that is just wrong!!!! ????~??????? ????????????? ????????... 3:30???... 4? ????? Too Go Box?????? ???????????? ???????????????... ????????????????????Toogo Box??????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Super cute mom and pop place! They were super friendly and absolutely accommodating! Went there about a year ago and still crave their waffles (that coming from a pancake lover). Get a lot of noms for the price."}
{"text":"Pro's:  The Waffles Cafe is tasty and has wonderful creativity.  Where else can you get a ham and bacon waffle sandwich that also tastes good (it's the special sauce)?  They have a good variety of interesting waffles for breakfast, lunch, and dessert.  They use fresh ingredients (avacado on your waffle, anyone?) They have fantastic drinks and smoothies and the atmosphere has a quaint, fun, local feeling to it.  I thoroughly enjoy the Waffle Cafe and return often.  Con's:  The paper plates and plasticware leave something to be desired.  And although the prices aren't bad, one does pay a tad more for something you'd otherwise have to make at home.  Depending on the time of day, you might have to wait 10-15 minutes for your food, other times it's to you in 5."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I do love me some waffles.....and their menu choices look so fun and interesting, I have been excited to give a few of them a try.  But we have been here twice now, and both times I left feeling disappointed.  The service has been slow both times, and the food... although unique... is just not that great.    Honestly, I feel like I'd be better off buying a waffle-maker and making this stuff on my own at home.   I would save money, get better service AND I wouldn't have to try to eat a thick waffle with a plastic fork and knife!"}
{"text":"The worst meal I had in a long time. The waffle had no flavor and the whipped cream had no sugar.  I can look past the paper plates and utensils, but the bacon was cold and tasted like they cooked it hours before. I am never returning."}
{"text":"Our food was good, but the service was not. My husband ordered a pumpkin delight combo, but was given just a pumpkin waffle due to the cashier not knowing how to ring it up properly. When we brought it to their attention, the cook came from the back and stated that we could have the additional toppings after they ring it up. My husband clearly stated he wanted the pumpkin delight waffle and wasn't given what he had ordered. Then they want to charge us extra for the toppings?! For a place that states 'great service' on their business cards, that's not quite 'great service.' On top of that, they gave me the wrong type of bacon. I repeated myself twice to the cashier and they still got it wrong when it came out. In the end, they gave us a full stamp card, which gives us $5 off our next visit, but i would have preferred that the cook to have apologized and given my husband what he ordered. The only person that apologized was the cashier and she stated it was her first day. Under good management, the manger, who seemed to be the cook from the back, should have apologized when she came out and corrected the order at no cost. The new cashier should not have to feel bad for making a mistake and shouldn't have to use her being a new cashier as an excuse. It clearly shows that management does not fully train their employees. This would have been a good training opportunity for the new cashier and manager. If you have a new employee who does something incorrectly, own up to the mistake, apologize, and correct it. Then address the issue after the correction has been made by going over it with your new employee.   My husband and i like the food enough that we will be returning. We just hope management trains their employees well enough so next visit is smoother."}
{"text":"I understand the pickier folks offering critique towards the somewhat dainty decor, but I think it's comfy, clean, and frankly, I don't know how you can complain about atmosphere when said atmosphere smells like waffles all the time. Bright look, not intimidating whatsoever. Love that when I order a Thai tea, they don't throw a bucket-full of ice into the cup. ( :c Most places like to toss in a bunch of ice and add only a small bit of tea, in my experience.) The two regular employees are the best guys, always really cool and genuine. Truly hope they always stay open c:"}
{"text":"Went here not long ago and it was absolutely amazing! Love it so much and am constantly recommending it for breakfast on a daily basis. The staff are wonderful and the food itself to die for!"}
{"text":"Love it Love it Love it!!!  I would be a regular if I lived in Vegas. Since I live in Cali however I make a point to stop by at least once per Vegas trip. The staff is super friendly, the food never disappoints, it's super cheap. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I went here with my daughter and she got a pumpkin pancake.  I ordered the breakfast special.  I was fasting for a glucose test, and chose to break it here, and preggo so very very hungry.  Staff was friendly, coffee was mediocre, my waffle was inedible.  I'm not sure what happened, but it tasted like a lot of baking soda.  There was no substance to it either. Kinda like the turkey on Chevy Chase Christmas vacation.  If you haven't seen that movie, you are missing out...  The pumpkin waffle was pretty good, nothing outstanding.  The fruit was really fresh.  It was a bit run down inside, there was a fan going in the front middle of the floor.  The mismatched paper plates gave it a cheap feel, which was not cool or trendy in any way.  I was disappointed overall.  Based on other reviews I'm guessing my bad waffle was a fluke (benefit of the doubt).   What would bring me back... 1.fresh roasted coffee (buy the beans from a local roaster or something and charge a bit more)  2. fresh half and half (mini moos are just gross, everyone knows that stuff is full of chemicals, allowing it stability at room temp for eons,) 3.real plates, or at least presentation that shows you care about presentation, show some pride in your waffles!  Not mine, the ones you usually serve, I think... 4. a little spruce up inside (time to redecorate!) Again show some pride.  Those toy/candy machines have to go, and fix your AC! 5. And obviously, a waffle that's better than what I failed to eat.  Thankful the bacon and eggs were OK... What I liked- 1. Friendly staff 2. Concept of a menu based on a waffle, including pizza, sandwiches, sundaes, and hard to find seasonal flavors...punky punkin! 3. Its fast.  You could capitalize on this with cool to go packaging.  Possibly a drive thru, and great coffee."}
{"text":"I think from the previous reviews, you get a picture of how great Waffles Cafe is....the waffle sandwiches truly are something else.  Love trying new restaurants, this one was a great find!  I had the turkey bacon waffle sandwich and he got the breakfast sandwich.  If you're deciding between one of those, go with the lunch one..it's a little better.  Next time I'm going to try the nutella waffle!!"}
{"text":"Where to start. We love coming here every Sunday for brunch!! We're always greeted with a smile and Jeff knows our order by heart!!! Everyone is so friendly and go out of their way to make sure that everyone has a great experience!! We love to bring visitors here because Waffles Cafe never disappoints and leave everyone we bring wanting to come back!  They're so personable and always thank every costumer that leaves! I can't tell you enough how much we love it here!!!"}
{"text":"I came here a second time hopeful to change my opinion on this place but I was still not impressed. This time I ordered the turkey sandwich which had turkey, lettuce, tomato, and avocado and again the food did not wow me. They say the third time is a charm but you won't see me here a third time."}
{"text":"I like this place. If you're in the mood for Waffles, I encourage you to stop by."}
{"text":"Always great food and friendly service. Love this place. Don't forget your stamp card."}
{"text":"Yummy waffles. I am a huge waffle fan and these are some of the best. Minus one star for not enough pecans"}
{"text":"The best waffle I have ever had. The tuna sandwich is my favorite. I've become somewhat of a regular here and they all remember me, regardless of how infrequent I visit. This place is welcoming and warm with amazing customer service and even better food. A definite must!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in wait time and service. 25 minutes for two minimal waffles, tukey bacon and turkey sausage.   As we were short on time already, we requested it to go. However, once we left the facility, upon opening the bag, we saw they never actually gave us the turkey bacon. In addition, the turkey sausage was very pitiful and small.   Heading to the other Waffle Cafe on Durango right now. The better one."}
{"text":"The best waffles in town . Fast and friendly service. Don't miss out on this ."}
{"text":"Best waffles I have ever had!  I was visiting Las Vegas and found this place on Google and so happy we came here to eat. The restaurant is super clean, easy to order menu and the staff is friendly and the food is great.  If I could give this place 6 stars I would. You will be so happy you ate here."}
{"text":"We've only been here twice but we love it. A very small and cute family-owned cafe is just what it sounds like - a waffle haven. It offers breakfast and lunch specials with waffles as the main star of the dishes. Picture sandwiches held together by waffles, waffle pizza, waffles and fruit.....Nutella. Need I say more? If you've reached your cheat day, check this place out. Calorie-conscious people need not set foot in here."}
{"text":"Great food. Had a turkey waffle sandwhich.  Place is clean, staff is friendly, food came quickly. No problems. Will go back. They also have ice cream served in .....waffle cones."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the workers are super nice! I believe they are family operated and I love supporting those kind of businesses."}
{"text":"not bad, but I feel like I would probably eat breakfast/ waffles somewhere else and be just as satisfied- staff was very nice and the place is clean and convenient for a simple meal"}
{"text":"Ate here with some friends on Sunday morning and I will never return. The food was okay but the service was absolutely horrible. One person in our group waited an hour for her smoothie even with asking about it 3 times. They messed up many of the orders, were rather rude about their mistakes, and customers who came in and ordered after us were served before us. Never again will I waste my time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great family friendly breakfast spot. Warm and hospitable staff ready with useful recommendations. Can't beat the price; $6.50 breakfast special that includes coffee.  Food was tasty and quick which is useful when dining with toddlers."}
{"text":"I usually come here as much as i can since I don't live close anymore and this visit was a disappointment. I ordered a regular waffle and a side of grits. I waited about 20 minutes and when I received my order it was cold. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is good and service is amazing. Awesome versions of traditional breakfasts and also some crazy concoctions that you must try. The kids love it too!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fancy plates, forks and cups this is not the place of you. But if you are looking for simplicity this is the place. I had an Original waffle with banana, strawberries, nutella and whipped cream along with a mocha latte. Both were really delicious. My daughter had the cherry blossom waffle with a cup of hot cocoa also delicious. The service is stellar which made my visit even that much more worth while."}
{"text":"Paper plates. Plastic utencils. Cafeteria style. Not a cafe ... more like ...   You ever go to a motel and get the \"breakfast buffet\" where you make your own waffles? Yeah, like that. You can convince yourself your getting a bargin, but you know its not a real meal. And plastic forks for waffles? Yeah. Not a great combo for the customer.    Food has weird (though, not bad) aftertaste -- at first it was delicious, but after a few bites, I was like ... huh? What is that? Slightly turned butter? Flax seed oil? Whatever it was, I wasn't into it.   THe eggs were plentiful, but, tasted like they were made with water and not milk.   Coffee, the coffee was just bad.   A couple of lights burned out. My chair was wobbily.   Service was like a Subway or McDonalds, except they bring the food out to you. Otherwise, similar."}
{"text":"So delicious!!! I absolutely love their butter, and the waffles are perfectly cooked!!"}
{"text":"2nd time coming here, everything seems to be just very cheap product. Had a blueberry banana smoothie. Not sure what is actually in this. One thing is for certain that it's banana flavor in it not actual banana. My fiancé had a waffle with chocolate sauce and whip cream. Was drenched in Hershey syrup. Was nasty. All and all won't be returning."}
{"text":"The people behind the counter are friendly.  Been here twice and always had excellent service.  The waffles are  tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to this area. We are so glad to find this place, they have the best waffle ever! Friendly service and it is owned by a cool family. Strongly recommend if you crave waffles!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got into Las Vegas early in the morning and was looking for a waffles place. We didn't want a buffet. So I searched thru yelp and found this place which was about 10 minutes away from the strip. To my surprise when I got there it wasn't a traditional sit down restaurant. You just order from the counter and seat yourself. They had a large selection of waffle choices. You choose what kind of waffle and toppings and syrup. There were so many to choose from. The people that worked there was very friendly. I ended up getting a organic flax waffle with strawberry and walnuts with whip cream and powdered sugar. My husband got the original waffle with peanut butter and banana with whip cream and powdered sugar. It was so good. I highly recommend this place. The price was very reasonable. The best part is the service was good and no tips required. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Omg!!!!! Everything is made with waffles!!! Even the pizza!! Awesome!!!! I had the breakfast special Delicious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waffle took over 15 minutes to make (finally delivered after I said something). It was barely ok; crowded seating inside"}
{"text":"New in the area, and looking for breakfast. Saw this cafe on yelp and thought I would give it a try. Great tasting waffles and very nice, friendly staff.  They have a good menu selection of waffles. They also have lunch and smoothies. Waffles are light and airy, not heavy. The special comes with eggs, sausage or bacon and 1 large waffle for $6.99. Will go back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Very delicious breakfast with a relaxed atmosphere. I had the classic waffle with strawberries and real whipped cream. My hubby had the bacon waffle. We really enjoyed our food and the friendly customer service."}
{"text":"If you don't mind dirty salt and pepper shakers, questionable tasting ketchup, syrup and filthy old refilled ketchup bottles this place is for you!   The potatoes were cooked in way too much oil on top of being over seasoned. The waffles tasted plain and not quite right.  The bacon tasted weird too. Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"5 stars for what it is. Great value. Great home made quality. Paper plates and plastic utensils but the food is great and the price is right. Family owned since 2009 and they deserve success!"}
{"text":"Couldn't find a smoothie place, so I turned to ye olde Yelp. Told me I was 110ft. away from the Waffle Cafe. Well played Yelp, well played.  I walk in and the fellow behind the counter greeted me with a big smile and hearty, \"Good morning.\"  I ordered up my strawberry smoothie and it was up very quickly. So far so good.  Now the food review. Simply, the smoothie was delicious. The big win.  Duringy brief wait, I took a look around and it's a pleasant looking place, simple in decor. Not fancy but perfect for a breakfast joint.  They also have, wait for it... waffles. They look pretty tasty. They advertise organic and gluten free foods. Also on the menu are Boba teas and spiral cut potatoes on a stick.   Reasonable pricing, quick friendly service, and a very tatsy smoothie. They have all three restaurant issues covered.  I'd really like to try their other foods, but it's a long drive for me to get up here. But I'll certianly remember them and will stop in if I'm on this side of town again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, perfect place to satisfy a sweet tooth. Customer service is exceptional. Fresh fruit daily and I really like the Boba tea. My s/o and I come here when we want a yummy treat."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, but I don't get the raving reviews on food. For example, Tropic Thunder waffle... Menu says its waffle with fresh mango, peach, pineapple on top, but it was actually fruit cocktail in syrup. Fresh out of a can maybe."}
{"text":"So yummy! It's not badly priced, it's good, I really can't complain. This place has always been clean. I really like supporting these local businesses too. I hope this place doesnt go away like many of the other stores that have been in this shopping center. It's never crowded (I'm usually the only one in there). I always take my sister there for an after school snack. Waffle sandwhiches=yummmm"}
{"text":"Horrible! Horrible service. Employees are not friendly and food took forever to make and was disgusting. Don't recommend and will not be back."}
{"text":"You guys put waffles to the next level! this place is really good! its not only just sweets but they also got like waffle sandwiches and stuff, really good"}
{"text":"Wasn't planning to eat, just stopped by for coffee, then I saw the pumpkin waffle and told myself I had to at least try it. It came with an apple pie filling, vanilla ice cream, caramel and cinnamon....and I ate it all! Definitely would come back to try other combinations. Mocha latte was very good too! Clean, fast, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Reiterating the other reviews, good food to be found here. The waffles are cooked to perfection and all sorts of toppings/additions that you can add. Employees are cheerful and helpful.   However, a few minor gripes about the place itself. Plastic plates and plastic utensils are used. And if you come during the wrong (peak) time, you may not be able to find a place to sit since the place is rather tiny inside (maybe a max of 20 occupants). But thankfully they can also wrap your food up to-go if you wish.  Great food, but mildly tarnished by the fact that it can take a while to receive your order and the place fills up quick! Overall, minor annoyances though."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the most amazing waffles I've ever had. They are light and airy, not dense and heavy like pancakes. I come here every weekend. Don't be put off by the paper plates and plastic utensils. It'll be your loss. I do bring my own maple syrup, only because I'm a pure grade B kinda gal.  I also absolutely love love love their tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"The pricing was very high for a plain waffle. The food was served on paper plates with plastic utensils. Definitely not impressed with the service. I would save your $20 and get breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Waffle Cafe is delicious!! This was the first experience at the Waffle Cafe and will not be my last! Definitely worth a try! The option to build your own waffle is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"First Time At Waffles cafe, AND I Loved it, especially their seasoned potatoes, man they were amazing!    Their service was great and very friendly. I had the waffle, eggs, and sausage and I must say it was good. I thought I might need more but after I was done I realized that the hunger was satisfied.  I will be back with my kids."}
{"text":"The food is good but not worth the wait. You guys need to seriously fix this part of your business."}
{"text":"My wife has become obsessed with this place. She cooks, and loves to make breakfast food, but she still wants to go and get WaffleS.  I've gotten the chicken sandwich and waffles with toppings in the batter. Stellar all around.   We ate inside once and hadn't thought to get drinks. The young guy who always helps us actually brought out a couple cups of water without any prompting... great service."}
{"text":"Excellent ..... had the build your own waffle. They have different batters, with healthy and gluten free choices, even have turkey bacon that was delicious.  They also have banana split and Pizza waffles for the note so healthy choices.. Waitress was very nice and explained our options... Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I was on vacation in Las Vegas for a week. The cafe is located near some friends I was visiting. We checked out the place on 12/28/2009 at about 11:05 am. It was crazy busy. Only 2 people were working there, and they didn't take our order until after over 10 minutes of waiting. Then we sat around for about a half hour and finally got our food at about 11:45. The only reason I put up with the wait was because I treated my friends the day before, and it was their turn to treat me so I let them pick out the place to eat. (If I was there by myself, I would have left after 5 minutes since they didn't take my order.)  The food was ok but not worth the wait. If WaffleS Cafe is 2/3 or more full when you get there and a few people are working, I recommend getting food elsewhere. I wonder if the good yelp reviews is why a lot of people are eating there. It could be a blessing and a curse..."}
{"text":"Great family owned place.  I loved the coconut pineapple smoothie.  Also the cool waffle variations like the waffle sandwiches and pizza."}
{"text":"Went here on an early Sunday morning. My chicken was fried in old grease. I could taste it and the waffle was bland. The doors were closed as they began cooking, so it filled the entire restaurant with smoke. We had to wait outside. The portions are large just not very tasty. The staff was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have seen these Waffles Cafes all over town so we decided to try the  one by my house. I knew from reading the reviews that we would be dining off of paper plates and using plastic silverware.   The food took awhile to come out. We had to get our own coffee and water. I ordered the chocolate waffle with strawberries and banana slices. It was just okay. It really didn't taste like a chocolate batter. The plastic silverware made it difficult to cut my waffle. My boyfriend ordered a breakfast combo that had a waffle with peanut butter and chocolate sauce with a side of eggs and bacon. Both of us agreed that the bacon tasted like it had been cooked in used oil from the Chinese restaurant next door. Disgusting. His waffle was fine, but he didn't care for the eggs.   The grossest thing was when he went to put salt and pepper on his food. He picked up the shakers and they literally stuck to his fingers, all dirty with syrup and who knows what else on the outside.    We threw our punch card that was given to us in the trash on the way out and will be making our waffles at home from now on."}
{"text":"Found this place on the Yelp app.  Not what I expected, but stayed anyways. Very glad I did.  Menu is limited, but quite delicious.  Waffles are crisp outside and moist inside.  The eggs were cooked in butter or butter flavored something.  Bacon crisp.  Smoothies looked delicious will order one way out."}
{"text":"Me and my girls tried this place out for breakfast and dang was it good. I was most pleased with the staff. The sever who also worked the register was very nice and that means a lot to me when I go out to eat. There coffee was hot and didn't have that bitter taste you get some times. I ended up getting the blazing chicken and waffle which is like a waffle chicken finger sandwich. Which as I am writing my mouth is watering for one. Also it came with waffle fries. Get it? Lol. Anyways, my daughter got the pumpkin delight and loved it. This is a local small business joint and we will be back. Need more places like this in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Waffles... Why not?  My sister introduced me to this wonderful little cafe that serves up waffles in any way imaginable. Waffles cafe is owned by Jeff and Yooni. They are always present and personable, and they get to know their customers.  I love the fact that their waffle batter is their own and made on site. They have an all day breakfast special, lunch specials, and even boba drinks.  My absolute favorite is the tuna sandwich. Tuna on a waffle in place of bread? Honestly, the idea of it scared me a little, but after one bite, I almost punched myself for not being more willing in the beginning. Their tuna is mixed there and the sauce they drizzle on the tuna really makes it a Waffles Cafe original.  Wait time can be a slight problem because they make the waffles upon order, so please do not come here expecting instant food. Your patience will be rewarded."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were good! I ordered the mijis favorite and it was good the first few bites but then it was too sweet."}
{"text":"I LOVE WAFFLES! I am so happy to have found a place that sells waffles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I ordered a strawberry waffle with  strawberries, strawberry ice cream, and whipped cream. Soooooo good. I am going to visit again and again! YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here by complete chance. After picking up a few things at the Walmart across the street, I decided to look for something nearby to grab a bite to eat. I saw the WaffleS Cafe and kept going. Nothing else caught my interest so I doubled back and decided to give it a try. I got the $5.49 special - one waffle, one egg and bacon. The bacon was crispy and all the wet grease had been dried off it (maybe it was microwaved), and it was good. The waffle was crisp on the outside and light on the inside. It blew away the much pricier Hash House A Go Go. The place has a small town diner feel - with very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times now and the place has yet to disappoint.   Service is extremely friendly and polite.   Food is delicious, the waffles come out just right, the bacon is crispy and the eggs are cooked to perfection.  The pricing is very reasonable.  I would recommend that you give them a try."}
{"text":"My reveiw is soley of the smoothies as that is all ive tried.going w hubby n kids for breakfast tomorrow. I had the freshest...bestest smoothie ive had in a long time here. The tropical smootie closed that was nxt foor so i figured id try this place! It was freaking awesome! Cant wait for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based upon the dessert waffles, although the breakfast sandwiches looked superb, I didn't have the time nor the sheer fortune of trying one out.  I ordered the Yooni's favorite, topped with strawberry and banana slices, whipped cream, ice cream and chocolate syrup.  My fiancee being the avid banana freak she is, ordered the Banana Split waffle which was equally delicious.    As far as the service is concerned, I guess maybe that's contingent upon how many people are in the establishment at any given moment.  I didn't personally experience anything strange or feel disrespected enough for me to waver my opinion.  In fact, I thought the service was stellar, albeit a bit slow.    I will definitely be back if I need a quick breakfast waffle pick me up.  This WaffleS location also serves Boba Tea and the French Vanilla one was one of the better ones I remember having.  This Boba Tea is also very dense, when the server handed it over, I thought I was going to break my wrist.  Ok..I'm being a bit facetious, but the Boba Tea was particularly heavy."}
{"text":"I always only get the Breakfast Special -of which saw a little pice increment :( So you get your waffle with bacon and/or sausage (your choice) and egg & an everflow of coffee which I don't drink. I usually get my waffles with banana and nutella with powdered sugar and whipped cream: DON'T JUDGE. It's really delicious. The waffles' are usually crispy and I like the way it's made.   The people there are nice. I go there almost every other day (wished I was exaggerating) because it's so close to home and I love waffles. Plus, I shamelessly admit to the joy I get when Jeff (one of the owners) say Hi Sarah! It's like frequent flyer pass vip at a Waffles joint, which I really shouldn't be too proud about.   They have this waffles reward card where you get stamped for every $5.00 (i think) you spent & for as much as I go there for, it has actually saved me some dough.   I have had 2 bad experiences here where they completely forgot my order and I was peeved. They gave me a $5.00 voucher, and then another time when they just took too long. Sometimes I wished they had more staff to help make the waffles or something but then when you go in there in the odd hours of the day like 3.30pm to get brunch/linner, it's completely dead. But I still go back because I honestly rather go here than IHOP.  Go try it!"}
{"text":"Food is great. The waffles itself are great because you can have it anyway but if the waffles are soggy, or too dry, then it would be junk. But their waffles are homemade fresh goodness.    Ambiance is good. You know u not gonna get  regular service or regular kind of silverware because this place is not that kind of restaurant.   Customer service is ok. Price is ok. Food is good. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's a decent spot to get breakfast type foods. I made a take-away order this last Saturday.  Waffle - Strawberry/Nutella: Nutella was not used, it seemed more like a chocolate syrup. Potato Scramble: Enjoyed it, was pretty good. Tornado Fries (Flame Grill BBQ): I can't really comment on this one because when I got home, they hadn't packed it with the rest of the food.  Disappointed that I didn't get the entire meal nor was Nutella used."}
{"text":"Mad about waffles? Then, this is the place for you. This cheery walk up cafe serves a breakfast special waffle with eggs, bacon or sausage, and coffee $5.49. Fresh fruit and other toppings are available for an additional fee. They also have a handful of savory waffle sandwiches or pizza and then a slew of dessert waffles.  My mom and I both had the breakfast special with bacon. Just fresh strawberries for me and butter for her. Eggs were fine, bacon was crisp, but a bit small. The waffle was great. It's nice and light, crisp, yet chewy and not doughy at all. The griddle marks are deep so your toppings melt right in. Coffee is self serve.   It's a nice option close to home. I'll return sometime to satisfy a sweet tooth and try the coffee waffle."}
{"text":"great customer service  one time i ordered something but didn't know it can a large portion because of how the have it set up like i said i wanted 4 eggs and the girl said ok , when i revived it it was 4  orders of 2 eggs each  i was like huh? she explained that how it comes i didn't want that many so and before i left i ordered a drink and she comped it for me so that was nice of her . i think i've tried everything on the menu once , the food is great but sometimes if i order the wings they smell a little bad like a old gamey smell once in a while . but other than that the food is great"}
{"text":"The waffles are delicious.  Service is excellent.  Servers are very pleasant. I love the option of turkey bacon and/or turkey sausage.  The caramel butter adds just enough sweetness to the pancakes or waffles. Clean environment. Great spot for simple dining for breakfast without a long wait."}
{"text":"Yum, waffle sandwiches, perfectly cooked boba, and friendly customer service? What more could a girl want.  I'll be back to try a waffle pizza and their other selections. Can't believe they also have boba smoothies, thai teas with boba, and the boba is soft on the outside, yet still chewy. The guys are really helpful as well, they brought my boba to me as I was waiting for my food. Super fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great for what it is.  From the moment we walked in this is what happened:  1.  Everyone one that worked there said hi!  Even from the depths of the kitcken.  2.  The gentleman at the counter said \"New customers... I thought so... Let me talk to you about your options for breakfast...\"  Stoked on that.  3.  We ordered the basic breakfast combo $5.49!!!  Great price!  4.  When we tried to sit down, some snooty customers said \"that's our table!\" as they were in line behind us... Not the restaurants fault.  5.  We found a different table on the other side of the 15 foot wide dining area.  6.  They brought our food out on paper plates... Wafle with peanut butter on one plate... Egg and sausage on the other...  Paper plates a little weird... Considering the environment...  7.  The food was awesome!  Most importantly... Especially for the price!  8.  As we were leaving everyone said good bye!  Is this place for real?  9.  Can't wait to go back without the bitchy customers!   Notes on food: Waffles... Perfectly crip, lots of options.  Waffle egg sandwhich looked awesome, but didn't try it.  Good vibes!... For the most part!"}
{"text":"Loved the chicken waffle sandwich with house sauce, delicious, and best waffle fries hands down. Waffles were perfectly cooked.  Kim was great explaining their menu since it was our first time. We can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"the best waffle place in town!!!! i ordered the strawberry and banana sandwich and it looked exactly like it's picture. the hash browns were spectacular and the scrambled eggs were perfect. their waffles are surprisingly fluffy (in an amazing way!!) all in all waffle cafe deserves my 5 stars!!! and the staff is super lovely"}
{"text":"We love waffle cafe it is by far one of our favorite go to restaurants and the customer service is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin waffle is the best!! My husband got it and I kept eating his. His toppings were mango and kiwi.  I got the oat waffle and it tasted like a plain one. They are really light, the perfect density. My sister got nutella and strawberry topping on her plain waffle, yum! My neice got a plain waffle with strawberries, chocolate and whipped cream, it looked pretty  There are lots of topping choices. It reminded me of a froyo place with all of the possibilities of waffle/topping selections. I got blueberries, which I thought they were stingy with their portions but they were tasty all the same. The smoothies were good too. We got strawberry banana with protein powder and my sister got a taro with boba.  All in all, I would go again for the pumpkin waffle."}
{"text":"The chicken & waffle is beyond good and Mango smoothie is perfect match for it. Love this place!! And also can't wait to try their new Tornado Fries, I've already tried them when I was in LA. They r so tasty and yummy. Finally they are arrived here in Vegas, Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We have been coming here since it opened and the staff has always been so friendly and helpful. What makes it better is it's a family owned and operated local business.  Things to try would be the fruit sandwich and of coarse the boba is delicious."}
{"text":"i have always LOVE LOVE LOVED this place but what happened to the old decor?? the customized stamps from customers all over the walls?? the overall \"kawaii\" zen of the place?? everything here is still fabulous, has been a favorite of mine for 4 or 5 years, but they must've recently remodeled because the inside decor is completely revamped and a little boring now in my opinion. still love the place though!"}
{"text":"I love love the tuna waffle sandwich. It's my favorite! And the pizza waffle is not too bad (sneaked a bite from my munchin) The service might be slow but the staff is super friendly; So I could understand the wait. I can't wait to try dessert waffles...oh, and the Thai tea is good as well."}
{"text":"Good food, but I prefer eating on real plates and drinking coffee out of a mug as opposed to having everything be cheap styrofoam.  The food is excellent and the prices too, but if there is one thing I don't like while eating at a restaurant, it's eating my meal as if I were out camping somewhere & had no real silverware.  Eaten here once and would love to make regular trips if they had real plates, especially to go with their waffles."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always a stop for us when we visit from Cali.  The family who owns this is super-cool and friendly.  Their breakfast sandwich is a favorite!"}
{"text":"So Boy Bestie Harry and I were looking for quick breakfast cheap. Yelp said, \"Hey, you should check out WaffleS Cafe!\" WaffleS Cafe? You mean... a cafe... devoted to waffles? Those grilled, delicious paddles of breakfast-type awesome? Nothing but waffles? I like it! I shall order waffles, then more waffles, then more waffles, until I have myself a veritable Tower of Waffles! From which I shall rule the breakfast kingdom on my Waffle Throne, with my Waffle Crown, and my Scepter formed from hardened Maple Syrup with a Powdered Sugar Jewel on top, after which I will turn my sights to RULING THE WORLD!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Too bad what I got was something I could have made in my own kitchen.  First off, it shouldn't be \"WaffleS Cafe.\" It should be \"Waffle Shop.\" A cafe to me implies a place to relax and enjoy some quality food. WaffleS had about all the ambiance of a pink Roberto's Taco Shop. Plastic and formica better found on my patio deck. I don't ask for much, I'm pretty simple, but put a LITTLE effort into it.  Cheap? Yeah, it was cheap, so it scored in that arena. $5.50 for a breakfast special.  Problem was, there wasn't very much special about it. I had a waffle with apple cinnamon topping, Boy Bestie Harry had a regular one. It was okay, but it was literally something I could have done at home with some batter and a waffle iron. If you specialize in waffles, impress me with said waffle. Also, I'm not OUTRIGHT saying that WaffleS Cafe caused this, but I got the bubblyguts later at work. Just saying.  Kudos is deserved for preparing everything fresh, as could be evidenced from my eggs, which were irregular when served. Not that irregular is bad, it just shows that there wasn't like a vat of them sitting in the back.  So it wasn't that great of an experience, and it's in the FAR Southwest. My plans for a Tower of Waffles will have to wait."}
{"text":"Okay, I first came here when they opened and it was good but it was so long ago that I couldn't really remember it.   OMG. I needed a severe sweet fix and had seen the menu online (and gotten a suggestion from Jadira R). I dropped by for the Banana Split Waffle. The people here are really really friendly (that's the thing I remembered most from my last visit) and helpful and the waffle was exactly what I needed.   Now that I remember how amazing this place is, I'll be back all the time."}
{"text":"Love this place, been coming here for years! Tasty waffles and great customer service!"}
{"text":"The best waffles in greater Las Vegas!!! I left for California 8 years ago and I was addicted to their food and now I moved back, I was so ecstatic to know they are still around (and rightfully so!) please check them out! Great family and staff on par with great food! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for 4 years and have always had a positive experience. The food and service are consistently great. The variety of waffle combinations is fantastic."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place by just asking Google for breakfast in our area, and I'm glad we tried it out. My mom is very picky about her breakfast, and they are one of the few places to get it right. My waffle with peanut butter, bananas, and nutella was outstanding. Add to that the staff is great. I'm not much of a morning person, but this place turns that around quickly"}
{"text":"Excelent  place , great staff . It was our  first time having breakfast and the  cashier  gived us time and also recommend some good stuff.  I wish syrup could be more fresh it tasted little bit weird like if it was sitting on the sun for a long time  but a side's  that  Our special breakfast was great . The waffles were the best so fluffy and crunchy  at the same time .  Delicious! !!  When we finish they picked up our plates. Thanks! I'll go back anytime"}
{"text":"I love Waffles Cafe for there creativity and service.   I was on a sweet tooth crave and ordered \"JEFF'S FAVORITE\"  pumpkin waffle + apple pie filling + vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce  drizzling all over = Mouth watering! recommended by Jeff himself! (i.e. owner)  he was very helpful, friendly, and always carried a smile.   Waffles Cafe also offers breakfast waffles, waffle pizza's, waffle sandwich's,  shakes, smoothies, and my ultimate fave...BOBA! yaaaay!   You can even make your own waffles that way if you are allergic, on a diet, or just specific.   FREE WIFI to customers - how convenient!!!"}
{"text":"BEST. GRITS. EVER! ...and waffles, and bacon, and oatmeal and my husband is wild about the waffle pizza! The staff and owners are fab! I can't imagine having breakfast anyplace else. Everything is made to order and the menu is extensive and an excellent bang for your buck! Do yourself a favor and give it a try...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum! Waffles were fresh and delicious.  The deli turkey was just okay. The shredded cheese was straight from a bag (I watched them). Other than the waffles (again - DELISH!), I could've made everything myself at home. Service was friendly and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is always super good and the people who work here are always super friendly."}
{"text":"Place was gross.. Their menu didn't have enough description. Matter of fact it had no description just pictures... I order a waffle sand which well it turned out it had some kind of jelly in it.. Really gross.. Just threw it away and walked out.. Won't be coming here anymore..."}
{"text":"I love their food. I wish there were larger portions but that's because I pigged out on the different waffles I tried. They'll be seeing me soon."}
{"text":"This is my daughter's favorite place in Vegas to get a Thai ice tea with boba. Thank goodness that we live close by for such goodness! Nice to get a waffle too on a lazy weekend. The owner/operators are very friendly and make you feel welcome. I want and will continue to support this local business."}
{"text":"I've only been to this place once and it was a nice experience, the staff was helpful and very nice, and the food was also tasty. When I went I had a blazing chicken and waffle, which fulfilled my need for sweetness, savory, and tangy all at the same time. I also had an order of waffle fries and tornado fries. The only reason I could not give them the full five stars was because there was nothing exceptional there that would make me crave waffle cafe. Other than that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Waffles Cafe is mediocre at best.  I LOVE waffles and really wanted to love this place, however, it is what it is.   Decor: Upon walking in to the restaurant, you'll find tables and chairs that remind you of a courthouse diner. They're pretty basic but get the job done. This place isn't fancy, so just throw on a hoodie and head over.  Food: The waffles are probably the only food item on the menu that is made from scratch. I have had the breakfast special several times now, and I'm positive the turkey sausage is the frozen/microwave kind, while the eggs are powdered or liquid. The food is pretty average, and I would only suggest coming here if you don't feel like driving the extra 2 blocks to Denny's.   Takeout: When ordering takeout, be sure to check your bag for all of the necessary condiments. Last time I ordered a waffle to go, I was not provided with syrup."}
{"text":"A little family owned specialty waffle spot located by the Smith's in Aliante. Personally have never tried any of their food items, but I have heard people say, \"Order anything, because everything there is delicious!\" We've become regulars to this place for their boba drinks though.   FOR HER: I opt for the FRUIT SMOOTHIES -- lychee is my personal favorite. Honey dew or cantaloupe as a tied second. I add boba to it (additional $0.30 charge).   FOR HIM: He loves the ORIGINAL BOBA TEAS -- the milk one being his favorite. Comes with boba too! He also is a fan of the chocolate smoothie, but does not feel it pairs well with boba.  TIP: They offer happy hour from 2pm-6pm, where drinks are buy one, get one half off which makes it super worth it! :)"}
{"text":"When this place opened in the neighborhood, I was so excited to have a different breakfast spot nearby. Then we tried it. I was less than impressed. You order at the counter but go wait at the table for your food to be delivered. They serve it on paper plates with plastic utensils. If the waffles are crispy, this is tough to use with ease. The waffles were ok with plenty of options for toppings. They also serve boba drinks which is a huge plus in this part of town. They are on the right track, but for the price point, it needs to step up the presentation a bit."}
{"text":"We drove from the strip here, about 30 minutes away and it was worth every minute!!!  It's in a strip mall but don't let that hold you back.  The food here is amazing!! And the variety of things you can do with a waffle is even more impressive! !!!"}
{"text":"Waffles are good. Sometimes a lil over drowned by toppings so I ask for it on side. Unlimited coffee. Don't worry about the paper plates & plastic utensils, they have the BEST & friendliest service. Its like a quick Denny's joint if ur in a hurry for breakfast. Except the sides aren't that great. Try all the toppings & all the flavored syrup before you judge this place"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and loved it! The waffles are SO fluffy and big! I had the raspberry & white chocolate waffles, and they were delicious. The presentation of the plate was beautiful, too! My fiancé had the breakfast special, and the eggs were the perfect texture. The raspberry smoothie was perhaps my favorite part - it had amazing consistency and the taste was not too sweet, it was perfect. Overall it's a fun little breakfast spot with very fun and delicious menu options!"}
{"text":"Friendly folks serving up some yummy waffles. Vast menu yet easy to decide and decently priced. Meal for 2 including a drink costed us $18."}
{"text":"I can only assume that I've come on a bad day since the reviews are so good :-/.  I hate to give this review because the people were so nice but I feel like I waited 40 minutes (yes, 40 min) on a not so crowded Saturday morning for nothing. Did I mention that it took 10 of those minutes to get my orange juice that they must have went to florida to squeeze.   As for my food, my fruit topped oat waffle was a bit on the crisp side.  I had to add some syrup to soften it up.  Not to mention it was hella small.  And my son was not happy with his pepperoni pizza waffle either. I tried a piece and the marinara sauce tasted like a canned spaghetti sauce.   This place has a lot of potential but it would probably take a Groupon or something for me to give it another shot.  Once again, I apologize for my review but my son and I are still hungry and are probably about to spend 17.00 elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and definitely won't be our last! Everyone was so friendly and the food was really good! The waffles, obviously, are awesome! The fruit bowl is a great value - so give it a try! Can't wait till next weekend to come back."}
{"text":"Everytime, I think of waffles for breakfast--yes, Waffle Cafe is the place to go.  Their breakfast waffle sandwich is excellent  with bacon, eggs, built into a waffle sandwich, and their waffles with strawberries, kiwi and whip cream is absolutely delicious.  Smoothies, great coffee and family friendly runned staff.  Open for breakfast and lunch, and they even have a punch card--once it's filled, one free waffle breakfast.  Their waffles are the best, with their secret ingredients, the only setback, is when I dine in a restaurant I prefer not to eat off of styrofoam plates! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely BS the grilled chicken sandwich I ordered came out fried the waffle was soggy and completely fell apart everywhere the chicken wings are burnt and taste like cardboard I wonder if this place truly cares about the customers considering we pay 30 dollars for a meal I will never be coming here again.     UPDATE: Extremely unprofessional company owner no caller id called my phone to tell me how rude I am for posting a review on their food being nasty my opinion still stands and more now noting how unprofessional they are to call a customers phone absolutely the worst company out there"}
{"text":"WOW!  Ever had a waffle sandwich before?  Me neither, until I ate the exquisitely tasty Waffle Sandwich at WaffleS Cafe.  Ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and this special sauce will make your mouth water.  Going back for lunch for the second day in a row!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 100 stars! They have the best waffles I have ever tasted. I have never once had a bad experience, my husband and I come almost every weekend. The staff is always so friendly and warm and the food comes out so quick. We love Waffles Cafe!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Food is made fresh.  My only complaint would be not enough strawberry butter for my waffles.   It worth the wait"}
{"text":"Carbs are my best friend. This cafe is a wonderful idea, owned by a Korean couple they offer everything you imaginable wedged in between a waffle. Waffle pizza, waffle sandwich...  I didn't get to try those just yet..  I had the pumpkin waffle with bananas, whip cream, and nuts. It was delicious. The waffle was cooked a tad bit too much, but I hold no grudges.   Great place for a meal any time of the day.  The menu is fun and varied...I bet they will concoct any combination if you just ask. That's 4 stars in my eyes."}
{"text":"Great service & delicious food! The breakfast sandwich is my favorite. & to the people commenting about the paper plates, big deal! It makes it feel more like a family restaurant (: love this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken and Waffles. It had this super yummy spicy sauce for the chicken and strawberry butter for the waffles. The waffles were crispy and delicious and the chicken tenders were good too but I feel like the price was too high for a waffle and what seemed to be frozen chicken tenders. My boyfriend got their breakfast platter with waffles, egg and sausage and he enjoyed it for the most part.  I think my only criticism is them serving it on paper plates and the ambience of the place could really use some improvement. I don't remember having music at all. And most importantly, the prices are a bit too high for what you get.   I'll go back and give it another try and order one of their crazy waffle creations but I guess that's it for me."}
{"text":"One Star only. Yes One Star only for a waffle Place.  I really Love waffles.   The Place was Empty on Sat 11 am.  Service. Very very nice& Friendly. It was a Guy.    Boba Smoothie: Not Good at all. To Sweet. I asked if its frech Fruit. He Said yes but it didnt tasted like fresh. More a powderd cheap Way Too Sweet Drink.3.50$  Choc waffle: dry i mean really dry. You Need 2 Cups water After Eating it.  Not Good at all.  Topping: Mango. The mango was Hard really Hard Not ready to eat hard & sour.   5.10$ i think for that is really to expensive.   I Love the Crêpe shack & waffle in Henderson.  Compared to them quality, fruits, waffles just Suck.   Sorry but that my opinion.   Wil Not go back.   :-("}
{"text":"First off, I was annoyed for waiting over half an hour for waffles, it wasn't over crowded so that was just lame. This place is over hyped, nothing special. Just a bunch of different toppings on waffles. Big whoop! The food isn't bad it's just not anything special."}
{"text":"One of our fave breakfast spots in Vegas. Their kind employees and awesome food has us coming back almost every Sunday!!! Chicken and waffles are always hot and tasty. Thank you guys for providing such an amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST breakfast spot if you LOVE waffles. It is totally underrated, but a bomb hole in the wall spot that will blow your mind away!"}
{"text":"I think I'm due for an update. I've been here many, many times in the past year and service has always been great. Ambiance has definitely improved. They added music! Yay! Regular menu items seem a bit pricey so catch them on their Happy Hour, Everyday 2-6 PM. BOGO 50% off Smoothies (Boba Add'l), Waffle Sandwich & Kettle Chips for $5 and Milk or Thai Tea (Buy 2 Get One Free).  Everything is worth trying. I've had Chicken & Waffles, Waffles with Strawberry & Banana with Chocolate Sauce, Ham and Pineapple Waffle Pizza, Green Tea and Banana Smoothies, Oreo Shakes, Tornado Fries, etc. They were all delicious!  Their waffles are so crunchy and fluffy at the same time. I'm so used to being served soggy waffles so it's a treat coming here.  I've seen reviews critiquing them serving on paper plates and such. I don't find it tacky or anything. There's nothing wrong with that, in my opinion. It doesn't take away from the food being yummy. Just a thought."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They offer stamp cards and for every item you purchase you receive a stamp for it, I believe I'm on my fourth one now because I love coming here for breakfast. Their ultimate bowl is probably one of my favorite dishes to get here it's a bowl with egg, seasoned potatoes, cheese, and bits of bacon. Their banana split waffle is another favorite of mine, I mean who wouldn't love ice cream for breakfast? This dish consists of a regular waffle topped with vanilla ice cream, sliced bananas, whipped cream, sprinkles, and drizzled hot fudge. I mainly come here for the boba because this is the closest and best boba place in North Las Vegas. My two favorite flavors are their taro and chocolate banana smoothies with boba. The staff is friendly as well and provide great service to the customers always."}
{"text":"The menu has so many tempting and tantalizing items, but I thought I'd go bit healthy and had the steel cut oatmeal. Wow! Out of this world. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes. The restaurant is clean and the service staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome. Nice service. Good food. Nothing fancy. waffle breakfast sandwich was great. i dont know about waffle pizza. it wasnt bad... just not my thing. very nice staff. get waffles!!!"}
{"text":"Ok been wanting to try this place for some time. I was on my way to another breakfast joint and there was a kid with the sign outside so we decided to give it a try. The service was excellent which you rarely find nowadays when it comes to teens and customer service. Which basically tells me the management has trained their staff well and management is good to the employees. Btw we met the owners and they were very nice and friendly. They were in the kitchen with the staff working just as hard(which is true leadership). The food, oh my, was awesome. Daughter had red velvet yummo! I had gluten free yummo! The grits were exellent! I'm glad we took a chance. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review... i guess more of a 2 3/4 but still not strong enough for a 3.   First I want to note... this is probably more of a quick food place... with a boba cafe sort of look... and I would says more of a dessert stop then a breakfast stop. But I guess better then McD's pancakes.   The only thing good here is the waffle (surprised?:) It was crispy and buttery and didn't get mushy 1/2 way through... So 4 for that.. but the rest...  ... everything else we had was blah. The sausage just regular whatever packaged sausage. The bacon looked blah like microwaved pre-cooked bacon (dry and fake looking). The eggs were blah too. I ordered a jasmine hot tea and got a bag of what seemed to be earl gray. I was disappointed in my tea, though didn't bother to note it since I didn't really care.   My friend had the waffle breakfast sandwich... which is a decent idea... and she seemed to enjoy, but the waffle ended up kinda soggy to me... the meats were ok... I'm bias and didn't like it b/c they add syrup to it and I have a pet-peeve about mixing my salty and sweet food.   I was a bit disappointed that it was not a sit down breakfast place. Plastic utensils, paper plates, plastic chairs and tables. Brightly painted but sparse walls... it ended up more like a boba cafe... and they do have boba and waffles with ice cream... yummy but not for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow!!!! Service was top notch here!!! Very friendly and helpful staff. In addition it was a GREAT Bobba! I had Mango and Pineaple. Wife and I had Red Velvit waffles with a plate patatoe, egg, sausage, bacon and cheese. They mix it all together is is very good! My wife works at Starbucks and a huge coffee lover and said the coffee was very very good!"}
{"text":"Great service with a smile! I enjoy all the waffle combinations but my favorite here is the potato scramble. Great place to eat and bring the family"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is great and it's convenient and easy.  Now there's nothing amazing about this place, but it's a place where people can agree to go to, especially since there are vegetarian and gluten free options.  Nutella generosity is also a major factor in enjoying the place, and they do a good job in cooking their bacon, so I am always relatively happy with my food, but this isn't a place to drive across town to try."}
{"text":"I think what you see is what you get here, which is a great thing!!  I always get the special, which is a waffle with bacon and eggs on the side.  I also order a side of whipped cream and strawberries.  I love coming here for brunch with my wife on my days off.  The staff is friendly and efficient, sometimes they can be busy,  which I am happy to see and dont mind the wait!  I want great locally owned small business restaurants to succeed!!  Unless you don't like waffles, this place is a home-run in my book,  very affordable, always clean, and very tasty!!!"}
{"text":"I came here the first day I arrived in Vegas.  My friend, having eaten here before, ordered for me.  I had some breakfast sandwich which consists of waffles as the \"bread\", and inside was egg, bacon, turkey and some sauce which seems to me honey and mayo mixed together.  Oddly enough, it tasted really good and I'm NOT a mayo fan AT ALL.  It comes with some chips on the side.  I also got their taro boba, which tasted just like any other taro boba I've tasted.  Overall, I would definitely come back.  Also, I did hear that they will be moving locations soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE, I come here about 2-3 times a week because it's just that good. My favorite is the breakfast special. I change the original waffle to a pumpkin waffle with extra powdered sugar and extra whipped cream, over medium eggs and sausage, add some Tabasco and it makes everything soo delicious! Staff is wonderful and friendly. I go for the friendly staff and the delicious food."}
{"text":"Hit up the Waffles Cafe for a late breakfast.  Not wanting anything to exotic I settled for the double original stack.  When my waffle did arrive it looked great and I loaded it up with butter and maple syrup.  I had also ordered up a large Tai Tea Boba Tea.  The waffles were delicious and did not have that malty kind of bite that you might find at other breakfast places.  It was light and crispy and absolutely made from a home made recipe.  It's other flavors now escape me.  The Tea was as most Boba teas are good and fun to drink.  Everyone that worked there was especially nice which made for a very nice breakfast."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I don't even like waffles but holy cow, everything here is delicious. The waffles are so light! We had the supreme waffle pizza (for me, since I don't like waffles) and the breakfast sandwich. Both were incredible. Bottomless coffee! The hosts were super cool, let us take our time ordering, and we're pleasant. Five stars, yo!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to get a breakfast.  The waffle sandwich is off the hook.  They put a sugary mayo (I know it sounds gross but OMG) on it. Two YUMS up."}
{"text":"This little waffle shop is a significant value, in my humble opinion.  Today, myself and the little eater known in reviews as \"the wife\" gave this place a shot, and they impressed.  As is my \"keep it cheap\" custom, I went directly after the waffle special advertised outside the restaurant.  For $5.49, the diner gets a waffle, an egg made to order, bacon or sausage, and unlimited coffee!!! The coffee is self-serve, with flavored creamers, as well as the creamy creamers.  The waffle was served hot and fresh. It had a slight buttermilk taste to it, but I may be wrong about that.  I upgraded, and added fresh blueberries for $0.75 more.    Other items on the menu include waffle sandwiches, waffle pizza's, smoothies, specialty teas, iced cream shakes, latte's, hot chocolate, soda, and juices.  Another big plus is free WiFi to customers.    If you like to be waited on, this is not your place.  The customer orders their meal at the counter, but the staff brings it to the table.  After that, you get your own coffee.  I'm happy to get the exercise of walking back and forth to the coffee, cream and Splenda."}
{"text":"I always get their breakfast sandwich special combo which consists of a perfectly cooked eggs, ham, bacon and their special sweet sauce. The service is always a warm smile upon entering. Also try their Chai Latte if you are a fan of Chai or want to become one. their dessert waffles and pizza waffles are very good as well, the smell is incredible Mmmm"}
{"text":"This place for just a waffle shop is so quaint and and quiet you almost feel like there might be something wrong with the food lol but there wasn't. I had a waffle sandwich and well as surprising as that sounds it was very good. It had fresh avocado and bacon as well as ham and it was superb! Alright more about the place. Well,  it has a pretty decent sized menu filled with what ever waffle fantasy creation you could think of and the prices are under $10 but above 5$ for almost all plates or waffle creations! The restaurant has lots of seating as well if you felt like you need to bring your football team or large family for some waffle goodness =)"}
{"text":"Amazing waffles!! If you like your waffles flaky and light then you will love this place. I got the breakfast sandwich with turkey it was amazing. The cashier at the counter really made some great recommendations on what to try and we were very pleased with both of our orders. We also tried the \"sweet-p\" and it also did not disappoint at all. The ONLY reason I'm forced not to give this place 5 stars is that it was pretty dirty inside and we were the only two people in here. I'll definitely come back here. I think if they cleaned this place up and spend a little money on the inside it would no doubt take it to 5 stars easy."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place gets all these great ratings.   I had the 2 eggs, bacon, waffle breakfast with hash browns on side.  Nothing special, in fact, I could have had fast food and not paid as much.  I suppose if you were to go there for your overly indulgent sweet tooth then it will hit the spot.   As for me, I will not be a return customer.   I would have rather waited in line at Babystacks."}
{"text":"This was a great waffle place, the waffles were amazing, I got a Nutella waffle And my friend got a white chocolate raspberry waffle, everyone was very friendly, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has thee best iced chai latte I've ever had! This was my first time visiting and I must say, I was very surprised at their diverse menu selection and reasonable prices. Also, I was pleasantly surprised at the wait for my food. I placed a to-go order and and ordered the breakfast sandwich meal and it was finished in no time. I didn't catch his name but the gentleman working there even brought my to-go order to my table where I was waiting. That's A1 customer service right there!! I'll definitely be back to try other waffles in the future!"}
{"text":"If Yelp told me to jump off a bridge would I do it? Hum? I guess if the bungee jumping company was highly recommended! Ha Ha!  Once again, yelp has led me to another terrific place: Waffles Cafe!! We have come here twice now and loved the whole thing! The place is clean, the staff are friendly and honest, the food is yummy, the concept is unique, and it's family owned (got to support that, love that!!)."}
{"text":"We love coming here. It's close to home, low key, & the food is tasty. The staff is always friendly & the wait is never long. I like that I can bring my noisy, messy 11 month old.  I usually get the breakfast sandwich & a strawberry banana smoothie. Hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! The waffles sandwiches are really good too. Want boba? Yep! They have that too! Highly recommend the breakfast sandwich or the turkey sandwich, where they use a waffle as the bread. They put this amazing house sauce on their sandwich that gives it a great taste."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice if you want to change it up. Lots of things with a waffle you probably wouldn't think of. Service is a bit spotty."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with waffles. I had a turkey club which had waffles instead of bread and had a super sweet syrup like sauce. Which was a bit different. I kind of wish I ordered off the regular waffle menu instead. But there's always next time. Service was great. Decently priced."}
{"text":"First time I had a waffle breakfast sandwich. - loved it!  Staff was super friendly and they work fast. I ordered 10 meals to go and they got on it right away.  Definitely will have breakfast here again when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"It was alright. Great service and all. Very nice little place. Food was good, but not out of this world either"}
{"text":"Came here last year with my girl and the food was awesome. Of course in our first trip back to Vegas for the new year she wants waffles cafe again. I'd have to say it's still as delicious as the first time. I had the blazing chicken and waffles and it was a hit. Waffles are soft and don't fall apart. Chicken wasn't over cooked and the wait staff was great and did mind going over the entire menu with us. I'd say skip all the fancy breakfast/ brunch spots on the strip and check waffles out. You'll be back. Tell em cam from the chi sent you."}
{"text":"I had the pancakes with strawberries and it was awesome. Others in my group had waffles , chocolate chip pancakes and a fruit bowl.  All loved it.  Only warning: if you're looking at the hash browns be aware they are McDonald's style not restaurant style.  Would definately go back."}
{"text":"How did it have 4 stars, this is my firs time doing a review... I usually like the places with 4 or 5 stars, this is the first time I didn't like it at all. I had the breakfast sandwich and it had no flavor. I had to drench it with syrup. My wife had a piece of hair stuck to her bacon, just broke off the part of the bacon. We  just did a drive from El Paso we were hungry. What a let down. If any one asks me if I want to eat there... NOPE"}
{"text":"Great waffles. Warm syrups, Nice friendly owner and staff.  What a pleasant surprise. Had the egg sausage potato scramble with a side of country gravy and it was good. We also had a waffle with fresh fruit which was really good!  Give it a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love their waffle breakfast sandwich! In my opinion it's the only thing good here. I've been here a lot and have really tried to love this place but After trying most of the menu the food really isn't that good. They are friendly and fast service but nothing is really that tasty. The bacon seems to be precooked and just reheated which tastes fine in the sandwich but not on it's own. The hash brown is like the frozen patties you buy and just deep fry- nothing special. The eggs are fluffy and perhaps poured from a carton and on the mushy side but again, in the sandwich they're good but we ordered a side of them and it was mushy. The waffles are average but the breakfast sandwich is where it's at. It comes with potato chips on the side which is interesting but I love the sweet sauce in the sandwich followed by the salty chips. I can't see myself going back here for anything else. If they ever took it off the menu I would probably never come back. They get 3 stars- 1 for friendly service, 1 for quick service, and 1 for the breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"A little out of the way from the strip, but it was nice to have a breakfast that wasn't expensive hotel food one day.  The place is cute and the people are very nice. The waffles are a bit different then what I am used to, kind of crispy outside and soft inside, my family was impressed that there was real fruit on them rather than sometype of fruity-mixed-topping. Go for the organic flax waffle it was better than the regular!!"}
{"text":"First timers. So glad we finally checked out! Delicious breakfast at affordable prices. Service was fast and courteous. Appreciated how they accommodated my little ones special requests. The waffles were amazing! All of the fruit was fresh. We also tried one of their waffle sandwiches... amazing as well! Definitely recommend. Wished we would have tried sooner!!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and brunch spot. Great for groups and children. A lot of menu items to choose from. Plenty of seating and not a long wait. Prices are affordable. Worth a drive if you're in the area. Waffle batter is tasty didn't even need syrup. Had the red velvet and created my own 3 side meal. Everything was delicious no complaints. Will be back for sure to taste rest of menu as there was a lot to choose from. Staff was friendly and attentive. Met one owner and she introduced herself and was talking with most customers. You can tell this establishment cares about their customers."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive to trying this out but im so glad I did. Its a quiet, bright, & warm Saturday morning. Kim greeted me pleasantly as I walked through the door and asked if this was my first visit. She offered to walk me through the menu and gave me a few minutes to make a selection.   I ordered the blazing chicken & waffle w/ hash browns & an orange smoothie. About 8 minutes later it was in front of me and it was delicious. The waffle was soft (making for a good wrap), the tomatoes and lettuce tastes fresh, and the chicken didn't disappoint either. Overall I think the best description would be fresh & vibrant.  Onto the atmosphere. As stated, Kim was extremely pleasant. The dining room is a mix between a small-ish brunch spot (as youd expect) with some hints of a 50s diner. Theres a flatscreen TV on the wall that was tuned into smooth hits of the 60s, 70s, and 80s that fit well with the mood of the place.  Definitely looking forward to coming back here sometime and trying some of the other interesting menu items."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! Yes its paper plates and plastic forks but food quality is what matters to me! Ordered eggs, bacon, and the best friend (oat waffle with peanut butter, nutella, whipped cream, and banana)."}
{"text":"YES YES YES! I love this place. We went here on our way to Red Rock Canyon and it was perfect place to go for a quick, cheap breakfast. When I first walked in, it reminded me of a Chinese take out place. The walls are bright orange and everyone is especially smiley and friendly. You order at the counter and then they bring everything to you. The employee at the counter was really helpful and didn't mind answering our questions and suggesting meals that we each might like (which, by the way, he did a very good job of because the food was amazing.)   I ordered the waffle sandwich- turkey, lettuce, bacon, avocado, tomato, special sauce...YUM. My dad got the strawberry waffles, my mom ordered the waffle breakfast sandwich, and my brother ordered waffle pie or something. The place is innovative, clean and the kind of place you feel good supporting. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Super yummy! The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was very clean and low key. We walked in and were asked if we have dined here before, after saying no the employee asked if we needed her to go over the menus. I thought this was very nice considering all of the staff being younger and really caring about our experience. We ordered and sat where we wanted. Upon sitting the owner was in the back and greeted many who walked in. We didn't wait too long for our meal and everything was fresh. We ordered an orange smoothie and a cantaloupe bona smoothie super refreshing! Chicken and waffles along with a red velvet waffle. The chicken tenders on the waffle was absolutely scrumptious. All white meat, i didnt have to dissect through any of the meat which I tend to do because im extremely picky with my white meat. Comes with a blazing sauce which isn't too spicy, your choice of maple syrup (flavored, plain or sugar free) and a wonderful strawberry butter on top DIVINE. The red velvet pancake didnt really burst with red velvet flavor for me. It was topped with whipped cream, powdered sugar and a sweet glaze on top and on the side should you require more. It was  a sweet treat to end out chicken and waffles brunch item. My husband loved the red velvet, I on the other hand was just ok with it, but it wasn't bad, just super sweet and he picked the item so i wont take any stars for that because its a personal preference really. Just know its very sweet, if you love that then try it! The price point in super affordable compared to actual Diners. $8.50 for the chicken and waffles and $4.50 for the red velvet. Smoothies range based on size and if you want boba beads or other toppings $3.99-5.99-ish. They offer happy hour specials after 2pm on the drinks buy one get one 50% off SWEET! I totally would come back and recommend anyone to give this place a try. Oh the owner also came over to our table to check on everything, nice touch!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and what a delightful experience it was; the waffles are so fresh and the variety of toppings are endless! Waffles Cafe will definitely be my new place to go for waffles in the future."}
{"text":"I had a strawberry wheatgrass smoothie.. I forgot to add boba, but it's the best consistency for on the go. Amazing waffles and chicken. Fluffiest pancakes I've had in forever"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Waffles! So it was a no-brainer to check this place out. Cute concept. Waffles with just about any topping and filling (turkey & cheese, sandwich waffle)  you can think up. They even offer boba which is hard to find in North Las Vegas so that's was cool.   Unfortunately the waffles were just OK, they definitely weren't the best I've ever had. But my kids loved it so we'll be back! I guess I was expecting more from a place called Waffles Cafe. Another thing to mention, the customer service has always been outstanding, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"One of the best waffles I've had in a looong time!  Belgian style, very crispy, light and tasty, not doughy or heavy.  The bacon looked lame but tasted very good.  Scrambled eggs were cooked just right (wet but not runny).  Service was great; nice people.  Small dining area. Also had a chocolate peanut butter shake that had really great flavor (not a real thick shake so your throat won't hurt trying to suck it up, and not too thin that you're wondering if it's ice milk)!  And yes, milkshake for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Waffles with bananas and peanut butter, you just can't beat it!  Prices were very reasonable too! A great little place to grab some breakfast!"}
{"text":"This joint is the jam! Just moved to LV and a friend took me here, it's off the chain. Diverse and unique menu, some of the best waffles I've ever had, Jeff and Co. are super friendly and a big part of why I return even though it's a 20 min drive. Please ignore those douchy guys who post these reviews with 2 stars and criticize the paint and tile pattern. You couldn't sound any less manly if you tried there Martha Stewart. Go to Waffles Cafe, no regrets for sure."}
{"text":"First time here waffles were very good just wish I would have had a waiter and menu at my table. Paper plate and plastic forks were a disappointment. But over all food was good."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast/brunch/lunch place.  Yummy Breakfast Sandwich using a Belgium Waffle s the bread, and great service - from the cashier to the owners son. Can't wait to try their Hawaiian Pizza Waffles. We will be back often."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Came here for my husbands birthday because of all the great reviews but was very disappointed. Ordered the breakfast special, bacon was dry and looked microwaved, over medium eggs (that came out over hard) my waffle was cold the butter didn't even melt on it. My sons scrambled eggs had a rather large egg shell in them. The hash browns were pre-made McDonald's style. All in all food quality was poor. Only giving two stars for the friendly staff."}
{"text":"We loved the food and would definitely come back! Owner was very friendly and helpful. Found this place from yelp and was very pleased. My family loved it too."}
{"text":"Food 9/10 Best waffle's I've had in Vegas ever. Highly recommend the flax waffle.   Drinks 7/10 Standard soft drinks, breakfast combo comes with unlimited coffee, Thai Tea had too much thai tea and not enough condensed milk (aka way too orange)  Environment 8/10 Good breakfast sunshine from the windows in the morning, and nice and cool during the hot summer days. Not a fan of Styrofoam plates and cups when eating in, but its understandable.   Enjoyment 9/10 I have gone to this place at least two dozen times. Great food, great family, and very accommodating if anything went wrong.   Overall 33/40 = 82.5% = 4 stars.   I grew up in the east coast, DC area to be exact. When most people think of a Waffle house, one can't help but think of Fried Chicken and Belgian waffles and a slightly dirty Denny's style diner. Sadly that's what I thought of when I first approached \"WaffleS\". This was not the case  First impression is its super clean environment and bright lights. It's definitely not an ethnic style waffle house. This is done asian style, hence the 'Cafe in WaffleS Cafe. And I can tell you I'm definitely a fan of this place. The first time going there you'll get a small culture shock as all your stereotypes get blown out of the water, THEN you'll get a little shock at the different varieties and styles of waffles you can choose from, literally a plethora of combinations.   When you decide from choosing between a standard, pizza, or sandwich waffle, you have 5 types of batter. From there, there's a a few dozen toppings from anchovies to strawberries, lets not forget all the syrups and such.   If you want a waffle your way you will get it your way. My personal favorite is the standard flaxseed waffle with maple syrup. But if i feel a little indulgent, you can't help but try Yooni's Favorite: Plain Waffle, with bananas, strawberries, whipped cream, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with chocolate syrup."}
{"text":"We love this cafe! The waffles are amazing. The potatoes were a favorite. They have a large variety of choices and everything we have tried was great. The service is wonderful and all of the employees are polite and attentive. Our new favorite breakfast destination."}

{"text":"This waffle joint is a half mile from Aliante Casino.  When my relatives start hitting the slots, they say I'm bad luck if I watch, so they tell me to scram.\"We'll be here a half hour, see you then...\"  They say they kinda feel sorry for me, but they get over it, and so do I.  Why?  It gives me an excuse to head to Waffles Cafe.   Carbs rarely ever taste this good.  I love waffles, and this waffle by itself is near perfect -  light, slightly sweet, tender, and slightly crispy all at the same time.  When it comes out warm, no matter what it's topped with, it's heavenly.  This time, I opted for the peaches and strawberries.  The peaches were sliced canned cling peaches, which I like, but I loved the sliced fresh strawberries with a dollop of whipped cream in the middle.  I decided to get it to go and eat it in the parking lot of the casino, well aware the Casino videotapes the parking lots.  All I can say to the security staff watching my one tape, \"Get your own!\" The aromatic, juicy berrie slices were naturally sweet with the waffle, the peaches were a good contrast visually, in taste, and texture.   The variety of waffles is fantastic, you can order one of their pre made concoctions, or create your own.  There is nutella, pumpkin, pecan, apples, blueberries, and so many others.  They have a great $5.49 breakfast waffle special with egg, bacon or sausage, and can add hash browns for a price. Of course, waffle sandwhiches are popular, too.   They had some bobas and teas.  But I had their Columbian coffee to go, it was decent, though I prefer my coffees bolder (i.e. French Roast) but it was a great accompaniement to my sweet dessert.  All told, it was about $8.  Definitely, I'll come back again.  My relatives didn't win this time, but in a half hour, I was far happier and my wallet was heavier than theirs."}
{"text":"I'm just not sure what people are eating around here, and whoever coming to this place saying it's good needs to stay out of this Vegas heat and go get their head checked....  on to the review.  first, walked in and I'm hit with a smell/stench. it smells like..you know when throw up dries on clothing and you get a wif of it? that was my first thought when I walked in.  sat down with the fam at a table with a open coke can on it and looked over to the menu on the wall. they do a good presentation of the images of the waffles, so I got the breakfast meal with oj. also got some scramble eggs and a waffle pizza.  waited about 8-10 minutes before some of the food got dropped off. this is where the 1 star came in.  when you pay $30+ for food, you don't expect your meal on paper plates. as soon as I saw the plate I thought \"oh fantastic this is going to be a waste\". and there my 2 eggs with dried, flat cheap bacon sat on a small round paper plate you find at target. then the waffle on a large white plate you find probably from Costco.  also when a restaurant has waffle in the name, they should really make sure their batter is kicking and cooked properly. the waffles come kind of well done, not fluffy or soft with crisp edges and there's a scoop of warm margarine, not then real butter.  rest of the food dropped off, nothing special at all. paper plates, plastic forks, aftermarket orange juice in a 16oz see thru plastic cup. just garbage presentation and food all around.  I just waited for everyone to finish, annoyed, wanting to get out of here.   if I wanted a Costco meal I'd go get samples for free.   poor presentation, poor quality food, one star is what they get. will not be coming back.  another suggestion is don't skimp and penny pinch on quality to serve value. we would have been better off going to McDonald's to get the breakfast plate, 3 of them."}
{"text":"The reviews make me feel like I just went on a bad day. The chicken and waffles were awful, And I'm a big C&W fan. The boba tea had hardly any boba. I felt sick after trying to eat some of my meal and just couldn't do it, which is quite rare for me lol. But really, I can't say anything good about this place, sorry. Oh wait!...I like the strawberry butter."}
{"text":"I was told by my roommate that this was a great spot around the corner from our house.... I was extremely disappointed. Never seen so many people on such a short cooking line take 30 minutes to make a scrabble and a waffle with only 1 order for a party of 5 ahead of us... multi tasking is not this staffs strong point. My biggest issue was the only flavors I could describe was burnt sausage and bacon. I would go into further details but not really into writing a book so I will just end with finding any other option would be the best alternative... Carl's Jr. Across the street perhaps."}
{"text":"I'm just waited 30 minutes for a Hawaiian pizza and a grilled chicken sandwich. And the place is empty. As soon as I walked up and asked for refund the pizza and chicken sandwich was ready. The person that ordered after me got their food before me and ordered a lot more. Ridiculous. Order at 11:04 am was brought out at 11:32 Am"}
{"text":"The few times I've been in this restaurant the food has been great however today I had a problem. My son and I went in there and he is on a no sugar diet because of health issues. He requested no sugar in his smoothie and was told by the owner that there would be no sugar in his smoothie. Once drinking his smoothie he had a bad reaction to the sugar that was apparently in the smoothie because they didn't pay attention to the fact that he needed no sugar. I feel as if our needs were super not met by the owner of this establishment. She should know every ingredient in everything she is selling in her restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a great cafe!  I had the original waffle with chocolate and peanut butter chips with whip cream.  I also got the combo meal with chocolate milk and bacon and eggs.  Everything was prepared with perfection and so tasty!  The staff, especially AJ, were super friendly and welcoming to me and everyone else.  I'll definitely come back next time I'm in North Las Vegas.  I hope I'm hungry enough for lunch today"}
{"text":"Oh WOW!  My boyfriend and I have been trying to find a good deal and fantastic tasting food here in Vegas... This place is it!!!!! I Love Belgian waffles... Especially when they are crunchy and soft on the inside... I made up my own which I will call the Sarah's Favorite: Original waffle with fresh strawberries,sliced up bananas,walnuts,nutella spread and whipped cream.  My eyes rolled back in my head it was sooooooo good!! I definitely recommend this place.  I just wish there was one on the East side..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to here since they opened. I normally get the double strawberry Nutella sandwich. So tasty! My boyfriend loves their breakfast sandwiches. I've tried almost everything on the menu at least once love pretty much all of it. The fruit is always fresh some of the veggies are pre-frozen but I've never minded. Also not sure why everyone cares it's served on paper plates? It's not that big of a deal. Also if restaurants do this. If the food is good, and it is, it shouldn't matter."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Great pricing, outstanding service and the food... ugh I have to fight the urge to visit multiple times each week.   To top it all off, HGTV was on in the dining area. Heaven.  Give it a try, check out the options they have. I'm sure you'll find a favorite."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat!  Service is fast. The owners are so nice. We have been going since they opened and we go every week. No other place like it in town. Once our son grew his first set of teeth he's been asking for waffles everyday. Love love love them!"}
{"text":"Super freindly spot. Family owned and i cant stress how nice they were and offered great service. When it comes to the food.. it was good but i felt like i could easily make it at home."}
{"text":"The concept of a waffles joint that serves all sorts of waffles is great. However, you would expect a place that serves mostly waffles to know how to make a perfect waffle. Mine was very brown and crisp. Not only that, but the wait time was too long. We waited a good 15+ minutes before the food was served. When it came out, it was served on paper plates. The bacon and eggs could have been made better at home. When paying for food you expect the presentation to be better than what you would do at home. For the price paid, it was not worth it. It was my first time trying it and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast restaurants. They make gluten free waffles!! Family owned, local buisness.  It is amazing!!"}
{"text":"You would think a place that specializes in waffles would appeal to almost everyone. I mean who the hell dont like waffles? They're crispy they're designed to have lots of surface area and can hold their own against fruit, ice cream, or hell even sandwich stuff.  So why dont I eat at waffles cafe more often?  The environment is pretty chill, the tables are clean the young ladies behind the counter are friendly and cheerful as well as darn attractive.   The waffles are damn tasty, the cucumber water...kinda tastes like cucumber tap water with a TDS (total dissolved solids) count of over 200.  A lot of pluses against one minus which isnt a big deal since i like to carry my own source of water in my car anyway...  So what is it about this place that prevents me from going too often...  Well i think the entire idea of this place was to appeal to younger crowds to gather and collectively consume waffles made in a variety of ways with numerous toppings and even savory waffles.  The thing that keeps me from seriously considering waffles cafe for a meal is the bang to buck ratio. There are much better deals elsewhere when you're in the mood to fill your belly up and WaffleS Cafe just doesnt fill me up enough at the cost of what i'm spending.   What about sweet waffles? If i were younger i'd love to drive out here, leech the free wifi (which is a pretty weak connection but still there) and have crispy waffle with sweet ice cream and colorful fruits decorating the plate while watching the pretty girls take orders and make waffles. I'm older now and my tastes have changed. Instead of craving something sweet i'd murder for Soyo or Pan Asian.  Be nice if they were open a little latter. Totally down for waffles after a weekly ritual of SoYo, but alas they close early.  The food is excellent and creative with numerous ways to customize something to your liking so finding something you'll really enjoy wouldnt be a problem at all. It's the practicality of spending a buck fifty for half a kiwi as a topping that makes customizing your own unrealistic and is what prevents me from giving the five stars this place deserves."}
{"text":"We were looking for an area for brunch and found this. Service was ok, menu looked great like really great but then our food came and it was just ok. . . .  1 i guess their waffles are obviously their main attraction but.  . . batter tasted like too much water, very light which wasn't able to taste the specified batter you choose. 2 very small portions for the price 3 too many flies, we were more concentrated on shooing them away then enjoying our food lol.  Other then that it is ok, i believe they have another location, maybe we will try it. Im not sure if this is a new joint but hopefully try to experiment new batter recipes."}
{"text":"Good food but don't come if you are in a hurry. Since they make everything fresh it does take a while. They have a good selection."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this place alot. It has been a while since I've returned. The staff and look has changed a bit since but they are still nice. Unfortunately far as service and quality I was a bit under satisfied. For 2 potatoe scrambles and a half waffle we waited nearly a half hour. The kitchen itself had more than 6 people in it, the establishment itself had 3 parties that came after us and that was it for patrons in the restaurant. We watched parties get served and finished there entire meal before we even got ours. I could totally understand if they were busy but to have that many staff In the kitchen and to have so many open tables and having patrons wait that long i can't understand. Unfortunately I will not be coming back. To add to it, we ordered take out, and on the bottom of all 3 of our to go boxes were all holes. Why do take out boxes have holes on the bottom???? My rating was at 5, now down to 1. Staff you were nice but unfortunately quality of service was just not what it used to be...."}
{"text":"Seen this place driving by several times before and finally we decided to plan breakfast here. Small place, friendly staff and extensive breakfast/waffle choices!!  Here's what we got:  1/2 Pumpkin & 1/2 Original Waffle: Yes it's one combined waffle and not separate halves. The Regular side tasted Alright.. It had a balanced flavor and most importantly the texture was right on!  Adding some silky butter and some syrup helped it a bit. On the other hand, the Pumpkin side tasted Much Better. Just the right of Pumpkin Goodness!  Sausage, Bacon & Egg Whites: Got these on the side.. Bacon were thin, crispy and short. Can't really go wrong with bacon but the portion was way too little. Egg whites were a palm full, tasted fine but again their portion was meant for Infants! Sausage same difference in serving size (a pair).Typical But Tasty!  Yooni's Favorite/Special: Original Waffle, Strawberry, Banana, Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce. I'm more of a simple kina waffle eater but this thing is quite the treat! Everything goes well with eachother and its one sweet way to start off a morning!!  Simple small shop, value was okay, I think a tad on the pricey side and really friendly service. I'd come back to try other waffle creations.."}
{"text":"I guess maybe I'm spoiled with my supervisor's waffles...   We came here while waiting for an appointment nearby. I ordered the waffle with peanut butter. I can't remember what he ordered.   The waffles, in my opinion, felt very cheap - like the pre-made freezer versions - Eggos! They were too crisp and very bland/flavorless.   I will not be eating here - ever - again."}
{"text":"I love this waffle cafe. Food is great and it's always clean when I go.  The staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Waffles were tasty.  If you build your own it can get a bit pricey.  Ambience is cute.  This neighborhood needs places like this."}
{"text":"This was the dirtiest eating establishment I have EVER walked into. Floors ,walls,chairs,tables, everything was really dirty. If the front of the house was this dirty I can only imagine what the kitchen looked like."}
{"text":"My dad (84) and I went in yesterday for breakfast.  As we found out on a prior visit, Kim will accommodate special requests that aren't on the menu.  My dad had a tall stack of pancakes and I had the seasoned potatoes and regular sized yogurt parfait which was full of a variety of fresh fruit, granola, and yogurt.  Everything was delicious!! Kim is patient, friendly, and more than willing to answer questions.  The food is cooked after you order, and it is made with fresh ingredients.  You order at the counter, but your food and drinks are brought to your table. Kim and another person checked on us, refilled our drinks, and cleared away out plates.  So far, I have tried something new on each visit, and I have never been disappointed.  The food is hot and delicious or cold and delicious depending on what you order.  Customers are treated like they are the most important person in the place.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  Customer service is definitely a priority.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was expecting more than paper plates and plastic silverware. Waffles were dry and my kids immediately said we should have stayed home and made waffles there. The coffee was weak as well. Not a great start for our morning!"}
{"text":"The best waffles I have ever had! Wonderful staff! Friendly and helpful. Very clean environment. I had the pumpkin waffle with fruit. Side of fruit and sausage. Coffee was also delicious. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves waffles they are life changing!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is not a typical breakfast place. You order at the counter and the menu is more of a build your own. Service was quick. Food is served on paper plates which didn't bother me but definitely something to note as it may bother some. Food was okay. I think $7 for a waffle with no eggs or sides is a bit pricey. Overall not a bad place and definitely something different."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted to take some friends to breakfast. I went here based on yelp reviews. While I think the food was good, it isn't a four or five star restaurant. With that said, the food was decent and it was a good value.   As a side note, A LOT of people who don't have handicap parking placards park in the handicap parking spots in this shopping center. Having a child who uses a walker and a wheelchair, this is very disheartening. You can read about her at HugsforHailey.com ."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing! I love the people and the employee's are always friendly and helpful. And the food is delicious"}
{"text":"This is a unique, family owned cafe with awesome t-shirts (I love their iron man t-shirts)! They are very friendly and give good suggestions on what to order, since it was our first time there. The waffles aren't too soft or too hard, just perfect. The portion sizes are fairly large as well. I wouldn't mind stopping by here again, whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We had chicken breast sandwich and shortcake waffle was very good.  Coffee was watery My waffle was lacking  flavor. However the ice cream had ice crystals through out the ice cream. The fruit was ok along with the chocolate syrup. They forgot our hot chocolate. Not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, super-amazing service, good portions.   What more does anyone want? (Maybe a Cookie Butter Waffle please?!)"}
{"text":"Heavenly is the only word to describe this place. It's simple and relaxed but very clean. The staff is always so nice whenever I go in. The waffle sandwiches are AMAZING simply for the sauce they put on them...don't know what it is and it looks kinda weird but it tastes sooooo good. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Love everything about Waffles Cafe!!! I give major props to the young guys that are always in there because they really do provide great service.   I've only had breakfast there a couple times but I come in for Boba tea from time to time because it's conveniently located right off the 215.   Major plus also for not having a minimum to pay card."}
{"text":"Always stop by here when we go to vegas! Who wants the usual breakfast buffet from the hotel!  Stop by and try a nice tasty and fresh waffle sandwich...its a taste of heaven!  The service is excellent, and even though we have only been once, they remembered us from almost a year ago!"}
{"text":"I love supporting small, family owned businesses. The people who own this place are so nice and friendly. No, the place is not fancy so if your coming here for pazazz, forget it. BUT if you want a perfectly cooked, delicious waffle that hits the spot you will not be disappointed. TONS of toppings to choose from, and so fresh. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband's a waffle man but he's no push over. Not just any old waffle will do. So we were pleasantly surprised to find Waffles Café and we both enjoyed their light crispy waffles. The service is awesome. A friendly smile and pleasant hello does wonders in the morning before my brain is kick started by a cup of coffee. Everything is cooked to order. Tasty. An overall delicious breakfast joint."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here since it's been open.  Great breakfast options.  The flaxseed waffles are to \"live\" for!  The owners and staff are very polite and welcoming.  It's everything you need if you don't feel like cooking breakfast at home."}
{"text":"THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES MEAL IS BEAUTIFUL. It had two sauces: one for the chicken and one for the waffle. The syrup was served warm. 10/10 would come back again. Also, the cashier is so welcoming. She makes you feel important and comfortable."}
{"text":"I love this place and I've been going here to eat breakfast since I moved in the NW about 7 years ago.  I love their concept on waffle sandwiches and back then there was a few places that offer this Idea.  Until this day, their service and food has been consistent on my every visits."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely friendly, the waffles are awesome (my favorite one to get is the cherry blossom, it has cherries, vanilla ice cream, and a nice fluffy chocolate waffle underneath, yummm) they do have a little complimentary water station too which is super nice. Oh! And they have boba! Definitely give their boba a try, I normally get the melon one!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!! Hand's down my favorite waffle place by far! And the customer service is great! jeff actually let me take a picture of him with his favorite waffle!"}
{"text":"My good friend took me here my last trip to Vegas. I told her I wanted to find some cheap eats so she suggested this place. I make waffle sandwiches at home so I was pretty excited when she told me about it.  The place was empty which scared me like \"where are the customers? is the food even good?\" I wasn't about to make my friend search for a another place so I kept my mouth quiet. She told me to get the chicken sandwich, but they RAN OUT OF CHICKEN? So we both settled for the turkey waffle sandwich. Which was your basic turkey sandwich, but instead of bread you had a waffle and instead of mayo you get this \"sweet sauce\". Honestly I wasn't impressed... actually I was pissed off. I guess if you like mixing sweet with savory this is your place. But I personally would never come here again. No flavor and the fact that they were running out of ingredients on a Friday afternoon was pretty annoying."}
{"text":"Wow just reading some of the other reviews just now and they seem harsh but hey I guess that;s their experience.  My aunt and I go about once a month when we get a hankering for a waffle (when you are constantly one a diet and trying to lose weight you have to splurge a little:) and the waffles we get are quite good.  We both just go old school and get the classic waffle with some fruit on it and that's about it but the price is reasonable and they always seem done and have a nice crunch to it.  The wait time can be a little long especially for not a busy place but I think they keep just one or two people on as staff and that could make the wait time a bit slow.  Overall I think its a yummy neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"My people, they have gluten free waffles!! And they taste awesome! It's been ages since I could eat a waffle and now I can. Yaaaaaas!"}
{"text":"I like this location even better than the one near me. Staff is super sweet and the layout is very nice. Oh yeah and the gluten free waffles just happen to be the bomb.com. Crunchy on the inside but chewy on the inside. Drooool......"}
{"text":"The Skinny: the waffles are okay but nothing special - be careful about what you order though (3) Service: it's counter service but it's friendly (3) value: it's okay - not terribly expensive but not terribly cheap either when you factor in the cost of toppings.  Ordered the breakfast special (original waffle, egg and sausage for $5.49) and the strawberry waffles x 2 (around $7-ish). To clarify, we expected the original waffle with fresh strawberries on top however it turned out to be strawberry-flavoured waffles.  The eggs and sausage were a little on the bland side. The original waffle was satisfying crisp however lack sweetness. They are not belgian waffles that have that eggy/buttery/cookie goodness. You really need to drench those suckers in syrup.  The strawberry waffles were sweeter than the original flavour however lack the appropriate texture - not quite as crisp and a little too cakey. Nor did the waffle retain any strawberry flavour at all.  Overall, not a bad place to eat but not exceptional either. I would recommend coming in small groups due to the lack of seating in this small establishment."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place probably a hundred times. Not sure why I never stopped. My wife and I decided to give it a try and we weren't disappointed. She got the breakfast sandwich and I got the buffalo chicken sandwich. They both came on a waffle. You get to choose from chips, hash brown, of waffle fries. Get the waffle fries. Then they have like 7 or 8 seasonings you can have. I tried the salt & vinegar. Was pretty amazing.   There was so many options so we will be back for another go. Especially for happy hour to try one of there shakes."}
{"text":"No frills but a family fave!!! We love the service they are so friendly and always remember you. The waffles are very light, airy and delicious. The fruit waffle sandwich is really yummy. The prices are great the have a breakfast combo with a waffle, meat, eggs, and coffee for like 5 or 6 buck! Great, friendly, peaceful little place to grab s cup of coffee and enjoy family time for brunch."}
{"text":"a homemade waffle joint down the street from my house??? i must be the luckiest girl in the world!  there are many items on the menu but the best item is the BYOW (build your own waffle). your choice of waffle type and toppings. that's all me, man!  i got the organic flax waffle with strawberries, bananas and mangoes. the waffle was perfectly cooked - a nice crunch on the outside and super fluffy on the inside. the fruit was so fresh and perfectly ripe. didn't even need any syrup!  the hubby got the breakfast sammich. it must've been good because, before i knew it, it was gone.  the service was great. you can tell it's a family owned and run business. those are the best in my book.  sure, it might be nice to be able to eat these amazing waffles on real dinnerware with real flatware but the paper and plastic products certainly won't keep me from gettin my WaffleS on!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelpers for this recommendation. Downtown Vegas was not fulfilling my craving for fresh waffles, but this was perfect since we were on our way to Red Rock and back to LA. We had the waffle breakfast sandwich and the waffle breakfast bowl. Both were really good! Not sure what the sweet sauce was (not maple syrup), but it was just right! Salty potato chips served on the side- I wasn't into that for breakfast.   Not sure if there are usually two people working, but you can tell it's a small business and they work hard to make this place full of quality and definitely unique! I wanted to try everything on the menu, especially all the fruit and ice cream waffles!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute. The servers are very sweet and friendly. Like another yelper state, it is not a restaurant. You place your order at the register, seat yourself and they bring your food out. I always get the breakfast combo, which is very reasonably priced for what you get. Portion size is just right, not huge and just enough. I feel as if the waffles are a bit in the salty side, which is probably because the same batter makes both the sweet and savory waffles. Also, try their smoothies.  Huge selection of flavors."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this place and both times were delicious. We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and a turkey club; the sandwiches came with a choice of chips, waffle fries, or hash browns... we chose the waffle fries. The meal was delicious and well priced at $6.95 (did not order drinks, water was available by condiments counter).  There's a huge menu on the wall; it can look intimidating so just grab a menu near the register if you need extra time. I love that the first items on the menu are desserts; they deserve their place, front and center!"}
{"text":"BANG FOR THE BUCK MEETS CREATIVE FUN! I totally love WaffleS Cafe and would give it 4.5 stars if I could. It's not a five star restaurant, but what it is is a great place to go for a fast, well cooked breakfast meal.  WaffleS Cafe is where \"Bang for the Buck\" meets \"Creative Fun!\" The BREAKFAST SPECIAL is a full-sized waffle, two eggs to order, bacon or sausage, and coffee is included. (7-11am) All that for $4.99. The coffee included really makes a difference as it'll run you about $2 at most breakfast locations. Additionally, they give it to you in sturdy to-go cups so you can take a cup of coffee with you. Nice!  But the real fun part is you can create the waffles any way you want, and there are a LOT of ingredients to choose from. The fruit toppings run the full range. Along with the standards (including FRESH strawberries) are pineapple and kiwi. Other toppings include peanutbutter, sprinkles, ice cream(!), and a selection of nuts. But there's many, many more toppings and you can mix and match them any way you want. The pricing of the toppings is very fair so you can get several and still be way under the normal breakfast price.  A cool concept is they do some odd toppings as well. For example, they have several pizza waffles (including a supreme). They also have lunch meats for waffle sandwiches. I haven't had them, but the quality of everything that we've had so far has been very good so I suspect it would be the same on these interesting choices.  Jeff and Yooni run the place and I suspect they own it, too. They are always there and you can tell they really want to do a good job. It's awesome seeing them put their heart into the business and it makes me happier to support their effort.  The atmosphere is basic but clean and not too crowded. You won't wait for a table and we get our food rather quickly.  Oh, and they do have smoothies and serve boba (a Vietnamese drink that is sweet like a melted smoothie but has very large tapioca balls in the bottom. Kids love them!)  If you're in the West-Southwest (Ft. Apache just south of Trop) and are looking for something different, fun, CHEAP, yummy, and no wait, I'd check this place out. It's a good one to have in your hip pocket."}
{"text":"5 stars is for the warm and friendly feel. Stopped in for lunch because we were in the neighborhood. Been meaning to try this place cause we pass by it often enough.   The shopping center is questionable. There are only 3 restaurants occupying the property, yet every window has signs of new-coming restaurants moving in. I think there was 8 other restaurant signs and all under construction. So random b/c my bf's lived there for 1.5 yrs and its been an empty plaza.   Tried the waffle sandwich w/ bacon, ham, cheese, and advocado. It was really good! There was a slight sweetness in the waffles(?) which made the sandwich sweet and salty. Bf ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, it was good but mine was so much better. I really want to try their sweet waffles but we were hungry for lunch not dessert.. that just means must return soon!!   The restaurant was open and big. The guy who greeted and took our order was really pleasant. Gave me free coffee! The menu was small and simple easy to order. I love finding mom and pops neighborhood restaurants!!!! Overall good experience would def. come back time and time again (:"}
{"text":"I love the tuna sandwich. I'm a regular here and I always ask the worker to add some spiciness to my sandwich. I love it!  Service here is great, feels like you're their best friends. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants a good breakfast that can be turned into a dessert or dinner.  Ask for the Alexa Special. ;)"}
{"text":"Came here wanting a real breakfast it fell short.  I ended up getting a tuna waffle which was lacking tuna, too much waffle and not enough meat/flavor.  The Mrs. thought it was \"ok\" but I don't think we would come back unless to try a dessert waffle."}
{"text":"Waffle Cafe is amazing! The two guys that work in here are very friendly and always provide great service. The food is incredible and unique. We don't have anything else like this in Las Vegas, at least not in the Centennial area for all I know.  Portions are great, food is amazing, service is on point. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the chicken sandwich and he described it like eating sugar and chicken that was microwaved.. disgusting. The waffles are paper thin like they are trying to save batter. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just got out from grubbing on brunch with the fam. We all had the $6.99 waffle breakfast which included 1 waffle, 2 eggs and choice of 2 bacon strips or 1 sausage. We all literally had the same thing: waffle, over medium eggs, bacon. And everything was consistently cooked perfectly to order. The waffles came with a great amount of butter snack dab on the middle. They were crispy and soft in certain areas with a naturally light sweet flavor on their own. The syrup comes room temperature and they also offer strawberry and boysenberry syrup on the counter. The bacon strips were thinner, FYI for those who like thicker cuts. BUT they were crispy and a good meat to fat ratio. No issues with the eggs, at all. This was a second visit here and from what I can remember from before... it was just as yummy! The breakfast also came with unlimited coffee. I love that there's a punch card here, as well! I've filled up my card on this visit and am up for $5 off for the next visit. Deff comin back!"}
{"text":"mmm waffles. Wait, is that a breakfast sandwich? But with a waffle instead on bread? Perfect match! Had to try it. And it was good. They had some house sauce on it that was sweet but interestingly nice.  And we also got their choclate strawberry waffle thing. Can't go wrong with this combination. Yum.  There are so many choices of waffles and some pretty interesting ones. Did I mention I love waffles? I need to try all the varieties, but only had room for 2 different waffles to share with the bf.  When we went here for a late breakfast, it was pretty quiet. Only 2 other people inside from what I remember. But as we sat waiting for our food and eating it, there was decent traffic of people ordering waffles to go. It is nice that they have different flavored batters for their waffles.  Must say, the idea of this place is great. Almost a dream come true. And though the waffles were yummy, they were not superb. It did have a different flavor from the traditional waffle and healthier? And a nice place to just sit and chat...It is a place I would return with my waffle cravings. Since it is pretty close to my house."}
{"text":"I went to the waffle cafe with my boyfriend on a monday. i was really quiet. no one was in there so i was able to get my waffle very fast. ( i just ordered strawberries and white chocolate chips )   The place is nice and quaint. they also have boba teas for my boba fans out there! and its really good for kids and families!  i'll be back soon ! :)"}
{"text":"The cafe is small but pretty clean. We had issues with the iPad type payment system and ended up paying cash when our credit card payment wouldn't produce a receipt twice. I tried to order a boba tea as an upgrade to my breakfast order but I was told by the cashier I couldn't do that, though the menu on the wall states it's possible. The food is served on paper plates with plastic utensils brought out by the staff calling your name from your receipt. The bacon I received was rather crispy, almost burnt but the eggs were fluffy and delicious. The waffles were crispy and tasty and they offer a variety of warm syrup. The orange juice was rather sweet but good. All in all, we enjoyed our experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Thai tea was terrible, no flavor and watery with the boba balls being hard jelly like and not cooked properly. Milk tea was sour with boba balls also jelly like and not chewy."}
{"text":"OMG! I have driven by this place seance they have opened and have always wanted to try this place.  I'm so glad I went today. I got a waffle breakfast sandwich. It was amazing!! I don't typically like waffles, but these were so light and fluffy and perfect!!!!! I def. Found my new place for breakfast!!!!"}
{"text":"keep up the great work, because whatever you're doing with this place is noteworthy. I was greeted sincerely when I walked in. She asked if I wanted to look at the menu myself or have her brief me. Smoothies are authentic, tenders aren't greasy and taste good too. Whatever this dip is for my strips is lit. Strawberry butter for my waffle, and the blueberry syrup is light on weight but prominent on flavor. My son met a new friend here and immediately turned into a play date. Got my stamp card started, and we'll be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"Not enough food for a chipmunk...and what did come was...meh.  Breakfast of last resorts."}
{"text":"This cute little place is amazing. I took my gf there for date night after we played mini golf down the street and we weren't sure what to expect. When we walked in, we were greeted warmly and decided to split a sandwich item and a dessert item.   We ordered the turkey waffle sandwich with bacon and it came sandwiched between a nice delicious crispy, but light, waffle and some type of light sauce with avocao,e lettuce, and tomato. AAHHMAAYYYYZING!!! Seriously. Delicious and impressive. At this time we also ordered a mango boba tea smoothie which was the best I've had in Vegas, even better than tea station in china town!  Next...we ordered Jeff's favorite...which was a pumpkin waffle with apple pie filling, Carmel sauce, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. We added white chocolate chips. Tasted like heaven. That's all i have to say.   If you have a sweet tooth and you enjoy waffles, check this place out. The two people working there are awesome. The food is amazing and he vibe is mellow. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Best tasting waffles that I have had anywhere. For $7.56 you get a waffle, 2 eggs and tasty sausage.  You order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table. The friendly staff are quick and are always smiling. You have got to check out this place."}
{"text":"Went here with family recently for breakfast based on good reviews.  It is a very simple place, with several tables and a counter where you order.  Basically you look at the big waffle based menu on the wall and seat yourself and wait for your order.  There is a good selection of waffle types, such as chocolate, pumpkin, flax, and regular, and a wide variety of toppings you can pay to add.  There are also waffle pizzas and waffle sandwiches, so make no mistake, waffles are the focus here.   Our experience was not exactly stellar.  We were 4, and ordered and sat down.  The silverware is plastic silverware and paper plates, which is not exactly the most convenient way to eat a meal, if one has ever gone picnicking.  We ordered 3 waffles, and a side of eggs and a sausage.  It took 57 minutes to receive.  FIFTY SEVEN minutes.  The place was moderately full, but not a single person came in after us.  The food itself was not bad, but it was not sensational either.  It was basic waffles that one could make at home, with some scarce toppings put on top ($.50 for a dollop of whipped cream and another $.50 for 3 strawberries sliced up).  The eggs were just simple scrambled eggs.  Now, while the food did not turn me off, it did nothing to instill me with a burning desire to return, and after a near HOUR long wait for what should have taken 10 minutes tops, I will not be back.  The guy at the counter tossed us a couple of $5 coupons, but it came when they brought us the food, and there was nothing said in the intervening hour.  No \"hey sorry it is taking an eternity...this is why...\" or anything of the sort.  Overall, I give it 2 stars since the food itself was acceptable, and I like to reserve 1 stars for places that are utterly disgusting."}
{"text":"The waffles here \"ROCK\"!!  Light and fluffy, the perfect breakfast!!  Crunchy on the outside, the inside, almost like eating air.  The breakfast special included scrambled eggs done just right.  Very mom and pop atmosphere, which lends to the charm of the Waffles Cafe, along with the great staff.   This is a go-out-of my-way place!!!"}
{"text":"A quick review.  A small Ma & Pa-style breakfast joint.  It's located in a little strip mall with inexpensive furnishings and food is served on paper plates/cups with plastic utensils. It might be time for them to do a little touch up painting in the dining room too.  Don't expect much other than some decent and inexpensive food. I do need to comment that the waffles were REALLY good, despite the spartan layout. Another plus is they offer a 10% military discount.   The young men working there were pleasant and helpful in aiding us in a menu selection.  You go direct to the counter and order and they bring the food to you at your selected table.   The tables we sat at had both been cleared, but not wiped down, which is probably not a good idea considering that waffle syrup is a staple condiment. Breakfast included unlimited coffee refills, but you need to go get it yourself.   FYI, they do not have a soft drink dispenser, so if you order a Coke, they will bring a can and a cup of ice...kinda like they do in Europe.   All in all, not an unpleasant exoerience, but we'll keep searching for a North Las Vegas breakfast favorite. Can't for the life of me figure out how anyone could rate this a 5 star...NEVER."}
{"text":"This is a great spot in Aliante. My favorite time is the breakfast sandwich with waffle fries. Everything always comes out hot and fresh and the staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Best food, amazing friendly service. If you've ever had a genuine belgian waffle you know this is the only place to get one in town. The owners treat everyone like best friends. We always feel so welcome!"}
{"text":"Packed on weekend mornings, but always friendly fast service. Great tasting breakfast special with coffee for 5.49. This place is small so seating can be an issue at busy times. My only gripe is the floor looks like it needs a good scrubbing."}
{"text":"Overall, great experience.  I ordered an iced chai tea and a pumpkin waffle with raspberries, strawberries, blueberries and light on the whipped creme.  I loved my waffle!  The pumpkin batter was absolutely delicious and the fruit were so fresh!  Definitely not the soggy, miserable little fruit IHOP puts on their fruity-tooty pancakes.  I proceeded to have a conversation with the guy at the register, turns out he's one of the co-owners.  He was a great guy.  He explained to me that they used to have high school kids work there but then they started reading bad reviews on them mentioning customer service so now he works there all the time.  I love that!  He cares about what us customers have to say.  So heads up to anyone that might've had a bad customer service situation with them in the past.  I went on a weekday morning and there was only one group of people in there before me.  The lady of that group put 2 dollars in the tip jar and thanked the co-owner specifically for the customer service and said she loved her food.  It's not often you find a breakfast place that isn't a typical waiter restaurant-style.. so this is a great alternative if you don't have the time for all that."}
{"text":"Went here the first time yesterday. Customer service was good. I had banana split and hot coffee. It was good. Unlimited hot coffee :)  I'll be back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"I've seen some mixed reviews about this place and being how I am, I have to go see for myself. We thought we'd stop by on our way to running some errands and give it a shot. The place is pretty small so you want to get there at a good time so you can actually get a seat. The line can get long at times. We ordered our food and found a seat. It took a long time for us to even get our food. It felt like people who came in after us, were getting their food before us and we only had two in our party. Definitely wasn't happy about waiting as long as we did for our food. I got the chicken and waffle plate and he got the ice cream sundae waffle. They were both good, but I don't think they were super. I will say the strawberry butter that they give you for the chicken and waffle didn't go very well. I'm glad I only put it on half of my waffle. I won't do that again. The sundae waffle was good too, but it was super sweet to eat for breakfast. We may go back and try it again, trying something different on their menu."}
{"text":"I think a good gauge for how good a restaurant is, is when everybody in your party finishes everything on their plate (without being threatened). I would say for us (me, wifey & 2 kids) this doesn't happen often, although we eat out a lot. We stopped here on the way up to Red Rock Canyon. We ordered the Breakfast Special (son),  a Breakfast Sandwich (me), Yooni's Favorite (daughter) & a Banana Split (wifey). Everything was delicious and satisfying. Now only if they could get some fried chicken up in the mix."}
{"text":"Waffles were great! I had the blazing chicken & waffle sandwich I highly recommend it!  Would have again.  You can tell the waffles were made Fresh. The coffee was delicious, strong. The wait staff was very nice, and attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent:  food (quality,price, portion size,variety of menu offerings) cleanliness of establishment decorum,tables and chairs spacing is adequate, customer service, price. There are healthy conscious offerings to include gluten free, organic, vegan. Kudos to Kim"}
{"text":"I give the WC 4 stars total. I love waffles. And the place is clean and everyone is kind. This is a nice little spot to sit and have breakfast. On a Saturday morning when IHOP is packed to the max. You can enter here and get served in less than 15 minutes. Even if your in a large group. The eggs they cook are the best ever. And the place is extra clean. Water is free. Wait for it....Oh my they give you a large cup! This place is worthy of my business. I will bring friends and family here, It wont break yo bank. I had a waffle eggs and bacon for like 5 bucks. This is helpful around the holiday time when you just want to run in get fed and head out to do holiday shopping!"}
{"text":"Amazing food that was ready on time and warm friendly staff,love this place I definitely recommend it to all my friends and family"}
{"text":"Love this place so much. Now that I have a Yelp account, I can finally leave a review. Everything about this place and especially the food is so great. The food is wholesome, fresh, and local. Everything was made perfectly. I usually order the pumpkin waffles breakfast with walnuts. To die for! The staff is very attentive and very friendly. Jeff is such a sweet guy!"}
{"text":"What a great option for us, Gluten Free waffles and you can get any type of waffle that they way. A great selection for breakfast and lunch. A definite stop when we're here, great job and great food!!"}
{"text":"We went here after purchasing a Groupon.  It was really busy and the servers had a hard time keeping up, lots of dirty tables.  We had to clean our own!  The whole place was really dirty - stains on the walls and the floors were disgusting. If we had noticed that before we ordered we wouldn't have stayed.  The food was good, I liked the waffles but I want to eat in a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped in  the Waffles Cafe for a bite to eat before heading home and boy I'm happy I did. The two gentlemen at the counter recommended many items but I chose something simple since it was my first time trying the place out. I ordered one Waffle, scrambled eggs and a sausage link. My order arrived at the table and might I say my Waffle couldn't of smell better. After taking my first bite  I was hooked. My Waffle taste so lite not heavy like the others,the butter was melted evenly on my Waffle and they have so many options of syrup to choose from its unreal. The scrambled Eggs were perfect not hard and the Sausage link, well it was a sausage link, but good. I will definitely go back for more you can bet on that. This cafe was clean, the service was fast and l highly recommend this place. Aw"}
{"text":"First time experience was delicious. I ordered chicken and waffle and it was such a nice combo. Love the strawberry whipped butter with the spicy sauce! The chicken taste ok but wish it was more tender and juicy. Waffles were perfect. Went back another time and tried to order the same thing for dinner but they ran out of chicken. Went back 3rd day but they were already closed so I suggest getting meat entree early in the day. Would be nice if they extended their hours in the evening . I thought the prices were a little high tho."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, and affordable. Very personable staff who recognizes repeat customers."}
{"text":"I like trying new places, particularly those in sad little strip malls that I fear are going to go tits up in this economy.  When I went to Waffles Cafe I thought I would be doing them some kind of charity - nay!  There were so many people at the cafe that it was standing room only for awhile.  That's okay because the walls are so brightly painted that you can't help but feel happy and okay with waiting around for your waffle.  The place is so tiny and overcrowded which is one reason they didn't get 5 stars, but the reason for the popularity is because of the great grub!  My first thought was that they didn't have enough food on the menu with protein because I was in the mood for a good egg dish (duh!  then why did I go to a place descriptively named 'waffles'?!), but then I got a load of the Waffle Sandwich.  This baby is, again, descriptively named.  Instead of bread, they make this sandwich with waffles that are sweet and syrupy, but with savory fillings.  I had ham and bacon with avocado and tomato inside of my sweet waffle bread.  It was nothing if not freakin' delicious!  Messy, but delicious.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will try the tuna waffle sandwich.  It does sound disgusting, but I am strangely attracted...  stay tuned.  My only complaints were the very uncomfortable and cheap seats and tables and the lack of space, but otherwise a lovely breakfast."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Clean location. Great customer service. Friendly and quick. We will be returning for there chicken and waffles. Thank you Waffles Cafe!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst breakfast ever. I can't think of another restaurant I have ever been that I would give one star. Just inedible, and I eat everything."}
{"text":"waffles are great. who dosnt like a menu based carbs!!   if they would just take the concept from the signage and pull it thru the whole place it would be much more pleasant to be inside, for now stay focused on the food and you'll come back over and over...  nutella, banana, strawberry and whipped cream on a fresh hot amazing waffle...   my mouth watering now just thinking of it... ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but the problem was that the chicken tenders I got weren't actually tenders. A chicken tender is technically part of the breast. The breast being made of the pectoralis major and minor. The pectoralis major is the \"breast\" part. The smaller section of the breast is the pectoralis minor, or the \"tender\". What I got wasn't that. It was a glorified chicken nugget. Processed, spongey, and all.  My tip to the establishment: don't call giant nuggets \"tenders\".  Other than that, the food was decent. Good luck.  Update: I finished my coffee and it was super grainy at the end. Bitter bits of grounds got me grumpy. BAD!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks yelp for this find! This place has some outstanding waffles which you can get in breakfast combos, or sandwiches, or however you like.  Stop on by here when you get tired of the Vegas buffets and want something a llttle different."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars!!!!  Service is great and professional, the waffles  delicious!!  The eggs bacon sausage and hashbrowns were excellent!! They have a very large and the licious menu I can't wait to go back and try something different!! If you're ever in the area centennial I recommend stopping in having a bite.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat breakfast! The owners are so polite as well!! They hired more staff and all we have come across have been amazing and so nice!! Love this place"}
{"text":"The waffles are sooo good you can't eat just one.   The food is outstanding and even though you eventually become full you still want more.  The menu has  many selections and is very easy to read.  Larry & Eva Roth"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool idea for a restaurant. Different and delicious! I had the s'mores waffle and it was really good. The only think is you pay for the waffle and that's it. I'd like it if they already had premade combo meals. Maybe I missed it but I like how things are set together.    I will go back for sure! Great little treat every now and then."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! They have a very unique menu which isn't just limited to traditional breakfast.   They have really yummy ice cream selections as well as more hearty selections...  The people who own this place are very friendly and always have a smile on their face, they are also very accommodating!   I love their waffles they are so unique I would describe the taste as sort of like a sweet croissant like taste, and a light  fluffy and crisp texture, not heavy like your traditional waffle.Also the milkshakes are my sons Fav!!!   I also love their loyalty cards. The overall setting is casual but still family friendly."}
{"text":"Today we brought a friend from out of town to this place because we liked it so much last time we went there.  It turned out to be a complete disappointment.  We had to get the food to go because the friend had a plane to catch.  The guy told us it would take 10 to 15 mins for the food to be ready.  We waited.  While we were waiting, everyone else got served, even people that came to the place AFTER us.  After 20+ mins, there was no sign of the food, I asked the guy and told him that we were in a hurry.  He said \"it should be ready in 4 mins.\" (his exact words).  10 mins passed... no food.  I don't even know how long we ended up waiting for 3 waffles.  Finally the food was here, they were questioning us what we ordered.  At that point I was just furious.  Right, took you forever to get our food because you served everyone else first and now you are telling me that you don't remember what we ordered?! I will NEVER go back. NEVER. EVER."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Employee came out and walked us through the menu and gave us tips and suggestions. Waffles were yum. I had banana and peanut butter. My husband had a blazing chicken sandwich. Fries were awesome, too. Out of the rush of town. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were craving a waffle and had not tried out this spot. Smells wonderful when you come in, definitely waffles being cooked up. However, it was just ok, meaning we ate it but won't bother coming back. I tried the pumpkin waffle which really didn't taste anything close to pumpkin. They also placed a huge wad of butter on it which should have been on the side as I don't care for butter. It should be the customers choice to add it. My honey tried a pizza version which was fine, but not a stand out."}
{"text":"I've lived by here for almost 8 months and I finally came in and oh my gosh! I've fell in love! It taste so good and satisfied my breakfast craving! I love the potato scramble. I'll defiantly be recommending my friends :)"}
{"text":"Waffles were solid. Crispy and golden brown on the outside light and airy on the inside. The dessert ingredient combos were heavenly.  I also had a sandwich waffle which was tasty. I might recommend using a better quality meat and larger portion. The secret sauce was tasty, kind of a sweet mayo. Service was friendly but we were the only ones inside."}
{"text":"I only decided to eat at this restaurant due to its good ratings on Yelp... I was disappointed to find that the food was sub-par. I thought I would be having some magically delicious waffle... I did not find it to be magical at all. The waffles are big and somewhat tasty. I think it's the butter, not the syrup, that makes it good. The supreme pizza waffle was a bore... I didn't bother to finish it. I was happy to find that they had boba drinks (odd for a waffle place, right?), but noticed they were pricier than my favorite standalone boba location. It was $4.50 for a large Thai tea w/ boba. Again, it only tasted okay. (I would gladly pay $5 for super tasty boba.) Even though I received a stamp card, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"So you won't believe how I ended up here. Somehow I had it in my head that the Wild Wild West was the hidden gem of Vegas buffets. Well, when Jamie W. and I drove there, we discovered that it was a tired motel filled with frog-voiced smokers next to a Denny's. Surely my mind was playing tricks on me. As I realized much later, it was Sam's Town I was looking for, but regardless, we were jonesing for breakfast. Thanks to the trusty Yelp app on my iPhone, we zeroed in on WaffleS Cafe.   Surprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall just like almost every non-Strip eatery in town. It really looks like a smoothie shop since I couldn't tell if they even had a kitchen. The overhead menu would have you believe it's a virtual waffle-palooza in there. Perhaps but I didn't hear the sound of a griddle or the plop of the batter, which made me think the waffles are made elsewhere and heated up in the back. It was just too quiet in there. Anyhow, both of us went for the $5.49 Breakfast Special - which consisted of a large, round waffle; a couple of eggs; bacon or sausage; and a cup of coffee.   I ordered the pumpkin waffle and had blueberries and whipped cream placed on top. It was good, and the meaty sausage and scrambled eggs helped a lot. Jamie showed greater forbearance and had his pumpkin waffle plain with a pat of butter, but he weakened and went for the bacon. All in all, it didn't feel substantive enough to be the breakfast we desired, but it did tie us over until the dogs we had at Pink's for lunch. Not because of the server, who was quite nice and cheery, but I doubt if I'll be back simply because it is slipping from my memory as I write this.   FOOD - 3 stars...nice large Belgian-style waffles but the oomph factor seemed missing  AMBIANCE - 3 stars...surely they sell Jamba Juice here, don't they?  SERVICE - 4 stars...peppy and responsive  TOTAL - 3 stars...just not quite memorable enough for me to return for a waffle"}
{"text":"Just absolutely amazing this food. Had the waffles with apple pie topping.. Taste so good! Excellent service"}
{"text":"The waffles are great, but you have to try the tuna sandwich where they use waffles as the bread! On top of that, their bobs teas hit the spot."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for another Yelp recommended find.  I tried this place because of Yelp and was not disappointed.  I got the Chicken and Waffles as recommended by the server.  It was delice....  Now, the space is not much in the way of ambiance. It is the typical strip mall food spot with seats, spartan look and feel and pretty clean.  But the waffle types and combinations and the bubble tea's make this spot worth a special visit.    If they upgraded their establishment and made it a bit more fun/creative/upscale, this could then be a 5 star...."}
{"text":"I took my husband for a quick brunch on father's day. At first the inside is not much to look at, tables and chairs and menu on the wall. Once you get past the presentation of the cafe you realize what they have to offer is a clean eatery with unique menu.  Waffles offer a lighter alternative to bread or buns on their sandwiches. I was very pleased with the taste of the food. We will definitely be going back. The service was very good"}
{"text":"Waffles very little and hot!!! Nicely ran, and great selection of waffles, and coffee!!! Fun great idea...."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place! We've been here a couple times on the weekend and have loved coming here. Everyone is so friendly and the food is good! I'm not a huge breakfast person but even I can't turn down their waffles. For me though it's the customer service. Everyone is just happy and helpful. I will keep comin here for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Every time we are in town to visit family this is our first stop ! We are obsessed with their tuna waffle sandwiches! AMAZING!! And I can't forget to mention their boba teas! Love love love this place! The owners along with their awesome sons are extremely friendly and always have a smile on their faces!"}
{"text":"Oh Waffles Cafe, I really wanted you to be amazing but I left disappointed, only eating a few bites of my meals that I paid over $20 for. I literally left the food to go eat somewhere else. I was super excited to eat here too because there have been some many five star reviews. I'm leaving two stars because the restaurant was clean and the staff was kind but I was not a fan of my meal at all.   When we walked in we were greeted warmly and I was getting hungry right away. The restaurant is a cute little mom & pop type business with 15 or so table tops and a smaller breakfast bar against the window. The first odd thing I noticed when I walked in was that even after being greeted by the staff behind the counter I wasn't sure if I should seat myself, wait to be seated, or walk to the counter and order.   I could go down the road of pointing out the things I didn't like about our meal, but instead I feel that some constructive criticism might be helpful:   1. The menu is laid out funk and it was hard for me to follow along. It took me a few minutes to figure out what in the heck was going on. I like the idea that you can build your own waffle but making toppings all different prices had me scratching my head. I had no idea what I was spending.....just blindly ordering and I wasn't a fan.   2. The fruit in the fresh fruit did not taste fresh. Mostly it was the bananas that stood out to me. An old banana has a very distinct taste, and I wasn't excited about it. At first glance it looked amazing, but I couldn't say the same after I tasted it. The fruit wasn't cut into nice pieces, it was chopped into lots of smaller pieces that seemed odd. Lets call it more like a diced fruit bowl.   3. We received our meal at different times. First the waffle, then the fruit, then our drinks, then the food they forgot we ordered. By the time all of the food had been delivered on paper plates and bowels I just wanted to leave and did. There were two other customers in the restaurant at the same time as us and they too were asking for the missing items they had ordered.  4. I didn't enjoy the flavor of the waffle batter. It was almost tasted like a sourdough waffle. If you're a fan of sourdough, and I know there are lot of people who are, you may have enjoyed it. For me, it didn't taste at all like my grandmothers waffles on Sunday mornings, and thats the flavor I'm looking for!"}
{"text":"One of the best things about going to Sin City without Vegas Newbies or HUGE ass groups is that you get to avoid the all-the-MEH-you-can-eat buffets and adventure out to more creative, tasty and less expensive fare!    The pizza waffle from WaffleS Cafe was no exception: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JNyho2P0jSk-0T30T3A0OQ?select=8gNT74-_D3AFK8dCHqC2ig  The uniquely light, crispy & delicate pastry made this savory item the best one our table ordered.  Sure, the sweeter selections were exquisite as well, but where else can you order an amazing Pizza Waffle?  I just had to get this one!  Curious?  Here's a high-res scan of their take out menu:   Page 1: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JNyho2P0jSk-0T30T3A0OQ?select=R8y_lc6larrZ0mh-VfALVw  Page 2: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JNyho2P0jSk-0T30T3A0OQ?select=UIKBrMAed207CTM2xZuCnA  So the next time you're in town, I suggest you pass up the buffets, go for a 10 minutes drive away from the strip and have some of the best waffles you'll ever have ... no seriously!"}
{"text":"This was a yelp find and it was pretty decent. I do wish that we decided to go in verses getting out meal to go. The inside is cozy and full of character. I loved how their menu was very large and visible, they also had a smaller specials menu that had drink specials for the day. I originally was going to order online but had issues with that set up and ultimately had to call in and go pick up, which was my only thing I didn't care for. But customer service was nice and helpful, I'm super pregnant and the lady asked me multiple times if she could help me out to my car, but I like the activities so I just made the extra trips. As far as taste goes, waffles are fluffy and have a nice texture to them. They have no flavor on their own, which is usual, but it makes up for that with their topping choices! I was not able to taste the pancake that my son got but from his 9 year old mouth \"it was like dessert and pancake deliciousness , it was like a party!\" We also got bacon and hash browns which aren't too special. Definitely give it a try if you have a sweet tooth and are looking for a fun breakfast, but also if you just want breakfast, because they have plenty of other savory options!"}
{"text":"I love waffles. So while in Vegas I wanted to have an amazing breakfast to begin my \"Pre New Years Eve\" celebration. In my search I stumbled upon Waffles Cafe.  Initially I was skeptical, however, after having the all day special for $6.95 (great value). I went all in with the Famous Waffle Sandwich. Amazing. If you are a waffle lover like myself you have to check out The Waffle Cafe in Aliante!!! It is Da Bomb!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's like the best kept secret in NW. If you are in the area or want to drive somewhere for some amazing food, this is the place. The food will NOT disappoint you. They are always very friendly and remember their customers. Come check out their waffle sandwich. My favorite is the ham & bacon sandwich. I've been coming here for years and have always been satisfied with the food & the service. Bring your kids, family and friends and check this place out. Make sure to ask for a stamp card as you will keep coming back. Waffle Cafe is a must try spot for all of you foodie lovers."}
{"text":"Waffles are really good but next time I will ask for unsalted butter. I wouldn't order eggs and bacon but it is edible. Specialty waffles look great."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome waffle sandwiches. The gf and I were hungry and found this place on Yelp. Read the fantastic reviews about their waffle breakfast sandwiches and decided to make the 20 minute detour from our trip back home to LA. Man, was it worth it. Totally recommend this place for any out of towners who need a quick snack for the long ride home.  Staff was very attentive and the place filled up quickly by 11am. Will definitely go back next time we hit up the strip."}
{"text":"I love it here! The food is delicious and the service is awesome.  The salt n vinegar waffle fries are soooo good."}
{"text":"Good smoothies. Even better waffles. Their blazing chicken and waffles are great. Can take a little long to get everything, but good food can take time!"}
{"text":"Did some research on Yelp and decided to take a drive and try this place out for breakfast.  Glade I did, I ordered a strawberry's waffle and my boyfriend ordered a breakfast waffle.  They are both really really good.  Some how they were able to make the strawberry's one just sweet enough and you don't feel like you are eating desert.  And the  breakfast waffle is amazing.....  Never though that having eggs, hams, bacon on a waffle can be that good.  I sure will recommend anyone to give it a try and I am sure you will like it."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat. Potato Scrambled delicious. I would recommend this please for sure."}
{"text":"Love the food and service very unique experience and taste always have friendly service and the staff hives great recommendations on choices. Red Velvet waffles are my daughters favr"}
{"text":"tldr  Cool little neighborhood breakfast/brunch spot. Waffles are good, tornado fries are bomb.  Get: -original waffle with Nutella -boba milk tea -sour cream tornado fries  Protip: from 2pm-6pm they have B1G1 50% off happy hour.  Protip: call ahead of time to ensure there is boba if that's what you want."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I never thought I could love waffles so much!!! This place is BOMB!!! It's a small business so come out and support it, you won't regret it. I tried their pumpkin batter with some Nutella and powdered sugar and whipped cream. It was delicious!!! My boyfriend had a waffle sandwich which was super appetizing as well. Can't wait to return to try some of their other batters which are supposed to be family recipes. This place is not fancy, it's a paper plates, get up and get your own water type of place, just FYI, but the family was attentive and sweet and the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"These are the best waffles I've ever had. Super adorable and a nice and caring staff. Definitely with the visit"}
{"text":"WATCH OUT FOR HAIRS IN THEIR WAFFLES... Ordered $35 worth of food (chicken and waffles, the big breakfast, kid's meal, apple juice, orange juice, and arnold palmer).  After devouring the chicken and making my way through the waffles, half way through I see a blonde hair in the waffle.  Didn't want to make a scene and told the owner of the location and she looked stunned and asked if we wanted her to make me a new batch of waffles????!  NO THANK YOU.  And she walks in the back with the waffle.  That's all.  Lost customers and yes, totally advising others to watch out for hairs in your food."}
{"text":"I love coming here for our family breakfast. The food is always good and  we love the owners and their sons that work there. They always rememeber us and we notice they always rememeber their regulars :-)"}
{"text":"Great selection of food to choose from. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Price was good, quality and quantity of food was excellent. Will go back there again. Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place."}
{"text":"Just a quick update.  I haven't been here for about 6 months since I've been going back and forth between Vegas and Tahoe, but I came here with my boyfriend a couple days ago around 7:30am after purchasing a Groupon and Jeff (I'm assuming that's the guy that's always there) still remembered us! I thought that was pretty awesome considering we haven't come here in so long.   I ordered Yooni's favorite (strawberry, banana, vanilla ice cream, choco sauce) w/ coffee like always and my bf ordered another combination minus the strawberries with soda. There's always free refills on coffee, so I usually end up refilling twice (3 times if I'm feelin' crazy). The strawberries were a tad more sour than usual, but everything else was perfect. We both cleaned our plates and left satisfied.   This is always my first choice whenever I'm in need of a waffle fix and in the Vegas area. I always order Yooni's favorite because I have a killer sweet tooth, but my bf and brother are both in love with their waffle sandwiches as well. Next time I plan on trying a waffle pizza and boba tea!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I'm kind of a waffle snob. I hate going to places like IHOP or Dennys and getting a waffle which is nothing but a waffle shaped pancake. The waffles here are crisp on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. Just the way of waffle is supposed to be.   The staff is always extremely friendly. There are times when they get busy that it's a little slower than others but overall not bad. The bacon is great. The waffle sandwiches are good and even their waffle pizzas are good. My daughters love their chocolate smoothies. This is a fun place to go and take the kids. They can order a waffle with ice cream and whip cream and chocolate syrup and fun stuff like that.  The next time you think of going over to cracked egg or IHOP and waiting for an hour to be seated head over to waffles cafe instead. You will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Best waffle spot EVER! Service is amazing here! Waffle breakfast sandwich is bomb and so are the specialty waffles!!!"}
{"text":"The waffles are tasty and very light!  I ordered mine topped with blueberries, powdered sugar, and whipped cream.  If you're hungry, I'd recommend ordering 2 with a side of eggs and bacon!  :)"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a nice friendly breakfast either on a date or with family. The staff are all smiles and enjoy the environment of this little cafe as well. The food is creative and delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this concept came from the, \"high-dea\" jar. I mean savory waffle sandwiches? Excuse me Cheech, your order is ready.   The decor in here definitely needs updating and some style, it sort of feels like you're eating in the teacher's lounge of an elementary school. Nothing here really makes you want to stay and hang out, just finish your meal and bounce. Good thing decor doesn't diminish my appetite or I would be about 30lbs lighter, seriously Vegas you need a major overhaul when it comes to restaurant style and atmosphere.   The waffles here are good, lightly sweetened which went well with the salty breakfast options. I ordered the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich; sausage, ham, eggs and cheese. This was definitely a meal, the portion was huge and filling, but doesn't leave you wanting more. It's like watching an \"OK\" movie; you've already forgotten the main character's name ten minutes after it's over. One more thing about this meal, it's served with a side of Ruffles potato chips, huh? How about side of syrup or a sweet jam for dipping?   The service is very good and fast, but I'm assuming that's because they cooked my meal with a microwave. I mean when you can hear the beeps and clicks of the radiation machine in back and your food comes out piping hot within five minutes of it being ordered... ugh.  The food was good, the service was good, and nothing was remotely close to great. I feel like there's a real lack effort with Waffles Cafe, they're doing the bare minimum and giving the bare minimum. A new coat of paint, waffles made to order and maybe a few special touches to the menu and this place could easily have a higher rating and possibly become more of a hangout spot.   Waffles Cafe you're so close."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it's been a wonderful experience. The food is always just like how I want it and it's delicious! Excellent food and the staff is the most friendliest people. I will continue to keep going here. Always fresh fruit toppings for the waffles, outstanding cooked waffles, and great drinks. Not so bad on prices either, its definitely worth it. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Pros: The price is right & the staff is personable & friendly. My food was okay. My eggs were perfectly cooked, which is surprising because it seems over medium is different everywhere.  Cons: my waffle was slightly undercooked & had way too much butter on it. Plus, it was regular salted butter(bleh). Seizing as the waffle is the main part, it was kind of a bummer.  I'd probably give it another shot just with butter on the side."}
{"text":"A cool concept of using a waffle as the middleman for every dish, but I am not a fan. The place needs a big revamping of style and decor. It was very cramped and loud. The tables, floors, and walls could have used a really heavy duty scrubbing. This place is another example of Americans being offered very unhealthy foods. These type of dishes with high calories and little nutrition should be saved for a day at the county fair.  I ordered one pumpkin waffle with apple toppings. I passed on the ice cream and whipped cream, but I still could only down half of the waffle and I felt very heavy afterwards. The order took about 10 minutes to make it to the table. The bf said he saw an employee scoop ice out of the machine with his bare hand... Not my idea of sanitary-- The other employees were wearing gloves while making the meals. The employees seemed hard working and pleasant. I was really bummed to see all the disposable silverware, cups, and plates.  The menu didn't offer enough light or healthy options and the dining area was a bit to cramped and uninviting to entice me to return."}
{"text":"The cashier was super friendly, everything was clean and tidy, and the atmosphere was like a small town cafe where several of the patrons knew each other and seemed to visit frequently.  My waffle was wonderful and it was a healthy snack for my son and I! We had the blueberry/ banana one without any syrup or powdered sugar and a strawberry fresh fruit smoothie to wash it all down.  We will definitely be back for more of our mommy/son excursions!!"}
{"text":"Waffles Cafe would fall somewhere between a 3 - 4 star rating depending on how much you like Waffles. I on the other hand love waffles and the idea of a Waffle Breakfast Sandwich sold me.  A perfect waffle should be soft on the inside and slighty crispy on the outside. WC executed this quite well and I was impressed.   Waffle Breakfast Sandwich comes with eggs, bacon, ham, and a secret sauce. I was quite skeptical about the secret sauce, a little hard to described, but it was lightly sweet and creamy at the same time. Everything went well together and the portion here was reasonable for $5.99...Pay an extra 50cent and you will get a soda and chips with your breakfast sandwich (Special). The only thing I would change about the breakfast sandwich here was the bacon. I wish the bacon was a little crispier and more well done.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/52387693@N08/4875590875/ ---4 / 5 Stars  My girlfriend ordered the Waffle Combo w/ an egg and bacon (on the side). The Waffle itself wasn't expensive, but adding her following toppings: Nutella, Strawberries, Banana, and Whip Cream made things a little pricier. http://www.flickr.com/photos/52387693@N08/4875590609/ ---4 / 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!! They have such original ideas for waffles. So many combinations. I love taking family and friends here. Anyways have a fun breakfast. Also love the fact that they have pictures of their different waffle options that are available. This making ordering so much easier!"}
{"text":"Gluten free waffles for $5??!! Yes, please! Delicious waffles, yummy hash browns and the nicest service. The place is basic and simple- decor wise, and maybe needs some sprucing up inside but I came for amazing waffles and did not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing! We walked in and greeted by Kim! She was so sweet! Very helpful and positive when explaining the menu! Awesome service. The food was absolutely amazing. You can taste the freshness and Quality. We will definetly be back! We loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years now, I can't believe I never left a review! Waffles is a fabulous family-run establishment, and the food is top notch. I dare you to try to find a better waffle. I like mine with peanut butter, chocolate sauce, and caramel... So good!!! Their smoothies are also really yummy."}
{"text":"I think, what's really attracted me to this place, is the fact of them having strawberry smoothie with boba and adding protein. That, plus its just a few miles away from home. Way better, then driving to Chinatown, and finding a place that will add protein to a strawberry smoothie with boba.   I found this place, to be unique, cause I rarely see anything like it. I'm sure there are others out there, but I haven't been living in Vegas that long to experience what locals experience. I guess you can say I'm still trying to find my way around Vegas. Just so happen, that we found our way to Waffles Cafe in Aliante.   First time around, I tried their Smore's Waffle, which was different, and sweet. I'm a bit marshmallow fan, that I had to try it and see. It wasn't to bad, but kind of sweet for breakfast. Second time around, I tried their Pepperoni Pizza Waffle. Which may sound odd or the sound of it, may make you wonder, how it taste. But quite honestly, it wasn't as bad as I thought. The fact, that I like pizza, is great, but the fact of it being on a waffle, made it interesting. I guess you can say, its a pizza, with a really soft crust.   The staff, was very nice, and made sure that everything was okay. But, the staff only consist of two Asian ladies. The place itself, look very nice and clean. Knowing that its fairly new, business there, seems really slow and when we usually go, its like 0-3 other people are in there. The only thing I'm not satisfied with, is the pricing. Even though its good, from my point of view, I don't think the pricing fits it, that well. I'm sure business would probably be better if it was probably a dollar cheaper.   I would probably say, if your into trying something unique and different, you should try it. I would definitely do the smoothie. I prefer boba with protein, but I'll leave that up to you. Again, the pricing is a bit more then expected, but its worth trying."}
{"text":"A MUST TRY!! Delish  I'm a foodie while traveling I like to get on yelp and explore restaurants well this dive is excellent. Inexpensive and the paper plates and utensils well are a good thing if you're a germaphobe. Back the food I asked for eggs over medium, bacon waffle with ice cream, whip cream, strawberries, bananas, & pecans 5* from the crunchy bacon to the perfect waffle oh and the mango smoothly was to die for.  ~from a full tummy and my overjoyed palette :)"}
{"text":"The eggs were blah... The bacon tasted like it came out of a microwave... and the waffle was so light and thin it was like they were cutting back on using batter to make a real waffle to save costs... they don't have fresh milk for coffee and only creamer that has been sitting out all morning.. and the water.... wow.... disgusting.... i about vomited after putting the styrofoam cup up to my mouth and smelling the disgusting water....... it smelled like tuna fish and dead bodies along with mold... DISGUSTING... The chairs were dirty, the walls were dirty, everything was dirty and I felt like I needed another shower after eating here.. If you are a poor college student, this is the place to go...... if not, steer clear!"}
{"text":"I love their Boba/Bubble Smoothies. i wish they would refrigerate their tapioca though because that is how most places do it and it takes better. It keeps the smoothie from melting faster also."}
{"text":"I am so happy I stumbled into this place.  I love the breakfast spots but sometimes I want something quick and may not be in the mood to wait.  Here is where Waffles Cafe comes in.  For $5.50 you get a waffle, eggs, bacon or sausage, and unlimited coffee.  You can get specialty waffles which is just a little bit more.    We had the pumpkin waffle which was perfect - not too sweet.  I, on the other hand, got the Strawberry Waffle special which came with Strawberry ice cream, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream.  Prob not the best breakfast waffle idea, more like a dessert, but it was awesome.  I like the atmosphere alot -- The service is great.  You get that food truck type of vibe.  The workers all really enjoy being there and it's a good feeling.  I am seriously thinking of hi-jacking this idea, moving to another city and putting this on a truck b/c it would straight kill it.  Until then, I'll be visiting this place weekly-  maybe more!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! I come here all the time and I cant get enough of the turkey avocado waffle sandwich. The customer service is amazing as well !"}
{"text":"my husband and I had been wanting to eat here for quite a while thinking it was going to be amazing. This place is more of a kid friendly place to eat. I ordered a simple waffle w/ strawberries and bananas w/ a side order of a hashbrown. my husband got just a simple pancake. our total came out to $15! totally over priced. we were brought out what i ordered but my husbands never came. after 5 minutes i inquired about his & after investigating they said they didn't ring it up & said we would have to pay. I almost wanted to yell across the room to my husband not to pay because by then I had bitten into my waffle & it was def nothing special. Hard and non flavorful. the hashbrown literally was taken out of a box and dipped in grease. At the same time another customer had the same problem, ordered something & did not receive it & had to repay. the paper plate and plasticware was not the best choice & made it hard to cut up the waffle. Overpriced. Non quality food. def sticking to making our own waffles!"}
{"text":"OMG I'm in love! The chicken and waffles are my favorite! Wish I could give 10 stars. I get them with extra strawberries and extra buffalo sauce (bc I like it spicy) and chop everything up so every bite is the perfect bite! Yummmm My husband loves it just the way it comes and laughs at me for pre cutting everything before I eat. Lol Love the smoothies too! I get honeydew+ strawberry pearls and he gets honeydew+pineapple+ strawberry pearls and they so delicious!  If you haven't tried this place, do it! It's great anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing food spot. The staff was super friendly, and the food was excellent. The strawberry and banana fruit sandwich was simply amazing.  I don't even really like waffles that much, but I guess I never had good waffles before!"}
{"text":"We love waffles cafe and come every weekend for breakfast and are treated kindly. Service has always been amazing and the food is GREAT! The owners Kim and Reggie are a pair of genuinely good hearted people that care for the customers that come through their door. 5 stars all the way around and definitely a place we will continue to go to through the years."}
{"text":"I believe that if a restaurant is named after a famous breakfast treat, they better know how to make it well. That being said, this place doesn't disappoint. I ordered the Turkey Waffle Sandwich- a freshly made waffle, perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy in the inside, filled with layers of deli-style turkey slices, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and avocado, topped off with a clear sweet syrupy sauce. The ingredients are simple but work oh so well together. I fell in love with this sandwich from the first bite. The waffle and the sweet syrup are a match made in culinary heaven, and add on to it the savory turkey, slices of fresh lettuce and tomato, and the creamy avocado, and you've got yourself a seemingly odd concoction that tastes so good. Service is friendly, and while the wait may be long, I like to blame that on the \"made to order\" fact. The décor is modern, clean and simple, with bright colors.   At Waffles Café, you can have waffles for breakfast, lunch and dinner. How bad can that be?"}
{"text":"Food is good. Everything as the name suggests is waffle based. I had the waffle sandwich it was huge and super sweet smothered in a clearish syrup. It is fast food style and there are not that many tables so sort of hard to eat in on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"9/25/2011 -Super friendly, family owned restaurant.  They made us perfect scrambled eggs & bacon every day this week while we were moving.  It was so nice that they remembered us each time, and the bacon was crisp, never greasy.  I would go there every weekend if we were still living nearby.  I wish their smoothies were all real fruit and turbinado  UPDATE:  Went back again, after one year, and they REMEMBERED ME and asked how I was and the food was PERFECT as always"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Very clean, cool atmosphere, rnb music playing. Banana split waffles are delicious. Waffle fries, seasoned potatoes, smoothie and coffee were all very good. The eggs were sooooo gross. Order anything but those weird textured, non-flavorful eggs. Janine have us very good service. We'll be back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place! The customer service is too notch! You're greeted upon walking in. The food is amazing! I am in love with this cafe ! Do yourself a favor and try it. Also if you have the pleasure of meeting one of the employees by the name of Ashar just know you will be well taken care of and have a great experience."}
{"text":"This place was not busy but the food was great. Waffles made perfect and the breakfast bowl was very good. Will eat here again and recommend it."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I've ever been to whether for breakfast ore brunch, and they have alot of nerve accepting money from anyone. I have been reading various reviews on this dump and I can't believe anyone could give it more than one star and that being that you have to give one star to post a review.maybe they're drinks are good but the food is disgusting. To pay close to $9 for an over cooked waffle that comes with a blob of melted margarine, yuck, not even real butter or even a choice of which one you want. The waffle pizza is soggy, things are quickly heated so they're cold and cheese doesn't appear to new real cheese, the eggs like rubber, the bacon was paper thin and precooked then reheated, so disgusting, then they serve all that disgust on the cheapest paper plates, not even matching our of good quality, everything soaks right through and years before you cam finish the junk they serve you, and to pay top dollar to get your own food, please. The tables were dirty  and sticky, we had empty cans of soda at the end of our table that was there when we sat down and still there when we left though we asked them to clean the table. The place smelled horrible, no ventilation and looked dirty. The Styrofoam cups was a nice touch for water. OMG, HORRIBLE, horrendous service and food, but they were nice, lol, that's a joke."}
{"text":"Not sure why, but I was expecting this place to be really good. I was disappointed right away. We ordered chocolate milk, which tasted horrible, maybe rotten. We asked for different drinks, which I asked for sweet tea and got a green sweet tea... Which is actually very good, so I'm not mad about that. The guy was very nice. They served the food on paper plates flimsy paper plates and plastic utensils, wasn't a fan of that."}
{"text":"Service: we were greeted as soon as we came in with a smile! That's always nice! The guy at the register was great, not only was he patient but helpful when I was asking questions! He also made sure we had our own new syrup bottle before we ate.   Food: the breakfast special was not only affordable but exactly what breakfast should be like! My eggs were cooked over easy and delicious! The bacon was bacon... Nothing wrong with that! The waffle was fresh and crispy on the outside even with syrup on it the held! My daughter ordered her waffle with bananas and chocolate, and she loved it!!! We will be going back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"The cashier Asian lady amazing customer service! First time here she explained everything! Food was great ! Will be coming back ! Thanks"}
{"text":"The kids had been bugging me about trying this place. My oldest is a waffle fanatic. I was very disappointed. As soon as we walked in I was struck by the fact that the place smelled bad. A place that serves food smells bad? We ordered. The kids said the food was ok. I didn't like the waffle at all. It tasted yeasty or something. I can't even describe it but it wasn't good. I also ordered a pineapple smoothie and it was flavorless. To make matters worse, the trash cans were overflowing to the point that you really couldn't add to it. The bathroom was super dirty too.   The service was great. Everyone was super friendly.  But the fact that the food wasn't good at all and the place was dirty, means we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I nice place that is unassuming and fun.  Simple meals and quick service.  All verry affordable too!  I had a pumpkin waffle with banana and strawberries and side of eggs and potatos.  Great breakfast!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, I brought my kids here multiple times and they enjoy coming here. The customer service is great too and they pay attention to their customers as well."}
{"text":"Tried this place today after seeing it all the time. They have really cute meals for kids and many different types of syrup. It is more like a dessert waffles place but still awesome. They have little ball things called boba. They put it in the shakes and smoothies. A little strange but good. We will be going back here."}
{"text":"I have to say overall so far the employees are helpful and kind. The menu is on the wall so it makes it easy to see all of the options available and easy to ask questions if you have any. Environment is clean and the food smells and looks good. Kid friendly. I will be back."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent! Plastic utensils and all. And yes it is just a nice quaint cafe and that's acceptable."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. It's very simple, almost reminds me of a pancake house back in Hawaii. Service was quick and the cashier was kind. My son and I just popped in after his doctor appointment. Got the \"regular breakfast\" I believe. With bacon, eggs, a waffle. I added sausage. And after noticing my baby doesn't like waffles, asked for a hash brown. Over all I have no issues after dining here. But, the high chair wasn't cleaned. And the place was empty when I arrived. So I'm not sure if they just recovered from breakfast? I would go back if I make it to centennial again."}
{"text":"Great waffles! My husband accidently ordered the incorrect breakfast sandwich and they changed it with now problem. The place was very clean and they even recycle. I posted a pic of Yoogi's fav w/ carmel sauce! It was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Located in a small store front in a strip mall. If you are looking for a full service breakfast restaurant this isn't it. Customers place their order at the counter and your food is brought to you. Coffee is just ok, waffles are crisp and full of flavor. At $4.95 for a waffle, eggs, bacon or sausage and a cup of coffee -I'm not sure how they are making money. Food is served on paper plates with plastic ware. Service was good, but my search continues for the best non-casino breakfast in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites, it is so good!   I would love to drink boba tea every day if I could. There 3 location in the valley. The people working there are always nice and helpful.  I would recommend this place to anyone. :)"}
{"text":"Went here to meet up with friends for Sunday morning brunch.  We had a party of 6 and orders were placed promptly.  In a short time, we had food delivered to table.  Cashier and server did good job.  I ordered the breakfast special with waffle with strawberries and whipped cream along with sausage and 2 eggs over easy which includes coffee!  Everything I tasted was excellent, definitely found my waffle spot in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Super generous portions, good prices, amazingly friendly, and super delicious food. What the hell more do you need? Their other location closed, so we must use our collective money powers to keep this awesome place alive. Waffles for the win!  Suggestion for the owners: keep it open for dessert! If you stayed open til 9 pm, you would capture the dessert crowd."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area with a few hours to kill while the kid took his SAT exam so thought I'd give this place a try. (Otherwise I may never would have come all the way out here from Henderson!)  I had the pumpkin waffle with Nuttella and pecans and a hot chai tea. The waffle itself was good, crispy edges and a tender inside, but not really very pumpkiny (although I haven't had their original flavor waffle so maybe there really is a difference in taste.) The pecans added just enough crunch and the Nuttella...well, how can you go wrong with Nuttella? It came with a dollop of whipped cream which was perfect since it cut the sweetness of the Nuttella. The tea was a standard hot tea bag but they were eager to refill the water with no hesitation.   On the way out I ordered a taro boba to go. The drink itself was standard but the boba was pretty mushy, like they were leftover from the day before. Too bad.   Service was great but business was slow. While I was here there were only two other people who came in to eat. The two Asian ladies working (the owner and her sister) were very sweet and personable.  I'd go again if I'm in the area but I won't be making any special trips out there."}
{"text":"This cafe is the ultimate best for waffle lovers! The waffles have a great texture and everything down to the cherry on top is perfect and served just as you want it. Their milk shakes are delicious and they're waffle sundaes are the best (My Favorite is the Sweet Pea; an apple pie filling with vanilla ice cream on a waffle). They have a waffle pizza that though seems awkward to think as good eats but they are really, really good! The breakfast sandwich is also my favorite to order with everything you'd want for breakfast folded between a folded waffle. The location is family owned by genuinely great people and you always get more than you come for with a happy belly. I would definitely recommend it and am a regular."}
{"text":"If you like waffles, this is the place for you!  It's super small & no frills (order at a counter, self service for coffee, & food served on disposables) but the prices are reasonable & the food is great!  The waffles are light & delish plus you can top them with almost anything.  They also offer smoothies, juice & boba tea.  Friendly staff & very clean.  We will be adding this to our breakfast rotation!"}
{"text":"Gluten free waffles! came here the other morning and was pleasantly surprised. I had a gluten free waffle with fresh cut strawberries and bananas. It was only $6. i couldnt get over the quality for the price. if your ever in the centenial area i highly suggest this place.  PS. the guy behind the counter was sooo sweet."}
{"text":"This place is great! We came in on a Sunday morning and it was busier than i thought it was going to be  I ordered the blazing chicken & waffle sandwich thinking it was just chicken and waffles (didn't read the sandwich part ) it also came with waffle fries which were super crispy and delicious! The waffle is fluffy, crispy on the outside, warm and soft on the inside The chicken was my favorite it was so tender.. The plastic knife cut through it like butter  They add this buffalo style sauce but so delicious definitely coming back for this same plate.   My boyfriend got some red velvet pancakes with fresh kiwi and strawberries the pancakes were fluffy and delicious as well   The reason why i don't give it 5 stars is because i thought it was a little pricey and it took about 20 minutes for us to get our food.. Which could be because it was a busy Sunday morning   Overall great place if you live in the area"}
{"text":"Thank you Phil and Blair for reviewing this place or I would have never known about it. On my way to Red Rock Casino, the hubby and I decided to visit this place. All I can say is the waffle sandwiches are the BEST!! I ordered Yooni's favorite- strawberry, banana, ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate sauce and the hubby got the ham and bacon waffle sandwich.  I liked mine but I kept drooling over the waffle sandwich that my hubby ordered. The sandwich is so savory and so different with the waffle that my taste buds were confused and delighted with the pairing. sooo yummy. The waffle sandwich was a five star general compared to the yooni's favorite.   Next time, and there will be a next time, I will order the sandwich. I also hear that the tuna is one of the best sandwiches they offer. Seems like a weird pairing, but I'm sure that the off beat pairing will also be a winner."}
{"text":"Excellent service at Waffles Cafe and the food was exactly how I ordered! I had Arieyona as my cashier and she brought out our food and she had excellent customer service, giving us all the specifics of our order and bringing it out the way we like. Now, I feel welcome at the resteraunt and love the hospitality. Definitely a recommendation tofamily and friends now. Keep up the hard work Waffles Cafe!"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in this AM for a quick to-go breakfast from here.  She had the plain waffle with the banana. It was awesome.  A nice crispy waffle, with yummy bananas and whipped cream.  No soggy waffles here, just crunchy goodness in each and every bite.  I decided to have a banana and strawberry smoothie.  It was delicious.  I'd definitely get that again.  All in all a total win.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, mostly because Babystacks has a ridiculously long line on the weekends. I have now had both the pumpkin and chocolate waffle and both are yummy. I usually get the breakfast special with two eggs and bacon. My husband always adds on an \"order\" of hashbrowns which are just the frozen chunks like McDonald's would serve you.  When you're hungry and it's a Sunday morning in the Centennial area, this is the place to go-- no wait, ever. Of course, you order and then sit down, so there isn't as much personal customer service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Waffles cafe used to be my family's favorite place for a Sunday treat. As of today, that is no longer the case. We were saddened by the service and the poor care to our food. The bacon was burnt to a carbon crisp, the food seemed rushed and thrown together, and the Thai tea with Boba was watered down and didn't have its creamy flavor I remembered, as well the boba seemed slimy and over-cooked. The tornado fries were hard as rock with no flavor. The fruit was not fresh like it used be. With all of this, the food was over-priced for its quality. I'm sorry to leave this review because this not the experience I'd ever expect from Waffles Cafe. Our family will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place because it has been on my bookmark list for ever. So the other day when I was in the area and had time to stop I did. Overall the whole experience was ok. I was greeted as I entered by the young man behind the counter and he asked if I been in before. When I stated I had not he explained the menu, made suggestions, and answered my questions.   I ended up ordering the breakfast special but sub'd the eggs for another piece of bacon because I don't eat eggs. The meal as stated on the menu comes with a waffle, eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage, and a coffee for $7. I felt the pricing most of the menu items was reasonable but I did not like that all topping were at an additional charge. Most place at least give u one topping free and charge for all others.   My food was prepared within a very reasonable amount of time but the following things were off-putting to me: 1. Food was served on paper plates (mind you... This was not a take out meal), and 2. The waffle was extremely light for a Belgian waffle. It was crisp which I didn't  mind except it was so light. Usually Belgian waffles are full and filling this was not the case with this waffle.   Overall, the people here were really nice but it really is not my idea of a great breakfast joint. I really wanted to love it too because they were so sweet and the other reviews were so good but just doesn't float my boat. On to the next I guess...."}
{"text":"Leslie Knope would be proud of this place. Waffles Cafe is a wonderful little place for those who are in need of a sugar rush or a filling meal. I prefer the former, in which I order something with a ton of whipped cream, pie filling, ice cream, or something of that matter. At my most recent visit, I ordered the cherry blossom. Ultra sweet, just like those who work there. This place is a gem up in Aliante, and I recommend going if you want to chill out, talk with friends, and have a good waffle."}
{"text":"Nice place and good concept for expanding the waffles. I went with my sister and we ordered the supreme pizza waffle, BBQ chicken waffle, and Jeff's favorite which had apple n ice cream with whip cream.   The BBQ chicken was ok. The waffle was drenched in BBQ sauce. It was too much to take. The chicken was dry. There was also pineapples which I thought was strange to have on a BBQ chicken pizza. Overall it was ok.   The supreme pizza waffle was ok too. They should've put more cheese.   The Jeff's favorite was the best out of the three but it would've been better if the apples were warm rather than cold."}
{"text":"The food was good. Fresh made to order waffles to your liking. Made very quickly. Will be back soon. Good service!!!"}
{"text":"I usually get the breakfast combo which comes with waffle, eggs, bacon/sausage and coffee. Not bad for $5.95. Don't forget the stamp card."}
{"text":"This review is a bit of a \"To Be Continued\" mainly because I only tried a waffle sandwich and the menu looked so amazing that I need to go back just to try everything out.  Waffle sandwiches, waffle pizzas, make your own waffles, waffle platters. You name it(including a waffle) and they will probably make it.   The \"restaurant\" is actually more of a fast food establishment where you order at the front and then they give you your food. It has a very strange setup/feel that I feel would be much more successful as an actual restaurant. Paper plates and forks were definitely a turn off. A+ for the actual waffle sandwich itself though."}
{"text":"One word, YUM! I really wasn't expecting much of this cafe honesty, but it's fantastic. The cafe itself is so cute with names printed out and stuck on the walls, and the posters all around. Gives a super positive vibe. The waffles taste so good! I had an original waffle with strawberries, caramel sauce, whipped cream and powdered sugar (which by the way I recommend!) the waffle was cooked perfectly and the strawberries were so fresh. The only thing I'd like to see different would be proper plates/knives/forks (not plastic and paper). Other than that I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visit this place for breakfast at least once a month. We usually get the breakfast special which includes a waffle, eggs, choice of bacon or sausage, and coffee or juice--all for $4.99 I believe. It's a good deal!  There are so many different types of waffles that they have, and you can create your own. They have these dessert waffles that look sooo delicious. One day I'm going to go in just for dessert. They also serve boba drinks.  Their staff is always friendly. The place is small, but clean and it definitely wakes you up with the vibrant wall color.   Waffles Cafe is definitely a place to try out at least once and to keep on coming back for more.  =)"}
{"text":"We were here a year ago and they've only gotten better.  Great Chicken and Waffles and really friendly service!"}
{"text":"Waffles is definitely not kidding around when it comes to their namesake.  Let's see you can get waffle sandwiches, waffle pizza, and just plain ol waffles of course.  They offer 6 types of waffles, original, oat, organic flax, chocolate, or pumpkin.  I went the safe route this go around and ordered a breakfast special that included eggs, 2 sausage links, one huge waffle, and an endless cup of coffee.  The coffee, eggs, and links were good; the waffle was GREAT!  So light and airy.  It was quite possibly the best i've tasted.  Not some flour laden waffle shaped biscuit whose weight rivals the plate its on.   If you check out their website you can see all the yummy toppings they offer on their waffles.  If you can dream it up, im sure they have it!  As if that weren't enough, they also offer an array of Boba Teas and Smoothies!  Just the icing on the cake at this point because Waffles Cafe, you had me at waffle."}
{"text":"Their ham and bacon sandwich didn't disappoint. It was delicious and different. The waffle wasn't soggy at all. Just light and crispy and a little chewy. The pumpkin waffles with whipped cream were great also. The prices are very reasonable -- $5.99 for a sandwich. I might have to go back tomorrow to try their fruit sandwich or waffle pizza."}
{"text":"I just loved this place! Great prices especially for what you get. If you love bacon (who doesn't?!) then try a side of bacon because they cook it right! You have to wait a bit to get your food but it is because they prepare everything fresh to order!   I had \"Jeff's Favorite\". It was $6.95 and had Apples, Caramel, Whip Cream and even a scoop of ice cream on top! It was too yummy. The staff was friendly and seemed to really take pride in what they were serving. I had a soda instead of coffee so I don't know how that is yet.   They have a punch card as well so don't forget to ask about that. After so many punches you get a free meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I were planning to go to IHOP for breakfast and, out of the corner of my eye, I spot a cute sign that read \"Waffles Cafe.\"  We quickly changed our plan and we're so glad we did.  When we walked inside the tiny restaurant, we were greeted warmly.  Since we were first time customers, they explained everything they had on the menu and stressed that we can customize our waffles any way we wanted.  Hawaiian pizza waffles?  BBQ sandwich waffles?    I got the Breakfast Special (waffle + egg + bacon + coffee) all for $4.99!  I did add some additional toppings (strawberries and chocolate syrup for about 50 cents each. The waffles come with whipped cream and powdered sugar for free. Still came out to a great deal.  Christian got the Breakfast sandwich (waffles, egg, ham, bacon, cheese, and a sweet sauce.)  Also a great deal for $5.99.  I can't help but sing the Journey song in my head... Any way you want it.  That's the way you need it.  Any way you want it.\"  And that's exactly what you get at Waffles Cafe.  Any way you want your waffles, they'll do it!"}
{"text":"After two days in a row at Babystacks, we needed something new. This place was wonderful. Fantastic, friendly, service. Light, crispy waffles -- absolutely perfect. Breakfast special comes with unlimited coffee. Great overall experience. So nice to support a local, family business.  ****Word of warning: waffles comes with a massive dollop of butter. I loved it but if you wouldn't -- make sure to tell them when you order."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday morning with a Groupon, after reading so many great reviews.   This is what we got:  Yooni's Favorite:  Original Waffle, Strawberry slices, Banana slices, a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. This was alright. So many things were going on.   Breakfast sandwich w/eggs, cheese, ham, and a special sauce. Not a huge fan of the special sauce. Instead of the regular waffle, we got the oat waffle instead. That cost $0.50 extra. We weren't a fan of the sauce but definitely the oat waffle.   I got the chai latte and it was alright. The coffee was refillable. It's a small shop w bright color. The waffles to me were ok, hence the three stars. W the groupon, we were restricted to a certain menu, maybe that's why we didn't think it was as great as other yelpers had reviewed this place to be. I will definitely come back to try the waffles again, and update my review where I see fit."}
{"text":"This easily became one of my favorite places in Vegas!  Came here for the fittest time a year ago; now that I'm moving here, plan on at least once a week.  A must try.  Super friendly service, great selection, great food at great prices.  Can't wait for the next time."}
{"text":"This is the only \"Waffle Cafe\" that I know of in Vegas but this place just opened and it's awesome. They have so much crazy stuff to choose from when it comes to waffles, if you want it on a waffle and they'll probably do it for you. They have waffle pizza, sandwiches and weirder. I stick to the norm. A waffle with some strawberries and bananas is bomb. (side note, the fruit is fresh and not that mushy stuff other restaurants will give you) They have coffee and teas and they have eggs, bacon, and sausage to go with your breakfast too. I definitely recommend supporting this small business, I would like to see them do well. The people I always see working are super friendly and the prices are cheap."}
{"text":"food is pretty good. but as for the service, the young girl who took my order kept asking me to repeat myself. and then called for miss kim, who i assume is the manager. \"miss kim\" was very rude towards my husband and I. talking to us as if we were an inconvenience to them. not a very good first impression."}
{"text":"Good food and great customer service. Love that they have Gluten free waffles.  Something for everyone."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick breakfast since its very close to home and there was only one other couple-COOL! So I Get my usual Breakfast Sandwich and my Taro Boba Smoothie. Wifey gets the same with a Coke...5 minutes later, more customers start coming at 5 minute intervals, and before you know it, there's a line out the door! Talk about perfect timing....Breakfast arrives, and it hits the spot-Crisp outside, fluffy inside, and their secret sauce which is basically a sweetened eggless mayo, ties everything in beautifully...glad we came in before the rush! ALOHA!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dessert! Waffles are crisp and fluffy at the same time, and the breakfast sandwich is ADDICTING!  Wash it all down with a boba smoothie....and now its time for dessert you can create your own, or Try Jeff's or Yooni's Favorite, equally good....  So happy they have one in Centennial Hills area now.....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Waffles Cafe today and here are the initial impressions. The menu is a little overpriced, but could become a better value if the price of the entree at least included a beverage (coffee). The waffles we received were thin (not Belgian style) leading to my opinion about the price. The decor was very plain and the cafe just didn't feel like something you'd experience in Aliante. This review isn't all \"bad\" (the waffles were good), but with a little more effort, this place could become a gem and a place we'd want to choose over competitors such as The Original Pancake House (which I'd personally give 5 stars). Lastly- the staff were friendly and welcoming so they had that going for them."}
{"text":"I had breakfast with some friends and tried the breakfast special with a pumpkin waffle topped with walnuts. Delicious! The owners are so friendly and it is apparent they appreciate their customers- warm service with a smile. I'll have to return soon and take my husband . He is eager to try these crispy and light waffles I've been raving about twice now!"}
{"text":"Great family owned business, awesome food and friendly service. We coke here often. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Simple breakfast solutions. It is wafflemania with all the toppings you can think of! They also offer eggs, potatoes, bacon & sausage. I enjoyed a peanut butter, banana & Nutella waffle. Yum! The only thing I would change is being served with paper plates."}
{"text":"Waffles cafe is a quaint little restaurant up on the northwest side of vegas.   This place is simple with waffles made different ways, breakfast items, boba, and tea in included in their menu. It's a quick place to get breakfast. You walk to the counter to order and it's self seating type of place.   I remember this place being opened since high school (2011) and they are still here today (2017). While other restaurants in their complex have failed and shut down. So they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place every day on my way to and from work, and I finally went inside to see what this glorious place could be!   My step-sister and I each ordered a breakfast sandwich and a smoothie, and we ended up paying $25. A little more than I was planning on spending, but the sandwiches were REALLY good. I wasn't even that hungry until I took a bite, but oh man that sandwich was gone fast.   The smoothies were interesting, I'm not really sure if they were made out of real fruit. They could have been a little fruit and a lot of ice cream, but something about them was just kind of weird and artificial. Not an ideal description of a smoothie.  I think that if the restaurant had real smoothies, dishes, and utensils, and if they brightened up the decor, I would feel like the $25 I spent was worth it. As it was I felt a little gypped- but they still get three stars because I'm getting hungry just thinking about that waffle sandwich, haha :)"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. It's is amazing what you can do with a waffle. The chicken sandwich was awesome.   Not just good, amazing.   Plus they have a very friendly staff that is all family."}
{"text":"It's a great deal for the price .  I got the original Batter waffle covered in strawberries with some whipped cream and powder sugar for only 5.00.  You can't beat the price .  The only thing that I was disappointed in was how long it took to get my order especially considering I was the only one in the store on a Saturday afternoon around 3.  The staff was very kind.  I was bothered that it took so long.  I also realize it's the middle of the summer here on Las Vegas so it's hard to control the temperature of your businesses.  I was sweating in the store waiting for my order to go.  Great food, great prices and slow service this visit."}
{"text":"This is a small cafe, maximum capacity of 45. With that said, staff didn't appear to be prepared to provide the best customer service. There were only a few tables of customers when we walked in. Yet we were not greeted at all, and being our first time, we weren't sure of the ordering process. There was a bell to ring for assistance. Which in my opinion, is not the best way to get the staff's attention. It's just a distraction to other customers dining, and you get awkward looks from everyone. Now for the food, ordered 2 waffle combos, original and red velvet. You pay at the time of ordering with tip option. Which we anticipated the best so we tipped 20 %. But for being a \"family recipe\", waffles did not fair well against other restaurants such as, IHOP. The flavor of the batter didn't stand out, nor did the texture. And toppings are just that, topped on. Chocolate chips and blueberries are not baked into the batter. Not sure if this is an option? Eggs are very runny. Note to self, always ask for scrambled hard. Thai tea with Boba does not taste like traditional.  The tea tasted like it was a Chai blend, and the Boba was not sweet at all. Blueberry syrup, seasoned potatoes are excellent! The Columbia roasted coffee is also great. Unfortunately, this was not our best choice for breakfast. There is room for improvement in the pace of their customer service, and quality of food. I lived in Louisiana many years, and quality of food and customer service/hospitality is what makes or breaks any cafe or restaurant. To their defense, they did say have a good day when we walked out."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff, quick and delicious food, with nice atmosphere, and good prices."}
{"text":"Wow, I was pretty amazed!!!  I wasn't craving waffles or any breakfast items when I went there; and I was all kinds of starving so, I was kinda apprehensive about eating there to begin with.......what can I say, \"I'm a bitch when I'm starving.\"  I ordered the tuna waffle sammich lunch special which came with crinkle chips and a drink which was reasonably $7.  It was sweet from the waffle and salty with the chips...I was in awe...SWEET AND SAVORY! Oddly enough, I actually, finished the whole thing and was completely satisfied....totally forgot that I wanted anything BUT a breakfast meal :p  A MUST SAMPS!!!"}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  Really cheap plastic utensils. The random pictures on the wall don't make sense together.  LIKE  The frequent diner's card. The breakfast special. The organic flax waffle. The helpful employees.  LOVE  The ability to create your own waffle combinations. The size of the waffles. The different waffle toppings (nuts, fruit, candy, ice cream, and especially NUTELLA). The various smoothie flavors to choose from (and how you can add protein and other healthy supplements)."}
{"text":"Ehh . Will probably not be back . Was visiting from San Diego . I got the apple pie looking waffles and a strawberry smoothie with boba .... first the table was SO sticky we had to get someone to wipe it down when we sat down . Also they serve you on paper plates , not for me. The food was god but verrrryyy sweet . The last thing was that we finished our meal before our smoothies came . All in all just disappointing ."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been her many times and will continue to come. I have had nothing but positive experiences. Staff is all very nice and food is delicious (especially the pumpkin waffle)."}
{"text":"one star because its required.  this place is SUCH a let down.  im not sure how the overall rating of this place is so high.  but to each their own i guess.  the waffles are crisp and then all air once you start eating. no flavor at all.  addons are a buck a piece (strawberries, cherry pie filling, etc.) which is a little much in my opinion but alright. you get unlimited coffee, which we had too wait for twice because they ran out. in my opinion they should keep up on that especially around breakfast time. also,if you add 'hashbrowns' its a buck for a hashbrown that mcdonalds serves. seriously?  they serve you on styrafoam and make you eat with plastic utensils.  they also dont know how to cook eggs over medium. so if that is how you like them, order them medium well and maybe theyll get it correctly.  if their quality of food was better, the concept of the place would work out well.  this place is pathetic. waffles at ihop are way more impressive."}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast sandwich. They forgot to make it. Came out covered in syrup and couldn't eat it.  Others order waffles and they forgot to bring the syrup. Avoid at all costs. Tables are extremely dirty and place is run down."}
{"text":"This morning we had a wonderful breakfast.  Ordered chicken and waffle and the meat lovers scramble with potatoes.   Great homemade style breakfast.  Chicken wings were the size of raptor wings. The owners was very hospitable and we wish her the most success with the business.  Looks like she is very involved and does a great job.  Loved the strawberry butter and the homemade hot sauce.   Keep it up alliante, lots of great family businesses and I plan to support them all."}
{"text":"I always come to this place every time i visit Vegas. I usually go to the Fort Apache location but since it closed we went to this one and it is just as good. I always get the Jeff's favorite which is a pumpkin waffle with apple pie filling, vanilla ice cream, caramel and whipped cream which is awesome. I love the waffles here and the service is excellent. My boyfriend and I actually walked in 10 minutes after closing and normally you would get turned away at any other place but not here and the gentleman at the register greeted us with such kindness and didn't rush us at all. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves waffles but the one thing that I love the most about this place is you can tell that the people who run the place really appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Omg! Best. After. Valentine's. Breakfast. Ever. Took my family here for after Valentine's breakfast and was not disappointed. I ordered a mango and coconut sprinkle waffle. Ladies and gentlemen you aren't getting canned or otherwise preserved fruit here. I had fresh shaved coconut on my waffle. Absolutely overall delicious."}
{"text":"I love Waffles Cafe. I live and work close by so I come here a lot and I haven't had something I didn't like.. My go to is the breakfast sandwich with sausage instead of ham but I've tried many things; pizza waffle, fruit sandwich and the chicken waffle sandwich.. I have my sights set on the fruit waffles with ice cream next. The place could use a face lift or even just a new coat of paint but it's family owned and the staff is always so nice so it's doesn't bother me really. Keep being awesome Waffles Cafe!"}
{"text":"This café has seriously upped the breakfast game. They serve up buttery waffle-icous meals: Waffle Pizzas (saaaay whaaat?!), Waffle Sandwiches, Waffle Sundaes and Classic Waffles w/ endless toppings(see photos for menu/prices). There are lots of add on options so you can create the waffle of your dreams. All the ingredients are top quality, and you can taste it.    What we ordered:  My fiancé ordered the classic waffle sandwich. The waffle was warm and fluffy on the inside and had a nice crisp crunch on the outside. The waffle was stuffed with  layers of crispy bacon, scrambled eggs and ooey-gooey melted cheese: Perfection!   I ordered the organic flax waffle with sliced bananas, diced strawberries, and chunks of mango with powdered sugar. They didn't skimp on my fresh fruit toppings. Instead,  they loaded that sucker up (just the way I like it). Again, my waffle was warm and fluffy on the inside and had a nice crisp crunch.  Every bite was like a piece of heaven!    If you're looking to be WOWed by ambience, keep calm and carry on.  If you're looking for a casual and unique spot to grab breakfast/dessert/lunch, Waffles Café is your place. We loved our breakfast and will be returning sooner than later.   Bonus: They're located in the growing NW/Centennial area!"}
{"text":"This place is the OG of breakfast/brunch! My sister, baby niece and I came here for the first time. Upon entering, we were greeted and the cashier/server even suggest the favorite. The waffles are seriously the best. Golden brown and crispy on the outside and fluffy and air filled on the inside. The breakfast sandwiches are HUGE and tasty! The classic breakfast special is amazing. This place is so simple it's crazy! Definitely hits home. I'll be back *drops imaginary mic"}
{"text":"Best no-frills breakfast in town, bar none.  Two eggs, two strips of bacon, and a waffle, served on a Styrofoam plate with a great cup of bottomless coffee for less than $5?  Count me in!  If you need to have hash browns, go ahead and order them!  They don't appear on the menu, but they do have them if you ask.  Not a great place to linger over that last cup while enjoying the trendy music and trying to pick up hipster chicks, this is as basic a place as you can get.  But despite this lack of frills, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  I know I was!"}
{"text":"the yummiest waffles I've ever had and the best deal for your money (breakfast with eggs, waffle, bacon and coffee for $5)"}
{"text":"Very nice girls nice and clean atmosphere.  The food is served on paper plates making it a bit too county fair like for me.  Also the batter is a bit to light and sweet (the ice cream shops in Korea), the syrup isn't maple, the butter is stick. The eggs were good and the hash browns reminded me of summer camp served in a paper dish.  The girls do a great job introducing the menu."}
{"text":"The pictures on the walls looked great, but there weren't enough seats in this tiny establishment. so my family and I left without eating... maybe next time."}
{"text":"Love the food here! We are from out of town.  It was our first time here and the owner offered to explain the whole menu.  I just wanted the grilled chicken and it was delicious!!! I would definitely come back and most definitely recommend this restaurant to our friends and family!!"}
{"text":"I always come here when I visit my family in Vegas. My favorite is their Red Velvet waffle with fresh fruit & extra cream cheese drizzle. Their seasoned potatoes are on point & bacon is sooo good. The owners & staff are really nice & friendly. They are also very helpful. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I liked the waffle, it was crispy and light and  creamy (not raw...think of a cruller donut) inside.  This was my first time here so I wanted the purest version and got it plain. There are other toppings but you have to pay for them.  So it can get pricey.  I got the breakfast special which included eggs and bacon. The eggs were a little runny but I ordered the bacon crunchy and it was PERFECT.  You order the food at the counter and it is served on paper plates.  Dixie paper plates. I get that they want to keep food costs down but to me that is unacceptable and plastic utensils? Not a very environmentally friendly place at all.   You don't get a server no one asks if everything is okay, it's all self serve and you pay for your food first and if course there is a place to leave a tip. Which I overtipped...  Inside the place is UGLY. It's not inviting at all.  I am not looking for a luxuriously tufted pillow to set my delicate butt on or anything but something in there, ANYTHING could match something else.   It's not a place I'd go back to."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. The customer service is amazing and the food is very good. I really enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here once and honestly only remember the food being served on a paper plate with a plastic fork. I was just reading some reviews and though I can't remember my waffle being anything too special, I don't like eating with a plastic fork even when I order food to go. There is just something strange about being served this way in a restaurant. Yea, it's clean but I think that they should stop serving food that way. It's just a bad first impression."}
{"text":"This place had really good reviews but we were not impressed.   The waffle was decent but the delivery was gross.  Serve on a paper plate in a not so clean environment."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious home cooked food! Very friendly staff. I'm always looking for locally owned breakfast/brunch cafes and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a great little local gem, and this is definitely one of them.  Before going here the first time I would have said I didn't care much for waffles.  These aren't just any waffles though.  I'm addicted to the breakfast sandwich, but my family has gotten multiple different menu items from savory to sweet, and they are always excellent.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing waffles!! Lol my boyfriend and I went for breakfast one morning and we didn't really know what to get. He got the chicken waffle sandwich which came with a hash brown and I got a flax waffle with strawberries and whipped cream and it came with bacon or sausage. I don't eat meat so I got bacon for my boyfriend and I ate his hashbrown.  It was a little pricey and the sprite that we ordered was just a can of sprite with a Styrofoam cup of ice. The Thai tea that I got was good but not very sweet like I like. I loved the hash brown and my waffle was so good. My boyfriend's sandwich looked amazing and it had avocado on it! Tastey and good for you!  Overall, the service was great and so was the food. I just wish the prices were a tiny bit cheaper."}
{"text":"This place has easily become one of my new favorites. A hidden gem in the Northwest area. It's always very clean. I have never walked in and saw even a dirty table. The owner is cheerful and very sweet to each and every customer. She even remembered my name. Which isn't an easy one . The entire staff is super friendly to be honest and still very professional. I like that. The atmosphere is relaxed like a coffee shop but with a sweet smell always in the air that screams southern home-cooked breakfast.  So far my favorites are the red velvet waffle and the chicken wings. The wings are actual seasoned perfectly and taste home cooked. My husband is a bacon-freak so he loves the \"Kimmie's BLT Xplosion\" it's loaded with bacon. My kids like the \"tornado fries\" Definitely check this place out!!! Good customer service + Good food. Oh and they have a selection of unique waffle batters including some healthy ones too! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and I love that they used recycled paper products (bowls and plates). I had the gluten free waffle and it was really good."}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time today and we're pleasantly surprised by the exciting menu of breakfast and lunch waffle options and create-your-own options.  The red velvet waffle with cream cheese drizzle was rich and delicious.  The maple syrup was even a standout.  My hot apple pie waffle was good, except that the apple pie filling was left cold when they put together my waffle.  It would have been much better served warm.  Still, it was delicious!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough nice about the waffles café on Aliante. The customer service is excellent. The owner is friendly and gracious. She actually remembered me from my previous visit. The food is consistently good. Specifically The grits are the best I have ever had. I recommend waffles café on Aliante for a wonderful breakfast experience well worth the reasonable prices charged."}
{"text":"Family owned and phenomenal service for that diner like feel, but for waffles! Gluten free option for waffles and have a wide variety of choices."}
{"text":"Pretty decent, I appreciated the locally sourced fresh food. No stand out flavors but nothing to complain about. The customer service was decent and location was convenient to where I was staying on vacation."}
{"text":"Great little cafe! It wasn't what I expected when I walked through the door, but the customer service is awesome and the food is great! Prices were reasonable too!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  We always got their waffle sandwiches and they were so so good!  I am sad to find out that they are now closed =("}
{"text":"Love this place! It's simple. It's priced fair and the waffle was very good. Sunday was my day to say I have had enough of the twigs and berries and I want pancakes! Well at least a waffle although they have big banner that states now serving pancakes but really who goes to a Waffle Cafe for pancakes...the name tells you what their specialty is.   Anyway I had a waffle with blueberries, strawberries and bananas. No I passed on the chocolate chips, whipped cream and powdered sugar. Hey I was breaking lose on my food choices but didn't want to go crazy...maybe that why I was carving ribs later that night because I knew I had saved some food karma points :)  Also the staff in this place was very friendly, helpful and fun. It was good to hear youthful energy enjoying their work instead of the normal this is just my job type of employee's. This staff gave good service and enjoyed what they do.    I would definitely come back here good food, good service and fair prices. Oh and I forgot to mention they also have cool smoothies I got the Lychee...yum I love the fruit!"}
{"text":"Mehhhh. I wish it was better. :(  The waffles were tough.   The boba tasted like it was a a powder mix.   The service was great though. Everyone seemed so friendly."}
{"text":"My kids and I were not impressed with the food or drinks at all.  The pumpkin waffle was way too sweet a d the thai boba didn't even taste like one.  My daughter didn't like the taste of her m&m waffle.  I wasted my money but the cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good waffles I like that you can choose your toppings and your waffle batter. It was moderately busy when I went and our drink order came when we were nearly done eating.  Food is served on throw away plates and the forks are plastic."}
{"text":"In the mood for waffles come to this place.  Wonderfully light airy and crisp waffle.  Wife clamors for them from time to time.  Be a five star rating but they don't have much selection beyond their waffles with uber toppings.  Give them a try you won't be disappointed and you'll be helping a local mom and pop shop!"}
{"text":"I'm not a waffle person so I'm trying to be fair by going with what my waffle eating family has said.  We had the banana split waffle, a caramel pumpkin pecan waffle, and some thai tea minus the bobas.  The banana split was merely ok for me.  Kids loved but what kid wouldn't?   The pumpkin pecan was quite good.  I think I would stick with the pumpkin batter than the traditional.   Their waffles are made well.  Light and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The Thai tea could have been a little bit sweeter (I've had better).  I'm not one that likes to fill up on these types of food because I always feel like I'm just putting \"junk\" into my body.   But I think it's a nice get away from the normal \"sweet tooth\" or desert outting for ice cream.  We'll be back for an occasional treat but not to eat the food as a meal.  I feel like it's just A-ok but I'm putting into consideration that I'm not a big waffle eater.  So, 4 stars for being a unique treat."}
{"text":"I popped in for breakfast while I was awaiting a surgical patient at Centennial hospital.  Way better than any cafeteria choices, I'm sure!  I had dined at waffles previously at the old southwest location so I knew what to expect.  This location didn't disappoint.  I had the breakfast special with 1 waffle, scrambled eggs, sausage, and coffee.  I upgraded to a chai latte for a fee.  I think it was around $8 total.    Delicious!  The waffles are almost inexplicable.  They are ultra crispy on the outside, super light, and moist and fluffy on the inside.  Eggs were cooked nicely.    Service was very nice and atmosphere was fine.  I would surely return soon....if I'm in the centennial neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you want a cafe style breakfast including waffles, this is your place.  Jeff and Isaac are very friendly and treat their regulars like family.  They gave my wife and I a card for our wedding.  Who does that?  We go in to eat occasionally and they treat us like family.  This family is amazing and they make great food.  I tried the Waffles Cafe in the Aliante area and it is not as good as this place."}
{"text":"We got their blazen grilled chicken and chicken and waffle meals. They were very good and the strawberry butter with the chicken and waffles was amazing. The customer service was top notch. The nice woman working the register went over the whole menu layout and was eager to help and answer any questions. I would recommend to anyone. They even have a few books for children to read while you wait for your meal. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been back about 4 more times since this review. I think I might be addicted haha Last time I was there I tried their  breakfast sandwich and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Always friendly and they greet you with welcoming smile.  It's nice to come to a place getting the same experience with great food and warm welcome every time you step right into Waffles Cafe. They have a great selection of waffles and add ons that will blow your waffle taste buds to another level!! Of course, my go to is the waffle breakfast sandwich which is ginormous and is guaranteed to to fill you up for breakfast.    If you're looking for the best Waffles in Vegas, then Waffles Cafe is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great service, great prices, great local spot!!! Love the crispy yummyness of their waffles!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Jeff and his girlfriend are great.  The food is very fresh and healthy.  I recommend that everyone try it.  If you like waffles you will love this place.  Please support them as they are a small business.  The customer service is the best I have found in a long time, and the food is fresh, clean and well presented.  Presentation, quality of food, and customer service is the motto here, and they live up to it.  If I could have I would have given them 6 stars."}
{"text":"Great portions, fantastic sausages. Good bacon, good scrambled eggs, their breakfast sandwich is enough to feed a small village, in other words, its huuuuge. Their waffles are rather large as well. Much better then Ihop, easily. They have a large menu, lots of options, you can customize your waffles in many different ways. If you love M&M's..theres a topping for that. Overall great place. Cute inside. Good staff. Good drinks as well."}
{"text":"love love LOVE this place.  They have a huge selection of different types of waffles.  Whether its waffles with different toppings or waffle sandwiches and EVEN waffle pizza.  The workers are awesome and wanting to get to know you.  Their menu selection is easy to read while the workers recommend items and give you more info.    they also have a selection of drinks as well.  They have a selection of boba tea, smoothies, and hot tea.    i really love this place.  A great way to start off your day.  A very nice environment and most of all........free coffee refills!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I did come back to eat the pizza waffle, and it was only well...meh.  I guess it just wasn't what I had expected.  The waffle was really mushy and the cheese allready coagulated when it arrived at the table.  I have to give them a pass though because they are still very new and may still be perfecting their craft.  Plus the people who work here are so friendly."}
{"text":"its a good quick breakfast place. you cant beat their breakfast special."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I live so close to Waffles Cafe :) I love love the Ham and Bacon Waffle Sandwich !  We have since brought everyone else we know here and everyone also loved their orders! :)  Don't forget to ask for a Waffles Card :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and exceptional service.  Huge menu, healthy or indulgent!! This is a hidden gem and Kim and her staff absolutely have it figured out!   What a find!  We will definitely be back for our return trips to Vegas for NASCAR!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I have to say I will come here multiple more times. Food was very delicious and fast. Atmosphere was very quite and staff very friendly.  Great place to bring the family. Well done!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place..... Jacob & Isaac are awesome guys & they treat you right. The food is great and the value is good for the portions. I always stick with the classic breakfast plate but upgrade to the pumpkin waffle, sausage & scrambled egg. This is always a great way to start my day off right."}
{"text":"This family owned establishment has a lot going for themselves.  Having a waffle based menu, you would never think that waffles could go well with so many things.  My favorites are their waffle sandwiches! You can get your choice of chicken, ham and bacon, tuna, or turkey.  You can also choose what type of waffle you want.  I almost always like to get the organic flax.    This place is also great for desserts where, you guessed it, they have a menu set up where you can customized some yummy waffle desserts. Add your own choice of toppings and ice creams and its a fun party time in your mouth. Last but not least, please try their boba and smoothie drinks. They are seriously the best I've EVER had. YUP!"}
{"text":"This Waffles Cafe is tasty!  It is also a fun cafe with so many lovely waffle options.  YUM!  This location is very nice.  It is bright and very open.  I have visited some of the other locations and they seem cramped, but not this one!  Lots of room to sit and relax and enjoy your waffle.  This location was also spotless!  They must have elves here to come out and clean, because it was absolutely spotless! It is also super casual, so it is a nice break from your everyday life.  The staff here is super friendly as well.  Everyone really seemed to welcome you and make you feel comfortable.  I just love great customer service and really appreciate it when I get it!  That gets Waffles a bonus star from me!  The food is yummy too.  On this visit I had the chicken & waffle.  It was really good.  It was different than I have ever had it before, so that was fun.  The waffles here are the size of the plate they come on and are of the thinner variety.  The waffle batter has something special in it, but I can't quite figure it out.  I think it is vanilla and maybe cinnamon?  I'm not sure, but they are yummy.  The chicken of the dish was 3 chicken fingers.  They tasted good, but weren't anything special.  What made the dish different was that it came with strawberry butter and a spicy hot sauce to go with the food.  The sweet, fruity butter went great with the food and I would order that on any waffle any time!  The spicy, thick, hot sauce was an interesting flavor and actually went well with the sweetness of the butter.  I know it sounds strange, but it really worked.   If you are into dessert style waffles, this is your place as well.  The have all sorts of options like apple pie filling, chocolate, pumpkin, strawberry, and a lot more to satisfy your sweet tooth.  They actually have more dessert varieties than breakfast and savory dishes.  YUMMY!  If you are into fancy teas like Thai, Boba, or Fruit teas, then you are REALLY in luck since they have about 3 dozen or tea varieties to make your taste buds happy.    I think the prices are a bit high for what you get, which is why I dropped them in the score.  The entree waffles all seem about a $1-2 too high for what you actually receive.  If the prices were a bit less, I would be at Waffles a lot more for sure."}
{"text":"ONE JOB GUYS. U make waffles and Bfest crap. Its super simple!!!! Why isnt your ENTIRE MENU ON GRUB HUB???????? Called to place the order instead, but I cant trust that because you FORGOT part of my order last time. Even tho you repeated it OVER THE PHONE. Its not rocket science!"}
{"text":"Comment dire...  OH MON DIEU !  De tout les repas (de porcs) faits à Vegas (baby !), c'est à ceux au WaffleS Café que je repense le plus.  Des gaufres énormes, délicieuses, mais surtout légères, plein de recettes de pâtes au choix (normal, complet, avoine, chocolat, potiron...) et des dizaines de combinaisons possibles vu tout les toppings disponibles : noix de pécans (beurk), beurre de cacahuètes, nutella, compote de pommes, noix de coco, amandes, mini-marshmallows, pépites de chocolat, sauce caramel, sauce chocolat ET PLEIN DE FRUITS FRAIS (rien que d'y repenser je pleure un peu à l'intérieur).  Y'a aussi plein d'autres trucs sur la carte, mais vaut mieux garder la place pour manger des gaufres, parce qu'elles dépotent du tonnerre.   Ah et oui, j'ai oublié de parler du prix : environ 7$ pour une double gaufre avoine avec deux fruits et deux toppings, ça veut dire environ 4,50 pour s'en mettre plein la panse. Miam.  WaffleS Café I love you."}
{"text":"The service is outstanding, and I love all the different toppings! The lime infused water was a nice touch, too. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Always good and clean. These people work there butt off and are so happy day n and day out! It's always been the same since day one! This is a sit in kind of place. Eat it while it's fresh!!"}
{"text":"This visit was much better than my first. Service was fast, staff was friendly and food was cooked perfect!  I had the waffle pizza and it was delicious."}
{"text":"After being referred to  Waffles cafe by an employee from an adjacent business, I gave the place a try. Boy am i glad we did. The customer service was attentive and helped with the menu items. The place was clean and well staffed.  We ordered the chicken and waffles and the tropic thunder plate.  The best waffle I've ever had. It was light and fluffy and mines came with a strawberry butter, no need for syrup.  However, I used syrup on the waffles anyway. I will come back and order a la carte and make my meal more health conscious. I real breakfast treat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were yelping Breakfast places and came across this place and decided to give it a try. The pictures and menu options sold us Lol. We are sooooo glad we found this place! Service was excellent by a guy named Jeff who recommended to try the Waffle Sandwich. We got the Ham & Bacon...mmmm best waffle sandwich we've ever had! We also had Yooni's Favorite which was strawberries, bananas, whipped cream, ice cream, and chocolate sauce all on top of a warm, soft, crispy on the outside waffle. Their waffles were a perfect texture and wasn't soggy at all. Everything was delicious, we will definitely come back to this place when we come to Vegas again."}
{"text":"So glad we finally made it to Waffles Cafe. I love waffles for breakfast, but was looking forward to trying the dessert waffles that I seen pictured on Yelp. I had the Banana split waffle on a chocolate waffle (delicious). My Dad who doesn't even like waffles had the Pumpkin Waffle with apples and vanilla ice cream. He ate the whole thing and said it was great!! He didn't save me a bite. My waffle was slightly crisp on the outside-light and fluffy on the inside and the warm waffle melted the ice cream perfectly. The bananas were fresh and plentiful. The waffles are bigger that I thought, but we had no problem finishing them off. Service was great and friendly. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing little hole in the wall. Customer service was available. Food was better then we thought it would be. We will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the Best Friend waffle and it was decent, crispy and soft in a good way. However, they undoubtedly put spoiled milk in my thai tea with boba! Unfortunately I got my food through Postmates so I couldn't do much complaining with out calling but I was extremely disgusted and will not be returning. Who knows what else is out of date in their store."}
{"text":"The waffles were a complete sugar rush, but they were wonderful. Smoothies were good too.  Service was a bit slow, but they were busy so it's understandable."}
{"text":"The food here was so good. I have the potato scrambles and a side of pancakes. The food came out hot and with a smile. This is not a fancy place, but if you want a great breakfast with good service, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place has amazing smoothies and lots of options. Great place to have breakfast and just relax with friends. The staff is excellent and very friendly. Nice to have a small town feel place in this big city."}
{"text":"If you are craving waffles for breakfast come here!  Cool spot for family/kids, I'd say. My bf really liked it lol and service was great as well. Portions are not huge like other places. Their waffles with chicken cream/sauce were really good. Would come back if I had kids with me :)"}
{"text":"I just ate here and it was amazing food was really good  And Ashere was so nice and had amazing customer service  He showed us a break down of the menu he was very enthusiastic I loved how he offered his favorite 's  He asked questions  His service was very authentic!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The oat waffle was great!  The waffle sandwich looked great too, but I didn't try that.  The staff did a great job of greeting us with a smile and explaining their menu to us.   Who knew there were so many things to do with a waffle?"}
{"text":"Ok, so my friends and I were looking for some breakfast foods after church.  I suggested this place, since it had great reviews on yelp.  Upon entering this place, I was expecting to be seated and to have a menu handed to me. But, no you  have to go up there and order what you want which was ok with me except I did want to stare at the menu while sitting down and reading a description.  But it's ok, I can deal.    Let me just say, I was really disappointed with this place.  I didn't understand the whole concept of ordering, or anything.  And even though the guy explained it to us, he made it seem like we could only order the breakfast portion even though I wanted to try the waffle pizza. I ended up ordering the Yooni's Favorite, which was no favorite of mine.  It didn't really grab my attention, and the waffles is ordinary.  The waffles were kind of pricey; and everything's served on paper plates and disposable utensils which I found kind of \"ghetto.\" I don't know that's just me.   The drive wasn't worth it, I might've just drove more down for babycakes.  At least their place had flavor, and prices are well worth it."}
{"text":"Five years later this Waffles Cafe still maintains the high quality and consistency of food and service that's earned my family's loyalty. Of the two locations this one is the best, by far. Waffles are crisp and airy, the staff is super friendly, and parking is a breeze.   We always order the tuna waffle sandwich with hash browns during breakfast time or chips during lunchtime. Runs about $7 per person and always hits the spot.  Still a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I'm a hard reviewer when it comes to 5 stars, but this place comes close. The waffles themselves are delicious, nice and lightly crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside. I could eat a waffle by itself. The toppings are good and fresh, it's just that to get what you want on the waffle, the price will pile up high very quickly. If you order their personal favorites (two of them), you'll save more money.  BUT LET ME TELL YOU THE GEM OF THIS PLACE-- THE WAFFLE SANDWICH. I've only had the tuna waffle sandwich but it changed my life. It's a large waffle folded in half stuffed with tuna, fresh greens, and a questionable clear and delicious sauce (sweet) that goes really well with the sandwich. Comes with a side of ridged potato chips and runs around 6.55 a sandwich. All in all, not bad.  If you're in a hurry though, CALL AHEAD and pick up your food because it does take a while to make and my mom and I were growing restless on their uncomfortable but trendy dining chairs.  The inside is really nicely decorated with bright oranges and lime greens. I felt like I had died and been reincarnated as a citrus fruit."}
{"text":"Very friendly and nice to first timers. I ordered strawberry waffle with choco chips and apple pie filling, it was so tasty I didn't need syrup! Def coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Good waffles; weird sandwiches. Although the waffles here are pretty good, the sandwiches they make (using waffles as bread) are just weird. Whether chicken, turkey or ham sandwiches they use sweet waffles as bread plus this sugary \"secret sauce\" that really doesn't work well with meats. Very friendly atmosphere and staff, but if you want something more than waffles go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So so surprised the waffles were the perfect marriage of subtle sweet light waffle batter and the savory of a turkey sandwich. This was my cheat meal of the week and so beyond worth it.   Little strawberry sauce on top of the yumminess. Lovely family run (there must be a super mom in the back who could make a porcupine taste good) and will be back.   FYI. I don't know how late this spot is open but after a night of drinking too much, it beats the shorts off Taco Hell & Jack n the Crack for alcohol-absorbing delight."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has a four star rating? Waffle sandwich was dry and without flavor. If you want a delicious waffle, visit the Coffee Pub instead."}
{"text":"I wanted to turn around and walk out as soon as the grease trap smell hit me in the face. That has to be the worst smell on the planet. The eggs were fine and the bacon was cheap... the waffles weren't bad but it was hard to enjoy with the strong smell of grease floating through the air. The worst part is they used paper plates and plastic forks and cups. I spent $34 to be served off plastic... and what about the environment??? They're obviously not recycling because you can't recycle anything that's soiled. The amount of money they probably spend on plastic-wear they could probably invest in some actual dishes and glass-wear. The coffee was the best part and they were very nice but I won't support a business that doesn't consider the environment."}
{"text":"So accommodating! I'm vegan and going out can be a challenge, well after only a few questions, waffles café created me a vegan sandwich! They sautéed peppers, mushrooms and olives added some lettuce and tomatoes on wheat bread. So delicious... I added a little mustard for zing and it was perfect. The entire staff was so nice, it was truly a pleasure and I hope they didn't find me too picky.   ALSO, they will sub almond milk for yogurt in their smoothies! I had the lychee flavor. They have an incredible amount of flavors. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch. Chicken and Waffles, Turkey Club, Blazing Chicken, the Cherry Blossom were on the ticket and they all certainly satisfied! Waffle cut fries were excellent and the tornado fries will be tried the next time out- All menu items were under $10- Staff very cheery and helpful. Absolutely no complaints or issues with this strip mall eatery."}
{"text":"This place was a little over priced it smelled like moist towels in the restaurant it was humid inside I wouldn't really ever go back unless they looked a little better and cleaned up whatever that smell was."}
{"text":"When I lived in Aliante this place was my go to for boba tea since other places are quite a drive. I'm glad that their boba tea menu fits my cravings (for more simplistic drinks) especially their milk tea or the lychee smoothie with boba/lychee jelly.   I've had their waffles a couple of times and they're decent. I never make waffles nor do I have anything to make waffles with so this is good when I want it once in a while. I'm partial to sweet versus savory. They do have normal breakfast options if you just want waffles on the side and not dressed up.  Their coffee drinks are also really good!"}
{"text":"Nice place, wide variety of waffles to choose for your belly =d"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was delicious and the build your own section is impressive. I decided to go with the chicken and waffles and I loved it. They also have a boba tea and smoothie section with multiple flavors. I definitely see myself being a regular."}
{"text":"This is the nearest place for me to buy Boba when I feel like having one. Not bad. It takes a very long time for them to make one shake. I went to Smith's to buy a few things I needed, went back to the cafe and they were not yet done.  Their swirl potato chip on a stick is really good. I think they are over priced. Overall,  I still go there to buy my boba."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from visiting and instantly fell in love. Will be a required stop any time we're in town from now on."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast. They are consistently good and super friendly. They know my order and the prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast or lunch.  Kids love the kids breakfast.  I've had the adult breakfast and chicken and waffles,  both good. Friendly staff. Lots of choices."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and it was amazing! It was my first time and the staff was super friendly and asked if I had been there and gave me tips on what to order! When I got the waffles they were definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The ultimate breakfast bowl is delicious!  Quiet atmosphere for a Sunday morning breakfast.  My best friend & I love coming to this little place"}
{"text":"Great little place.  Looks like she has WiFi.  Waffles are very good,  According to my German husband, they are just as good as those he ate in Europe.  Very friendly and good prices."}
{"text":"so due to some crazy impromptu trip to vegas, my friends and I ended up here.  One of my friends that lives in Vegas insisted that we go here, and besides, we'd already seen a picture of her coffee waffle with nutella and bananas, so we were game.  It's quite a bit away from the strip, so if you don't have a car while in Vegas, expect a large cab fare.    Decent prices, options galore.  You pick a type of waffle that you want, and then you can pick from a variety of toppings.  You can also make it a combo, add some potatoes and eggs.    The guy working there is super nice, I think he might be the owner.  He ran through the whole process with us, and remembered that my friend had been there before.  We all got a waffle, two coffees, one pumpkin.  Needless to say, they were only clean plates left.  Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Small shop making waffles with love. The food and shakes do take a few minutes longer than what some of us may be used too but the food is worth the wait. They are not stingy with their portions, food tasted and looked great.   Didn't know whether or not to still put syrup on my waffle sandwich but I did, and it tasted great.   The place was surprisingly quiet, although there were a few different groups of people inside.   Shakes: Good and simple. I was more impressed with the fact that it came with a jumbo straw rather than those other skimpy ones.   Overall a must try if you haven't stopped by."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal from the food to the drinks to the smoothies to the atmosphere to the music to the friendly workers to the owners themselves I had to get his place 10 out of 10 it is perfect it needs nothing else to be a great place it is beyond perfect I will definitely be going here again I love this place the food is awesome very very very awesome and the drinks are awesome as well I know I said that already but what can I say when something is good do you have to explain it the best you can I will be coming again and again."}
{"text":"Had a choco waffle with strawberries and bananas. It was excellent! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic meal here. We ordered the tornado fries, blazing chicken sandwhich, flax waffles with coconut and almonds and waffle fries. Everything was excellent but I'm partial to the chicken. The prices were very good, check the menu on yelp and see for yourself. Worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, we only waited ten minutes (maybe less) for our food.  I had the original waffle, and my friend had a pumpkin waffle.  A little bit of a crispy outside, nice and moist on the inside.  Very tasty.  Eggs on the side were bland, and the turkey sausage was good, but not great.  Coffee was also mediocre.  If you only get waffles it's excellent, but average sides prevent a higher rating.  Next time I go I'll definitely just get a few waffles."}
{"text":"Cute place, I was in the mood for something savory so I got a turkey waffle sandwich.  It comes with tomato, lettuce, avocado, cheese and sauce.  I should've asked what the sauce was before I got it, it was like a sweetened Italian dressing goo, but the waffle instead of bread is a neat concept.  The green iced tea was very grassy and delicious.  It is far away from my side of town so I wouldn't rush back here, but I am sure the sweeter waffles are fun.  I guess I can agree with another yelper that the chairs aren't that comfy but it is a casual place."}
{"text":"I enjoy having breakfast here. They have a variety of waffles breakfast and lunch items. The service is always great. The cafe is always very clean. The owner has been here every visit and is very friendly. Today I had the breakfast sandwich, it was delicious! (Like always) oatmeal was delicious also..!"}
{"text":"This place is a dump. Very dirty and grimy. The tables and seats are not clean. The waffles were ok. Nothing special. I would not go here again."}
{"text":"The people that work there are soooooooooooo nice and helpful!  The waffles were decent but I would not go out of my way to get there.  Seemed like they have a lot of regulars though.  I did not like the fact that they do not have any fountain soda."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews before leaving for my Vegas trip and decided to try it out myself. I personally am a huge FAN of WAFFLES. I mean come on, who doesn't love a good waffle? :]  The menu is really simple and not overwhelming like most other places. You can either A) choose your type of waffle and your favorite toppings and sides. B) order a waffle sandwich (DELICIOUS) with your choice of tuna, ham & bacon, chicken, or turkey. C) waffle pizza!! I ordered the Turkey Waffle Sandwich and OMG!! The waffle tasted like any other waffle but the idea of it in sandwich form was on another level. The sauce that they put in the sandwich made it even yummier as well. It's not really mayonnaise, but it's a sweet clear sauce that brought everything in the sandwich together.  If you are in the area definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Our Favorite neighborhood breakfast place!   By far the best waffle.. Crisp on the outside yet light and fluffy inside- and a wonderful taste.  We enjoy the breakfast special and the atmosphere of this family owned restaurant. We are always greeted with a welcome and hello when we come to the counter.  The consistency of quality is one reason we continue to make this our favorite!"}
{"text":"Great little place to grab some yummy food! They serve breakfast style waffles, lunch style waffles and smoothies! I enjoyed how they had the option to make your waffle healthier by adding flax seeds, organic, or even adding fresh fruit. I ordered the breakfast special which was a perfect amount of food. There was one waffle, sausage, eggs, and a cup of coffee. My boyfriend ordered the waffle ham sandwich that came with hash browns. They were both delicious!  Very clean and friendly environment. They had today's top hits playing on the radio and the news on the tv. The staff was great and the service was very quick! I will be returning here often. Extremely pleased with this find!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little unassuming restaurant in a complex that I have managed to ignore for the longest time. Seriously. I've been to the Wal-Mart and other stores across the road, but I think this is the first time I've ever gone to something on this side of the road.  I ordered the Fruit Sandwich Waffle. It was very good and worth the price of admission. My cousin had a Chocolate Waffle with strawberries and chocolate sauce. Everything was good.  Honestly, I'm not a big waffle fan. In fact, I usually only get them at hotels that have the waffle maker (because it's just fun!). In this case, I'm giving four stars for one simple and silly reason - from the moment I stepped in the door, I heard one Beatles song after another. They eventually played other music (and then more Beatles), but that alone makes me a fan. Well, that and their employees are uber-friendly. It would be a shame if they had great taste in music but were rude."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this café a higher rating because the food was decent, but seeing 50+ typos on their printed menu was a bit unsettling. If management lack this degree of attention to detail, I wonder if they are checking the expiration date on their eggs (not a good first impression). Another issue was the server brought out 2 trays for our food and placed 1 tray onto a neighboring table (where guests were sitting!!) while she served us. MAJOR NO NO! You never place a guests food on another guests table. YIKES! ~ Lastly, the price was high when considering you have to stand to place your order, eat on paper plates and use plastic utensils..oh, can clear your own table. ($30 for 3 waffle orders with no drinks)"}
{"text":"Horrible! Husband and I both order chicken wings and waffles. Everything down to the strawberry butter tasted disgusting! The waffles tasted as if they're seasoned with savory spices and the texture was that of a freezer waffle. Chicken was overly salty, the meat smelled and tasted as if the meat had gone bad and they were fried in old oil.  I was only able to get through three bites of the meals before I had to stop because I couldn't stomach anymore. The meal didn't even smell appetizing.  Add TERRIBLE customer service to the list. Just got off the phone with the manager and she was beyond RUDE! Her attitude was completely HORRENDOUS! She yelled and hung up the phone TWICE. Uncourteous and unprofessional."}
{"text":"1st time eating here. The food was not bad, it's a nice place for a lunch break. It kinda feels almost like a nice fast food place, I didn't really feel a cafe vibe....NOT BAD AT ALL:)!!"}
{"text":"very good waffles! the menu is huge and everything is on a waffle, from pecans to ham its all on a waffle! a little pr icy but very creative!"}
{"text":"The place to be to get Belgian Waffles in Vegas. Been here numerous times, but finally got around to writing a review for this place.  Food: Waffles, Waffles, Waffles. Waffles with strawberries. Waffles with blueberries. Waffles pizza. Waffles with ice cream. They would do waffles boba drink if it was delicious. I think you get the idea. I stick to the original waffles, I'm a purist of taste. The Belgian waffles are just delicious, but really need some ingredients like nuts and berries to really bring out the flavor. I recommend adding some topping. The Waffle Pizza is interesting. I tried the pepperoni waffle pizza. I wouldn't say its bad, but I wouldn't order it again. It certainly is unique. I wish the waffle wasn't so soft, would have tasted a lot better had it been a little crunchy or harder. Sadly, anything that isn't a waffle is meh. Personally I would avoid the $5 breakfast special: waffle, eggs, bacon or sausage, and coffee (before 11am). Eggs were mediocre and bacon was too crispy for my taste.   Service: The staff are really friendly and helpful. Jeff (the owner?) is really friendly and nice. However, service could be faster. On average, I would say it takes 10 minutes to make your waffle from the time of ordering, IF you're the only one there. This place is usually pack so wait time could easily go 20 - 30 minutes. I highly recommend calling your order in right before you leave for this place.  Price: Base price for the waffle is $3.75 which isn't that bad. But here is the clever up selling technique. Pricing the ingredients relatively cheap, under $1. You go a little crazy on ingredients and you're waffle easily goes over $6. Really brilliant on the business end. While the $5 breakfast is a good value, it just doesn't work for me. I rather just spend it on the ingredients and make 1 really good waffle.  Summary: Anything that isn't the traditional waffle just doesn't really work for me. Stick to the traditional waffles and go topping crazy, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for years.  They have awesome waffles.  The rest of the food is ok, but the waffles are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  If you are on this side of town, it is a must."}
{"text":"My family loves this location - it's not far from our house and it makes the children happy. It's family owned so there is a special kind of treatment you receive.  If you support small business and like breakfast this is a definite go spot."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and wanted to try something new. Im not a huge breakfast person but I was in the mood for something new. Stumbled upon this family business and found a real treat! We ordered the chicken breast sandwich and a turkey breast sandwich n  it was so much better than I could have imagined! It wasn't crazy heavy on the stomach and tickled all of my taste buds. Low cost, delicious, family owned and fresh... hits all the check marks for a new favorite! Will def come back to this place..   P.S. woulda taken pictures of the food but it was too good to wait! :)"}
{"text":"It was my wife's birthday so for the second consecutive year we decided to celebrate by dining at Waffles on strawberry pancakes with whipped cream"}
{"text":"Great place with great customer service. It gets pretty busy on weekends so plan to arrive early. I recommend the breakfast special for first timers,but the rest of the menu is awesome as well. My family and I love this place and come here often. For those complaining about their plastic utensils, get over yourself. You're probably the same person who eats at McDonald's where your burgers and fries are served in paper wrappers! Just sayin'...."}
{"text":"Waffles Cafe promises you one thing: a cafe that serves waffles.  And it is quite the colorful cafe!  Bright yellow walls with white tables and chairs make for a cheery environment.  The menu is also made up of several chalkboards, with the whole menu handwritten in different colors!  It's a nice touch that makes me feel a little bit happier just walking into the place.  It also doesn't hurt that Jeff is always very hospitable and loves helping you decide on how to craft your perfect waffle.  If I'm up early in the morning and feeling like getting some good, quick breakfast, Waffles Cafe fulfills that feeling.  The one item that I've come to lean on is their Breakfast Special, which for under $6.00 gets you a plan waffle, eggs, bacon/sausage and unlimited coffee.  Yes, I've tried the waffle sandwiches, the waffle pizza's, the \"dessert\" waffles and all that, but I am perfectly fine with a plain waffle for breakfast.  The waffles are very good, and there is even a pumpkin batter option available.    The waffle sandwiches are exactly what they sound like; it's a sandwich that uses waffles instead of bread!  These tasty creations are waaay better than you would think, and the breakfast sandwich is deliciousness in a waffle (as opposed to on top off or beside).  Waffle pizzas are waffles with cheese and toppings on top.  Really, the waffles here are good enough where I don't mind replacing my bread or dough with them.  In addition to waffles they also serve boba drinks.  It's not the best I've had, but it'll do for when you have a craving for boba on this side of town.    Overall I've always been happy with the food and service, and will continue to come here.  Why the 4 stars?  If I'm looking to indulge...one waffle doesn't fill me up!  I've ordered a waffle sandwich and shared another waffle with a friend before and that was just right; add in a boba drink and you've crossed the $10 line, which is kinda pricey for breakfast.  (I did say that I was looking to indulge...)"}
{"text":"Very friendly and quick service. Nothing fancy, you order at the counter then they bring to you on paper plates but quick and hot. We really enjoyed the waffles with fresh fruit and smoothies. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich and delicious chicken and waffles. The homemade buffalo sauce is the bees knees. Kimberly is super friendly and knowledgeable of the food. All around great experience, will definitely be back to work my way through the menu"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time days ago.  Im not a big waffle fan but this place won me over.  I had the chicken and waffle and a chocolate milk shake. I know what a funky combination.  All of it was sooo good. Chicken cooked perfectly and the waffle was great.  I look forward to going back to this place.  The price point is good for a small location.."}
{"text":"Kim, the lady who assisted me was very nice and informative on menu selection.  It's posted by the register that they use the best ingredients so I was excited in tasting my waffle order.    To my disappointment, the waffles tasted terrible without whip cream and syrup.  The batter quality is substandard; thin, tasteless, cardboard-flavor.  I gave it another shot by dunking this waffle into my Starbucks coffee but it's unpalatable to me.  I shredded them into pieces and used it as bird food; They seemed to enjoy it!  What a waste of my $5.  Next time I'll invest this money into a breakfast buffet giving me assortment of waffles, pancakes and the likes.  So, so disappointed :(  I'm giving a one star for good customer service on Kim's part!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday morning after a night of libations and we were in the mood for something to soak up some alcohol. I remembered reading Yelp reviews about this place and decided to check it out. I thought the concept of a breakfast sandwich or any sandwich at all on a waffle sounded pretty cool.   I guess I caught them on a bad day because I came away not impressed. They were understaffed but nevertheless, how long can it take to make a waffle? Well, on this day it took about an half hour to crank out one gentleman's order to dine in no less. Our order took about the same so we were plenty hungry by time we got home. Low and behold, we had to assemble our own sandwich! After reheating everything and then putting it together, it actually wasn't bad but way too much effort for the price. Most importantly though my kids didn't care for it at all. Sorry WaffleS."}
{"text":"It was ok, the waffle is pretty good but I got the egg thing they got with the special sauce and it was sweet I'm not a huge fan of sweet eggs. It's really light next time I'll just get the blueberry waffle"}
{"text":"Waited over 1hr for food, with only a few customers in. Asked for coffee while I wait since I've waited over 45min n was charged for coffee to wait longer. Food wasn't great either for the that much of an wait Chef Romsey should have been back there!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious!!! Their waffles were cooked perfectly and the prices were extremely reasonable. The employees were extremely friendly and accommodating. I would absolutely come here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We ate here once. The food was okay, but nothing too exciting. There are much better places to get waffles around Vegas."}
{"text":"Super friendly with great prices and a good selection. If you are after waffles this is the place to check out. My kids were super excited to finally eat here. They split the Banana Split Waffle, and it was so big that they were barely able to finish it between the both of them.   I was excited to see that they also have boba teas and smoothies on their menu. That will be on my list to try on my next visit, along with a breakfast sandwich. My family doesn't go out for breakfast often, but I can see us returning here soon. This is the type of place that I could see us becoming regulars at. I love the hole in the wall family business vibe it has. You will never get that at any Denny's or IHOP in town and I am all for supporting the small business owner."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. Owner greeted us right away and explained the menu. I got a pumpkin waffle and bobby got a regular . I like places you sit and order at. We didn't realize it was counter service, but the service was great . Even though the pancakes were thin, they were airy. Mine did not have a lot of pumpkin taste. We wouldn't drive back up there, but if we were in the neighborhood we would eat there again"}
{"text":"It's a smaller shop so there is a wait. I got the turkey club it was delicious! I found my new breakfast spot on this side of town."}
{"text":"The service was fast and the food was good. But when I ordered one of the women behind the counter argued with me about the menu. I kept saying ok to her over and over and she kept repeating that the menu item that read 'blazing chicken and waffle' was a sandwich. Ok, I still want that. And this went on for a few minutes and I finally just stopped talking. I still don't understand what the problem was. I just wanted to make sure they gave us the spicy chicken not plain. The drinks are what are going to get you here. Coffee is 1.79 and sodas are 2.29 and you get a 16.9 oz bottle and a cup of ice, no refills obviously. It's worth mentioning, there's something wrong with the ventilation system. After about 15 min everyone's eyes started watering and you could see the cloudiness towards the kitchen. They seem to be nice people and the food is reasonable priced, two adults and two kids (not ordering the kids menu) was $47 with the tip. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but I wouldn't argue if someone else wanted to come here."}
{"text":"Having passed by here often we finally decided to give it a try. We went in on a weekend very early morning. There weren't many people there at the time, but the crowd picked up after that. So the menu is much more extensive thanks I was expecting. We always go for classics when trying out a new place, so that what we ordered. The waffle was good, but not anything to really write home about. It too a while to come out and they wee served on disposable plates and plastic ware. Not a huge deal, but I guess I had higher expectations from a place called waffles cafe. So, not horrible, just not sure if ilk be running back for more anytime. If you've had and enjoy blueberry hill waffles you will more than likely be dissatisfied.  It's a cute place and they seem to have a nice following, so try it and see what you think. Maybe the waffle with lots of toppings are better."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! My son gets to eat an amazing waffle and I get something more healthy. No need for seasoning anything! Alex was so friendly and made our experience very enjoyable. We'll be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"pretty awesome relaxing and interesting little cafe, they let you make your own type of waffle, from protein, red velvet, fruity, or original. Best part are the potatoes! haha try it out! awesome place"}
{"text":"Just didn't do it for me the customer service was good but food was so-so. The waffle was a little cold and they serve food on paper plates. It tasted like McDonald's waffles. It is plain and simple the food was not worth coming in for. If it had been served on fine china it still would have been cold and not very tasty. Just because the staff is nice that does not increase the quality of the dish. Better off going to IHOP. Damn I wish there was a Waffle House or roscoes chicken and waffles in north Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Jainie is such a friendly employee! Very nice. Even when there were no other customers, she kept busy by cleaning the tables and making sure nothing was on the floor. I love coming here. The environment is always cheerful and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"I like this place I would give it a 4.5 if you could. The good and waffles are good with a clean taste to the food. I think the lack of grease is what surprises people. For me and my family it provides a nice clean strawberry waffle or banana flax seed. We will definitely be going back from time to time."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices and the food here is insanely good. I highly recommend the blazing chicken sandwich the sauce is very good. Also their flax seed waffles are delicious. I would definitely drive out of my way for this one."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place.  If you're looking for somewhere super fancy,  this isn't they place for you.  But if you want good food for a good price then this is the place for you.  The breakfast special was 6.99 and it includes a waffle,  eggs,  bacon or sausage,  and unlimited coffee.  It was pretty empty when we were there so it was nice and quiet."}
{"text":"The plus side is they have gluten free waffles! Down side is we paid $26 dollars for such small portions. This is restaurant prices... :("}
{"text":"I love the waffles and how you can put so many different types of to toppings. The service's is fast and very nice."}
{"text":"Decent food. Not a bad wait but its dirty literally every time I visit. All tables need to be cleaned and never get the attention. Chicken and waffles is ok, don't expect Roscoe's or southern quality. smoothies ok though"}
{"text":"This place was really good I got the waffles with strawberry and whip cream, scrambled eggs, sausage and kiwi drink. Everything was so good no complaints. My husband got the waffles with chicken really good the strips were fresh and crispy taste really good. He got the strawberry lemonade drink bomb.com. Overall really great food service was really good going back."}
{"text":"The food : I tried the breakfast sandwich and was able to get all turkey based meats. Eggs, turkey , turkey sausage and cheese between a very fluffy waffle. It was a really good portion size and came with a side of potato chips. The sand which was great one of the better breakfast sandwiches I've had. I also had a side waffle with syrup. I have to say I love a fluffy waffle and this one really doesn't disappoint.  The service:  the service at this location was really good. Very friendly staff that's knowledgeable in case you need them to make you a recommendation. They got our food out quickly with out any issues.  I would definitely recommend waffles cafe for a quick breakfast that hits the spot."}
{"text":"Very good waffles but they don't use real plates or silverware and the walls are pretty dirty."}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Good place to get sit down and not feel rushed.  Would suggest getting more creative with waffles and make give it a twist.  But overall I would come back."}
{"text":"I loved the gluten free waffle! It is always a challenge to find gluten free pancakes and waffles and the other day I saw the sign that they had added GF waffles. I ordered it plain so I could taste the waffle on it's own, the texture and taste was wonderful.   I will definitely go back and try  the breakfast waffles and  other goodies they have. The inside is cheery and I wish I could remember the servers name, she is Korean, she was a delight and made my experience that much better. I also like that there are tables outside if you wish to eat al freco!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was good and service is okay. My husband got a Hawaiian pizza and breakfast sandwich; I got a regular waffle and fruit sandwich. I asked for no whipped cream but still got it on the sandwich when it was brought to me but it was easy to scrape off.  Not sure what the punch cards at the front are for since we weren't offered or given one. Maybe it's for the beverages.   I love my fruit sandwich and would be happy to come again."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and very well priced! They serve specialty breakfasts that you wouldn't think of, like a waffle breakfast sandwich! The staff was very attentive and friendly. Great place!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service wasn't the best. We ordered our food and that came pretty quick. They forgot our drinks and my husband let the girl at the register know. She said they were behind and she will give us our drinks when she can. There were only 2 people sitting down, beside us. There were more people working in the back, and if you can't take care of your current customers, you shouldn't take in more customers."}
{"text":"Mm great waffles and choices. Had the breakfast one and bought a chicken sandwich for later. Great service and nice people"}
{"text":"This was a great breakfast stop! A little out of the way of the Vegas congestion, but perfect stop on our way out of town. I had a waffle sandwich, consisting of a waffle folded in half, stuffed with fresh fruit and whipped cream. My husband had a peanut butter nutella waffle. Both were fabulous."}
{"text":"Great food, super nice staff and more than willing to explain the menu and process. Very clean and fast service!"}
{"text":"I got a lot of hype about this place and it was good. It was not the best ever like a lot of people told me but, I will again for a second opinion. I had the Jimi's waffle and it was tasty. Kinda expensive and I hate paper plates and plastic untensils for things I have to cut."}
{"text":"First time here, their waffle is soooooooo good , very soft inside crispy outside yummy. I will come back"}
{"text":"Cute place, orange walls, and slow jams in the background. What more can you ask for? As the name implies, it serves waffles in every way imaginable; waffle sandwiches, waffle pizzas, flaxseed waffles, you name it. What I love about this place is that you get to choose the type of waffle and toppings you would like. I've been here twice and my fave is the original waffle with strawberries, nutella, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. The flaxseed waffle is also good for all you healthy folks. They also have a breakfast special which is $5.49 for a waffle, bacon or sausage, eggs, and bottomless coffee. It's a great deal and the waffle is big. I did try the waffle sandwich which had ham, eggs, and bacon and some sort of sweet mystery sauce inside. To be honest, waffles taste good with about anything. The staff is very friendly and the place is small and intimate. So if you're craving waffles, keep this place in mind! P.S. Get a waffles stamp card"}
{"text":"I guess I'm a fan again after a few positive again experiences. I also think now that they are doing combos, makes it for a fast, tasty and cheap meal option of a waffle breakfast, sandwich (with chips), waffle pizza,  etc. with a drink for under $7.   My favorite thing to get is breakfast waffle sandwiches (egg, cheese, ham, bacon) which makes for a good bit of savory and sweet. I pour some syrup in mine. The crinkle cut kettle chips are possibly homemade? These are plain, but good. They let me do ice tea as my beverage which is fresh brewed. They also added a water dispenser which is welcoming since I like to drink a lot while eating. My one negative thing is I liked their chicken sandwiches before, except now it seems they use ready made grilled strips. *womp, womp*   Still, I do like their fluffy style waffles here. It's different from what is usual, but it's a good kind of different. Definitely a plus I can come here in the afternoon and can order breakfast. I love not waking up early just to grab breakfast/brunch and deal with crowds on top of that."}
{"text":"I was really excited by the idea of this place. Sadly the food was just okay. It is just not worth the price to me. The waffle sandwiches are TINY.   I had a pumpkin waffle which was yummy but blow my mind in any way. I took it home to eat and it was already soggy and cold by the time I made it home a few miles away.   Sadly this place just wasn't as exciting as it could be."}
{"text":"Waffles, waffles, wafffffles!  Pretty much everything here has something to do with waffles.  Waffle sammiches,  desserty waffle sundaes, and waffle pizzas?!  You really have to appreciate the innovativeness of the owners of this place!  The waffles are really good.  It has a good crisp to the outside and its soft in the inside which is what a waffle should be!  The breakfast sandwich is awesome.  It's like all your favorite breakfast items in one bite!  Waffles, bacon, sausage (it came with ham, but I swapped it out for sausage), egg.  It comes with their special sauce, which you can opt to get it on the side.   I can't put my finger on what the sauce is, but I don't like it - its taste makes me feel weird.  I'd much rather drench the sandwich with syrup, but that's just me.  Also try the Yooni's special - it's pretty delicious.  It has your basic sundae toppings all over it.  Ice cream, strawberries, bananas, whip cream, chocolate sauce.  At $7+, I think it's a bit pricey.  I kept thinking to myself... I have a waffle maker, I can just make this at home!  Anyway, it was still delicious.    The place is small with can pose an issue for the busy weekend mornings.    The ambience is OK... I really like to orange walls and white furniture.  But I hate the fluorescent lighting in there and the floors look dingy.    That doesn't affect the quality of the food and service though.  Just sayin!     We will definitely be coming back here for their reasonably priced breakfast combo (5.49 for a regular waffle, eggs, coffee, and bacon or sausage).  Might even get one of the specialty waffles for a dessert after dinner one day (too much sugar for breakfast for me!).  Plus, its always good to support local business!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Sacramento and we Yelped up this place for breakfast. In a word... outstanding. Best waffles we've ever eaten. The scrambled eggs were delicious. The bacon? LOOKED flat and unimpressive, but it, too, was delicious. Coffee came with our meals and was excellent. As we ate, the wall-mounted menu taunted me with a picture of a luscious-looking waffle pizza. Waffle pizza? Yup. Sounds strange, but looked mouth-watering. I hope to give it a try before we leave. If I do, I'll give you an update. The people were real sweeties, too."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore you, WaffleS Cafe! That's why we're MySpace friends!!!!!  My friend kept on raving about WaffleS Cafe since they opened, and she went  there at least THREE times a week in the early days. After having tried it, I totally understand now.   HAWAIIAN WAFFLE PIZZA: It's just a regular pizza--there's the tomato sauce, the cheese, and ham and pineapples....ON TOP OF A WAFFLE!!! served hot...absolutely delicious!  FRUIT SANDWICH (w/ nutella, strawberries, and whipped cream): Nutella? Strawberries? WC? What's not to like? Then, it's secured in a light, fluffy waffle... Wowowowowowowowow WOW"}
{"text":"My cousin brought me here for the first time and I see why she is so devoted to this beautiful place. The people that work in there and run it to begin with are phenomenal!!! Add that on top of having a deliciously tasting assortment of waffles makes my taste buds and heart go crazy! I am a waffle fanatic by the way so a place like this is a slice of heaven.   I was very basic and ordered the classic breakfast (waffle, bacon/sausage, eggs). The waffle was good, don't get me wrong omg I've NEVER been served beautiful and hot eggs!!! I can't even keep my eggs that hot when I cook them myself... I'm hating lol. I also ordered a pineapple and peach smoothie (yasssss). I ordered a raspberry white chocolate waffle to go.   A thoughtful gesture, they waited on cooking my waffle order to go. It was brought out when it looked like we were getting ready to leave. Being the conversationalist that I am, we didn't leave right away which was totally fine. When we did decide to get up and leave, one of the employees says that she'll make me a fresh order. I'm like nooooo that's ok, this will be fine. She continued and then the guy explained how they wanted me to have a more fresh order. My heart filled with even more joy. That was going well above and beyond the expectations of customer service.  Granted I still had about two more stops before I got home, however these waffles were both perfectly fine despite my rough handling of my bags. This place will continue to receive my business and I hope wherever reads this will go and support this particular location of Waffles Cafe as well. There's more that I can add onto this review as of why I  it so much but I'm getting ready to dig into one of my waffles ."}
{"text":"First time at this WaffleS. I usually drop into the one on Fort Apache and Trop but was meeting a friend for lunch. Ordered the usual: breakfast sandwich special with chips and a drink.  Breakfast sandwich is still amazing. I could eat that everyday. Still holding back on that 5th star due to the fact that they still don't have any other options except potato chips as a side. I want hash browns or tater tots or something!  Anyway, the moral of my story is that you should go here and eat a breakfast waffle sandwich. I haven't had anything else yet. The service at this location was friendly as well."}
{"text":"3rd trip here and I'm still loving it. Had the breakfast sandwich again and it was awesome. Waffles are perfect and the service is great. Wish I could bump this up to 5 stars but they really need more sides besides potato chips."}
{"text":"The waffles were cooked perfectly, the girl behind the counter came out and explained the menu very thorough. Fresh fruit bowl with turkey bacon accompanied my pumpkin waffle drizzled with pecan syrup. Good food overall at a decent price."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy. But delicious in every way.  I came here with an open mind, to see what all the hype was about. It was a Wednesday morning so no one was in there but me, and I had the coffee all to myself, woot woot! They even have my favorite creamers there, vanilla and hazlenut. YUUUUSSS!  Price range is neat, $6 for a big ass waffle, eggs and bacon. The waffle was amazing in my book, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Eggs. They were eggs. Bacon kinda looked dry and stale to me, which disappointed me at first, but I guess it had a jerky texture to it, so in the end it wasn't that bad at all.  I like how everything is served on disposable utensils. From the paper plates to the plastic forks. I'm an odd germy-phobe, so to not have to worry about whether the dishes were washed properly definitely lifted my spirits.  I saw they had some sort of waffle pizza on the menu, which I really want to come back a try."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new place for brunch because usually I have sunday brunches at home.  My fiance and I were greeted by Jeff, who is very friendly and helpful. He noticed it was our first time there and helped us choose our meals.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich and Chris ordered the breakfast special.  The menu is pretty easy to understand and there are pictures on the wall to help you as well.  The waffles were sooo good. I'm usually not a waffle person, but these ones were just right: buttery, a lil sweet, soft. I LOVE the breakfast sandwich, my bacon was just the right crispiness and cooked to my liking.  Chris enjoyed his meal and he snuck a couple bites of my sandwich.  The cafe was clean, the staff was fryiendly and best of all the food is good! Can't wait to try a dessert waffle, waffle pizza or the other waffle sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Great service, very friendly staff and knows what's good here .. plus they are very eco friendly big plus for me"}
{"text":"My BLT was great. I ordered chicken and waffle for my son but I ended up moving in on that as well. #SorryNotSorry"}
{"text":"I would go back for the waffle sandwich and for the guy that took our order, but both orders of our regular waffles were hard, dry, and cold. Some of the side options, like sausage, are a little overpriced for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"Service was good but the waffles were not good at all. No flavor whatsoever. Id say good prices had I been excited about my food. Overall, mediocre at best"}
{"text":"For the 3 years that I've lived and worked in this area - I finally decided to come here for my birthday breakfast. I have no idea why I haven't come here before. I remember someone telling me that it was \"ok\" and it's \"just waffles\".   No sir, this is not just waffles. These are delightful, crispy, amazing waffles. I love them so much, so so so much.   I got the organic waffle with - Strawberries Peanut Butter Chocolate Chips Bananas Almonds   - I used the sugar free syrup, and to my surprise, it was amazing. They do have real maple syrup if you're looking for a sugar high.   I really could not get over how good these were. Probably because I'm on pretty strict clean diet and I don't have too many amazing cheat meals like this. But good god...It was worth it.   The service was awesome - the only thing is they forgot my kiwi's...but I don't even care. I really don't.   If you drive by this place and you're wondering if you should try it out, yes. You should. Especially if you're a waffle lover, like myself."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with the waffles. They were very thin and airy almost like a wafer. No substance taste or texture. Thank God for the strawberries or we would have been starving,  Eggo waffles are better"}
{"text":"Waffles were pretty darn amazing!  They have unique flavors like pumpkin and red velvet.  The woman behind the counter had amazing customer service! Smiling and enthusiastic.  It was my first time there and she explained how the menu worked.  Considering they have so many options, it loved her explanation of the waffles and what types of combos you can get.  Pumpkin waffle with nutella, coconut and bananas were amazing.  Oreo milkshake could have had a little more oreo in it.  Overall, one waffle with toppings was extremely filling!  A little steep on the prices....but good breakfast!"}
{"text":"Waffle Cafe is one of those little restaurants in a small plaza that people overlook.  If you see it, I recommend you give it a try. The sandwiches here are really good because they add that special sauce (secret recipe) to every sandwich they make that gives it a sweet flavor to it. I like the chicken sandwich but you can't go wrong with any of them. You can even have them replace the regular waffle with chocolate waffles if you want your food to be sweeter.  The smoothies here are ok. The coconut is my favorite and this is the first place I've ever tried a coconut smoothie so I can't really say if other places are better. They also have several desserts to choose from as well, all placed on top of their waffles.  Everything here is basically substituted with a waffle (pizza. sandwich, etc). Only if they would add fried chicken to the menu, this place would be the ultimate sh*t, the lil' Roscoes Chicken & Waffles of Vegas!"}
{"text":"Waffles waffles waffles this place is amazing if you are a waffle lover. They have every type of waffle and topping you can think of. You can create your own or try one of their favorites. I had the chicken and waffles that was fantastic. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. A must stop if your are in the area. Waffles!!"}
{"text":"The family who run the cafe are really friendly and the waffles are light and crispy so I don't feel like dying after the meal! It's relatively close to red rocks national park, so i ended up getting breakfast here almost every morning."}
{"text":"I went here afte checking the reviews and it was close. This place is ok I usually give spots another chance so I will update soon but for now I really wasnt amazed. I had a waffle breakfast sandwich and it tasted like something i couldve made at home."}
{"text":"Update!  Seems like they listened to some of our complaints, and finally added some background music!  It is very subtle, but really makes the environment more welcoming.  Service was friendly as always, and the place is clean!  The reason why it got the review bump.....the breakfast sandwich!  It came with eggs, bacon and etc inside a waffle sandwich!  The portion was good for the price ($5.99), and the taste was very good.  As you know already from reading the other reviews, the waffles here are great, so it works together perfectly and is nice and clean on the hands.  Check out the pic :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/waffles-cafe-las-vegas-2?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#-N2RRW15OVLymuWeMRpgug  Also, because it is a sandwich, I couldn't complain about the paper plates or plastic silverware lol.  I think I will order their sandwiches from now on!  Give it a try :)"}
{"text":"Ok, this review is for the Korean BBQ Waffle and the differences I saw between this location and their Durango location.  Korean BBQ Waffle ($8.95): Top Sirloin Beef marinated in Korean seasonings. This is essentially a Bulgogi Waffle, but the meat was too thick, tough, and not full of flavor. Also, the waffle is not as \"done\" as the other location, and it isn't the reason WHY I go to the other location....the amazing waffles!  Would not recommend at all.   I tried the Large Peach Smoothie with Boba ($5.29). This is pretty good.  I like their boba here.  Comparing my favorite item here, Jeff's Favorite / Sweet P ($6.95): Pumpkin Waffle, Apple Pie Filling, Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel and Cinnamon.

More pics :"}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  If your near North Las Vegas you need to stop here!  Highly recommended to all!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, great food at good prices, and many healthy options! It is nice to fontina breakfast place that has gluten free options!"}
{"text":"If you like waffles, then this place might worth the drive for you if your either here for the weekend in Vegas or just happen to live in the area.   Yoonies favorite is probably the most colorful and best looking waffle. Look at the picture for yourself. It will put anyone with a sweet tooth into submission.   I was lucky and fat enough to try 4 different waffles here.   1. The Ham and Bacon Waffle Sandwich.  2. The Yoonies Favorite.  3. Jeffs Favorite 4. The one with bananas, caramel, and white chocolate. lol.   All of them were delicious. It takes quite a while for them to make it because obviously they spend time on the presentation.   The Ham and Bacon Waffle Sandwich was good but different. The special sauce made the gf want to vomit. I thought it was tasty.   Yoonies favorite was delicious w/ the whipped cream, loved the ice cream of course, but I wish the chocolate was replaced with caramel instead.   Jeffs favorite came with cinnamon apples, caramel, whipped cream and ice cream. Pretty good but not a fan of cinnamon apples.   The one with bananas, caramel, and white chocolate was by far the best in my book. Kept simple, but tasted so good.   No need to  worry on a limited selection since you can go ahead and create your very own waffle. Watch what you mix here though, some things just dont go well together.   Glad I tried it at least once. Now I know what Waffles Cafe is all about."}
{"text":"When it comes to breakfast places around the valley, the hype is hit or miss. For WaffleS Cafe, definitely a miss. Ever since we purchased the Groupon, my brother and I have been pushing back coming here for weeks now. Before I left for Seattle, I was resolute about coming here, yet I'm not impressed with our visit.  I ordered the Alexa's: strawberry waffle topped with both fresh strawberries and strawberry ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. For the drink, a milk tea always wins. My brother ordered the Yooni's: bananas, strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup atop an organic flax waffle (subbed for the original for a dollar more). Sticking to his blatant love for all things Asian, he ordered the Taro tea. The wait seemed a bit much, with not much attention paid towards us in the meantime.   After devouring our plates, we agreed: we loved parts of both, but not the entire thing. My waffle was absolutely delicious: subtly sweet with enough strawberry flavor. The fruit was clearly fresh, but the overall flavor combination wasn't enough to tempt me for a second visit. However, my milk tea was sweet enough to cause a cavity upon first sip. The boba was perfect: chewy and addictive.   What left a worse taste in my mouth was the service. The owner was cordial enough towards the two of us, but seemed extraordinarily accommodating towards every customer thereafter. I would come back only to try the savory sandwiches or even the waffle pizzas, but as for the hype, I just don't see it."}
{"text":"Customer service was great, and the place was nice inside, and great prices but I just didn't like the food.   My fiance got a Waffle pizza and I got an Original with raspberries. I added some eggs and bacon along with it.  I tasted some of my fiance's pizza and you could taste the frozen veggies.. Not for us."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I would normally eat at Denny's on Tropicana and Fort Apache for breakfast as a treat.  But, their price doesn't match their quality of food.  We tend to feel robbed after dining in.  For a while when going to Walmart or Burger King in this area, I would always wonder about Waffles Cafe.  Last week, while unpacking to settle in our new our apartment I had decided to get us some breakfast from this little dive breakfast joint.  I ordered two Breakfast Specials which included:  Waffles with banana, whip cream, powdered sugar sprinkled on top, and maple syrup on the side; Scrambled eggs, bacon, and added sausage for an additional $1.  With this, I got a free coffee.  To substitute it with orange juice, it's another $1.  All in all, I spent about $18 plus tip.  This is a good price compared to spending around $35 at Denny's.  When I got home, my boyfriend was pleasantly surprised after he opened his container of food.  His waffles had strawberries sprinkled with powdered sugar and maple syrup on the side.  When he started eating the sausage, eggs, and bacon, the look on his face was priceless.  I agreed with his look as I was biting in to my food.  Everything tasted perfect.  Normally, the sausage is something that is just blah.  This sausage actually had meat.  It wasn't the dinky little kind that Denny's serves.  The bacon was crispy and crunchy, not too oily just how bacon should be made.  The waffles that came with the meal topped it off nicely.   As I was spreading the butter on my waffles, my boyfriend made a comment on how great everything was.  After I let the maple syrup drop all over the waffles, I dove right in.  I couldn't believe how much I loved it.  The taste is comparable to getting a new bra in Victoria Secret - EXCITING, NEW, AND UNFORGETTABLE.  I've never really eaten waffles as much as I would pancakes.  After this experience, I've been converted.  I would definitely take their waffles over any pancakes any day.  We'll be here more often for breakfast.  Mmm-mmm-mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"This place is Waffle euphoria from traditional to contemporary. I ordered the blazing chicken and waffle sandwich. It was so good I ordered one to go. I wish they had it in NY. The staff was friendly and very helpful. She gave an overview of the entire menu highlighting the more popular items including her favorites."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and waffles and homemade grits.  Can't get enough.  My wife and I come in every weekend.  The owner, Kim, is very friendly and attentive. Great service and great food. Can wait to be back!"}
{"text":"We have only been here once, but we can't wait to take he whole family back and try many other items on their menu.   I'm not sure if this was first a food truck, but it gives me that impression. The menu is a big plastic banner sign and they serve everything on paper plates. (Save money on dishwashers, I guess!)   The staff that helped us was very kind and helpful. Everything that we saw on other people's plates looked amazing.   We both got a breakfast sandwich. Yum! I couldn't finish it, but enjoyed the half that I ate."}
{"text":"The service is over the top excellent. The food was good enough to warrant a 5 star review coupled with excellent service. I would recommend this location!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews... I am glad they were CLOSED when we went there today. Signs in the windows say that they are closed with no expected opening date"}
{"text":"The name does not lie as pretty much the only food item on the menu is waffleS. Waffle pizzas, waffle sandwiches (breakfast and lunch varieties), waffle sundaes and waffle waffles. There are different waffle flavors, including pumpkin and chocolate, and then there are the toppings which include cherry pie filling, nuts, peanut butter, and ice cream to name just a few of the sweeter options. They also have boba teas and smoothies.   I was a bit bummed that they did not offer soysage because that prevents the vegetarians among us from taking advantage of the breakfast special: waffle, eggs, bacon or sausage, and coffee for $5.49. The vibe is so youthful and forward that I assumed they just must have some alternative meat options, but alas, I was wrong.   The space is definitely cute with orange walls and mod, white plastic furniture. It is small, only about 10 tables, and it is counter service. Because it is so small, I would not bring a brood of children here, as it can get crazy quickly in such a compact area. I was surprised, as I had imagined a bigger more restauranty place, but I was not disappointed with the atmosphere. The servers were all cheerful and patient with us newcomers who must have stared at the wall for 5-minutes trying to grasp all of the possible combinations and debating what we wanted: \"You really think that cherry pie filling and ice cream is too much sugar for breakfast?\"  Ultimately, we went pretty simple with plain waffles and a side of peanut butter. (I am one of those who puts peanut butter on every griddle breakfast item.) The waffles were tasty, crispy and featured nice, deep griddle holes (crucial for quality waffles). At $7 for two waffles it might be a little pricey, especially when you can catch the breakfast buffet at lots of places for around that, but I am still giving WaffleS 4-stars. It might be a very objective 3-star culinary experience, but I am giving it a bonus star for being so devoted to waffles. In my little world, devotion is worth one bonus star."}
{"text":"Out with my kids and decided to get some late breakfast this morning. I've seen Waffles Cafe before and been curious about the food/concept. Our experience was pretty mixed. Cons: menu is confusing and \"building your own combo\" takes a hot minute to figure out. Are we in a Boba place or a milkshake place or a Waffle place? Are we better at breakfast or lunch? Slightly confusing.  Bathroom is dingy, maybe just unkept?, and waffle wasn't hot when served (butter-didn't-melt unhot). Brand feels a little confused somewhere between fast food and mom and pop diner. Fancy waffle around $7-$9 (for just the waffle). Syrup was thin and sweet, not very maple-y, as I had hoped for a waffle place. If you just order a simple waffle with syrup, I think you'd be disappointed. Pros: fruit bowl came with fresh mangos, pineapples and blueberries (amazing fruit bowl). Sandwiches and kids meal come with side/drink. \"Coffee bar\" and hot sauce bar had nice assortment. Most enjoyable was A.J. She greeted us, took our order and was incredibly friendly and informative. She saved our experience, which dependent on the food/cost, wasn't overly impressive.  We ordered mostly breakfast items and if we were to return might try the lunch/brunch items. I have a feeling those might be stronger than the breakfast items we ordered."}
{"text":"Always fresh delicious and healthy waffles as well as a full assortment for breakfast and lunch. A must for locals!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEES KNEES! We ordered the breakfast sandwich and a regular waffle with strawberries and apple pie filling. Who would have thought apple pie filling on a waffle would be THAT delicious! Deff going to be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"#86 After an eventful, exciting, and tiring experience at TAO the night before, we decided we wanted something delicious, hearty, and healthy for brunch. We looked up waffle places in the area and came across WaffleS Cafe. It was going to be a bit of a drive out (we were staying at the Stratosphere), but we figured it was worth it based on the reviews online. When we got there, we were a bit underwhelmed since it seemed like we'd just driven back into suburbia, with WaffleS Cafe situated in your typical suburban shopping center.   However, walking in, we were pleased. =) The place was cute, with plenty of pink to go around. The interior decor could have and should be ramped up, but who's to complain, really. We ordered one order of the Tuna Sandwich waffle and another Original one where we added sweet toppings. The prices weren't terrible (and, really, something that I miss being in Philly) and the quality was great. The carbs were exactly what we needed to cure the hangovers and it was nice to see families coming and going.   Not sure if I'd ever be able to make it back here, save for those few and far between trips to Vegas, but I'm giving this place a thumbs' up!"}
{"text":"Word is they shop for fresh ingredients locally three times a week to hand make quality waffles daily.    It sure tasted like it!    I had the pumpkin waffle with Nutella topping.  Light crunch on the outside and fluffy inside.  I also enjoyed the original waffle with whipped cream, powdered sugar, and topped with caramel sauce.   My waffle was part of a breakfast special which came with eggs, bacon, and unlimited coffee....Perfect way to start the day!    It felt a little stuffy in this small cafe, but I got used to it.  Staff was very polite and helpful, especially with the free wi-fi.   I've got my eye on the waffle sandwiches or the waffle pizza for my next visit."}
{"text":"After a long morning of fasting, having blood drawn, and sitting at the DMV, my husband and I were STARVING on Thursday morning, and decided to look up someplace nearby for breakfast.    Pulling up my trusty Yelp app, I located Waffles Cafe, and we decided to check it out.   Upon entering, we were greeted warmly by Kim, who I found out a little later is the owner.  She asked if we'd been in before, and after finding out that we hadn't, let us know that if we had questions about the menu, to just ask, and she's more than happy to help.    The menu is big, but not too overwhelming.  I had a hard time picking because everything looked wonderful.   We decided on:  Chicken and waffles for my fella, and the \"create your own\" waffle combo for me.   I've seen a couple reviews knocking the place because they use paper plates and plastic utensils, but it didn't bother me at all.  At least the plates/cups are biodegradable.    The thing is, this isn't a fancy restaurant or a chain like Ihop or Denny's.  Its super cute, super clean (like...she wipes down the hot sauce bottles after they've been used), and cozy.  I'm not so pretentious to be bothered by eating off paper plates.    I also ordered a taro boba drink, which was heavenly.  Boba was the perfect consistency.    When the food arrived, everything was HOT.  Like...I burned my mouth on the grits, hot.    Fella's chicken and waffles were good.  We're 99% sure that the chicken is breaded in house and not store bought.  They were tasty.  Not greasy at ALL, which thrilled me.   The chicken came with this sauce...we think its a honey mustard type base with hot sauce, and it is DELICIOUS.  I'd eat this all day long.  Fella's waffle was really good too.    I opted for the \"create your own\" waffle combo.  This is exciting, because there are at least 5 or 6 different waffle bases for you to choose from: Original, Gluten free, Red Velvet, Chia Seed, Flax seed...SO many to choose from!   For Thursday's visit, I chose the original batter, with pecans.  (there were LOTS of other toppings, but I was in the mood for simple)  The combo comes with 2 sides and a drink.  I chose bacon, grits, and did my boba slushie, with an upgrade charge.    So the waffle itself comes with powdered sugar and whipped cream.  We had regular syrup too.  The waffle was really good.  Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside...perfect.    The grits were burn your mouth hot, but delicious.  Best grits I've had in ages, truth be told.  Throw in a little butter (which it came with on the side)...mmmm.  I was in heaven.  The bacon was cooked well.  I wish there was more than 2 pieces to a side, but I think that's pretty standard for \"sides\" of bacon at other places too.  Who doesn't want more bacon all the time anyway?    We were checked on a couple of times, but not too many.  Service really was top notch.    I definitely plan to return, there are lots of items on the menu that I want to try out!!"}
{"text":"I was in Summerlin running errands (a rare occurance for me!) and logged onto mobile yelp to find a restaurant. Waffles popped up and I'm so glad it did!   First off, it's family owned and the people working there are all very sweet and caring. It was dinner time, but that didn't stop us from wanting waffles- why can't waffles be a dinner food too? We tried the waffle hawaiian pizza, the breakfast sandwich, and a waffle with chocolate chips, caramel and whipped cream. The pizza was so cute and creative. They bake it in the oven so the cheese gets nice and melty. I really loved it. Fiance seemed to love his sandwich and the dessert waffle was awesome.   I liked that they had some flavored batters (pumpkin, chocolate, flax-soy). However, I wish they could put some toppings IN the batter. Like say bacon in the batter or chocolate chips in the batter, etc. I think that would greatly improve things!  Prices were relatively reasonable for what it is! I wish it wasn't so freaking far away - I never go to Summerlin."}
{"text":"Definitely creative use of waffles. I wasn't overly impressed with my meal but others with me were. Worth a try but not my thing!"}
{"text":"Seriously I  just had the simple breakfast special with a waffle, 2 eggs, and turkey sausage.... BOMB. And the cashier was kind as well!"}
{"text":"Went this morning for first time even though it is not that far from my house (maybe 10 or so mins). I thought the set up and the food were great. The menu was on the wall, then ordered at the counter, got my self serve coffee, and the food was brought out like 5 mins later. For 6.50 tax included, I got the breakfast special-a waffle, 2 strips of crispy bacon, 2 eggs and coffee. The bacon and eggs were gravy, the star was the waffle-more crispy with the inside softness more so towards the middle/center of the waffle. Everything tasted fresh and not processed. The waffle was so good that I ordered a second. I left an hour later relaxed, full and completely satisfied.  I was a bit weary to eat off paper plates and plastic utensils (as I had read this in other reviews and as a rule do not like to) but, the experience was so good that it didn't bother me at all, almost didn't notice it."}
{"text":"I remember when Waffles Cafe was located in a shopping area by Tropicana and Fort Apache. A couple years passed and it had moved to this location on N Durango. I was surprised that it had moved from a busy, high traffic neighborhood to a random quiet plaza in the north west. It was always busy in the old location and the food never disappointed.   Since they've moved, I've only gone to this location 2 times. While the food is still great, it feels so depressing inside knowing how quiet and dead it is in this location. They really need to move back to the SW side of town."}
{"text":"This place was super close to our friends house. Even if I stayed on the strip, I would make the trip out. It's a nice clean place. I'm not to sure if it's family owned or not. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast sand which. I was rather hungry so I got the strawberry&banana waffle sand which plus a breakfast special. Yes! I ate it all! Service was fast. The staff was super nice! Food came out pretty fast. Oh! And they have boba tea! Waffles were a good size and fluffy with the right about of crisp to them. And they have a bathroom on site, in case you wanna get \"lost\"  So overall. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"I tried was bored with the usual breakfast places and searched on Yelp for a highly rated place, it was right across the street from me!  When I walked in I wasnt sure how the process worked b/c everyone working there was busy making batter..  I soon found out that you order like a fast food joint and sit down, then they bring the food out to you.    I just asked them what the most popular was, the recommended the breakfast sandwich, and i can see why.  I was unusual to have a breakfast sandwich with waffles as the bread, but it was awesome.  Only problem was the side.. plain potato chips, weird..  I could have ate two of them b/c i as pretty hungry.    I am going to frequent based on price!  Open from 0600-5pm"}
{"text":"Yum would definitely go here again! I had the waffle chicken sandwich with the special buffalo sauce. So good!"}
{"text":"Ehh... It was ok. More like a waffle shop than a cafe. Waffles were ok. They go crazy with waffles, similar to all the fillings you'd find in crepes - fruits, meats, pizza stuffing, etc... Only bad thin is it's located at the end of Vegas, kinda far, not worth the long trip (or gas)! Found hair in our eggs, although the guy was very nice and made new eggs, still a bit gross. Maybe they should wear hair nets. Likely won't eat there again, but the service was decent."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Banana Split - Chocolate Waffle with Banana, Ice Cream, Chocolate Sauce, Almond, Sprinkles, Whipped Cream ($8.19) The Sweet P - Pumpkin Waffle, Apple Pie Filling, Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Cinnamon ($7.95)  Located in Centennial and another long-term member of my breakfast 'to-do' list it was finally on Saturday Morning after a stop at the new Al's Donuts and Café Burger that I decided to stop by Waffles Café and although a suspicious server inquiring as to why I was taking pictures of the wall-mounted menu was a touch off-putting the food itself proved well worth the trip.  Every bit a 'locals only' sort of spot, hidden in a small strip-mall on the East side of North Durango, it was just after 7:30am that I entered the brightly lit space and finding myself to be the restaurant's only patron until a family of four arrived at eight o'clock both order and service were expedited, the mother and sons team chatting amongst themselves in the kitchen while I watched Obama address the Iraq situation via wall-mounted LCD in back.  Obviously content in sticking to the waffle-centric theme with a menu entailing options either sandwiched or standard it was only after substantial debate that I eventually settled on two of the items listed under \"Specials\" and declining further customization beyond making my Banana Split base chocolate I'm happy to say both piping hot options proved divine, the mountainous split's base harkening the flavor of hot cocoa beneath ripe bananas while the Sweet P's supple crumb was soaked through with cinnamon spiced apples and a liberal ladle of caramel for a decidedly sweet experience just barely reined in by the slowly melting ice cream."}
{"text":"Ah waffles, they are for people who has texture problems. Like people who can't eat pancake because it tastes like a gop of syrup or basically a sugary sponge. Well, fear no more! You can have nice crispy edges from the Waffle Cafe.   This place is homey. I mean, really homey. By that I mean you get regular Ruffles chips with your order. You get something like a George Foreman grilled chicken breast if you want the chicken with your waffles, which is what I had. So pretty much, its everything you can make at home. But if you don't want the mess and want something quick and really simple, come here. The people are nice, they serve boba, which is a plus but I haven't tried. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"A great lil joint. Awesome people always smiling and making sure they get ur meal/drink just perfect. I went in there to order something but they had never made it the way I tried it years back in a diff state but that didn't stop them, they wanted to create it for me and they did. Great service"}
{"text":"Best waffles ever! Light, crispy & yummy. This is a \"no frills\" Mom & Pop place. Great staff. Suggest the breakfast special. My boyfriend have been back to this place several times."}
{"text":"Second time here. Had the turkey club sandwich. I love how waffles are used in place of bread!!! Friendly staff. Very inexpensive"}
{"text":"After a good nite sleep Ben rushed us to WaffleS. which was quite a journey considering its not down the strip and its actually in the normal part of LasVegas  we pulled into a fairly empty plaza and went into the small but cute WaffleS.  you head up to the counter and you order one of the prefixed waffles or you create your own from the extra friendly waiter/cook/owner? they also have waffle sandwiches and meals where it comes with a side of bacon/sausage & eggs  my waffle was supposed to consist of a coffee waffle, caramel, white chocolate & bananas.. & hannah's waffle was a plain waffle with marshmellows, nutella, peanut butter, whip cream and some other craazy mess.  however!!! our waffles mustve got switched up cuz i got plain and she got coffee =( which totally sucks for hannah because she hates coffee and it was actually NOT good.(stick with plain) poor girl.  everyone loved their order...hello its like everything u want for breakfast that your mama wont let u have! waffle with chocolate caramel syrup with more sugary toppings with a scoop of icecream who wouldnt love it?   again its by preference (since ben LOVED it )but the sauce in the ham & bacon waffle sandwich did NOT work for me. at all. literally made me gag. its like a slightly sweet thick olive oil-ish concoction ; makes my mouth water (in the bad way) just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"great little breakfast spot! food is very good. prices are more reasonable. staff is friendly. I had the waffle sandwich. nothing fancy wich is great. just a good place for good food."}
{"text":"It was just okay. I came here with a few friends and was kind of underwhelmed.  I ordered the chicken and waffle and the chicken was obviously a frozen chicken was the premade chicken you would buy in the frozen aisle of the grocery store. it was tasteless. probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I'd pick waffles over pancakes any day (although I frequent a pancake establishment only because it's close to my office).  Waffles cafe has smoothies, boba tea, hot tea, waffle sandwich, waffle pizza and the good ol' waffles.  They have specials:  Breakfast for $5.99: waffle + egg+ bacon OR sausage + unlimited coffee OR add $1 for other drinks.  Lunch for $6.49: waffle sandwich + chips + soda OR waffle pizza + soda  The Sweet P for $6.95: pumpkin waffle with apple pie filling + vanilla ice cream + caramel + cinnamon  Short Cake Split for $7.45: original waffle + strawberry + banana + vanilla ice cream + chocolate sauce  Banana Split for $6.69: banana + ice cream + chocolate sauce + almond + sprinkles + whipped cream  You can also create your own waffle from $3.95-8.95 (choose from original, oat, flax, chocolate, pumpkin) and add toppings from 75 cents-$1 (walnut, pecan, strawberry, sprinkles, peanut butter, Nutella, chocolate chips, marshmallows, Reese's chips, chocolate sauce, M&M's, caramel sauce, coconut, banana, kiwi, mango, peach, blueberry, raspberry, apple pie filling, cherry pie filling) or maybe get a side of bacon, sausage, egg or wheat toast for $1.50.  I built my own waffle. I had the original with Nutella + strawberries + mangoes. They added powdered sugar and whipped cream on top.  Since I already have Nutella, I didn't put any syrup on my waffle.  The syrups they have include maple, sugar, boysenberry, etc.  Food is served on a paper plate and they'll give you a plastic fork and knife. The downside to that is it's not too appealing but I guess the good thing about that is if you want to take your food to-go, you can just put foil on top and voila!"}
{"text":"Skip.  Friendly service and free Wi-Fi but the food was nothing special. The kiddos didn't like the waffles (what kid doesn't like waffles???) Go to Baby Stacks instead."}
{"text":"The people were great. The food was good  Actually more filling then I thought. Small place so be willing to take to go. The kid portions were big enough for two kids or one adult. Love a family business."}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pop type place with excellent chicken and waffles and even better customer service."}
{"text":"I love this place. The chicken tenders and waffle were great. The potato scramble was also good. Will def be going back"}
{"text":"First time at Waffles Cafe, we've heard great things and we love breakfast. First impressions, clean restaurant albeit empty! Friendly staff at the counter. We had the littles with us so we ordered a double order of the original waffles with whipped cream and strawberries, a chocolate chip waffle, and a ham and bacon waffle sandwich. It's a seat yourself joint, so we picked a table and grabbed some booster seats. Hubby grabbed his coffee at the self serve coffee bar and I grabbed my water. About 10 minutes after placing our order we got our food. They forgot our Littles chocolate milk and it took a second to get them. The food was hot the waffles crisp and fluffy on the inside. But it wasn't mind blowing. They forgot no tomatoes on the sandwich and it was just very underwhelming for the price. I think this place is best for dessert waffles."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great food. Great Service. Even better prices.   At breakfast, I have a hard time deciding between a sweet or savory meal. French Toast or Hashbrowns? Waffles or Bacon & Eggs? Well, at Waffles I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich which satisfied both of my desires. Bacon & Eggs sandwiched between a Waffle with a sweet sauce to tie it all together.  It was DELICIOUS! I was completely satisfied when finished - probably because I got the best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"I got pumpkin waffle with turkey sausage and eggs, it was pretty good. I really liked the fluffy waffles with blueberries. The waffles are warm and berries were fresh. Definitely will be coming back for waffles. Also, very friendly and accommodating staff."}
{"text":"Whenever I get a hankering for breakfast food, do I go to Denny's or Ihop?  Nay, nay, I head on over to the Waffles Cafe.  The owners are super cool, the food is awesome, and they play great music.  If it's not too busy, sometimes one of the servers busts out his guitar!  Recommendations:  1) Breakfast waffle sandwich- ham, scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese and the house sauce all nestled in one delicious, homemade waffle.  It comes with chips as well!  2) Breakfast special- if you are in the mood for a more traditional breakfast, you can pretty much get everything separated.  Two eggs however you like them, bacon or sausage, and a drink.  3) Create your own- your choice of plain, chocolate or pumpkin waffle then whatever toppings you want!  Chocolate waffle with strawberries and bananas is quite good.  4) Miscellaneous- they have regular turkey or ham waffle sandwiches and waffle pizza for the more adventurous!"}
{"text":"Waffles Cafe has been on my to go to list for so long. It took a Groupon sale to finally get me over to the shop. At first I was expecting a sit down spot, but it turns out to be concession style. This is good because it keeps the cost down.  The Groupon was good for two specialty waffles and two drinks. My sister had ordered a milk tea boba and the Alexa's; a strawberry waffle, fresh strawberries, strawberry ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup. I got the taro boba and the Yooni's; subbed the original waffle for an organic flax waffle for a dollar, fresh bananas, strawberries, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. I found that I liked components of both the waffles, but not the whole. The waffles are amazing. They are just the way I like them, a little dense and cake like. The flavor is superb, but I could not tell if I really got the flax waffle or not. If it was then they use flax meal. The fruit were firm and not slimy. If I got it without the chocolate syrup and whipped cream, I would have been happier. I had the same issue with their boba. I loved the tapioca balls, but the drinks were too sweet.   WaffleS Cafe's strong points are their reasonable prices and the build your own options. The eight different waffles and large array of toppings are only limited by the customer."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. Really cool place!! VERY clean and comfortable! Kim was GREAT very helpful and friendly!! I had the spicy chicken and waffle sandwich with waffle fries. I have to say, those were the absolute best waffle fries I have ever had! They were cooked perfectly!! The sandwich was amazing! The sauce that they put on it should be bottled and sold in stores!!! And its homemade!! The best part was the prices!! Everything was between $5-$8!!!! More than affordable for great quality and perfect portions!! I will definitely be back, and take my whole family next time!! GREAT place!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly, the restaurant was clean and bright and the menu offered so many different options of waffles!  I love waffles.  I live in LA and there are no \"build your own\" waffle shops.  This place offered different types of waffle batter, fruit toppings (strawberries, bananas, blueberries, etc.), candy toppings (M&M's, chocolate chips, etc.) and lots of other yummy indulgences (Peanut butter, nutella, chocolate sauce, apple pie filling, etc.).  I had a Banana, peanut butter and chocolate chip waffle and it was delicious!  My friend ordered a strawberry and M&M waffle It comes with whipped cream and syrup and is cooked fresh to your order.  They have a few specials like Waffles with eggs and bacon or sausage, a waffle pizza and waffle sandwich.  I highly recommend this waffle shop!  The ingredients are fresh, you are limited only by your imagination and the end result is delicious!  Plus you can't beat the price: $3.75 for a plain waffle and each topping is only $.50!  What a steal!  I wish I lived in Vegas, because I'd eat here every day!"}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amaze!  It has been 2 1/2 months since I was last here and Jeff remembered me.  That's great service.  Oh and the food is wonderful too.  Definitely worth the drive away from the overpriced strip."}
{"text":"This was a superb waffle café, I love the experience the servers were polite and very understanding, they got the order wrong and waive the fee for it"}
{"text":"Waffles cafe is a no frills breakfast cafe with perfectly prepared waffles and other breakfast items. It seems like a family run business, the staff is always friendly. I've had the waffle breakfast sandwich and I've had the waffles with eggs and bacon. My daughter loves the pizza waffle. The waffle itself is crunchy in initial texture yielding to the soft and sweet breading inside. It's not fancy or expensive and I've never had a bad experience earing here.   If you don't want to wait an hour to eat at babystacks just drive down the street and this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is very tasty- so many options you will change your mind every time you think you made a decision.  I built my own meal - got the Red Velvet waffle - tasted very Red Velvety- it came with a cream cheese icing - I could have eaten that by as is but i decided to add some strawberries and whipped cream - YUM!!!  The fruit is very fresh - i did not receive one overly bitter piece of fruit.  There were so many options to try! You cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"We will absolutely recommend and return! The ultimate bowl, the tropic thunder, the banana split and the breakfast sandwich were amazing.   The juice, coffee and latte all exceeded the expectations.   The service was excellent. They were closing early for the holiday and instead of rushing us out she gave us the best FIVE STAR SERVICE CAN GIVE.  Great quick way to eat good food made with love.   Not a fancy joint. A casual dining experience with lots of fun waffle options. Don't expect a full breakfast menu... Expect a different type of trust to your waffle meal."}
{"text":"Had the waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and chocolate syrup... only reason it's knocked down to a 4 star is the girl cheaped out on us and we didn't even get a full scoop of ice cream. We ordered to go so we didn't notice until we got home... we'll still be going back in the future."}
{"text":"I was seriously jonesing to try this place and I have to say that it was not worth all the excitement. When we got there the place was dirty as hell and the floor looked like it hadnt been mopped in weeks.  The menu looked interesting and its always fun to try something new so I ordered a turkey sandwich combo my sister got the breakfast sandwich and we got a banana split waffle to share. My sisters looked pretty good but I told her to eat it with syrup and she liked it a lot better. Mine was pretty much a turkey sandwich but there was the secret sauce on it that was pretty nasty. It was grainy and viscous and about 90% sugar. Who wants, essentially a sugar syrup, on their turkey sandwich? I pulled as much of it off as I could but it ruined it for me. Also, each sandwich came out with a bag of chips that the guy at the register picked for us. I felt like because I was paying for my lunch that I should have been able to pick my chips. That was so strange to me.  The banana split waffle was not that good either. It had a scoop of old tasting vanilla ice cream that was so small I couldnt tell it was there at first. It was also doused in chocolate syrup. I think that it could be a much better experience for me if I stick to breakfast. I do not recommend going at lunch time."}
{"text":"We're in town for a couple of days, wanted to try something new - off the strip- so we came here & it was really good!  A bit of a drive from the Strip area we are staying but with no plans for the day we just decided to go for it.  Had the chicken & waffles, added scrambled eggs, and it was very good food.  Small place, quick service & good food!"}
{"text":"Pineapple mango protein shake and breakfast sandwich, n hash brown !  Yes, bring on brain freeze! I like this place! It's small but not too small that ur cramped up next to other patrons. Food cane fairly quick and I'm about to dig in..."}
{"text":"Tried it last week went in with a few folks after reading about it here not to impressed waffles were good but nothing out of this world all 4 of us tried something different off the menu including the waffle pizza  was disappointed in the smoothies tasted jus like ice end up throwing it away if i go back itll be for the breakfast sandwich with eggs cheese ham and bacon....."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, and I'm always amazed by the level of customer service at this place. All the employees are always friendly and very inviting. The food is great and their prices are reasonable. Very clean and efficient as well. I absolutely recommend the breakfast sandwich for first timers."}
{"text":"This place was great!!!  I decided yesterday that I was going to go here for a proper Sunday brunch, since I have not done that since I moved to Vegas a few weeks ago.  Walked in and was immediately greeted with a \"good morning!\" from the girl at the counter.  She was super sweet and patient with me as I surveyed the menu forever.  I ended up getting the breakfast special, which was a waffle, an egg, a sausage (you can also get bacon) and coffee for only $5!  The coffee was great, and so was the egg and sausage.  But the best part, by FAR, was the waffle.  It was so light and airy, with a crisp outside and soft airy inside (have I mentioned yet that it was airy?) and great taste!  Not too sweet, just right.  I just put butter on it as I don't really like syrup and it was excellent.    Next time I will get one with toppings, although I wanted savory toppings and the only ones on their menu were sweet, so I'm not sure what I missed there.  This was the regular waffle but they also have chocolate, pumpkin and... something else - sorry!  I definitely want to try the pumpkin.  Overall great food, great service, cheap prices... I will be back!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This cafe is really quaint, and quiet. The atmosphere is very welcoming. There isn't many places to sit when it's busy, but there is some outdoor seating for nicer weather. It's located near where I live, and the food is pretty satisfying. Their sandwiches use waffles as their bread. I never would have thought that it would taste so good! I got a regular waffle with strawberries, banana, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Pretty typical desert waffle. Nothing out of the ordinary, but the waffles were really crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and not too sweet. Exactly what a waffle should be. We'll be returning here for sure."}
{"text":"Gah I love waffles, and I love ice cream, and being fat, and so this place is awesome!  Here you can get waffles every which way- dessert for breakfast (banana split is the best!) or lunch (chicken and waffle sandwich). Prices are a bit high, but really, it's a fresh made waffle with a LOT of toppings and glorious goodness. There are also sandwiches to choose from, like a chicken and waffle one, which a friend said was alright.   Great place to get a sugar rush."}
{"text":"We love this family owned and operated cafe. They are welcoming and courteous!  The waffles are delicious too! They do not get soggy as quickly as waffles normally do. My favorite item to order is the breakfast special - a waffle with eggs, a breakfast meat and refillable coffee. I recommend topping your waffle with bananas and almonds."}
{"text":"I had the Smores waffle, fast service, great presentation, syrup was warm and ready to go. only downfall is they didn't put enough chocolate chips on the waffle so it tastes mostly marshmallowy but still amazing. my companion had the chicken and waffles he claims the chicken tenders were very good."}
{"text":"First time here.  The service was excellent I like soft waffles and mine could have been a little softer.  The chicken was just a little to salty and loved their potatoes.    I will come back"}
{"text":"LOVE this place, the atmosphere, customer service and most of all FOOD! Both of my kids love it as well! Definitely a place for Sunday Brunches!"}
{"text":"We were on the north side of town & decided to Yelp to find a breakfast spot. So glad we did! This cute little cafe is tucked in next to the Smith's. It is smaller inside, but can accommodate moderately large parties. Everything is waffle based! I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was eggs, ham, bacon, special sauce wedged between 2 waffle halves. Super yum! Hunny ordered the chicken and waffles - if you do NOTHING else in this life, you must order chicken here. It was amazing!!!! I wanted to order just chicken to go. It was crispy & juicy. We got fingers, but they have wings too (the table next to us ordered wings and it took all my fat girl will power not to steal them!) The waffle batter is made in house, and it was good! They also have strawberry butter, a special hot sauce for the chicken & traditional maple syrup. I wish they had one on our side of town because this would become our go to spot, but until then, hunny will just have to brave the 35 minute drive to get out there! Definitely worth trying if you are near Aliante!"}
{"text":"This place is TOP!!   As you walk in, they ask if you are first timer or not. If you are a first timer then they will explain to you how to order and also like many others, I have coupon from Groupon. And they would as you that as well. Just so they can explain to you what is to order if you have Groupon.   The girls and guys that worked there are so energetic, nice, helpful and as a plus they smile to you.   I order the Alexa which is strawberry waffles, with strawberry ice cream, top with fresh sweet strawberries and a whip cream. I assumed they say no substitute but I ask anyway if I can have chocolate ice cream instead of the strawberry ice cream. And he said \"no problem\" ... well you win there..   The waffles is really good, I usually can not finish 1 average size waffles. But this one, as you can see in the picture I post ~ its clean.. too bad the waffles was served in a paper plate. Or else I would clean the plate.   If I live in the area, I will have my breakfast there often.  But if I ever go to Las Vegas again, I will definitely go back to WaffleS Cafe."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away but when you find it is a great place for waffle and surprisingly their boba is amazing too. I would highly recommend this to someone looking for a casual breakfast or even a lunch with one of their many waffle sandwiches. I'll definitely be returning. The customer service is great here as well!"}
{"text":"If I had to choose a place to take my stoner friends...this would be it!!  The waffle sandwiches are awesome as are the crazy combos of toppings you can choose from.  My only concern would be that a few of my buds would be standing in front of the register looking at the menu for hours on end trying to decide.    Waffle pizza?  I might give it a go next time.  Jeff, the owner, talked about waffle tacos.  How about a deep fried waffle, Jeff?"}
{"text":"Waffles were really light and had a great taste, staff was super friendly, was a terrific breakfast"}
{"text":"The service was great, but that's about all that can be said. The boba was mushy and deteriorating in the milk tea, and the blt waffle sandwich was pretty unappetizing. My girlfriend got a sweet waffle topped with what amounted to canned fruit and whipped cream. The waffles themselves were fine, but nothing to make a special trip for."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I love family owned businesses.  The food was cold, served in disposable dishes and silverware. A tiny dish for the eggs and an undercooked sausage.  It can get pricey with the waffle add ons.  The waffle idea is good and the service is friendly.  I would recommend investing in real silverware and dishes, tidy up the place, work on getting everything cooked better and make sure it gets served hot.  Good luck."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here a couple weeks ago. This morning, I returned by myself. Besides being located just around the corner from our home, we liked that the food is pretty healthy. We had eggs, bacon and a waffle. The waffles are light and taste great. I had iced green tea which was very good. Best part is the service. ALWAYS with a smile. Great little place to stop in for coffee or breakfast."}
{"text":"I wanna start off by saying I'm giving this a 5 star because it's a great waffle place to eat!! I'm not comparing it to other places, just itself. This place deserves 5 stars because: the food was great, exactly what the description said it was, service was welcoming, fast and a-mazing, and I'll come back! That's why I give 5 stars.   My family loves breakfast and I can not believe we have waited so long to visit this place.  Great customer service. Never been here before and the guy was so patient. Helped us order and the food came out fast!! Everything was fresh and hot.  A must try for anyone who loves waffles and eggs.  Thank you"}
{"text":"I just left this place about 10 minutes ago and had to immediately put in my review! Myself and my bf were looking for waffles and after reading the reviews decided to go. Arriving there it looked really empty which SCARED me, but I thought it maybe was because it was 10:00am on a Monday?? The people there were so nice and explained their \"$5.99 Breakfast Special\" which consists of  eggs bacon or sausage and a waffle.Due to me trying to eat better he suggested the \"organic flax seed waffle\" with strawberries. My bf had the waffle with mango and pineapple. We also tried the Boba Thai Tea. Everything was delicious. EVERYTHING. My flax seed waffle had a funnel cake- ish texture almost.It was still light  and soooo good.It was topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream (which he went light on)I also topped it with a little of their strawberry syrup, Divine! The egg whites were awesome, they seemed very fresh. The bacon was ok, nothing special. Even though my bf's waffle was gone in a blink of an eye I did manage to taste some and his regular waffle with the  kiwi and pineapple topping.His fruit topping too were fresh and sweet. Neither one of us have ever had a Boba Tea so this was our first time. Needless to say I'm hooked. It was sweet and creamy. Very good. I like this place because when we left, I didnt feel \"bloated\" or super full as I do with other pancake houses! I also loved that we were in and out of this place in 25 minutes!If you like waffles I suggest you give them a try!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free Waffles for breakfast or as your sandwich meat delivery vessel. Service was excellent and my sandwich was great. Try the flavored lemonade too!"}
{"text":"Love it, best waffles ever! I have to stop there at least 3X a week. A great place, nice atmosphere.  I had lunch with a client at their establishment one week ago, a perfect lunch."}
{"text":"We ended up at this place because we were getting the car serviced. We live over 20 miles away. We were hungry and thanks to Yelp, we stumbled up on Waffles Cafe. When we walked in, I thought that we were surely in for a bad experience. I looked around and saw paper plates on tables as well as plastic forks and knives. I also saw some interesting looking waffles with a lot of \"stuff\" on them. I'm just a regular waffle kind of guy with just butter and little syrup. My initial thought was that they have all of the \"stuff\" on them to hide a bad waffle.   I looked at the prices and they were amazingly inexpensive. That was a good start. They had bottomless coffee that tasted really good. I ordered their waffle special which was a waffle, an egg, and bacon or sausage as well as the coffee. It didn't take them long to bring the food. I thought the short wait was reasonable. The bacon and eggs were not anything special. How can you mess that up and yet, how can you make that scrumptious? The waffle? PERFECT! I had just been looking up a recipe for a perfect waffle. That would be: one that taste delicious, kinda sweet, crispy on the outside, yet creamy on the inside. Yum!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and excellent service! Ashar greeted us at the door, asked if was our first time and offered assistance with the menu. Service was fast and waffles were delicious! No canned fruit in a sugary sauce. I had a plain waffle with bananas, strawberries and blueberries and it was so yummy I forgot to take a picture."}
{"text":"Waffle Pizza and Boba, what more do you need. Never had anything less than stellar food here. Keep It Up Guys!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! The woman helping us made sure she went through the menu with us as it was our first visit. The food was good. Nice smoothies. I'm not allergic but have gone no dairy so requested almond milk. I had a little doubt in my mind that they used the almond milk because I could taste the difference. But aside from that it was a nice meal."}
{"text":"Great service and food! They have a great variety of  choices of waffle combinations and drinks. Their ingredients are fresh and they even have gluten free options. Would definitely recommend. My favorites are the avocado smoothie (may seem strange, but it's great) and the breakfast sandwich waffle."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying, BEST WAFFLES IN THE WOLRD! I ordered a breakfast waffle with eggs, ham, bacon, cheese and orange juice.   I would like to make an attempt to describe the the waffle. It was very light and had a crunchy crust exterior. It tasted sweet and fluffy, like a fried Cotton candy, but not as sweet. I love lathering syrup on my waffles but I didn't need to this time.   The eggs were scrambled and layered thoroughly in the sandwich. I love eggs so it was perfect.   Got Meat!There were generous slices of ham and bacon in the sandwich. The ham was not greasy or salty. Bacon was cooked well and crunchy. It was a nice combination to the ham.   Say Cheese. The cheese was melted on the eggs and dripped over the ham and bacon. I am not sure if it was American cheese or cheddar, but my mouth liked it.   So if you are ever in the Vegas area and you're looking for an inexpensive, delicious breakfast place. Go to Waffle cafe!   Thanks for reading my review."}
{"text":"We love Waffles Cafe! It's our favorite place for a smoothie. The waffles, of course, are delicious as well. My best friend & I hang out here regularly and love the laid back, friendly atmosphere. The staff always has a smile and a wave for everyone who comes in. I've brought several visiting friends and family members here over the past few months for a great breakfast and it's always a huge hit. Don't miss it if you're in the NLV area! :)"}
{"text":"Stayed at my cousins in Vegas and was STARVING for Breakfast.  My cousins said waffles I said sure not knowing that you could do all this fun stuff with waffles.    We walk in and you pick your waffle flavor and waffle toppings!!!  They had waffle creations like pizza, sandwiches, who knew?! A M A Z I N G!! I got the $5.49 Breakfast special! Waffle  coffee, sausage and eggs!!! Chocolate waffles with whipped cream, powdered sugar, nutella and white chocolate!  I didn't want to eat the waffle cuz it was nicely presented.  But when I took my first bite, it melted in my mouth- it was too late, I had already fallen in love.  I ate half and i was already full!! Then I looked at my sausage and eggs, I'm like shoot how am i going to do this?  Luckily my husband and cousins helped eat that so i could focus on the waffle!! o0ooo in between the coffee i had some cucumber water... delish!  Def goin back when i'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had the waffle special. 1 waffle 2 eggs 2 strips of bacon unlimited coffee $6.99. It was ok but not worth $6.99. I think the waffle is just an add water mix. If all you serve is waffles it should be a homemade recipe. Eggs were ok the bacon was crispy.  The staff was excellent. The two stars reflect the food."}
{"text":"It was okay.Because I was super hungry.But looks n sounds like they just used microwave for warm up.also I don't like the paper plate... Table was sticky. Good point was syrup was in warmer place. I think price is little bit pricy for this quality... And that's all."}
{"text":"big fan of this establishment, great food& good service and you can't beat that. waffles are amazing and you can't go wrong with their brunch menu. pull up!"}
{"text":"We came all the way from NY... me and a buncha friends went to LV... we were lookin for a place for breakfast... then i saw the review for this place.. it looks pretty good... we first assume that it gotta be a diner or something... but it is really not... at first, we were worried about the quality of the food... cuz the location and size... we decided to give it a try... it is actually not bad... it is fairly tasty... i had a tuna waffle sandwich... i personally would like have it again if i have a chance... the sauce ( the clear stuff) taste pretty good... i dunno what that is... but it was good..."}
{"text":"Ham and bacon waffle sandwich with avocado and \"special house sauce\" yummmm.  My husband likes to get the breakfast special, it comes with a waffle, eggs, bacon, and coffee with side order of whipped cream and fresh raspberries or strawberries.    Crispy fluffy waffles, fresh ingredients, fresh fruit topping, and reasonably priced.  You can also create your own waffle, waffle sandwich, or waffle pizza."}
{"text":"I'd say the food is 3/5, but w/ cheap prices, I'd bump it to 4 stars.  I came for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  The store specializes in Waffle entrees like waffle pancakes & waffle sandwiches.  They also serve boba and various teas.  The food is pretty good and relatively cheap for $6.  I was expecting it to be $8 but for $6 I can't really complain.  If they raised the prices I might go someplace else.  Breakfast waffle - decent 3/5 - $6.  Comes w/ bacon, ham, egg, and served on a waffle w/ syrup inside.  Also comes w/ a side of chips. -The breakfast waffle is pretty good.  It's really hard to mess up breakfast entrees but this tasted decent.  If you don't like sweet foods I'd recommend getting syrup on the side.  TIPS: -All entrees are served on paper plates (from Costco) & plastic utensils.  Blegh.   -Water is self serve but it tasted a bit odd when I tried it.  I got an OJ instead"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while now and it seems that every time we come it gets better and better. The environment is always welcoming, the food is never disappointing. I enjoy bringing my out of town friends here because I know it is worth it. Hott coffee and fruit infused water is always plentiful at the drink station. Floors are just as clean as the tables. I will visit this restaurant again and again. A++++"}
{"text":"I rarely give any place 5 stars, but we tried this for the first time.   We are from out of town, but come out a few times a year.  They were busy, so that alone told me it should be good.  We waited for our order, it didn't seem like a very long wait at all, when the owner, Kim came out to apologize because apparently our order slip fell and no one saw it til the owner picked it up.  Anyway, Kim comp our meal AND gave us a coupon towards our next visit.  The food is amazing!!! Thank you Kim! You are a very generous owner.  Your staff is very friendly, and well, once again.....your food is AMAZING!!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and frequent here at least twice a month! I always get the same thing, Plain waffle with whip and powdered sugar, sausage and scrambled eggs with a coffee. I'm a big waffle gal and would choose it over pancakes anyway. Their waffles are big and fluffy and sooooo delicious with their WARMED blueberry syrup! They recently remodeled the place and I think it looks great! They are very clean and always greet customers as soon as they walk in the doors. I love that they have a coffee station, I can refill my coffee and put a different flavor of creamer and it's just a cute setup! I always recommend to my friends. Don't forget the stamp card too!"}
{"text":"Great waffles! Loved it, just not a lot of seating"}
{"text":"This diamond in the ruff is JUST the place to come for a break from the norm! Great food, a plethora of combinations to choose from and there is ALWAYS a full staff of smiles and salutations upon arrival and departure! I truly feel at home here and have made it a weekend ritual!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for customer service and the gentlemen that helped us was very nice.  Unlike its neighbor (slidin thru) its not a upbeat, fun environment. It awkwardly quiet, maybe they should have music playing in the background. My turkey sandwich was great, TWO thumbs up and I love the potato chips that came with my special... However, my boyfriend's ordered the breakfast special and the waffles left something to be desired. The bacon was great though. I was debating on the three or four rating, but I went with 4 because if I had just order the sandwich I would have been very happy with my choice:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a different place to eat breakfast. We saw a man across the street with a sign for this cafe. We walked in and noticed that this place was not at all efficient in their service. They have one cashier and not a big enough space to stand in line. We waited over 35 minutes for 2 waffle breakfast sandwiches. It was ridiculous. We brought it up to the manager and he told us that 30 minutes was the average wait time. That should not be acceptable. Each sandwich was $7 and the description said it was loaded with egg, cheese , ham and bacon. Yet another disappointment. It had one flat egg, 2 small pieces of bacon, a small sliver of ham and small amount of cheese. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone; unless you enjoy overpriced waffles and a very long wait for food."}
{"text":"Went herefor a quick bite because I was starving. We had our pups with us too and they let us bring them in. So fast and so friendly. Thankyou for a great experience"}
{"text":"Soooo cool having a turkey waffle sandwich. Went with the whole family, service was great; only about 8 people in the whole place. Really great tasting waffle, like another yelper said wish there was another option other than chips. But overall great experience."}
{"text":"We won't ever be back. We had to wait 10mins for coffee, the food was mediocre and cold, and the place was dirty. We sat at the table outside the kitchen, and saw the cooks place plates of cooked food under the fryer while they waited for food staff to pick them up; no hot plates or anywhere clean. Their \"A\" rating is a sham if this is a normal business practice."}
{"text":"Best waffle I've ever had...I made my own with a chocolate waffle, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, raspberries, cherry pie filling, blueberries, whip cream and powdered sugar.  Pure bliss!"}
{"text":"It was ok... paper goods are not a great presentation."}
{"text":"I love this place! If you create tour own and it's good they put it on the menu. The Christmas music random on shuffle is strange in July but it goes with the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great for a change up for breakfast/brunch, family friendly and even when busy doesn't take forever to get food or a table."}
{"text":"I ordered the organic flax waffle with strawberries and whip cream, it was delicious!  My daughter and son shared the chicken and waffles with a side of waffle fries. This is our third time here and they continue to impress! Everyone is so friendly and helpful which helps when you have a toddler."}
{"text":"Enjoying the chicken and waffle meal. The strawberry butter is divine and that blazin sauce, so yummy.  Topped with warm syrup.  I'm telling you, we will be back. Best part is that your walking distance."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast sandwich the secret sauce is a good addition. Slightly sweet and salty was a great way to start the day. It's a large amount of food go hungry or split one with your pal."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious, and I wish that I could return to Vegas just so I could eat here again!  I ordered the banana split waffle, without the banana. The ice cream on top would have been amazing alone, but the warm buttery waffle underneath it only made it better. The whipped cream and chocolate sauce certainly didn't hurt either.  Their menu is pretty impressive, considering they only do waffles. This is a place that is good for breakfast (obviously), lunch, and dinner. The toppings and possibilities here are endless, and making a choice was quite the task.   If I do ever end up returning, I am incredibly interested in trying one of their waffle sandwiches. That is if I can resist the banana split waffle again."}
{"text":"this place is original! very clean. we stopped by for breakfast but you can get lunch, dinner and desert!! they have a great breakfast deal a waffle (fresh not frozen) eggs, bacon/sausage and coffee for a great price. can't wait to take the kiddos... las vegas is mainly big business so this fun little spot makes me feel like i am back in eagle rock california.. you must stop by this lil gem...."}

{"text":"Cute concept. Great breakfast spot for locals. Not worth a taxi ride if you are a tourist. However, if you have a car and want a cheap meal, check it out.   Food: The waffle was one of the best that I've ever had! Crispy on the outside, airy inside. However, the bacon was the worst. It was dried out, looked old, and tasted funny.   Price: $4.99 Breakfast special before 11:00am includes waffle, eggs, meat, and coffee. Great deal!   Atmosphere: Very clean and contemporary.   Service: Everyone was very nice and pleasant. I actually got there a little after 11am and they still allowed me to get the special. You can tell that the people that work there are the actually owners and are vested in making it the best that it can be."}
{"text":"Homemade waffles and crispy fried chicken. It's a nice mom and pop type restaurant. Very clean and the service is great.  You do go up to order your food and then grab a table.  They deliver your order and give a choice of syrup. The waffles were fresh and hot and the wings were excellent.  Their latte is not too bad. Definitely recommended casual breakfast joint"}
{"text":"It was ok the pictures on the wall were more exciting then he actual food I went on my daughters birthday thinking it would be something good to try I mean who doesn't love waffles and it was so many"}
{"text":"On your way to red rock?  Hungry for some off the strip food?  Come in to this friendly waffle place with an Asian flare.  Have a yummy waffle breakfast sandwich and I'm sure you will be set for the rest of the climb on the rocks for the day!  Don't forget to get a side order of sausage and bubble tea, they're yummy!"}
{"text":"Ever since I was a kid, I have always liked waffles better than pancakes. Thanks to yelp, I just had to try WaffleS Café after reading some of the reviews. My husband and I have become regulars here since we moved to the area about a month ago!  A very cute café with a unique menu - everything is made with waffles. I haven't tried too many things on the menu. I blame that on their Ham and Bacon Sandwich, which is just so awesome that I just can't see myself ordering anything else!! It is a little hard to eat, but oh soooo worth all the trouble and mess because it tastes very good and fills me up! I would like to try one of the Waffle Pizzas some day. My husband likes the Breakfast Sandwich and the Breakfast Bowl. The smoothies are great as well, I really like the Strawberry one.   Customer service is pretty good. All the employees here have been very friendly and has no problems taking the time to answer your questions or to explain the menu. I think the prices are reasonable here. This place is small, not too many tables inside, so you may have to do take out when they are busy. Wait time for your food depends on how many people are working and how busy they are.   My only complaint so far is that not all the employees will offer you a stamp card. I finally had to ask for one during my third or fourth visit here. I think the guy at the register at the time recognized me and knew that I have been there before. He apologized that no one offered me a stamp card. It's cool I guess, at least he was nice about it. For every $5 you spend, you get a stamp. When the card is filled ($50) you get $5 off."}
{"text":"Wow, really great, unassuming little place. I was early for a meeting and stopped in. The decor looks a lot like a frozen yogurt store, and the staff are all younguns from Asia. I used to live in Taiwan, and I miss the way the Chinese treat breakfast. I got the special, and I was very pleased. The waffle was executed as well as any I have had before. Crispy on the outside, sweet, and chewy on the inside. The staff is super friendly, all the other customers I saw seemed to be regulars. There is a very homey atmosphere here. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Discovered this place from fellow yelpers, and decided to give it a try after a \"yelp roulette\" with a hungry buddy of mine.   The joint isn't too big, it's a nice little spot that's decorated very bright, colorful and has minimalistic flair. Reminds me of being in a frozen yogurt establisment.  Greeted with a smile and welcoming faces, I gazed upon the black chalkboard menu. Waffles.. Waffles.. And.. A WAFFLE SANDWICH?! I ordered it without hesitation. It was very different, but in the very best way possible. A sandwich, comprised of two waffles with pieces of bacon cooked into them, with ham, lettuce and tomatoes wedged between the starchy goodness. There was a dressing that I can't recall what it was, but it had a sweet flavor. The sandwich definetely works. Textures are great, flavors of the bacon-infused waffle really stand out along with the sandwiches internals. It came with a pickle slice and some chips.  I haven't been back since that first visit, and I really should to try out the traditional waffle dishes."}
{"text":"always high quality very tasty waffles that come fresh, hot and delicious! great friendly customer service. relaxed atmosphere for a laid back time. over all 2nd excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was TERRIBLE. Took absolutely forever to get my food. I did not order anything excessive either. I'd like to go back and get another waffle sandwich, but I don't want to wait 45 minutes to receive it again... there are too many amazing breakfast places to go to instead."}
