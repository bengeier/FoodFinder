{"text":"A must stop!!! Will be one for me Everytime I come to Vegas!!! The beef hot dog is absolutely wonderful. Can't wait to try something new next time!!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place a couple days ago and let me tell you, it's amazing! Everything is fairly priced and the food is great. If you ever find yourself walking around the strip or in town do yourself a favor and try this place out and you won't be disappointed! Plus the owner is super nice and friendly. (P.S.- try out the deep fried Oreos!!!)"}
{"text":"this food is a must try . ernie is putting out a great sandwich among other things . all is good , for sure . don't miss out on this one !!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! What a great find! Fantastic food and even better service.  It just opened. Ask for all the items that are not on the menu, especially the deep fried Oreo. Seriously best one I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I don't even know where to start.   1. Got a 1/2 lb. burger and added avocado, cheese, and saut√©ed mushrooms. Holy mother of God people. It was the best burger I've ever had and I don't say that lightly. The burger was fresh the ingredients were fresh and the fries was seasoned perfectly.   2. The owner was amazing. He came out and talked to us and gave us, what he calls, \"American Churros\" on the house. These American Churros are delicious deep fried Oreos with just enough cinnamon on top for you to say, \"Damn, these are seriously American Churros. So fitting!\"   3. The owner made the effort to bring us our food and treat us with care. He engaged with us and we had a lovely conversation. You can really tell he loves what he does with every bite.   This place is a little shack under a billboard, it doesn't look like much at all but you will be slapped in the face with surprise once you eat here. He also has a new sandwich he told us about called primo and that's exactly what I will get next time I go. It sounded absolutely amazing and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Wow great hotdogs and burgers. A very personal experience Erie and Richard make you feel right at home. Hot dog had many specialty toppings that added to hot dog. Great experience. Loved it."}
{"text":"Great quality food, and flavors. We were really curious on what those little crunchy strips are on the chicken sandwich. Which was really good, as well as the burgers and deep fried Oreos! Thank you for the food experience. Great value as well. 100/100!"}
{"text":"Seriously, the best hotdog I have ever had. Hotdog with egg and cabbage woooooow , Everything was so flavorful, the man who runs the little shop was so friendly and nice. I will definitely recommend to all my friends  I will give you"}
{"text":"This was a nice little shack.  The Pepito open faced sandwhich was awesome.  The hot dog was really tasty.  They have a secret menu it's deep fried Oreo's & Pickles.  Our Chef Richard was nice enough to give me and my wife deep fried Oreo's on the house.  Next time we're in Vegas we will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat. I guarantee you will enjoy anything on the menu I have eaten at this place many times and everything I have tried has been A1, that means delicious for you slow people. Back to the subject this place is great definitely check it out of if you are in the area don't be shy and Richard is a cool guy too. He even has Fried Oreos on a secret menu."}
{"text":"Omg I just had the best open face chicken sandwich ever!!! At the World Famous Pepito Shack across from OG and Dino's. It was super delicious with super fresh ingredients.  You can watch the chef prepare it for you through the glass window. A verity of sides to choose from. Also home made onion rings and bacon fries!!!! Omg I'm in trouble il be eating here all the time. I have to try the whole menu. I highly recommend this spot!!!! Wow"}
{"text":"We found this little diamond in a rough by chance. It's a little shack on a corner but it is Amazing. We come to Vegas every 3 months and look for a new place to go every time. We will definitely be back!!!  I got the chicken pepito and my husband got the scooby pepito. We also had bacon fries and fried Oreos! If you're looking for a little gem this is it! The owner was also amazing. He took the time to explain everything to us, consistently checked on us and brought the dogs out a bowl of water without us asking. It was only$25 for the both of us and we had food left over. Great place and great service"}
{"text":"They had a lot of things that sounded good, so it was tough for me to decide. I ended up getting the hamburger. It was just OK. It's made with pork and hamburger meat, so I think that's why it wasn't so juicy. Also, it was just stiff, which was strange, but I think it was the addition of the pork that made it like that.. I'm used to hamburger having a bit more crumbly meat. Other than that, the service was very good. I think I'll still give them another try and have a pepito."}
{"text":"Really great burger.  It was was first time here.  Will definitely go back and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"The food alone is already awesome and Ernie's personality just makes it 10x better. Definitely a spot to come back to! Oh and be sure to save some room for the deep fried oreo!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem! The customer service and characters at this joint are amazing! We received a menu wall thru by the owner and received complimentary drinks, fried pickles and Oreos."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times, and I have never been disappointed. The food has flavor, and the portions are good. Also, the team is very nice. If you are in the neighborhood, stop by Pepito Shack!"}
{"text":"Our last night in Vegas and we heard it was their Grand Opening! I'll do just about anything for a free hot dog. So glad we went. This place is amazing. Hot dog was incredible mmmmm. We shared a hamburger which was by far one of the best I've ever had. Their patty is a mix of pork and beef and to die for!!!! I'm heading back to Vegas in two weeks for work and will stop by to try more. No trip to Vegas is complete without a stop at Pepito Shack from here on out. Good job and thank you!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best food truck in town right now! We have ate everything on the menu from the hotdog to the fried pickles You will not be disappointed.Yummy and the prices are better then any fast food joint in town! Fresh food great service and easy on the pocket book !"}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant. Definitely worth the visit for sure. Had the chicken Pepito and it was awesome. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been to Pepito Shack many times in the last few months and have definitely satisfied my hunger pains every time ! The food is so good I wish they had another location near where I live :) The owner is very courteous and I highly recommend you visit this place and enjoy one of their yumeee dishes."}
{"text":"Shack indeed! Great location with some great good. Their pork sandwich and bacon fries were awesome! Great customer service, reasonable prices... I'll be back."}
{"text":"South American sandwiches and hot dogs have come to the tiny walk-up space in Dino's parking lot! Under the same ownership as nearby Viva Las Arepas, Pepito Shack features similar cuisine and flavors with wallet-friendly prices and late-night hours.  The open-faced sandwiches are my pick, with mesquite-grilled meats and fresh buns from Bon Bakery- the chicken so far is a favorite, adding mushrooms and cheese. Manager insisted that adding an egg was a great way to up the wow factor, and I totally agree. Avocado and jalapeno are other add-ons to consider but keep in mind that this dish is a monster of a mess and a huge portion.  The hot dogs are a lesser draw for me, but also good- props for offering pork and beef options, served dressed with coleslaw, onions, tomatoes potato strings, and sauce. It's good but not my preferred dish here- looking forward to more sandwiches though, particularly the fish version!  Service was quick and friendly. It can be a bit difficult to hear staff inside the booth, but the increased bar-style seating makes up for that- belly up and get your grub on!"}
{"text":"i really enjoyed this place.  i had the burger and it was awesome!  the owner was very personable.  support your local businesses!  :)"}
{"text":"Had drove by this spot many times and always wanted to stop by since everything that opens up in this location seems to have a trend of having super good food.  Sure not didn't disappoint, got me a pepitos beef which hit the spot.  Super nice people working there and hope nothing but success to this place and will definitely come back.  *also was brought some deep fried Oreos on the house which was amazing, thank you so much."}
{"text":"We had the beef, pork and chicken Pepitos and they were amazing. Super friendly customer service. Quality and care were apparent when I watched the owner preparing our sandwiches. The deep fried Oreos were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I got the beef hot dog with egg, bacon and avocado added and it was probably the best hot dog I've had. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area looking to get a quick and delicious bite. The hours are great too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's right around the corner from my house I finally tried it last week and got the dog add bacon. After that I was hooked. Today after the UNLV football game I took my two cousins there and we all got burgers witch are so big and good. Nothing else compares to this place in this area. All the food is so fresh and these 2 guys are so nice you have to check this place out. If your a foodie prepare yourself you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"This was easily the best gourmet hot dog I've ever had. Delicious fresh ingredients tons of homemade sauces and sausages. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about their product. I had a hotdog made of beef topped with homemade saut√©ed onions and potato crisps. WOW!! Try the chicken sandwich with cilantro sauce and extra avocado. Prices are reasonable. It's really fun to stop and eat outside or take your food into the neighboring bar. They even have a few surprises you can ask them about. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great burger! Will come back when I'm in Vegas again. Great and friendly service. Close to stratosphere hotel."}
{"text":"stopped by to redeem my free hotdog and i'm really glad i did! i tried the burger and my boyfriend had the hot dog. both were very tasty and left us satisfied! also the fries were delicious. everything tastes very fresh.   staff was very friendly and let us try out the fried oreos they have on their secret menu. they were amazzzinngg! crispy and freshly made, i enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"Just came back from the Pepito Shack and it was amazing. It is a scratch kitchen and everything is cooked to order and super fresh. The Chef/Owner is a really nice guy and talked with me about the concept and ingredients he uses to make his wonderful food. I had a burger med rare and an order of bacon fries  ASK ABOUT HIS SECRET MENU, you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"So so so good! Definitely give these guys your business. We stumbled upon this little spot on our first day in Vegas and will be returning every trip we take here! The pepito sandwiches were so unique and amazing, we actually came for a burger but the guy sold us on the pepito. Such a great decision, the sandwiches are loaded with so many flavors and textures and the crispy hash browns on top really made it! Go!"}
{"text":"I want to first start by saying \"Wow\"!!  so delicious !!! My girlfriend and I had the pleasure of stubbing upon this place. Definitely not disappointed lol At first I look at the menu trying to figure out, what is a pepito ? \"Sounds like a high-dea\" well best one I've had the please of coming across and experience."}
{"text":"Deep fried Oreo is a must-have especially if you haven't had it before. It's like an Oreo inside of a hot, lightly-sugared churro. And the Oreo actually retained quite a bit of its crunch.  Okay, so onto the main course. The pepito was good. Worth the late afternoon trip. Around 3pm, There was no line, plenty of parking, and the weather was mild. I say all this to say, you shouldn't necessarily brave the heat or endure a long line for this sandwich. It was good, worth the money, worth trying but not mind-blowing. My biggest gripe was not enough spice. I added jalape√±os to it, but next time, I'll probably ask for dbl. The bacon jam was a nice surprise and it brings me to the beef dog.   If you like bacon on your dog, don't convince yourself you don't need it when you hear it comes with bacon jam. It's a nice addition but it's no substitute for full slices on your dog.   I will likely find an excuse to come down here again.  Also, The manager was friendly, helpful, and accommodating."}
{"text":"The Shack is back!  I came here last week and enjoyed a delicious \"Hawaiian\" style burger only to find out they closed the doors a day later? Nope, this place just has funky hours and sometimes the chef is out running errands. So take it easy Yelpers, only report a place as closed if you see a, \"Closed For Business\" sign. That being said... When I walked up to the shack no one was there, I waited for a bit and turned to leave just as the chef came running up, close call Pepito!   Taking over the former Goodwich food shack, Pepito offers more of a blue collar, culture rich menu with solid flavor profiles, but with less food finesse. That being said, my burger was juicy, spicy and deliciously messy. An inch thick patty, piled high with onion rings, grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce, I added fresh saut√©ed jalape√±os and avocado. By the way, no cheese on this bad boy and I'm still in love, the layered flavors were highlighted with each bite and kept me eating with no breathing breaks, who needs oxygen!   Carl's Jr. and most boutique burger joints in Vegas have nothing on this burger. Pepito!, fix your hours, stay consistent and you're sure to have a line around the corner.   If you grill it, they will come."}
{"text":"Reminds me a LA burger shack. Super cool guys and the food is bomb. I recommend bacon on everything! For sure bring friends from out of town here."}
{"text":"This place was just a great find! The employees were so friendly and helpful to go over the menu and different options of toppings and sauces (and there are many)! We ordered a chicken pepito and a bacon burger stock. Both had a lot of amazing flavors built in to them and exceeded our expectations! We had one person come out (oh I forgot to mention this is a little shack with outside seating around the edge of the trailer) and ask us how everything was and if we wanted to try anymore sauces with our fries? Well of course we had to because he advised us they were all homemade sauces:) I chose the ranch and it was very good and I even threw some on the sandwich! Then we had someone else come out and offer us some deep fried Oreos to try. I am not a fan of Oreos (I know I hear it all the time that I'm not normal) but these were covered in some cinnamon coating that really made them irresistible! Overall the experience was great and even better the price was so cheap for so much food and this is important when spending time in Vegas and wanting to cut corners a bit. We absolutely loved this place!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Came across this place on yelp so my buddy and I decided to check it out.  It's a stand located near the Stratosphere with bar style seating on two sides of the shack. I'm assuming most people take carry out or just eat in their cars. I can't imagine people eating outside especially during the scorching summers.   They serve hot dogs, burgers, and pepitos (which are Mexican/Venezuelan sandwiches). We got a pepito with pork, one hot dog with beef, an order of bacon fries, and fried oreos. I'm usually not a huge fan of sandwiches, but I really enjoyed the pepito. The bread was toasted nicely, soft but with a slight crunch, and the pork was juicy. The crispy onions added more texture to the sandwich overall, but next time, I think I'll add some jalapeno peppers to give it that extra kick. I haven't had a hot dog in awhile so that was refreshing, and the fries with bacon bits were pretty good. The only complaint I would have is that the fries weren't hot when I received them.   Oh and the fried oreos were really tasty. The batter was coated with cinnamon so it tasted like a churro with an oreo inside of it. Best to eat it when its hot!  Will definitely be back if I'm in the area! Looking forward to trying their burger!"}
{"text":"Pepitos open face sandwiches were amazing!! Richard our host was also incredible and friendly speaking to us in depth about the \"shack\" and all of its menu items. Tip: Don't forget to ask about the secret menu! Deep fried oreos and deep fried pickles are a must! I also hear they have bacon fries?! We shall be return!"}
{"text":"Craving a hot dog and happened to drive by this place. So glad I did, the food was AMAZING!!! Fresh hand battered onion rings, incredible hot dogs piled high with deliciousness, deep fried Oreos and the best customer service I've ever received! I'll will be back for sure to get a Scooby burger next time!"}
{"text":"Finally got this fabulous burger!!! Great meat amazing grilled taste, quality bun and its actually cheap if you look around how burgers cost! Much luck and success to you guys"}
{"text":"Everything is cooked fresh and it is delicious! I had the chicken pepita sandwich and added jalape√±os and avocado. It was suggested that I add an egg too, which probably would have been delicious, but I'm just not an egg fan. I highly recommend checking this place out! The owners were very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Another clever creation from Felix (of Viva Las Arepas and Art of Flavors).  I had the burger (half-pound of beef and pork) with cheese, an egg and bacon...absolutely decadent and delicious! Great food! Great prices! Great guys doing the cooking!  One more reason I love living in Las Vegas. I'll be back...again...and again....and again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best burger in Vegas, look no further. Meat cooked to perfection, Great bread and very good size. But that is an understatement, cause nothing on the menu will leave you disappointed. What really makes all the staples shine is the freshness in everything used. Being able to see the staff cooking everything at the moment really adds up to the experience. The guys here not only are super friendly but they sure know what they are doing. Besides the burgers, the pepitos are amazing! Really fulfilling and full of flavor. There is a secret menu which holds things like fried Oreos (a must when coming here). Fantastic place you should not miss out."}
{"text":"Scored myself one of their hot dogs and it did not disappoint. The bun, slaw, onions and hot dog all compliment each other nicely. I will definitely have another when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"First time here! The food and service were really great. I got the chicken pepito and I'm definitely coming back soon to try the other stuff on the menu"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I have ever had in my life. The chicken melts in your mouth and there are so many sauces to choose from !  Really top notch service. It feels like family. Don't forget to ask for the fried Oreos!!  Yummy! Definitely check this out!"}
{"text":"I give this 5 stars because the food is incredibly flavorful and the owner is such a lovely person.  Stopped here for a couple of hot dogs with everything on them and they sure are not your typical hot dog.  Served on a beautiful toasted bun with cabbage, potato strings, mustard, and sauce.  The hot dog itself was def gourmet style and full of seasoning.  I wish I would've been hungrier because I really wanted to try more!  There are some little seats around the building, but we ate in the car as it was super windy outside. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be sure to stop by when I'm super hungry.  I really want to try the chicken sandwich with bacon, avocado, and maybe an egg on it...and a deep fried OREO!  Best wishes to this place!"}
{"text":"First time here, hot dogs are amazing. Burgers are amazing. Richard was the cook that created our meals. Some crazy ideas coming soon. Definitely a must go to."}
{"text":"It's a small location with great food and great customer service! I had a 1/2 burger with tomato lettuce, mushrooms, jalape√±os, cheese and some house made garlic sauce. It was honestly a really tasteful burger. The owner really cares for his costumers and showed us great costumer service. I recommend this place to everyone that visits Vegas. It's right at the end of the strip by stratosphere. Check it out!! They have deep fried Oreos too."}
{"text":"amazingly good food! had the beef dog the 1/2 burger and the open face chicken pepito & the cheese bacon bit fries. can't  complain so good and so filling! we return to try again."}
{"text":"Up for a quick and easy lunch. Give this place a try. Pepitas are all great. Think I liked the pork best. Want some \"extra\". Ask for a fried Oreo. Not on the menu but pretty awesome. Top it all off with a friendly cook/owner, and I can say I'll be back"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Pepito's. If you like the flavor of the meats at Viva Las Arepas, you'll enjoy this. I tried the pork Pepito while my boyfriend got the wood-fired smoked chicken, included toppings plus avocado. The portion was a really good size. There are also the traditional green hot sauce that Viva Las Arepas offers, and they also brought out a cheese sauce and some sort of creamy bacon sauce to add onto the sauciness that was already on the sandwich. It was so bomb. The service was so awesome also. Both the chef and the manager were super friendly and kept checking on us as we sat on the bar seating to make sure we were completely satisfied. They have a few seats (about 10 at the bar) which is cool, bc the previous occupants had to remove the outdoor seating area due to city codes or something like that making it hard to eat there. We'll absolutely be back to try some of the other menu items like some fries or the hot dogs too."}
{"text":"I love the downtown area. I just happened to be downtown today and while I waited for my sisters Dr Appt to be over I decided to get me a little lunch. As always I took to my yelp reviews not being from this side of town and wanted something all the locals liked.  Then I found Pepitos. I read the reviews and decided this was hot spot destination for lunch.   Richard, I beleive is the owner was very friendly and gave me several options as to what to order. After talking to him and reading other reviews I opted for the beef pepito, no extras but did ask for the garlic sauce. The sauce gave the sandwich that infamous taste that upon first bite your eyes roll back in heaven. I enjoyed my 15 minutes out on a beautiful sunny March afternoon with good eats and company from Richard ( the chef) himself. Awesome food and even more awesome company. Thank you Richard"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain I had the steak pepito and my friend had a hot dog and wow! Just try it you'll see."}
{"text":"The coolest place I've ever been. True Vegas experience. Haven't even eaten the food yet, but I'm bowled over."}
{"text":"Very good products, the burgers, and the hot dogs are very huge. It's a better value than any fast food.The staff is very nice ."}
{"text":"Excellents dogs and burgers at a great price. Staff was friendly and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We weren't sure what to expect when we walked up to it, but the food is incredible. The pepito was so fresh and delicious that we are coming back for lunch before we leave Las Vegas. It was the perfect combination of flavor and texture. The French Fries have a lot of flavor and are a great side addition! GET THE FRIED OREOS!!! They are like crunchy, smooth, cinnamon bits of delicious that melt in your mouth (and I don't even like Oreos). On top of it, the owner, Richard, genuinely cares about his business and customer satisfaction. GO HERE! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Absolutely top notch.  Perfect flavors complimenting other perfect flavors.  This place just does it right I go at least once a week now.   PRIME TIME!!!!"}
{"text":"The best hot dog and hamburgers in Las Vegas I love this place los mejores hot dog y hamburgers en Las Vegas amo este lugar"}
{"text":"Super sweet staff and very helpful with telling me and my bf about the menu. I had the Scooby Dog which was AMAZING and the bf got the burger which was also AMAZING! We also ordered fried pickles, bacon fries, and fried oreos and it was all PRETTY DAMN GOOD! I also like that fact they do military discount too! They are located right next to Dino's in a small yellow stand at the intersection OF Las Vegas and Wyoming. Also get the Colita soda too!!!! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my second review! I'm in loooove with this place! The price is amazing and the food is even better! I can't express my happiness enough! I'll just have to keep giving these wonderful people my money! I deeply enjoy the chicken pepito! When you visit, be sure to add egg and avocado to your pepito and also your hotdog!!! The sandwiches (pepitos) come with a lot of ingredients already but you can't live without adding more.  **Ask about the secret menu items!!!  bacon fries, fried pickles...just to name a few!!!! do it!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious and the service was incredible. We were given free samples of their chocolate mousse, extra French fries, and they made my son a special grilled cheese. I had a burger and onion rings that were spectacular."}
