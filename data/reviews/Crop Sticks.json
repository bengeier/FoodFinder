{"text":"Came here with high expectations but left somewhat disappointed.  Started off with  the spicy tuna - very bland, they forgot the spice?  Followed this with the pad Thai- fair but tasted very generic.  I know hot sake is lower quality but on a cold and windy night, I enjoy a drink that can warm me up- since they didn't Serve the hot variety the bartender quickly suggested an alternative which was still pretty good.  I hope they can do something different with the food menu, otherwise I don't think I'll be visiting again. It would still be a good place for cocktails at the very least."}
{"text":"My husband and I went down to the flats for a happy hour gathering which left us hungry in a hip (but seasonally quiet) part of town. Luckily we stumbled upon Crop Sticks, a modern Asian spot on the East Bank.  To start, the drinks! This place has an amazing cocktail menu. Tried the jackfruit margarita, so fresh and flavorful. Yum! My husband had the Maithai. So delicious but a little strong for my taste.  We were hungry, so deciding what to eat should not have been hard, but there was so many things I wanted to try! We started with the crab Rangoon and chicken egg roll. Eggroll was fantastic, not greasy just fresh veg and chicken. I usually don't like crab Rangoon, but these were by far the best I have ever had. For dinner I had the ThaiD bowl, a flavor bomb! Who knew cinnamon noodles  and curry worked so well together. I can not stop thinking about it. Husband had chicken pad Thai and enjoyed it. Wish we saved room for dessert.  Can't wait to come back down here and try the other crop restaurant next door."}
{"text":"My date and I stopped here before the Carlos Jones show at ON AIR STUDIO and we really enjoyed it! We ate at the bar and it definitely has a modern, sleek feel to it, with all sorts of beautiful Asian Scrolls on the walls. The Bamboo bar top and lighting is gorgeous!   Drinks were a highlight, kind of the hipster craft cocktail thing but with an Asian flair and really good. The Mai' tai was STRONG and the girlfriend tried the Seoul Mate, with gin and Hibiscus. Then I found the Hitachino Beers they offer, they seem to have all of the different beers from them! I tried the Anbai  Ale which is a Plum and sea salt Gose style.  As for the food, it was surprisingly good!  The King Crab Rangoons were perfection; real crab! We shared the Sushi special with Temupra Shrimp and it was a great roll, fresh and loaded with goodies.  We both got Pad Thai for entrees, I got the combo (with Shrimp and Chicken!) and the girl got Shrimp.  Both were excellent! More flavor than your average Pad Thai, Tamarind? Lots of meat and very full flavored but not salty!  Overall really nice place for a date night! Asian flavors in a nice modern setting! Loving the new Flats!"}
{"text":"Sat down and waited for over 15 minutes without a single server coming to wait on us. They looked confused and incapable of figuring out who serves what table. Have no desire to go there again regardless of how good the food was."}
{"text":"Service: The manager Debbie should be fired. My friend and I were there Saturday after the jazz festival. The mgr Debbie stated the restaurant is booked up for the night so if we wanted dinner we had to seat at the bar. So we sat at the bar, well time passed over an hour and now we see people coming in with no reservation and being seated. I was livid that the mgr. of all people I felt racially profiled me and my friend. I brought to Debbie attention of how first of all when seats became available as a mgr that TOLD US TO SIT AT THE BAR, we should have been the first people to be seated. I felt disrespected as a patron this establishment and felt since I was African american it was ok to be treated as such. The fact that a manager could act rudely as such is horrible for this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and right by the water, perfect with friends. Food is okay. My favorite is sashimi salad; very fresh. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Easiest way to get your check quickly is to let them know their miso soup tastes like dead people. Their pho is aight."}
{"text":"Came during the RNC, so I expected the place to be busy.  It was empty.  I had the pork ramen.  The noodles were tender and chewy, and the pork was soft and stew like.  But the broth was extremely salty, almost to the point of being inedible.  My wife had the vegetarian roll which was so so."}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed in our experience on 10/17/15. Three of us ordered pad thai. I was suprised that at 7:30pm on a Saturday evening, I was told there were only two orders available and would one of us have ramen noodles instead. The food was so salty. All four of our entrees were doused in soy (or some other salty sauce). A manager did not visit our table, therefore we did not voice our concerns. I've been to Crop and Crop Kitchen and was expecting more from Crop Sticks. To make matters worse, I decided to email Crop directly and did not get a response from them."}
{"text":"Among all the new, frenetic restaurants now enjoying the Flats East Bank development, Crop Sticks is a very refreshing experience. The crowd is lively, but urbane. The food is sophisticated, but completely accessible. And the bartender, Dan, couldn't be better. He's welcoming, attentive, offers reliable guidance on the menu, and he really knows his cocktails. If you're looking for a memorable meal instead of just the usual scene, go to Crop Sticks."}
{"text":"Can not believe someone would actually serve the two dishes (red duck curry and beef udon soup) and something they called miso soup at a restaurant. It was like the chef made a dish based on a description of what it was supposed to taste like. OMG!  The service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"After two dining experiences here I can say Crop Sticks is an embarrassment to the Crop brand and not a place I'm inclined to try again.   Service: On both occasions - both with reservations made in advance - my dining companions and I have been met with either lazy indifference or confused passive aggressiveness by the hostess. The bartenders and servers do a poor job of portraying confidence about drinks and food they know nothing about-- if you're not going to know what you're serving, at least act like a professional working in a supposedly decent restaurant.   Food: Some of their sushi is good but far overpriced: $16 for a California Roll-- are you kidding me? Some of their daily special rolls take great liberties with the definition of sushi. This was disappointing considering the sushi at Crop Kitchen in Uptown is generally good and appropriately priced.  Beyond a couple of decent appetizers that you could find at most gastropubs (e.g. deviled eggs; peppers) the rest of the menu is downright awful. Poorly prepared ingredients covered by a melange of heavy sauces with conflicting flavor profiles. Of particular note is the tofu ravioli in a miso broth: it looked and tasted so unappealing that the friend who ordered it couldn't bear more than 1.5 bites before pushing it away.   Drinks: Decent liquor selection is compromised by poor bartenders and all house cocktails are super sugary.   Bottom line: stay away. They are trading on the Crop name and the fact that the Flats East Bank is the newest flavor of the month in the Cleveland dining scene. You can have a better dining experience almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"Yay for versatility in the Flats!  This place has a good Asian-fusion menu, with options like sushi rolls, pad Thai, ramen, and curry dishes.  I've only dined here once, but really enjoyed the meal.  Everyone at our table got something different, and we all enjoyed it.  I had the shrimp pad Thai and thought it was great; although I feel like pad Thai is generally pretty standard, like, I can't remember having \"THE BEST\" pad Thai at any place in particular, but I do remember the bad ones.  We were drinking beer that night (they had a good selection), but the cocktail list looked pretty good and would definitely like to try one or two cocktails the next time I'm here.  My only (slight) complaint is the price.  Overall, the prices aren't that unreasonable and are in-line with the other restaurants in the Flats.  I think the pad Thai was $15, which again isn't unreasonable, but I'm so used to Thai restaurants where you get a TON of food and have one or two meals' worth of leftovers, whereas here the one order here was only enough just for my dinner.  So basically, I am being cheap and was hoping to get leftovers out of it, lol.   If you haven't been though, I recommend going.  I think they're open for dinner every night of the week, but check their website for the days they're open for lunch - might only be Thursday through Sunday?"}
{"text":"This was my fiancé and my first time trying out Crop Sticks. We booked a table with Open Table as we were unsure how busy it would be on a Saturday. We arrived for our 7 pm reservation, there were only about 5 other tables inside at the time. Crowd definitely arrives around 8/830 on a Saturday.  Service was amazing, very attentive and everyone was helping each other out. The bartender even came out to our table a couple of times to bring drinks.  Our server recommended some dishes based on what he likes and what seems to be popular. We went with the crab rangoons, which I could definitely had gone without. The Pad Thai, which was amazing, very sweet but shrimp was cooked to perfection. My fiancé ordered the Beef Udon, which he was pleasantly surprised with. Beef was cooked perfectly and was full of flavors, he stated he would definitely order that again.  Half way through our appetizer, the manager brought over complimentary wasabi deviled eggs for us, we were celebrating our engagement! Major points to them for that!  Atmosphere was amazing, noise level was perfect, aside from one loud man next to us, other than that, a very nice atmosphere for a night out.  Prices are a bit high, I would return for a special occasion.   Service was a 5 star, food, I give a 4 due to the slight disappoint with the crab Rangoon."}
{"text":"Aesthetically beautiful, great service, beautiful presentation on the food, although a little salty on the miso soup and also the chicken pad Thai and the spareribs.  The music did not match the mood of the restaurant and could not have a conversation due to volume.  The location of this restaurant is beautiful, esp. On a warm summer night. I'll give it another shot soon."}
{"text":"Average. Nothing spectacular stood out to me here. We all shared a bunch of apps which were good, but I wouldn't go back here in the near future. We were also the only people in the restaurant which was weird."}
{"text":"This is for a lunch review on a Saturday afternoon.  I didn't get any drinks, but the bar looked fully stocked and the bartender seemed like the type who really knows his stuff.  Also, it was very clean, quick, and the service was great.  Sadly the food left me feeling a bit meh.    I had the lunch special, which came with soup, side salad, and a half of a sandwich. I took the miso soup and the pork steam bun as a sandwich.  The soup had tofu, mushrooms, and scallions - not bad, but nothing unique either.    The salad was the best part of the meal, and included a variety of lettuce, scallions (I think?), some other vegetables, and some kind of Asian-tasting dressing.  They used great vegetables and everything was fresh. The dressing was fine.  One thing they absolutely nailed was the dressing to salad ratio.  Kudos.  Finally, the steam bun. It had pulled pork, some kind of sesame something or other, and...again with the chopped scallions. It was fine, but that's it -- what else can I say?  Tying it all together, I guess this is what I expected.  East Bank places are very hyped right now, and any kind of Asian fusion restaurant is bound to disappoint those who prefer more authentic Asian food. The price was $20 incl. tip.  I would definitely come back here for a drink sometime, and will possibly give it one more shot for food."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant but as soon as I walked in , dissapointment. There is absolutely no ambiance. The decor looks cheap and tacky. Service was great and food was fine. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Just ok. Service slow and food tastes pre-packaged. Good location though. Had the Miso Soup and two weak drinks. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at the original Crop Bistro but was admittedly tentative at trying Crop's take on Asian food.  I came out pleasantly surprised, but not without an equally surprising hit to the wallet.  For a drink, I started with the Mai Tai'd ($13)--more intrigued than anything else at the two-drink limit posted on the menu.  Indeed, it is pretty boozy as forewarned and potentially dangerous in its drinkability.  My second drink was water.  For appetizers, we split an order of Oyster Steamed Buns ($14).  The two folded-over buns are each pretty sizeable--bigger than the steamed buns at Noodlecat, for example, but at double the price.  The oysters were crispy throughout and overcooked, which was disappointing.  I liked the two pork dumplings in the cup of Wonton Soup ($8), a good change of pace from the thicker dumplings at most Chinese restaurants.  The thinner dumplings better highlight the pork interior (though perhaps a little bit more seasoning on that pork would help).  I did not like, however, the saltiness of broth--either due to the duck stock or pre-added soy sauce.  The main course was one of the signature plates: the Crispy Basil Duck ($29)--two large pieces of duck over a plate of black rice slathered in sauce with grilled bok choy.  I liked the black rice in sauce as well as the grilled bok choy.  The duck itself occupies an odd space between roasted duck and a truly-crispy Peking duck preparation.  If you were hoping for the latter, I would advise moving on to another menu item.  To put it in the most negative light, you could say it was overcooked, but I suppose some license is warranted given the title.  For dessert (yes, I suffer in order to write comprehensive Yelp reviews), I had the Coconut Milk Loaf ($6).  The frozen coconut milk mousse is on the bland side with the flavor instead driven by the accompanying slices of tropical fruits.  Not particularly a highlight, I would likely pass on any dessert in a future visit.  All in all, the food was decent with some blemishes.  Do not set your expectations to the quality of the flagship Crop restaurant or you will be disappointed.  For those keeping track at home, the items above total $70.  Of course, this is a lot of food--having split the steamed buns and one could arguably even split the duck if there were appetizers beforehand (no idea if there is a surcharge for this).  Also, to be sure, the menu offers some noodle and rice options in the $16 to $18 range.  Just based on what I had, though, I do not find myself keen to do a return visit at those price points, but also just shy of a two-star (i.e., bad) experience."}
{"text":"Just ok if you are in the area and the other surrounding restaurants have a long wait. Weak specialty cocktails and food is crazy overpriced for the portion sizes as are drinks. There are many authentic Thai/Asian restaurants locally that are better taste and priced accordingly. Now we see why. We were at an event on the East bank, surrounded by restaurants and Crop Sticks was the only option that did not have a long wait just to sit down. However, when we walked in and sat at the bar, the bartender took a while to acknowledge us. Even then, he was multi-tasking and made us feel like we were an inconvenience. With all due respect to the owner/Chef, to sustain repeat guests, things need to be fixed.   Prices are crazy. Chicken or Shrimp Pad Thai is $17. I asked for a combo (no problem!) and they charged me $24! Had he told me the price I would not have ordered it. Order pad thai combo elsewhere, and they don't charge you $7 upcharge, or they would tell you before ordering so you can decide. Bartender recommended the chicken egg rolls ($9 for 2) and after seeing them, they looked like standard egg rolls priced under $2 elsewhere.  Not impressed. Perhaps this review will be helpful."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago for a dinner with a friend. I made reservations online, but we ended up being the only ones in the restaurant the entire time we were there which was surprising because it was the night of the first Cavs finals game. Our waiter was very attentive, which could have been because we were the only ones there but still had great service. I ordered the Orange Chicken Salad and my friend got the Sushi Salad. Mine was good, but nothing special. My friend's salad was very interesting and I should've tried this. It was a regular salad and a sushi roll around the outside of the plate- so best of both worlds, sushi and salad!"}
{"text":"I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Had a delicious drink with my yummy dinner, despite the somewhat stark atmosphere.   PROS -Service. I have to call this out first because our server was phenomenal. He made great recommendations for drinks and food and was very attentive to our table. He was even cracking a few jokes with us, which we had us all laughing.  -Pork Ramen. I typically don't get ramen, unless I am buying it in bulk from the grocery store. But I said, what the heck, I'll try it. What a great decision! Not too salty and plenty of pork and Ohio City noodles. Check out the pic.  -All the cocktails. I got the Maharajah Cooler; a mix of gin, tequila and citrus-y flavors. Again, not something I would typically order (I'm a vodka girl) but the drink was very refreshing. Malacca Mule & Cherry Blossom were also tasty, though the Cherry Blossom was a little too sweet for me. The Japanese Cocktail was strong!   -Patio space. Though we couldn't use the patio space, it is worth mentioning that they have one!   CONS -Weird atmosphere. The restaurant was really well lit and not intimate at all. The tall ceilings did not really help that vibe - I felt like our conversation at our table was with the entire restaurant because of it.   -The spicy tuna sushi was TOO spicy for me!   BOTTOM LINE -Come here for dinner, try a cocktail, and get one of the noodle dishes! I will definitely be coming back after the weather warms up to dine on the patio!"}
{"text":"So...I usually take the time to leave a lengthy and worthy review...I'm not going to waste my time on this one. Overpriced and less than mediocre American Asian bistro. They are in no sense authentic (not that I think they were aiming for authenticity)...typical restaurant at the flats...maybe if you're drunk enough you'll be able to down this food...  Avoid this wanna be..."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago and was very impressed.  They have a good cocktail list and a decent beer list.  The husband had a tasty tiki cocktail which was delicious and strong.  We started out with the crispy oyster steamed buns which were very good.  For dinner I had the pad thai based on the servers recommendation.  I normally don't order pad thai but he recommended it, and I'm glad he did.  It was excellent!  The sauce was nice and tangy (tamarind?) and it was cooked perfectly.  Service was very good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is smothered in a spicy, unimaginative, unattractive, and very heavy sauce. It is so overpowering - in quantity and taste - that you cannot distinguish what you are eating other than by knowing what you ordered off the menu. Even the plain white jasmine rice came out smothered in a spicy peanut based sauce. When I questioned the waiter on this, he said that it turns that color when it is cooked and that is how they serve their side of Jasmine rice! Stay away unless you want to indulge in a bowl of spicy sauce with a few other mysterious ingredients mixed in. Service was adequate. Food was sub-par. Drinks were average."}
{"text":"I love Crop Kitchen and Crop Bistro, but this was a very weak attempt at Asian Fusion.  - Crab cake appetizer: This was the highlight of the meal.  It had good flavor and a good mix of the crab meat and the breading.  Not really Asian, but whatever. - Chicken egg rolls: These were not very crispy, but tasted all right. - Ramen: Did not resemble Asian ramen in any way, but rather a so-so tasting bowl of noodle soup with an egg on top.  The meat was not the meat you expect in ramen, but more like pulled pork.  And it was too salty. - Udon: Actually thought that they had switched the ramen and udon, because this soup looked more like ramen than udon.  But the noodles were a giveaway.  There was far too much dashi in this soup and it tasted even more salty.  Prices were steep for Asian - $15 for the crab cakes, $9 for two egg rolls, $18 for a bowl of noodles and $20+ for regular main dishes.  The service was sluggish and our waiter was standing at the bar watching a sports game on the big screen while we were waiting for our check."}
{"text":"Its Cavs game day, the restaurant is empty, and the hostess was very rude. She said that the tables were all reserved, but till now nobody arrived the restaurant. Such an awkward situation that we still can make a reservation on open table!  The food is ok.  We sat on the bar counter, the service is good. 1 star because of the hostess!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was mediocre and prices were absolutely outrageous! Very limited, basic sushi that would have been about a third of the price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came for lunch yesterday during the Maize festival in the flats. Pork ramen was really good and I'm eating it now as a leftover. The only thing I didn't love was the price. $16 for ramen is a bit on the pricey side. Would go back to try the pho as well."}
{"text":"A serious mistake. I split the spicy tuna roll and ordered the Crop Pho. First the roll--it had way too much rice for being advertised as a spicy tuna roll.  The description says its tuna tartare, sriracha and chili flake.  What I received was a ton of rice and in the middle was a little bit of red looking paste. It was so finely ground (food processor) that it was a pate that looked like it was coloring the rice.  Could I tell that it was tuna? no. Was it spicy? no. The sushi rice wasn't right either and the roll itself was rolled way too big.  This would be great if you want some fish flavored sushi rice.   The Pho was worse.  The broth color immediately threw me off.  Someone asked me if I was having blood soup and they were being serious. I knew it was not going to be traditional clearish broth because it is marketed as a cinnamon beef broth but this was seriously brown-black.  The flavor was strange.  The noodles weren't traditional vermicelli but more like a flat linguini noodle. It was a big bowl of broth and a tiny bit of noodles--way too few. I asked what cut of beef was used in the soup--it claims to be rare beef.  I got grey slices of beef and the waiter had no idea if it was brisket, round or flank. Never again. I hate three bites before giving up."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. Service is SUPER SLOW. I get that its Saturday evening but there is no one here. We opted out of dinner and we just had a drink. Won't be back. We will eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had the misfortune to try this place last night. The inside is cool and the service was friendly and they have a bar. So go only if you just want drinks. I ordered some fairly simple stuff, miso soup and tuna and salmon sashimi. Straightforward, right? Nope. The soup tasted like sour milk and the salmon and tuna didn't taste like anything - no flavor.  There are too many other choices in the area, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Were wanted to check out the East Bank as we hadn't been there since it's heyday. We immediately noticed it to be much more upscale than the old Fagan's and The Basement. We parked easily with reasonable $10 valet. From the minute we walked in we were impressed. It smelled great and the seating was intimate. We didn't have a reservation and it was Sweetest Day but they immediately sat us at a high top table by the bar, but it was still nice. The service was fantastic, he was prompt and knowledgeable and answered all our questions. I had the special roll of the day, tempura shrimp and beef tar tare and it was amazing. The plating was impressive as well. My wife had the crispy basil duck and it was delicious. This little spot is located adjacent to Crop Rocks and you can access it through a hallway marked \"restroom\" which was a little strange. But this is a great place in a great location. Almost forgot to mention the wasabi deviled eggs the waiter recommended. I'm glad he did because otherwise I wouldn't have gotten them. The balsamic drizzle really balanced out the spiciness of the wasabi. Great texture, this is place where you want to eat slow and savor every bite."}
{"text":"Not a fan from the start. We walked in on a Saturday around 7pm. The hostess immediately barked at us that there we could not get a table for 8 and we needed reservations. I asked if we could go to the bar and she said that we could but the staff was so busy that we may not get out food for like an hour. As I gazed into the virtually empty restraunt, I was more hungry than angry at this point so we decided we should take our chances at the bar.  The first bartender/server did not know anything about the saki or menu really. She was nice, but not too attentive.  Then Jerry came to our rescue and treated quite well. He suggested an awesome tuna nachos appetizer that is not normally on the menu and made us great drinks. The nachos were excellent, drizzed with some wasabi aioli.  Jerry derserves 5 stars...the rest does not."}
{"text":"As a fan of Crop, I was pretty excited to try this new addition to the line in the Flats!  I've been here twice- and I'm probably more a fan of their happy hour than the entrees.  Each time I've been here (given it's been a weekday), it hasn't been too full- I think maybe because it's just too new and not advertised enough? Either way, it's fine, as the servers at Crop Sticks are really friendly and I've had some good conversations with the waitstaff.  Entrees are pretty pricey, so I would just stick with the happy hour menu (the entrees are good, I'm sure, but I still prefer my pho and curries in Asiatown, please).  My faves off their happy hour menu: - The Chinese Five Spice Ribs- mmmm, that's well worth the 6 bucks and the meat is super tender! -Shishito peppers- I like this- it's not really spicy, and it's essentially stir fried peppers that you can dip in some tasty salt. - Wasabi deviled eggs- it definitely has a kick of wasabi in it, and was pretty good. Also, if you're thirsty, they serve hitachino! I thought that was pretty cool- you can't really find that many places (I've only really seen it at La Cave Du Vin in CLE).  Things i would avoid off the menu: - Veggie sushi- ummm, it's not sushi. It's definitely healthy, don't get me wrong, but the rice isn't sweetened and it just doesn't taste like sushi.  - Pork steamed buns- I had thought this was like the Momofuku steamed buns, but the buns were soggy with too much sauce and the pork slaw was sliding out of it. It's no momofuku pork belly bun, but just....like a taco in a white bun. I mean, it was good, but not what I was expecting (and thus, disappointment seeps in).  I think the location is cool and the restaurant is nice. There are some nice items on the list. Perhaps give it some more time, and i'm sure this place will gain popularity.   For now, definitely hit up the happy hour (only at the bar) for those ribs......"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Crop Sticks on Friday July 8, 2016- what a disappointment.  My friend and I walked in about 830pm- there were about 5 open tables and no line.  We were told there was a 15 minute wait.  A little perplexed we put our name on the list.  Came back from the restroom and was told our table was ready- great.  Busser gave us water- never acknowledged, welcomed us- never told us our server would be with us.  Glad he did not, because we never had a server come at all- reviewed the menu- waited 10 minutes- no server, no acknowledgement- nothing- wow- I am a business professional, and I will steer clear of this place as it was an embarrassment to the establishment."}
{"text":"I didn't check the Yelp rating of this place until I was there and checking in. I know - what was I thinking!? I'm glad I hadn't though because a 2.5 rating would have caused me to go elsewhere and I enjoyed my Crop Sticks experience.   Food I had the Spicy Tuna Roll for an appetizer. This roll is pretty identical wherever I seem to order it and I've come to realize the Spicy Tuna Roll is never spicy. However here, it was actually spicy. There was a dry heat that lingered in your mouth after each bite. I loved it. I thought the rolls were larger than average in size as well.   I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken for my main. The dish was flavorful, prepared well, and on par with Pad Thai I have had other places.   Service The waitress we had was really friendly and constantly refilled waters for the table. Another staff member also took turns doing this as he wandered around the restaurant.   The highlights of the service stop there however. When we first sat down the waitress asked if we had ever been in before. We said no and I was hoping to get a menu overview or some suggestions from her. Instead she simply said, \"You will find modern Asian cuisine on the menu.\" Also, and what mostly bothered me, was that the kitchen timing was really bad. I ordered sushi as an appetizer. Within 2 minutes of it being sat on the table our entrees arrived."}
{"text":"Wow. Pretty disappinting. Started with a couple of appetizers - crab Rangoon and pot stickers. No better than the take out around the corner in our neighborhood. Crop rock was great so had high expectations for here. Failed to impress. Would not have dinner here. Staff was nice. Atmosphere was ok....but it could not cover for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"We ordered the ribs and the crab cake.    Ribs: Very strong hoisen sauce style ribs.  It was actually a bit overpowering but the ribs were nicely cooked.  Crab cake: Very good and worked well with the accompaniment.  Mostly disappointed in the size.    Our service was impeccable, but overall we left hungry.  Ended up going next door to Crop Rocks and were more satisfied.    I'd go back, but mostly because there is always seating available, not because it'd be my top choice."}
{"text":"We waited an hour for a table with a 9pm reservation.  The bar tenders almost made up for it but we waited an hour for a table.    When we arrived at 8:50pm for a 9pm the hostess said it would be 10 minutes as a table was just closing their tab and they would clean up the table and have it ready for us in time for our reservation.  Then I saw her give the table to someone else.    When we asked her, she lied to us and said they also had a reservation but then there was not another table available for an hour.  If you make a mistake just apologize and give us the option to dine with you another time or dine at the bar.   The food is pretty good but not worth waiting that long.   They also ran out of Sapporo in all sizes."}
