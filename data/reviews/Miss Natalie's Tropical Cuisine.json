{"text":"First of all, I noticed the little typo in the restaurant's name. Miss Natalie's Topical C sounds like a medicinal ointment, lol! For the record, it is Miss Natalie's Tropical Cuisine.

On to the review.....sadly, I didn't have a positive experience with my first take-out here. Having had a long day, skipping lunch at work, and such a dreary rainy day, I was looking forward to a nice 'tropical' dinner that would wake up my taste buds. I ordered the oxtail, rice and peas, and a side of fried plantains. When I got home, I was dismayed to find that my plantains were blackened and soggy.  I suspect that this was fried earlier in the day and refried again, sooo definitely not fresh.  My oxtail and rice had no heat or spice, you'd think I walked home with the food container exposed to the rain, because that's how it tasted, washed out."}
{"text":"They are never open. Every time I call for pickup they're closed, even though their website says they're open. Food is alright, but I don't understand how they're making any money if they're closed all the time."}
{"text":"I went there once when they first opened and at that time, it was not good at all.  After seeing all the rave reviews online for this place recently, I decided to give it a second try. I decided to order a bit of everything to see what was good there.  It has definitely improved and is more than satisfactory, but still, not as good as my go to places for jerk and roti.  While very generous with the serving size, the chicken roti needed a bit more curry flavour and the jerk chicken needed to be slow cooked longer to be more tender. The slaw that came with the jerk dinner was tangy and vinegary.  I prefer the sweet creamy style that most other places have. The best item I tried were the doubles. That's one thing they do very well."}
{"text":"This is my second time going there and I have to say I couldn't have found a nicer owner.

The food is very tasty and fresh. The meat didn't smell and was well spiced, the doubles didn't smell like old oil and the chick peas also tasted fresh. 

I picked up food for the week on my second visit.

The place is clean and well kept but I know they'll be doing some renovations soon.

Will definitely be returning many times over."}
{"text":"I went in here with my friend back in the winter after having dinner at Anatolia as she wanted to order some curry and roti for her husband. The owner was quite chatty and seemed passionate about the food so I made note to eventually try it. Plus, my friend did indicate that, although her husband didn't want it, her son ate it and liked it. In fact, she had gone back maybe once or twice to pick it up again.

Anyway, one day I found myself craving jerk pork and Mitzie's was closed so what the heck, I'll try it as it's only \"advertised\" as $4.99. When I walked in, there were no other patrons in there. There was a big shoulder of jerk pork sitting in a warming area that looked like it was grilled with the bark so I was excited as I thought that's what I would be getting. I ordered the jerk pork with peas and rice. He brought out this teensy, weensy Styrofoam container that most restaurants would use for side salad. After he dished out the rice, he started to add gravy, which I thought was the oxtail gravy. Then he started putting pieces of meat from the gravy on to the rice. I thought he had mixed up my order and was giving me oxtail. When I looked, it was the meat swimming in the watery gravy. I wanted to walk out but, at this point, I was committed. The little sample size meal was actually $5.99 and I was charged $0.50 extra for using debit and it totaled a little less than $8.00 ... these freakin' places.

I gave him the benefit of the doubt because my friend said the food was good and it smelled good. When I went to eat it, half the pork was fat. He should have just named the dish, \"jerk fat with peas and rice.\" Not to mention, the rice had no seasoning - not even a touch of salt. The non-fatty pieces had no jerk flavor whatsoever; I'm not sure what his interpretation of jerk is but it was bland and low quality ingredients. I picked out all the fat and ate about five or six bites and then had to throw the rest away as I suspect it had been likely sitting around for days and just being reheated. The fat/pork was likely laced with MSG as I couldn't quench my thirst and felt bloated.

These con artists that pose as restaurateurs really need to go out of business. You can't charge people $8.00 for a bunch of fat! He's creepy and disgusting anyway and I'm predicting he'll eventually go out of business.

Zero or even -5 stars if that was possible."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying: I was so excited for this curry and roti joint to open. I am a lover of all things tropical, especially the food.

I walked in and thought that maybe they were not officially open. There was sign-age laying around and only half the space was furnished. At the counter, they had trays for food to be displayed, but it was empty, safe for a couple of plastic bags with what looked like bread sticks  in them.

I was willing to give them a chance though.  It takes a long time to move in and get cozy,  right?

I go to the counter and read the menu. Not knowing what I want, I asked who I can only assume was Miss Natalie what was good. \"Everything,\" was the reply.  I told her I understand that you like it all,  but what is the best? \"Everything,  it depends on what you like.\" I like everything. So I told her, but she still was unable to make a recommendation. I told her I was shocked she could not help me.

Frustrated (she couldn't just say jerk chicken?) I asked to speak to the chef (that's how I roll). I repeated the above question, simple right? What do you recommend? He tried to tell me that it depended on what I like. This again,  really? No. So I asked what he liked best and doesn't he pick up the menu and read it to me.

So, I went with curry chicken,  jerk pork and a side of coleslaw.  I guess the only positive is that it did not take long to make.

Money changes hands, I grab my food and walk home. Starved, I open it up right away and dig right in. And can I say, if this is the food they like, I understand not being able to recommend anything. I would recommend this to my dog.

The chicken was clearly over braised and dry and stringy. There was no sauce, but more like a curry smear on it. I need my sauce here folks.  Dry chicken on dry rice.  Eww.

The pork was almost entirely fat. And not the yummy kind, but the skin kind that is almost impossible to chew (unless crispy). We just threw it away. Also, I was told it would be spicy amd although cinnamon is a spice, it was not what I expected.

Lastly the coleslaw came in the tiniest take away container and it came open while walking home. I managed to get a little taste.
SPOILER ALERT: I think I cracked the recipe. Vinegar, cabbage and pepper

I could do better at home blindfolded. Sorry.

I really wanted them to be good, or at least decent. Shame on me for hoping.


UPDATE: My bad - I was enraged with the food, I did not spell check the restaurant name, although maybe if I had rubbed the food all over me instead of eating it... lol"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because of the previous reviews. But I've always been curious and want to try it out because I don't think it would stay open if the food is really that bad. I also noted that the last review was written way back in 2013. Anyway today I was in the area and was in the mood to take the risk. The blinking sign that said \"4.99 jerk\" was simply irresistible. Once I walked in I got a little wary-- it's not a fancy place and appeared a bit tacky. But as soon as I saw their juicylicious chicken I knew I did something right! The jerk chicken special is absolutely amazing: tasty and fresh and the spices are not overpowering unlike other jerk chicken dinners I've tried. This will be my new top favorite jerk in TO! The value is very good with such generous portions. Plantains for a toonie and you get a whole bunch unlike in other places where you get a few measly slices. I hardly write reviews anymore but I hate to see this place so wrongly underrated. I will definitely be back to try other stuff on their menu."}
