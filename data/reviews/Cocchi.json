{"text":"Top-Tip Parma: Wenn auch alles andere als zentral gelegen, hier fuehlt man siich geborgen bei bestem essen! Lokale Spezialitaeten, taegl. frische empfehlungen, grosse weinkarte und ein selbstgemachtes Eis, das im Mund schmilzt wie kein anderes. Also wirklich, aber das muss man probiert haben, um es zu verstehen. Also auf gar keinen Fall verpassen, wenn ihr in der Naehe seid und unbedingt reservieren  auch unter der Woche."}
{"text":"Ristorante Cocchi is about five minutes outside of the center of Parma, inside a quiet hotel. The restaurant itself is bustling, filled with locals who know where to get an amazing meal. The food was outstanding, one of the best meals I've ever had in Italy, and that is saying a lot. We had the tortelli trio, with truffle, classic ricotta and spinach, and squash, all of which were outstanding. The house specialty risotto wrapped in a paper thin slice of Parma ham is hand stirred (as opposed to par cooked, which is what a lot of restaurants do as a short cut), and was divine. The veal stuffed with parmesan actually a thin slice of veal with a polenta-like slice of heaven in the center. I'm sure pretty much everything on the menu is just as amazing.  It is on the nicer side- jeans and a t-shirt wouldn't fit in here. Make a reservation, its not a drop in kind of place."}

{"text":"Our experience at Cocchi exceeded all expectations.... what a wonderful first night out in Parma!! We made a reservation 3 weeks in advance and although we arrived 15 minutes early, we were seated immediately.  Starters: pumpkin soufflé and the special of fried bread and mixed salami and prosciutto.  The soufflé is not to be missed!!  One bottle of wine down, and we ordered the pasta.  Potato and truffle ravioli for my father, tortellini in bordo for my stepmother and I had the special: artichoke ravioli.  We all agreed- the artichoke ravioli was spectacular and had such a wonderful brightness to the dish.   Enter a bottle of Nobile and onto the mains: beef filet with olive oil and salt, rabbit loin stuffed with artichokes and the sea bass (also served with artichokes).  The beef was cooked rare to perfection and the olive oil gave it a subtle sweetness.  Wonderful!  And the rabbit was a wonderful surprise.  Incredibly tender and full of flavor.  The sea bass--perfectly cooked!  We skipped dessert... so no comments there.  Although all the desserts we saw come out looked fantastic.   The service was attentive and the staff didn't rush us through the meal.  We were also pleasantly surprised the restaurant offered an English menu and the gentleman that waited on us spoke English very well.  We were seated for a full two hours and spent around 200 Euros for the three of us.   I would highly recommend you make this a priority on your visit to Parma... it is about 10 Euro for a taxi from the downtown area."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  This was our last meal in Italy, so we had high expectations and it did not disappoint.  The menu changes all the time so our experience was unique to our mid-late October visit.  When in Parma, one must have a salumi platter and Cocchi has a tremendous selection.  Take your pick: it's all delicious.  Primi: The truffle tortelli were possibly the best thing we ate all trip and the gnocchi were \"special\".  Secondi: If they have the foie gras, get it.  It was spectacular."}
{"text":"This was a phenomenal stop in Parma.   Since our hotel was a little off the beaten path, we found ourselves at this restaurant because of its close location. It's in a neighborhood that's rough around the edges, in an unassuming hotel. The dining room is filled with locals. The night we went, there was not one English (or German) speaking group in the room. A good sign.   Everything was fantastic. Tortellini trio was a highlight, as were the cured meats. I don't think you can go wrong on this menu.  Service was very friendly and attentive."}

A Michelin Guide rated space, though a touch too pricy for Bib Gourmand and not quite refined enough to nab a Star in the most recent guide, it was precisely on time that entry was made into the reception and attached bar area, a Tuxedoed man quickly offering greetings and confirming the reservation, his English almost accentless as specials were recited; several of them quite enticing, as was the menu itself.  Far more affordable than other restaurants of its ilk, particularly when accounting for the quality of ingredients and the service involved, it was while crunching on housemade Breadsticks that four-courses were requested, a nibble of 20 Month Parmigiano Reggiano offered gratis with a total cost of 87 for seven plates to follow.  Passing preparation times with quiet conversation, only three other tables occupied throughout the 100-minute stay, it was not long before a plate of cured pork from Antica Corte Pallavicina arrived with Torta Fritta, each luxurious bite a reminder of dinner one night prior while the Pumpkin Souffle offered a lesson in fluffiness that may well have floated off the plate were it not for the rich Cream accompanying it.  Producing every Pasta on the menu in-house, specials featuring Mushrooms at the peak of season, the decision to try plump Potato Gnocchi topped with Piedmontese Beef and a chunky sauce of Chanterelles plus White Beans, the trio of Tortelli offering a taste of complex fillings inside delicate wrappers with a dusting of Parmigiano atop Brown Butter.  Finding \"Veal Breast - in the Tradition of Parma\" quite different from Italian-American \"Veal Parm,\"  the sliced breast stuffed with Bread Crumbs alongside fried Potatoes and a Stew of Peppers plus Tomatoes, dessert was presented tableside first as a slice of rustic Peach Pie atop an all-Butter crust that was robust and flaky, the Chocolate Budino a warm pile of baked Custard that necessitated Coffee to balance its sweetness,  an accompaniment of Zabaglione unfortunately going too fast with a flavor that would have probably justified licking the plate clean."}
