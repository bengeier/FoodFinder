{"text":"We were fooled by the guy who left the review saying it was the best pizza in Montreal. That is not true. We had the vegetarian. It was terrible. Watery. The best pert was when we added hot sauce to it. Blech."}
{"text":"On m'avait recommandé la pizza, et je ne l'ai pas autant aimée. Je l'ai trouvé ordinaire. La pâte ne goûtait pas tellement. J'ai commandé autre chose mais c'est en dernier ressort que je les appelle."}
{"text":"Really not impressed with the quality of ingredients they use on their pizza -    I paid 35$ for a pizza that looked very generic nothing wow or fresh about it -   The asparagus seemed from a can all dead and soggy when they should have had some crunchiness on.  I've had had better pizza at those 2-1 pizzerias   I've given 2 chances to this place that supposedly is amazing but frankly if you expectations are high you will be highly disappointed with a frustration of wasting money on bad quality food-"}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever.... End of sentence. Nothing in Toronto has come close in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm not prone to over-emphasis, but I firmly believe that my dinner at Woodland restaurant was the worst dining experience I've ever had.   It started when the server took our orders. She had an attitude, just in her movements and the way she spoke - there was no smile on her face, she didn't ask how our day was or give us any greeting. She walked up and said, verbatim, \"what do you want?\" I chose to ignore the attitude, and we placed our orders - a caesar salad and sauteed mushrooms for me, tortellini and a Shirley Temple for him with a side of garlic bread to share. They brought out the salad with bacon - I don't eat meat, my fault, I should have asked. However to describe the server's attitude as indignant would be an understatement. She started telling me about all the hassle it caused her to bring it back, and how I should know better than to assume it didn't have bacon, and couldn't I just pick it off? I've been in the industry for a few years and know that it doesn't matter - the customer is always right, she shouldn't have picked the fight.   The food was underwhelming. I was vomiting in the bathroom from my sauteed mushrooms which were not just poorly cooked but were clearly no longer fresh. The salad was bland, along with my boyfriend's meat sauce. When the server came back to check on how our food was tasting we were open with her. We told her that everything but the garlic bread was pretty awful. And then she walked away. She didn't ask how she could fix the problem (as any good server should have) nor did she sympathize or ask us to explain what was wrong. She didn't even acknowledge us. She just walked off to the next table without words nor utterances. When I eventually managed to call her back after what was literally five or ten minutes of her ignoring me I informed her that because the food left me throwing up in the bathroom I would like my meal to be taken off the bill. And that's where she lost it.   \"What? Oh no no, I can't do that.\" She turned away to leave again. \"Excuse me,\" I said, \"It's made me sick.\" She looked at me like I was stupid \"Well I can't just TAKE IT OFF, oh no, of course not. If you're not happy with your meal I can grab the manager or call the police.\" I can't invent that. She threatened to CALL THE POLICE because we were unhappy with the food. I asked to speak to the manager and she said she'd grab him in a few minutes as he was busy. We spent about twenty or twenty five minutes (my boyfriend checked his watch!) waiting for him while I was huddled into my booth, trying to make my stomachache go away. Eventually she just dropped off the bill (without a word, of course) and left. Naturally, we didn't tip. When she returned she saw the bill and counted out the bills and coins we'd left for her. \"Wow, thanks,\" she said, sarcastically \"don't feel like you have to come back here again.\" I'm not joking. She actually said that.   To their credit, our experience seemed to be an uncommon one. It seems like their pizza is pretty good, but unfortunately the server didn't exactly want us coming back."}
{"text":"Pizza with the dough balls on it and the salad dressing is the main reason I call. Try it out :) Yumm"}
{"text":"First off Tiago must work for a pizza place in verdun !! Woodland pizza is montreals best pizza period!!!the pizza is done with perfection and this allegation it's  cheap is absolutely BS.everything that is made is made with love !!! I recommend giving the cheeseburger with bacon a try!!! Wow!!!  On woodlands worst days they would get a 4 and a half and that's due to maybe them Being so busy that they forgot a minor detail!!!  Besides that woodland pizza is 10 stars"}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 club sandwiches for pickup, easy and hassle free ordering, the guy on the phone very polite - when I asked if I could substitute onion rings for fries he said \"of course\"!  The sandwiches are amazing, loaded w/ white meat chicken and crispy bacon cooked to perfection, delicious coleslaw too!  Will def order from here again now that I know it's there!"}
{"text":"Restaurant que j'adore littéralement. Tous ce que j'y ai goûté est excellent. Ce n'est pas de la grande cuisine mais leurs plats sont tout de même vraiment bons. Il y a un peu de monde par contre sur l'heure du souper."}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype about this place. The pizza isn't good. Rubbery cheese, flavourless sauce."}
{"text":"Grew up on their Pizza. It's in my view one of THE BEST. Their cheese mix on pizza is by far the most delicious I've ever eaten. I've also had their subs... incredible but make sure salad dressing on the side but pepperoni and sub is outstanding! Clubs and the rest of the menu is simply amazing. A must try as you will keep going back again and again. I've been going since my childhood and my kids are now hooked on it :-)"}
{"text":"This place is five minutes down the street from my place so I dropped by for a ham & pineapple pizza. They use delicious slices of ham instead the tiny cubes you usually see. Service was really friendly and quick, will definitely revisit. Would be nice to see more local brews on tap but that's a minor complaint. A solid family restaurant."}
{"text":"Just ate my first \"all-dressed\" pizza from Woodland. As I was eating the third slice, I was wondering whether a pepperoni pizza had been delivered by mistake. I was quite disappointed as there were hardly any vegetables. I had to look for the few thinly sliced mushrooms and the barely there small pepper pieces. Also, the crust was quite soggy. As a pepperoni pizza, it was o.k. but nothing to write home about! I was expecting better with all the favourable reviews. Will have to go back to ordering from Mory's pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the restaurant is ok too. They have some really good veteran servers too! Too bad they don't deliver to Nun's Island."}
{"text":"Pour la pizza. Je n'ai jamais osé commander autre chose puisque j'ai toujours été satisfait de la pizza ici. Toujours la classique toute garnie. Le service est rapide et amical. Le soir à partir du mercredi c'est un endroit très occupé. Après avoir manger, allez donc faire une petite marche en face sur le bord de l'eau. Superbe vue à proximité."}
{"text":"Imagine that feeling u get when someone tells u: \"oh their *insert menu item here* is the best you've ever had!!\" ...it's partially like \"Challenge accepted!\" and partially like \"yah right dude calm down i'm sure it's not that good\". That's how this place is to burgers...and in my opinion, burgers ONLY. All 4 stars of this rating go to the burgers.   That situation occurred originally with their pizza. So i tried it and it was the latter reaction. My boyfriend likes their pizza though. Personally i don't. Imo their pizza is awful and not worth a second thought ever. The sauce is bland and yet sweet but watery ...the dough seems like the stuff u get from a chain or cheap place, the toppings are rubbery and meh. I know ppl will flip out for me saying this but it's true, their pizza sux balls.   Their poutine too is a terrible disaster of a Québécois slap in the face. The fries are at best ok on their own (but they really aren't very good at all) and their cheese and gravy both in taste and quantity fails to do anything but disappoint.   Their subs too are like... Um yah...that's what a sub tastes like. Way to not do sumthin original with it or anything.   But their burgers my gawd. Their burgers. One in every 10 orders they f it up and it's too burnt or the meat is surely not as fresh as it coulda been or sumthin...but mostly it's always the most spot on perfect charcoal-cooked juicy tasty tender burger you've had anywhere... nay...the BEST burger you've had anywhere!   Go ahead, challenge accepted?"}
{"text":"I've tried everything on the menu and it's all very good especially the surf and turf But my favorite is their Pizza which I consider the best I've ever had. Easily the best pizza in town!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Good ratio of toppings to base. Not too greasy. Always try to come here whenever we are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Do you like Pizza? I mean  tomatoey loaded with pepperoni old school pizza with enough cheese to choke on? No fancy crap, no special toppings. Just straight-up awesome Pizza that makes you drool just by opening the box. Can't wait to see the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"One of the better spots in Montreal.. They have the beat grilled chicken ceasar salad in Montreal. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I've come here several times for supper when I was too lazy to cook. By far, the best pizza in the Verdun/Lasalle area. perfect crust, tasty sauce and not-too-oily melted cheese. Order your pizzas here, they're a little more expensive than other places down the street but they are definitely better quality too.  I've had several other items here too, their club sandwiches are great and come with perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside fries. Their French Onion soup, \"gratinee\", is probably the best soup you can ask for when it's -30 outside. Service can be hit or miss. There are some waitresses here who have been here for years and they're quite nice, the younger ones are still learning."}
{"text":"What awful food!!! How can you mess up a Greek salad by letting it swim in a dressing that tastes like mayonnaise? And, the pizza was gluey and had rubbery cheese. I expected much better with all the Yelp stars."}
{"text":"Good pizza, not the best that I've eaten.   Personally I love a good pizza, Woodland definitely satisfies that craving. Although I would not put it up there with the best pizza that I have eaten, it's probably in my top 5.   In you live in the Verdun/Ile-des-Soeurs area you have to make this your go to pizza place because there is none better."}
{"text":"Pour une bonne pizza avec des étages de peperroni à ne plus finir, Woodland est un endroit parfait. Vous pouvez manger sur place, commander pour emporter ou même faire livrer si vous êtes dans le sud-ouest de l'ile. Le setup est assez impressionnant avec au moins une dizaines de personnes derrière le comptoir de pizza qui n'arrête pas du tout de chômer. Une des filles qui prenaient les commandes était dédiée seulement au téléphone et n'a pas eu l'air d'avoir le temps d'arrêter prendre son souffle entre les appels. Je n'ai pas mangé sur place donc je ne peux pas parler du service de côté là. Allez-y pour la pizza, ou encore mieux, appelez pour commander et allez leur dire bonjour en la ramassant vous-même."}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Their pizza, souvlaki, subs, everything basically is good. Good prices, fast service."}
