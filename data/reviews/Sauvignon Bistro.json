{"text":"The chorizo pasta is the best pasta I've ever had (and I've been to italy). Nice patio and always good service. The beaches actually lacks great restaurants so this place wins it for me."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, on the pricey side for the Beach, but well worth it for the 8 - 10 visits we have experienced. Nice new patio to give them more outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Restaurant im französischen Bistro Stil. Tolle Einrichtung und schöne Atmosphäre. Hier möchte ich am liebsten täglich einkehren. 
Das Personal ist schnell, freundlich, unaufdringlich und bietet professionellen Service. 
Die - Auswahl ist enorm und deckt alle wichtigen Gebiete ab, so dass für jeden Geschmack und zu jedem Essen das passende dabei ist. Man hat die Wahl zwischen offenen Weinen oder Flaschen, wobei man sogar Flaschen mit 0,5 Litern bekommen. Gut zum Teilen. 
Das Essen und Dessert  war ausgezeichnet und köstlich. Ich hatte das vegetarische Gerichte mit Aubergine  das wirklich schön spicy war, genau nach meinem Geschmack. Mein Begleiter hatte das Konfit mit Ente und war extrem begeistert. 
Die Portionen waren gut zum satt werden und genau richtig. Wir haben uns das Dessert geteilt, was problemlos ging. Espresso-Creme Brûlée zum niederknien. Ein fruchtiger Grappa rundete den Abend ab. Das Bistro Sauvignon ist unbedingt empfehlenswert!"}
{"text":"Have always been curious when passing by and we tried it Monday evening. Nice, funky ambience, kind of like New Orleans. Food was terrific, tried the calamari then shared the mussels and pasta. Excellent. Service was gracious and not rushed. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at for special occasions. The food is always excellent in a French bistro style. The service is efficient and always friendly."}
{"text":"Solid neighbourhood bistro. Friendly staff and comfortable decor. The menu changes regularly with some old customer favorites (Caesar salad, NY strip loin with sweet potato frites). The food tends to be excellent with a Middle Eastern flair, no doubt a function of the kitchen staff. Everything is solid. Nicely selected wine list with lesser-known and interesting choices. In general, the dishes are perhaps a bit large, which may not be a complaint for many, but I would prefer them be smaller (just a small point). This is a regular local haunt of mine, and I recommend it without hesitation."}
{"text":"Why would a restaurant bring the glasses of wine you ordered to go with your dinner to the table while you're still enjoying your cocktails? Worse, why would a restaurant bring your first course to the table while you're still enjoying your cocktails? Felt rushed, felt like opening day. Food was fine, though, despite the service."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD IN THE BEACHES. I had a fantastic Valentine's meal!  I went to Sauvignon last night with my Mister to have a late VD celebration and was elated to discover this gem of a restaurant in my neighbourhood.  The atmosphere was intimate and romantic, the service was warm and attentive, the wine list extensive, the entree portions generous, and the food exceptional.  
I had the steak-frites ($35).  The steak was fresh, pleasantly tender, and cooked a perfect medium rare.  The frites were crisp, favourful, and not overly salted like most places.  The mushroom puree and tomato jam will stars in my dreams in the weeks to come.   
My mister had the veal special with saffron risotto ($38).  I had a taste of his veal and it was as tender as butter.  HIs risotto was well cooked and the saffron was properly used (My boyfriend is Persian and is a saffron connoisseur).
We shared the goat's cheesecake ($9) for dessert.  The sweetness of the crust and tartness of the goat's cheese filing were well balanced.  It was rich, but appropriately proportioned. 
The prices might be a trifle high for some, including myself. (I am a student and my boyfriend isn't exactly a Vanderbilt) But it is in direct correlation to the quality and generous portions of the food.  Sauvignon offers a fixe prix menu for either $15 or $20 Monday and Tuesday.  I can assure you my boyfriend and I will be back."}
{"text":"Best ceasar salad, New York strip loin, feature red wine and dessert spot in east toronto.  Period.  

Service, pace, venue and price are bang on.    

If you stick to the menu above...you cannot go wrong.   Amazing.  And consistently so."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. I remember some years back, I had this lovely vegetable quinoi dish with butternut squash and I would have it every time. I have not been back for a very long time, and went just last Friday and I was delighted to find the menu had changes somewhat, but disappointed that they no longer had the quinoi. 

Intro. It was around 8-ish that my amour and I decided to go out and eat. I was starving and didn't feel like wandering around looking for somewhere to eat. I suggested Sauvignon which was the closest restaurant to my place, and, that was not fast food. I was a bit apprehensive though because this place is always very busy and on a Friday night before the long weekend? Luckily, we got a table for 2.

Food. Good but don't expect the wow factor. I had (can you guess?) the duck - crispy skin, a little dry, but tasty altogether. My amour had the spicy pork dish, and it WAS spicy. But, there is a cool crème fraiche-like sauce which cools your tongue, so it is a thoughtfully put-together dish. For appetizers, we both shared mussels which, in my opinion, was average (I have never had bad mussels, so...) The mussel broth was great for dipping the chunky bread that is served at the beginning. 

Ambiance. Intimate. It's a small restaurant, and the dark-toned walls give it at an almost romantic atmosphere. There is outdoor seating for warmer days, however, I find sitting on the uncomfortable, metal chairs a damper on the whole outdoor dining experience. No complaints about the service: efficient where it needs to be.

All in all, a staple in Leslieville. In the immediate block, I find this is one of the nicer restaurants (amidst the pubs and Starbucks and Harvey's). My parents have come here many a time and it's hard to explain, but Sauvignon is neither bad nor outstanding. It's a restaurant where you kind of want to go, but kind of don't want to go. My mom has said that there really is nothing to eat, and I fear that even with the menu change, we will go here as a last resort. Yet, it is a nice cozy place and if you just want to relax with good company and good wine, then let Sauvignon be your next stop."}
{"text":"I went here for a family gathering and had a chance to try out several of the items on the menu. Overall, I was disappointed in the food. 
The salads were very plain. The dumplings were deep fried and tasted like pizza rolls? So strange. I had the duck and it was good, but I expected much better. 
My girlfriend had the chorizo pasta and recommended it. The lamb at the table went mostly uneaten... not a good sign.  
Otherwise the service was attentive and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, pleasant décor but most of the dishes we chose were disappointing. Started with a squash and ginger soup but could not taste the squash for all the cumin. Had nice heat from the ginger but couldn't taste it because of overwhelming cumin. My partner had foie gras served with buckwheat pancakes. He was disappointed in the size of the seared foie gras and the pancakes were bland and stale. On to the next course. My green salad had the dullest dressing ever, tasteless slivers of what they called pear, uninspired beets and a few pecans. But the frites with aioli were tasty and generous in portion. Hubs had rack of lamb on polenta with kale and something tomatoey, The lamb looked and tasted fabulous. Polenta and the rest suffered from the same bland treatment. I would not venture any dessert because I could not face any more disappointment. On the whole for a big price, not worth it."}
{"text":"I really liked this room.  I loved the colours, the layout and the relative quiet of this place.  It's really comfortable here and when I walked in I immediately fell in love with the place.  Unfortunately, the food really didn't match the decor.  It wasn't bad but it was uninspired.  It might be a great place to bring people who are very unadventurous eaters.   Steak was ho-hum.  Duck was good, but a bit dry.  Frites were terribly greasy.   Service was efficient but not very warm.  

I think I will come back to this place to enjoy the bar, but I'll probably eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yay, came back to Toronto after 8 years away, and this place is as good as ever, with the same staff."}
{"text":"Very disappointing dinner on June 1st. I had the braised lamb shank and the meat was very tough.  I needed a steak knife to cut it. I was still hungry after finishing my dinner and went somewhere else. I was not offered anything else. 
Maybe the cook was just changed but I was very unhappy with my meal .
I read some other reviews and they were all good but my experience was not any more then a 2 star"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. My boyfriend and I were blown away! I had crab/pork dumplings to start and my boyfriend had the tenderloin cabbage rolls - both were incredibly delicious. I also had the duck, and it was wonderfully moist and tasty on the inside, and perfectly crisp on the outside. My boyfriend had the cod on ragout done to perfection. For dessert we had a chocolate creme brulee that was out of this world. We are definitely coming back and telling all of our friends about this place. It deserves 10 stars but we could only give it a maximum of five. A perfect gem in the beaches. I only review restaurants that I like, and it's especially hard to find amazing restaurants in the city. I recommend everyone to eat here and you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy. Went to have dinner last night and really enjoyed what we ordered. Service was prompt and friendly. We had the grilled calamari with jicama as an appetizer. The vegetarian quinoa and chickpea dish and the rack of lamb. Everything was perfect! We'll be going back for sure"}
{"text":"An old friend took me here to celebrate her new job, which I helped her get, last Friday night. They are regulars, but I am not, but I was warmly greeted when I arrived just after they opened and was promptly served a dry martini which made the week's stress melt away while I waited for the other guests to arrive.
The food was lovely, served impeccably hot from the kitchen. Two of us had the schnitzel and three of us had desserts, including a delicious chocolate marquise. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The duck was fantastic. Moist, great flavor and crispy skin. Enjoyed the tomato and goat cheese salad too. The toffee pudding wasn't quite what I expected, but it was good as well. Nice, cozy place on the edge of he Beach neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood bistro.  The staff are very attentive and the room has a great atmosphere.  Came in with another couple who were regulars and we thank them for bringing us here.  The food was great as was the wine.  It was a good food experience from the moment we stepped in until we departed."}
{"text":"I can't believe there are only 6 reviews??!! This is such an adorable place with dimmed red lanterns and cute tables/chairs. I had the duck, it's a slightly dry outside, but it's extremely juicy inside. My friend's beef is also very well done! I have to admit this place is a bit pricey, but it's beach area, what do you expect!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great. Good service and a great wine list. I would try the orecchiette."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here - had the duck, and the creme brulee for dessert was amazing.  Great service.  I found the food to be fairly authentic French cuisine, based on five years living in Paris."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to have dinner in the beach area. The food is delicious and prepared with care. I love the Caesar salad. I would like more vegetarian options, generally it is salads, soup, an appetizer and a main. Having a couple more veg choices in the mains would be nice. They do have a good selection of fish choices. The atmosphere is cosy with original photographs on the walls. Front and side patio dining is offered during the summer and a little entrance to block most of the wind when entering is put up in the winter. There is a lot of thought that goes into the atmosphere, menu and wine selection. The entire staff is excellent, attentive and welcoming. I like everything about this special little place and have enjoyed my meal and my experience on every visit! I hope to get back again soon."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service. There were no tables when we came in but they set one up for the four of us. Very attentive bartenders and waiters. Def would recommend"}
{"text":"On it's own, with lower prices this place would be ok. But for the prices they charge - very very meh.

I expected flavourful delicious fish, chicken and appetizers, but I was disappointed. Quite average and no real appetizers to share - very salad heavy. Service was odd with one man running around everywhere and talking at us without listening. It was hard to get his attention. If you're in the beaches neighbourhood and have nowhere else to go - sure. Otherwise, not worth seeking out from another part of the city."}
{"text":"I've been going there for a while now and I love it there . The staff are very friendly , the decor is nice and their red fringy lampshades are very French ( at least if it was the 40s :)
 Everything off their appetizer menu is amazingly tasty and the food is just wonderful . Especially their steak . Sit outside on the patio and Try it with the Rose. You won't be disappointed ."}
