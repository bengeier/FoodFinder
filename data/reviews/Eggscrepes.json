{"text":"The food is amazing here. Service was fast. The crepes & poutine were fantastic.  Big portions, too"}
{"text":"I visit EggsCrepes once a year on my back from Montreal and I make sure that this is where we have breakfast every time. A selection of breakfast foods with special attention made to fresh fruits is what makes this restaurant stand out. Their name does them justice as both eggs and crepes are second to none. I usually order a bacon cheddar omelette and with the home fries, fruit and toast, I always leave satisfied. If in the area, I highly recommend this place. Great food, friendly bilingual service and an affordable price."}
