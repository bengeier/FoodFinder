{"text":"I love this place! I always get the chicken parm, and it is delicious.  The portion is great, and the prices are fair.  I often get take out, as I work rather close. I call ahead so it is ready by the time I get there."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. One of my favourites in all of Toronto. Their \"Uno\" sandwich has been a weekly staple for me for quite some time now. Great rice balls too! They also do awesome sandwich platters for catering."}
{"text":"Being from the middle east, I wouldn't say Im an expert on italian food. But I've tried my fair share! Excellent place! The penne I had were done right."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a beautiful Saturday. We were happy to find we could be seated right away. Our server was pleasant and attentive. The food was excellent. I had the salad l'americana (greens,egg,chicken,tomato,cuc,bacon, onions and cheese) and my husband had the daily special which was a mix of mushrooms,sausage,peppers,tomato sauce and potato medallions -- both are highly recommended.   we will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"A lineup this long usually means good things, and this place is indeed a good thing.  It serves pastas, sandwiches, and salads: the trifecta of \"I feel like Italian for lunch.\"  The sandwich I had (breaded eggplant) was excellent--not too heavy, but nicely filling, with briny artichokes and fresh tomatoes to complement the eggplant.  Go only if you have time for a wait, though--the place is popular at peak lunch hours, and the prices make this place more a treat than a regular lunch spot."}
{"text":"Rumor has it they're opening a new second location east of the city. Richmond St. East area, I think I over heard sherbourne and not sure when they are slated to open though.  keep you posted."}
{"text":"Clean, attentive and food was delicious. Nice ambience. I was with my 3 yr old daughter.  They didn't had crayons but immediately looked for markers and paper.  Excellent service. Pasta portions are generous.  They don't have koda menu but do offer any pasta half for children for $6.  My daughter ate all her pasta which was bolognese.  I had the Vodka which also was great.  Ingredients seems very fresh and food was delicious.  Really nice lunch.  We were very satisfied."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Fusaro's Kitchen as we were walking around the area looking for a place for dinner.  We ordered the putanesca and chicken parmasan. The putanesca was perfect, with a real al dente texture.  Flavor was also very good, not to the point of being too overwhelming or greasy. The chicken parmasan came with penne pasta.  The chicken was crispy and very well done, as opposed to some other places that serve them soggy. The pasta was very standard.  We especially liked that the environment was not pretentious, and has a comfortable home feel. The service was excellent and our server regularly checked up on us. The prices were very reasonable, including wine ($6 for a generous glass of house white). Portions were just enough to leave you satisfied and content, without overfilling you.  Will definitely come back when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Though it has become somewhat expected to find a good panini in any major world city, I'd say that Fusaro's makes a very good one.   Tried the \"Otto\"; grilled chicken, roasted peppers, provolone and pesto mayo, and it was excellent. All the ingredients were fresh and tasty, and the pairing of tastes was perfect.  Fun little place too, with outdoor seating and some interesting-looking pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice after a visit to the AGO for delicious, generous individual pizza--thin crust with lots of topping. The beer choices are very limited, but they had a Creemore on tap. Service was friendly, fast and attentive in both visits. This seems to be a popular neighbourhood spot, full by 7:00 with a mix of young people, middle-aged business men, and older friends sharing an early dinner--cheerful and chattery, not a spot for a lingering tete a tete. The patio gets you close to the lively street scene."}
{"text":"I've been there twice for dinner in the past week.  What do I love about this place? Fresh food, at a great price.  Last night I had the seafood pasta and my gf had the veal parm entree. The $16 seafood pasta had plenty of mussels, scallops and shrimp and some calamari. The linguini was amazing. I could slurp them up for hours. So light! And the perfect texture. We've had the $13 veal parm on two occassions and once it came with bowtie pasta and last night it came with skinnier rotini. As others have mentioned, it may be a bit firmer than you make at home. Did I mention that the veal parm comes with a small caeser salad?! It's not a huge side but it's enough for me (but I suppose I'm primarily a meat eater).  For dessert, you have to try the tiramisu. Soft, delicious. and $4.50. We also had the peanut butter & nutella cookie which was forgettable.  A great entree and dessert for about $40-45 for two people after tax and tip (but no beverage) - that's cheaper than plenty of the chain restaurants around.  It's renewed my faith small restaurants can get it right, without pretension, and at a great price.  The restaurant is pretty quiet (i.e. no over-bearing music) so it's a great place for friends to catch up or to get to know someone."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is a neighborhood gem. We were there last year and enjoyed it but with so many restaurants in our hood we just got around to going back today.  The interior is very low key and unpretentious but the menu is terrific The daily specials are clearly listed and contain something for everyone.  We had the veal piccata special and the pasta bolognese along with a Caesar salad appetizer that was so large that even with two people sharing there was still enough for a third.  The value is amazing for the quality of the food and the serving staff were very friendly and made the whole experience totally enjoyable."}
{"text":"This was not good Italian, but you get what you pay for I suppose. The veal Parmesan was mediocre at best the breading was mushy and fell off. The pomodoro sauce tasted like it was out of a can. The chicken articano was a little better, but could use more spices and was a little heavy."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the only negative thing I can think of about this place is the hours (closed on sunday, only open until 4pm on saturday). Other than that, this place probably makes one of the best panini in Toronto. They have other items on the menu which are ok, but if this is your first time I would recommend trying a panini. Inside the place is nice and they have a nice small patio in front. The service is also fantastic. I have found the servers to be very friendly and will take the time to chat with you and ask if you are enjoying your meal. All in all, this is a fantastic place for a sandwich and a cold italian beer! (they offer 'Poretti' which I had for the first time here - it's a very light beer and will appeal to the heineken/stella crowd)"}
{"text":"After a nice walk along the lake, we were hungry and ready for some pasta. I've passed by this place many times but never really notice what type of restaurant it was until I looked it up. It was busy with the office lunch crowd. So many people ordering take-out as well as dinning in, but good that we were able to find a table to enjoy. My friend and I both ended up ordering the same thing (we didn't know what each other ordered until it was brought to our table and notice it was the same dish).  We ordered the FIORENTINA - rigatoni, chicken, spinach, in a fresh tomato and basil pesto sauce. The pasta dish was steaming hot when it got to our table, which I love, I hate cold pasta. The homemade pasta sauce was delicious, pasta was boiled just right, not hard and not mushy. It was a good size plate for lunch, I was just full and hit the spot. Now I have found a nice Italian place close by home with reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of theirs for a few years now and have noticed the service is horrible of late. I tried to order something for lunch today and they said that they are no longer taking orders for single items??? If you have ever been there during lunch you would know that it's about a half an hour more before you get your food for take out? I've also noticed that they do not display the prices on the website anymore (which usually means price changes and  extra charges) and that they have become petty with things like extra sauce on a chicken parm sandwich is a dollar extra even though we all know that they are only adding a half spoon more of it.The only reason they get three stars from me is because the food is rather good but between wait times and petty extra charges, I will be looking for somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Best cheap pasta in the city.  Chicken wrap is great, paninis are good too.  Spicy sausage penne add roasted red peppers."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, very reliable in terms of food and service. I live in the neighbourhood so used to be in here a lot. There has been a noticeable, steady decline in both food quality and service in the last 6 months. They seem to have gotten rid of all their regular, awesome staff and replaced them with less attentive, very young staff. The menu has changed, they told me to pare down the ingredients (fine! great food can be so simple), but the quality has also gone downhill (not as fresh, not cooked as well, most of their menu is now a different combination of the same thing). Still better than most in the neighbourhood (1 million times better than Subway and Tim Hortons on the opposite corners), but I really wish they'd put some quality back into the service and food. I want to love you again Fusaro's!"}
{"text":"There's nothing bad I can say about this place. Every time I've gone in the staff have been helpful and attentive and the food has always been amazing. I usually go for the Chicken Parm Panini and a small Cesare Insalata and it never fails me. I once ordered a pasta dish (I believe it was a la vodka) and they also provided complimentary bread with spicy mayo and some peppers and it was probably one of the best away-from-home meals I have had. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the staff are very welcoming.   Can't wait to try more from Fusaro's."}
{"text":"Great pizza here: crust nice and thin but not burnt. Tomato sauce very well made. Only complaint is that their creamy white spaghetti sauce is very very salty. Personally would have preferred less cream in there but doesn't take away from the great quality food served on the menu."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Fusaro's. From the relaxed atmosphere to great food this spot is always on point. Pastas and Panini's are always a top choice and the homemade sauce is as good as it gets. Nothing is coming out of a jar here. End your meal with an espresso and you're good to go."}
{"text":"Great pasta, nice place, and really yummy tiramisu. Good vegetarian selection as well, as they're happy to do substitutions for any dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"ok... this place is goooooood!    I work nearby, so I come here everything other week for lunch.  My favorites are the vegetarian lasagna which is cheesy (but not overkill), has a good amount of eggplant and is in general a very homey dish and the Otto Panini, really yummy combination of grilled chicken breast, roasted red peppers, and pesto mayo (sounds typical, but somehow they do it just right)."}
{"text":"Excellent. I am from Florida and am visiting Toronto and I noticed that not only are most of the italian restaurants too pricy, they are all served with mini portions leaving any man hungry.   This restaurant has it right. Nice size portions, margarita pizza had great tangy tomato sauce and good cheese. The dough was nice as well, high quality products. My wife's gnocchi was solid. The small Cesar salad was flavorful. Service was great and I walked out the door spending less than $40 Canadian after tip and that awful 13% tax they charged people in Toronto.   Absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best sauce period! Never had sauce as good as Fusaros! I recommend this place all the time for pasta lovers. Delicious! !!"}
{"text":"This place came recommended to me by a co-worker. I must admit, I've probably passed this restaurant so many times without realizing it was there! It's in the same strip as Fresh on Spadina.   We came in on an early Friday evening, around 6:30 or so. Restaurant was mostly full but there were one to two tables clear so we didn't have to wait long. Service was great, the waitress came by quickly with waters and told us to take our time. Service remained constant throughout too which I appreciate.   I ordered the penne vodka. The plate was huge and came in pipping hot from the kitchen. For the price, it was an absolute steal for fresh Italian food. I couldn't finish my portion so I had to take it home - the pasta tasted better the next day. This place is definitely recommended and a great place to catch up with friends, go on a date, or with family."}
{"text":"Friend and I had a fantastic dinner at this little Italian kitchen.  Authentic Italian food served up in a simple, non pretentious setting. The servers are friendly and personable as well as knowledgeable about the menu.    Portions are quite large for pizza and pasta.  They don't skimp out one bit. I had the house chardonnay which was great and only $6 for the glass.  We spent about $40 for two entrees and one glass of wine.  We left feeling very satisfied."}
{"text":"Went to Fusaro's for dinner with a friend.   It wasn't quite what we were expecting when we walked in, with a cool, very casual, seat-yourself atmosphere. Chalk boards over the kitchen, and along the wall showcased their menu itmes.   What was most shocking about Fusaro's were the prices, which ranged from $7-$12. !!! They extremely reasonable for Italian cuisine. We ordered some sort of cold cut and cheese platter to start out with (which I don't see on the online menu) which had some really tasty meats and other treats. My friend and I both ordered the siciliana, which was their penne with sausage. This was quite delishes for the $11 price point. The food suited the prices we paid, and for that we were happy. If you're looking for fine Italian where everything is made from scratch with over-the-moon flavour, this isn't your place. But if you're looking for an everyday yummy meal at a fair price, then go to Fusaro's Kitchen.   PS. We weren't over the moon on the wines either. I wonder if they do a corking fee?"}
{"text":"Classic Italian dishes, served by charming staff. Delicious and made right. Pasta was cooked perfectly and loved the sauce. Only thing was I didn't like the bread with olive oil pre-loaded, I prefer to load my own oil bread. Long live carbs."}
{"text":"I popped by the other day for a late lunch and sat on the patio. I ordered an otto(grilled chicken sandwich) it was really good."}
{"text":"I ordered the Siciliana pasta. For the prices that everything is on the menu, it's definitely worth it. We all got a pretty big portion. In terms of taste however, it didn't really blow me away.   Although the food took quite some time to get to us (30 minutes) the service was great. I had this waitress from Ireland who was quite nice. When I wasn't sure of which wine to get, she also brought me tasters.   Overall, it's a good place for fairly cheap Italian food but it didn't blow my socks off."}
{"text":"5 star food, but they got a bit backed up and we had a 3 star wait. In the end I have to say it was worth it though. The charcuterie plate and the garlic bread and tomato sauce would probably have been enough for the four of us (2 kids), and with the pastas and pizza we ordered we'll have lunch for tomorrow. Again, no harm no foul, it was all really good."}
{"text":"Went out for one of the girls' birthdays 7pm on a Thursday night, there were 4 of us. Waitress said we could sit anywhere then seemed annoyed that we picked the window table that she had to clean up.   The food arrived from the kitchen very quickly, but that gave us almost zero time between the bread appetizer and the entree. I had the Tre $10.50 (tuna and veg panini includes a side salad) which was a good portion and a Brio $2.50. Everyone enjoyed their food; good but nothing spectacular. The waitress came to check up on us every now and then which was nice."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I've been going to this restaurant for 10 years and it's always consistently awesome. The food is amazing and set at such a great price. 85% of the time I get a mix green salad (no tomato) with the house dressing and fresh bread.   My favourite times to go are right before noon (so that I avoid the line up) or on a Saturday afternoon when it's super chilled out, relaxing with a glass of wine. I've brought friends and clients here and they have always been impressed. I just found their twitter - smart use of displaying their daily specials."}
{"text":"One or two of the servers have a serious attitude problem, but the prices are *very* reasonable and the food is excellent. Besides Italian sandwiches, Fusaros has a really nice selection of pastas to choose from and it's all quite excellent.  One person can eat for under $10. You can't beat that with a stick."}
{"text":"It's not a big restaurant, so the long lunch line that stretches to the door can be intimidating. Fear not, it ends up moving pretty quickly since most lunchers here are regulars who know exactly what they are getting. While you wait in line, sometimes they offer samples of fresh bread as snacks (who doesn't like free samples?).  As a whole, a great place to get comforting food that is priced fairly and tastes like homemade Italian cooking."}
{"text":"I have walked past this restaurant on Spadina so many times but never thought to go in to try it! I can't believe I've been missing out on Fusaro's Italian comfort food. My friend and I had originally wanted to eat dinner at a nearby restaurant but the wait was too long. Checked on Yelp and saw Fusaro's had a solid 4 stars so off we went and I'm so glad we did.  Interior is really cute and cozy... rustic wooden tables as well as string lights dangling across the ceiling. Perfect for catching up with friends or date night.  They have a regular menu as well as a separate one which feature specials. To start we shared the olives which come with a few pieces of bread. Not bad for $6! For my entree I got the seafood linguine and it tasted pretty delicious. Portion was just right for me. My friend ordered a pasta (the name escapes me...) that was supposed to come with capers but unfortunately they missed them in the dish. No worries though because after letting our waitress know she apologized and promptly brought them out on the side.  4 stars is totally accurate for Fusaro's. I'd say the food is about 3.5 (pasta is pasta) but service, ambience, and value is definitely worth that extra 0.5."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Absolutely abysmal. If you're looking for a pasta place that does not know how to make pasta, you're in luck! The pasta was overcooked to the point of mushy, the sauce was watery. Best part of the meal was the ice water..."}
{"text":"I work right across the street and have a hard time not going into this place everyday for lunch. I will say the line up at lunch hour does sway me sometimes when I need something quick and easy. This is also not the place to go to if you don't want to be noticed. You will definitely run into someone you know!   The Pasta is incredible and I am quite smitten with the Cesear Salads (their croutons are unbelievable...) The atmosphere is like a warm hug and everyone is so friendly and happy all of the time.   My suggestion if ever going to Fusaros is to not order ahead. Your ordering head makes you less of a priority than the people in line and you end up waiting anyways. Go, wait in the line, enjoy the free snacks they put out and know that sometimes, as in the case with Fusaros, the wait is worth the payoff."}
{"text":"Tasteful, amazing! Did I say amazing?  The grilled calamari are to die for! I had the chicken and Gorgonzola daily special which was superb. Their chianti is also very good.  Cheap price and great great food"}
{"text":"The food I had was okay. There wasn't anything outstanding about it. I had the penne all vodka and a small Caesar salad. I'm not sure if the food quality was a little lacking because I ordered through Uber Eats or if it's just how the food normally tastes but it wasn't great."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD. Aglio olio is superb. I'm not a big fusilli fan but this made me reconsider. I wouldn't pitch this as a healthy option to anyone, but it sure is tasty. Goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, garlic sauce, a bit of bread and a cup of Parmesan on the side - what's not to love? I am admittedly an unhealthy eater and a pasta drenched in garlic sauce to me is always pleasing. I consumed this meal in a matter of minutes and the portion was just right - enough to keep you full and satisfied for a while, but not so large as to make you feel terrible right after. This is going to be one of my new guilty pleasures in the city and I cannot wait to dabble in the rest of the menu. Have a good feeling this place is going to be a keeper! My eye is on a creamy penne next :)"}
{"text":"the ambiance of the place is good and the staff are friendly. the food however was very horrible. went for the pasta special of the day. the salad that was brought was drowned in olive oil. i understand that it is an italian restaurant but it was a little too much. the pasta had so much oil in it, i was afraid of foreign invasion (iykwim)! the sauce had so much salt in it, i had to drink a whole jug of water that they gave me just to get the taste in my mouth neutralized."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Been here 3 times now and consistency is on point. The wine selection is marginal but for 25$ you can't miss. The pasta portion is phenomenal. I highly recommend the Siciliano..the rose sauce is to die for. Me and a buddy ordered the pasta, pizza, caprese salad and a bottle of red and paid 75$. Pure value for money and a better alternative for overpriced King west."}
{"text":"I hate Italian food. I love Fusaro's. Yes, that good.   If I was to recommend three dishes, it would be the Arancini (I love it with the meat sauce, my wife without), the Arcritano (penne) and the polpette (I cannot resist their meatmalls and the tomato basil sauce it comes in)"}
{"text":"Legit! Right price for right portions. Flavourful. Better than expected. Gets packed during dinner time. Good service."}
{"text":"good pasta for a good price. i recommend splitting it with a friend unless you know you both have large portions for sure since it's really filling. lots of vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food at affordable prices. I went here for dinner with a few friends last night and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service here. We ordered the gnocchi, seafood linguine and spicy salami pizza. All were very flavourful, mainly because the tomato sauce was so delicious. The portion sizes are quite generous too! The restaurant is small so it's best to make reservations if you don't want to wait for a table. They also have a small patio if you want to dine outside."}
{"text":"Yum! I love their sandwiches. I've had them a couple of times and they're always delicious. I had them for takeout. Always served with a side salad, nicely packaged and full of flavour. Quality ingredients paired beautifully!  I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Went there after reading reviews on yelp and I was pleasantly pleased.  The prices are reasonable.   we had a pizza (nice tasting crust), gnocchi (which was really hot...so definitely made to order), pasta primavera (which I found a bit underdone for my taste) and the grilled calimari (this didn't disappoint, tender, not chewy at all)... I saw lots of people come in for take out pizza so it's a popular thing here.  Worth going to if you feel like Italian and you are in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Fusaro's is pretty great. I've never had a bad experience with them food-wise or service wise (though I think I've only ever eaten in once or twice).   Their pasta is always good (though I always get the same one or two dishes). Always tastes the same even at both locations.   Prices and portions are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Fusaro's is a classic business lunch joint, i.e. edible but boring.  It's a counter setup with certain pastas and dishes pre-made ready for heating, and others made to order.  I'd like to give them more stars but the food and the service just aren't that great.  Although I've never had an experience that would necessitate my return, I also have never had an experience that would compel me to come back.  I have grabbed things from here on multiple occasions, but only because:  1.  I live really close, and it's on the way home from work 2.  It's fast (usually, but there've been a few times they've been woefully short-staffed and I've had to wait for someone to take my order or simply grab a Panini or slab of Lasagna, or a couple of  Arancini from behind the glass and stuff it in a takeout container). 3.  Prior to the opening of Alimento on King St, it was the only place in the neighbourhood I could reliable pick up some Italian larder (Anchovy Paste, San Marzano Tomatoes, etc.) - in fact, this is the only reason I don't mind it's continued existence.  If Alimento closes, I'll still want to be able to come here for restocking.  You won't barf if you eat here, but you are also only going to get mediocre fare."}
{"text":"Get here before lunch during the week cause Fusaros gets PACKED! It's a popular spot and rightly so - the food is superb. If you've got a hankering fo some good old fashioned Italian food, this is the place to go!  Their pasta is absolutely delicious and I've had several different ones and never been disappointed.  My favorite has to be the rigatoni, with spinach chicken and tomato sauce  - and it comes with bread. They also have a selection of paninis, which are filled with a delicious variety of Italian meats and cheese. They also have a salads to order, daily made pizzas and Italian favourites like veal parmigiana and spaghetti and meatballs.   Beware, seating in here in sparse so make sure you get it to go if you can!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. Dinner was good, but menu is a bit pricey. I have to say that a weekend brunch is where this place excels for me, the siciliana pasta was delicious and well worth the cost. There is ample seating indoors and it is not crowded as it is during the weekdays. A must visit for a nice meal at a fair price, if u are in the area during weekend brunch."}
{"text":"How come I've never heard of this delicious place before?! I just had the most hearty and tasty bowl of pasta that was perfect on a chilly Fall day.   I ordered the fiorentina - rigatoni with spinach and chicken in a tomato basil sauce. I substituted the chicken for sausages and it was a gooood call. The sausages tastes really fresh and juicy. The  rigatoni was cooked perfectly al dente. But the star of the dish was definitely the pasta sauce. Definitely not ur average joe tomato sauce, you can really taste all the ingredients cooked thoroughly into it and it is amazing. I would come back in a heartbeat just for the sauce.   Their pizza also looks really enticing and will be back to try it - so glad to have found this place. They got themselves another regular!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian spots in town! Great prices for the amount and quality of pasta. Would recommend this spot for dinner with friends or a date ;)."}
{"text":"A group of us were indecisive about dinner, with half wanting a true meal and the others wanting sandwiches.  Fusaro's was the perfect compromise--with pasta for some and panini for others.  Service was great and friendly too.  If you're feeling dessert, go for the tiramisu--large portion and delicious!"}
{"text":"Acritano with extra chicken is my go-to pasta at this location. This is a chicken and mushroom penne with creamy garlic sauce and it is a beautifully generous portion size. I haven't found another place in the city that does a chicken penne like Fusaro's. Hey Lucy's comes close but theirs is a rosé sauce vs Fusaro's cream sauce."}
{"text":"A popular lunch time spot in the area, Fusaro's is, basically, a take-out Italian Food restaurant.  They certainly have seating, but it's not a serviced seating area.  That knowledge doesn't stop customers from coming into the store, as there is almost always a line-up from 11:30 'til about 1:30/2ish.  Specializing in Panini sandwiches and pasta (\"please be prepared to wait 8-10 minutes\"), they pump out food like crazy.  It's an extremely organized assembly line operation, with as many as 4 different people taking orders from the same single line-up.  The food itself is delicious, and while I've heard complaints about the portion sizes being too large (hah!) I haven't found that to be a problem.  If you're in the mood for a spicy sandwich, try Panini Uno.  If spicy sandwiches aren't your thing, I'm also a big fan of Panini Cinque."}
{"text":"I feel like my reviews are going downhill since the first. This will be my last, as it's my last time at this place. Their lunch was always bad, but their dinner was incredible. We came here weekly and really enjoyed this as \"our spot\".   The new chef that you just hired is terrible. The bruschetta had so much garlic I didn't even eat it (and I love garlic), the pasta was bad and it didn't have the ingredients it was supposed to (the waitress said he forgot the scallops in the pasta, but they didn't forget to charge me), and my husbands pasta was disgusting. We didn't finish our meals, told the server it was not good and that we would not be back (she knew we were regulars), and were told \"see you around\". This is not how to run a business.   I would not recommend. If you are regulars, watch out for the changes. If you are the owner, be careful of your future and fix the issues. If you do fix them, write to me as I will come back; I really loved your place and I am so sad that my long term venture with your restaurant is over."}
{"text":"Sandwich was amazing.  Great spot for a quick panini with order at counter service.  Top notch.  Would love to go back to try the pastas as well."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food at nearly-unbelievable prices. Sick of maintaining your stupid keto diet and want to go all out? This is probably the best place to go about doing that.  I've only been to Fusaro's once and the service that I received was sub-par. The food came out nearly 45 minutes after I ordered it, but the waitress was very apologetic and offered us an explanation at the very least (kitchen was short-staffed). My glass-half-full hunch is that this experience was an outlier and not at all indicative of the norm.  I'll be able to see if my hunch was right, since I'm planning to be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fusaro's 5-6 times in the past year, and it has quickly become one of my favourite Italian restaurants downtown. Quality food for great value, with a casual atmosphere right at Richmond/Spadina.   My favourite menu item to order is the Linguini ai Fruitti di Mare - the pasta tastes fresh and not drenched in sauce and oil. They also give generous portions of seafood in addition to the pasta. I also highly recommend the calamari as an appetizer; it is some of the most delicious calamari in Toronto! The calamari is not fried (which I prefer, much smoother) and served with butter/lemon sauce that is delicious.   Highly recommend this place for reasonably priced, casual dining."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a huge surprise. A friend recommended it and I'm so glad we went. The storefront looks unassuming but inside are cute string lights and a very warm ambience.  Their appetizers has the usuals, tons of cheese options and calamari. We ordered the antipasto platter and it was huge, we were really surprised because it wasn't expensive. It had meats, cheeses, grilled vegetables, and small sides like pesto sauce and marinated jalapeños. The pasta were all fresh and delicious. It definitely has the homemade taste of newly made sauce. Portions were pretty decent, and I took half of the pasta to go since I had the antipasto already.  The service was good and they gave us water whenever we ran out and packed our boxes to take leftovers. I'd say it was just the right level of service without them watching you or ignoring you.  Overall the bill came to less than $25 for a pasta and half the antipasto platter. So all that plus the great price makes it 5/5. Go to this place if you're ever uncertain of what to have for dinner."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant - local feel and warm hearty foods we got the grilled calamari, chicken parm, and a side of meatballs (which was huge considering it was a side!). The food was very good as was the service. We would definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this place in the evening. We had a four cheeses pizza with extra toppings and a salad. The pizza was thin, like they make them in Italy. Salad was okay to! We had the red wine. I would recommend this restaurant as vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but definitely plan to return. It has great word-of-mouth and now I know why. Many things looked appetizing but I settled on the stuffed eggplant. SO good!  It's a busy lunch place, so it's best to arrive early if you can. All the items are freshly pre-made (an oxymoron, but it's cafeteria style), on display and ready to be heated."}
{"text":"I have a vague memory from 2009 of coming to an Italian place in this location, but on a rainy day it was empty.  I remembered it as being pretty decent and thought, hey this place seems like it's in the same spot so it must be the same place!  First off, it was packed at 7pm on a Friday but my dad and I were able to get the perfect table out on the front patio.  Our waitress was really nice and, although she had a lot of tables she was looking after, made good recommendations.  By far the favorite thing I ate here was the warm mushroom arugula salad, which was recommended to us by our waitress (instead of the caprese salad).  It was so good that I'm still dreaming about it today.  The mushrooms were salty and lemony and they coated the greens and warmed them up nicely.  For our entree, we decided to split a pasta and a pizza.  Note from me: skip the pizza!  Our \"marguerite\" pizza was just a very cheesy mess.  It tasted better next day.  It was nothing like a pizza marguerite (and does not look like the ones posted previously on yelp).  The pasta we had was one of the special ones, and I can't remember the name.  Kind of like half moon raviolis.  It was good, but man the sauce was great!  Next time I'd say get an appetizer and then maybe 2 pastas to split ... but skip the pizza for sure.  All in all, really pleasant experience.  Oh, and I had a tiramisu to go.  Was super good.  Only thing I remember not liking about my dining experience (besides the pizza) was the fact that the napkins were paper."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed. The best pasta I have ever had in Toronto, and trust me, I eat a lot of pastas around Toronto. Very quick and attentive service, and the prices are relatively cheap for the quality of the food. My second time going there, I told myself that I simply remembered the food as being better than it was, only to find that it was just the same.  So incredibly underrated. I hope they continue as they are."}
{"text":"I love this place! You notice it has great ratings -- and for good reason.  Fusaros makes fantastic pizza, panini's and pasta.  Really fresh ingredients and always wonderfully flavored. I just polished off their \"Due\" sandwich - grilled chicken, mozzarella, arugula, tomatoes and garlic mayo on a panini. Yummmmmmmmmm!  There is often a long lineup out the door - a testament to their good grub! Avoid right at lunchtime (ie 12noon) if you don't want a long wait -- second wave hits around 12:45 - 1:00 pm.  But do NOT miss out!  Fusaro's is da bomb!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with co-workers, two pasta, one pannini, one soup and salad and everyone raved about how good the food was. Respectable size for lunch, reasonable prices, quality ingredients and fun atmosphere! Go early or late, 12:15-1:00 is BUSY!"}
{"text":"Fusaro proves that you don't have to pay top dollar for quality italian comfort food.  This place is really affordable (~$10-13 a main) without sacrificing any of the nice decor, classy ambiance, and delicious flavors that italian food is known for.  I love coming here with friends and eating some comfort-food pasta."}
{"text":"Fusaro's is exactly the type of place I was looking for. Authentic Italian dishes at reasonable prices and generous portion sizes. This isn't easy to come by downtown Toronto! My only complaint is that the service, though very fast, seemed a bit impersonal. I was not greeted properly, and it was almost like I was bothering them to have my order taken. Nonetheless, I am willing to give them another try. After all, it was lunch time and very busy. Lots of delicious sounding options on the menu that I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Years ago I used to work in the area, and ALL of us at the office would eat here weekly, if not more. To this day, Fusaro's has my FAVOURITE salad of all time (and I HAAATE salad): the insala di tonno. It is the best mix of greens, roasted red peppers, shredded carrots, halved grape tomatoes topped with tuna in olive oil. It USED to be served with bocconcini and it is now served with asiago... call me nostalgic, but I still request the bocconcini instead. The BEST part? The balsamic dressing. The best anywhere. I don't know what they do differently from anyone else. I've tried taking a peek to see which olive oil and balsamic they use, or if they have any special way of mixing it that makes it the perfect blend of sweet and acidic to no avail... I think I once tried their pasta in lieu of the salad, and it just wasn't the same. Don't get me wrong, the pasta was great! But Fusaro's for me IS this tuna salad."}
{"text":"Just because there's a long line up at lunch doesnt necessarily mean that the food is good does it? Well, in this case it does. We waited on a Monday afternoon for maybe 10mins, had a chance to read the chalkboard menu and specials as well as check out the display you eventually are lined up against (free pizza samples too!). Since I was there with a regular, I went with her choice, a smoked turkey panini, with a herbed mayo, cucumber, pepper, lettuce and marble cheese. You order over the counter, your tray is set up on top of the counter and, no matter if your choice is quicker than those ahead, you wait in sequence to pay.  Took our sandwiches to the small patio and dug in. For about the same price of a turkey sandwich from Subway immediately next door, Fusaro's wins hands down. The mayo alone is a win.  I will go back. The pastas, the salads and the quiche all looked delicious, and by the looks ofnthe full Corona box on the floor, they're licensed!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good, and I am a huge fan of the Otto panini, which comes with roasted peppers, chicken, provolone, and a flavorful aioli spread, all freshly pressed and buttered.  The only downside is that you can wait a while for your food to be prepared, depending on when you order.  I also love that they sell grocery items, such as torrones, imported pastas, and sauces, too!  Prices are reasonable (~$9/sandwich or wrap, ~$11/large salad with chicken, ~$10/pasta dish), and the salads come with a fresh, soft piece of baguette.  I would ask for EVOO on the side to dip it in.  A good place to grab a casual lunch."}
{"text":"I went in here to get some takeaway. I had a very basic pasta that was not really worth the effort to me. I was really hoping it would be good, as my co-worker had recommended it to me. But I just found the pasta to be bland and not really flavourful. I've been to Italy now and had some really authentic pasta so perhaps it's tainted my palette. Because I'm sure a few years ago this would have been fine to me.   This just tasted really bland and boring. Nice atmosphere inside and decent customer service. You can also buy some ingredients here to make your own Italian food at home."}
{"text":"Came by yesterday for a date and it was just perfect. Although the store was not really that busy, the pastas that we ordered came at a great portion and it's quality..... Was definitely something I could not recreate at home. There was a great balance of herbs and flavour on my chicken penne and our waiter was quick to serve us water and made sure everything was amazing.   I asked for some hot sauce for the pasta and instead we got some nice chili oil that went very well with the meal :) would definitely come back again  Price: around 15-20 per dish"}
{"text":"After a terrible experience at another nearby restaurant, this place was a breath if fresh air. We went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. There was no wait, and pleasantly greeted by the wait staff.   My friend and I were on our way to the film festival and we let our waiter (Doug) know we were on a timeline. He put our orders in and got the bill ready for us. We both ordered the Florentine brunch option. The poached eggs were delicious and the tomato sauce heavenly.   I will definitely be back for another meal!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a friend on Wednesday evening out on the patio. The server was very friendly and the service was pretty fast. They bring out grilled bread with olive oil to start. For dinner I had a margherita pizza and a beer, and my total bill was about $20. This is the definition of cheap and cheerful! The food likely won't blow you away but the value is great. The pizza was cheesier than I'd prefer for thin-crust but it was decent, and gigantic. My friend had a pasta that she enjoyed, too. I wouldn't make an effort to come back here but great spot for a snack on the patio if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little street side restaurant in the heart of China town. Italian in China Town...huh!   Best panini sandwich that I've ever had I think. It was prosciutto & cheese & it was crunchy, tasty & delicious!! Also the Calamari was absolutely fabulous!! This is a definite do over for me & if you're in China Town...go here!"}
{"text":"I live near the Richmond E location so I've been meaning to try Fusaros since time. I was near the Spadina location one day after work so I decided to stop here for a bite.   We decided to sit outside on the patio which is a nice little patio for the restaurant. Inside there is lots of seating. We were greeted by our server and ordered our drinks. While looking at the menu we were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices for the dishes. I end up ordering Penne a la vodka and my friend got the veal parm. Both dishes when they came out were big portions! My friend also got a side salad with the veal parm. Their warm bread was also quite delicious. I had a craving for bolognese and should have stuck with that because unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of the penne. It was good, but didn't hit the spot. My friends dish was super tasty though.   Although my penne didn't hit the spot, totally my fault for ordering something different when I wanted something else! I will definitely come back here with the good service and other yummy looking pasta offerings!"}
{"text":"Fusaro's is a pretty solid lunch choice around my workplace. It's almost like an Italian diner. There is a long line to place your order at a counter with a variety of pastas, sandwiches, salads and pizza to choose from - much of it pre-made but some made to order as well. There are good lunch specials with healthy portions - a full plate of pasta and side salad for about $10.  Nice things - when in that long line up to order they sometimes put out some snacks - garlic cheese bread! And the desserts are delicious if you feel like splurging. Criticism - they always ask you if you want parmasean cheese on your pasta (whoever says no to that?!) and they almost always forget to do it. If' you're committed enough to it, there are shakers on the ledge on the way out but it's so steaming hot I usually just deal with the disappointment when I get to my desk.   Not overly veggie friendly. The special is more often than not veggie but a big plate of pasta with rosé sauce and a couple of vegetables thrown in is a pretty empty calorie dish but there are rice balls, salads and a couple of other options as well.   The food isn't amazing but it's consistently good and not too expensive compared to the other options available in the hood."}
{"text":"Honestly I think this might be the best pizza in the city.   The pizza and the sandwiches are amazing, authentically italian!  Really great location as there is nothing else like Fusaro's in the entertainment district, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome place ! The portions are enormous and the prices reasonable. We were seven and we had 2 appetizers, 7 mains, 2 desserts and 2 bottles of wine. We split the total in seven, and we only had for 30$ each (tips include)!!! When I'll be back in Toronto, I'll go there for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and affordable. I got the Bruschetta, the Siciliana (which was actually spicy!) and the Tiramisu. The sauce was some of the best I've had. Nice setting and friendly service. Would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Fusaro's is a neat little joint along the busy strip of Spadina and Richmond streets. I grabbed lunch here on a Tuesday around 12:39 with a friend.   I absolutely love the decor of this place. It's sort of rustic with displays of pasta and olive oils and other ingredients aesthetically laid out and pleasing to the human eyes. Their menu is written in stylish cursive writings. The tables are boring though. I guess that's what they were going for.   You order at the counter and pay, grab a seat, and finally someone brings your dish to your table of choice. There is no tipping involved which is nice for a change in a restaurant.   I ordered the \"Americana Salad\". It costs $14. It was definitely worth the price as it was larger than expected. Service was fast. The Americana was a beautiful healthy looking bowl. On a bed of lettuce, spinach and other greens were a couple slices of cold cucumber and a handful of grated carrots. I don't eat bacon so I got extra cucumbers. There were a few pieces of red onions which I didn't eat and seemed random. To one side of the bowl was a nicely grilled chicken breast. It was charred the way I like it. The flavour was on point. To the other side was half an avocado or what seemed like half an avocado. I would have liked more avocado. There was also a hard boiled egg which was sliced beautifully and a good heaping sprinkle of feta cheese. I could not decipher the sauce but it seemed like olive oil. The salad also came with baguette. I would have appreciated it toasted with some butter. It was just a cold piece of bread.   Overall, I would visit this place again. My salad was hearty and filling and I enjoyed dining here immensely."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch quite a bit since I work nearby, and I've sat in a few times for dinner, as well.  Their pasta is excellent. I prefer the taste of the food when I dine in, but maybe that's a given. Crummy take-out containers isn't really my thing.  My favorite pasta is the acritano, by far. Their chef's pasta is usually very good as well, but it costs a few more dollars and comes with a salad that I don't particular care for. It's not their fault, I just don't like salad.  I'm not really a fan of their pizza (though I've only had one). I had the napoli (anchovies and capers) and it left me feeling pretty greasy and uncomfortable. I'm sure their other pizzas are good, but I like their pasta too much to bother trying them.  The lines at lunchtime are OK as long as you show up before 12:20pm or so. After that, it gets pretty crowded. From walking in through the front door to walking out with the food, expect to wait 5-10 minutes on a good day, up to 20 on a bad one. Relatively empty during dinner time."}
{"text":"The place is cheap, popular and unmistakably Italian. Or at least Latin, if we're talking about the people on the other side of the counter.  Huge lineups are normal - that's a common take-out lunch destination for all those offices around. Food is good, though nothing special - just a normal stuff anyone would get for lunch \"feeling like eating something Italian today\". I usually get gnocci con bolognese there, and those are always fresh and well made (that's not from the menu, by the way, but you can ask for it and get it).  I can only recommend this place for take-outs - trying to eat inside is a huge fail. Employees of this place are seriously wasted, there is no way you can expect courteous or fast service. They are not bad people, just really, really tired and overloaded."}
{"text":"This must be one of my favourite Italian spots: authentic, consistent, hitting the spot every time, with every dish.  I must have visited Fusaro's at least a dozen times by now and I feel fully confident to recommend this place to anyone craving Italian.  Dishes are reasonably priced for the quality of food you get and portions are very generous. Pastas are served with bread and paninis come with small salads. My favourite items on the menu are Acritano Pasta (chicken+mushrooms+cream sauce) and Rucola Pizza. The only thing that I probably won't order again is gnocchi but not because there's something wrong with the dish; it is just sort of plain/boring to me."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and pasta. Truly authentic. Nice ambience and attentive service. This was out favorite dinning experience during our 5 day trip to Toronto. Will defiantly come back next time."}
{"text":"I don't normally spend the time to write reviews even if I had a bad experience. So to leave a negative review must mean it was REALLY bad.   I came here for lunch with my coworkers. I waited a long, long time for my order to come, the lunch pasta special. People ordered their food, ate it, and left before I even received my food (and they were the same order). When I spoke to the cashier, she had the audacity to condescendingly say, \"Maybe you didn't hear it.\" I didn't hear my order called out, nor did my coworkers who were right beside me, waiting for their orders as well. My order number was 71. The manager said, \"Well, there was an order 81, maybe they got mixed up?\" I told him it is your responsibility that the right order goes to the right person. \"Well, it's coming,\" he said. No \"sorry\". No apology.  And that is my biggest gripe. I worked at a restaurant. I get it. When there's a rush of people, mistakes can happen. But you do not ever, EVER, blame the customer for your mistakes.  Suffice to say I will never, ever, order food from here again.   Oh and the pasta was okay, nothing special and a bit too salty for me. My friend said his sandwich was also too salty."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian restaurant! Went here last night for the very first time. Split a pizza and pasta with my friend. Portions are very generous. Casual, authentic Italian restaurant. If you are picky about Italian sauce, you will love it here!"}
{"text":"A go-to spot for quick, reasonably priced, well portioned and decent Italian. I've been here for lunch/dinner, dine-in/takeout, and they've all been nice experiences. The interiors are quite simple, like a homey kitchen/general store, and the staff are friendly and efficient.   When I'm super hungry, I get the Rucola pizza (~$14), which is stuffed with prosciutto and arugula but still tastes pretty light. The Crudo ($10) is the sandwich version of this, which also comes with a cut of fior di latte and a salad on the side - good for lunch! Regardless, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the pastas are especially hearty (but not oily) in the winter months."}
{"text":"the food was awesome and came in good portion, customer service was great, their cashier was very patient even when i didnt know how to pronounce those italian dish!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I order from Fusaro's on pretty much a weekly basis for lunch and we've now tried their pasta, their paninis and their pizza - we love them all! They're reasonably priced and the food is always delicious. I would recommend them to anybody looking for a nice lunch without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"This was my first time that I had eaten here, and it was recommended by a friend as we were visiting in Toronto. My main issue with this place was with the cashier. She didn't really seem to be interested when I was inquiring in what a certain ingredient was in the dish. As wells he forgot to give me my drink.  I enjoyed the food, I got the spicy sausage with linguine. It was very hot,  cooked very well and the portion size was great. I also loved the sausage that was in the pasta.  If I ever go back there when I'm visiting Toronto I'd probably give four stars, if I had a better cashier."}
{"text":"Having walked by this strip on an almost daily basis for the last year or so, I had no idea Fusaro even existed until a friend who works and lives nearby suggested that we come here for lunch.  For a tiny place, this restaurant has an abundance of choices on their menu, on display, and plenty of places to sit, including a quaint little patio, perfect for a summer's day like today (the inside is a little bit hot)  You line up long their display to order your food, whether it's panini, fried foods, salad, pastry, pasta and pay for it up front. If you are ordering it for here, they will deliver it to your seat. I had their Sciliana, which is a penne with tomato sauce and hot italian sausage for $11. It's a bit pricey but the portions are ample and tasty. The best part is while you're standing in line, they have free snacks while you wait, including brownies and appetizer flatbreads.   The line is long during lunch time, but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Do you want an Italian food induced pregnancy? Or do you want to share the feeling of an Italian food induced pregnancy without all the responsibility and crying? Look no further than Fusaro's.   Ingredients come first here. They're proudly adorning the walls and apportioned thoughtfully in the adjacent kitchen.   Excellent pastas. Both seafood linguine & arabiatta are devine. Fresh succulent sea food & zesty, spicy and savory sauces.   Maximum gunshots 15/10.2^1 bullet-holes. Great spot. Appies good too. Salad diaries."}
{"text":"I was looking a for a casual Italian place to dine with a group of friends. we walked in and immediately were hit with the delicious smell of their justifiably famous red sauce. Full of garlic the sauce was soon good. We had a selection of pastas and other dishes and it was all so good. When we left one of the group commented that when he saw the cheap prices he was worried about the food, but he was totally won-over! Wine by the glass and bottle was also well priced!"}
{"text":"Little known fact by people who pass by the restaurant in the morning: Fusaro's serves breakfast!  I've been here for lunch once or twice, but love coming back for their breakfast even more. They have a few basic classics, like bacon and eggs, usually served with home fries and fresh fruit, but also have some more out-of-the-ordinary stuff: spicy sausage covered in bread, tomato sauce and melted cheese. Their breakfast menu is limited to 5 or 6 items, but they're all solid, and eating on the patio at 9:00AM is unbeatable.  Service is a bit iffy at times, but amazing, highly recommended place otherwise."}
{"text":"I enjoyed having dinner here. Loved the vibe and the service was amazing. Food arrived quickly, but the pizza was on the cold side and the salad could have been better with some more dressing. Really enjoyed the pasta."}
{"text":"We popped in here for dinner on a weeknight. It's a small space and was busy, but we were seated right away. We ordered pasta dishes, him a seafood special, me the Siciliana, a delicious combination of creamy tomato sauce and thinly sliced hot sausages.  The pasta was cooked to perfection, the flavours well balanced, and just the right amount of gooey cheese. The service was good despite there being all of two people working front of house for a packed restaurant.  We'll definitely be back for casual yet quaint date nights."}
{"text":"Good pasta, great place to pop in for lunch. Dinner? Not as much. If you're looking for authenticity, Fusaro's is a bit Canadian-ized. Most of the right stuff is in there, but not always the right amount. Healthy Italian food this is not. Consistency is an issue at lunch. Sometimes the dishes are overwhelmed with olive oil and/or butter, sometimes not.  Absolutely worth a try if you work nearby. It's yummy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING! I eat here every few weeks, whether it's dining in or ordering take out because the pasta is so fresh and delicious while the prices really can't be beat for the great value you're getting! I would definitely recommend my go-to pasta, which is the Siliciana! This restaurant also has a great, low-key and laid back vibe and is the perfect place to dine with friends and family. I would recommend it to anyone.  Also, tonight they really pulled through when I had an accident with my takeout on the way back and they made me a fresh batch for being a loyal customer! It just goes to show how much they value their customers - thanks for saving my night, Fusaro's! :)"}
{"text":"Great salads and always fresh. The portions are good and the prices are fair. A busy spot if you're stopping by for lunch and wait times are generally pretty long. Good spot."}
{"text":"Fusaro's is a decent Italian lunch-spot. I have only tried the pasta options, since the paninis sit out on the counter. The pasta dishes that I have tried include the alla vodka, the salsiccia e rapini, the acritano, and the gnocchi. The acritano and gnocchi are my favorites. I'm not usually a gnocchi fan, but their potato gnocchi is soft and tasty.  Fusaro's gets very busy during the noon lunch-hour, and you can wait 15 minutes or more.  Update: I have tried the chef's special risotto and was not impressed. I've had better risotto elsewhere.  Tip: There are 2 lines. One for those waiting to order and pay, and one to pick-up."}
{"text":"The girl that works the cash at Fusaro's has literally (by my watch at least) never had a day off in the five years that I've been coming here. Along with the lunch hour lineups she is the one consistent thing about this place.  I wish I could say the same about my beloved gnocchi, which varies wildly from visit to visit. Sometimes the sauce is creamy cream, sometimes it's oily tomato, sometimes it's jarred tomato. For the record, if anyone from Fusaro's is listening, the only winner in that list is creamy tomato. And I also like the days when fresh basil and parmagiano reggiano are involved."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with my friend for dinner. The atmosphere was very relaxed and casual. I forgot the name of what i ordered but it was penne pasta with a creamy red sauce and italian sausage. The food was flavorful and good but i feel like my pasta was slightly undercooked which made it hard to chew. Not horribly undercooked though! Also, be warned. The dish i ordered was also a bit spicy. I didnt really expect that but it mustve been the italian sausage.  Overall, we enjoyed our experience here and the service was decent!"}
{"text":"This place is a bumpin' take-out lunch spot for the office building dwellers in the entertainment district. The food is delicious, but the lines can be long and slow. I love dropping in for lunch, but often regret spending the $15 and 15 minutes on my lunch hour. Such a toss up.  I'm also partial to looking at their beautiful foods on display through glass in true Italian form.   Hints:   The chef's pasta special is always the best choice, unless you are a late diner -- then it will have been sitting under the lights.  If you're getting your food to go, open it up and sprinkle on some fresh parm and chili flakes from their extras station."}
