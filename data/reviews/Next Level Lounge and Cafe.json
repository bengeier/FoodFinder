{"text":"If 0 stars was an option that'd be my choice. HOOKAH IS TRASH! I'm at a hookah lounge a few times a week and we decided to try this one with my usual flavor, MISTAKE. Back when it was Midnight, the hookah was good along with the service. Recommend Habibi down the street 10/10. The worst part was the service. Ali was the one who helped us, not sure if he's the owner but he was RUDE. We ordered 2 hookahs, a plate of food, and a drink. We got our hookahs, he let us know the food was 10 minutes out... about 35-40 minutes go by and nothing. We decide to just ask for a refund on the food, they offered the food but we declined. They gave us a partial refund but didn't tell us it was partial, when we went back in to ask the guy he totally LOST it. He was arguing with us and these were his words \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY STORE, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED BACK HERE\" \"DONT TELL ME HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS\". At no point did we yell, or get wild or even advise him on how to run his business, all I stated to him was to not be rude as we weren't treating him rudely either. It's a problem when the employees catch more attitude than a customer. Worst part is we did pay fully for our hookahs and a drink so they easily still got $35 from us and still treated us like s***. And hookahs are dirty, there was stuff in the vase, didn't bother letting them know, what was the point after that attitude?"}
{"text":"Great place to eat shawarma and smoke hookah super relaxing atmospheres great music and the owners are awesome definitely recommend to every body bring your friends and family!!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed last night, the best tasting hookah I ever had, the food was AMAZING. I had this dish that I dont know the name of lol but basically it was the Mediterranean version of Carne Asada frys lol with this white sauce all over it, and they had this cilantro salad OMG off the hook! I got their strawberry smoothy GOOOOOD. We needed a place like this in the Metro circle the owner picked the perfect spot. I also want to add the owner was very attentive and very friendly made you feel like family I loved him!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst place to go to on a Friday night. Sheesh! Absolutely no one shows up and no one cleans. Looked like there was leftover hookahs and empty cans from previous nights sitting there. Music is so softly playing they might as well cut it off. I'm a visitor to the Phoenix area and I wish I knew.. chai!"}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied with this place, for an Arab it's a picky thing is a good hookah. So I've been looking and this place is been the one. Food is amazing and the service is very professional. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"The most horrible service I have ever received. Not only was the experience excruciating, the service was horrible, we were thrown out, cussed out, and humiliated for simply trying to figure out why we had to pay a partial for food we did not receive, mind you they threw us out after they took our money. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST! 1 star is simply being too nice wish you could leave no stars at all. Management is also a joke."}
{"text":"Delicious food with the best middle Eastern hookah really cool place. Manger the best, give us some free water bottle and made the whole thing really chill."}
{"text":"Very good place with good hookahs that last and  friendly owners !! Recommend for you that loves hookah and food"}
{"text":"So I arrives in Phoenix at night, after checking in & everything it was past 11pm. Most food places near my hotel were closed. Thankfully Yelp came to the rescue & directed me to Next Level hookah lounge. I've been to a lot of hookah lounges back home.(Baltimore, Maryland) But the ones out here are far better! For one the parking was great. No door charge to get in. They served food all night & provided drinks. Back east I would've had to pay to get in & bring my own drinks & food isn't allowed unless it was a private party . The hookah was even cheaper ($15) plus a much larger variety of hookahs. I stumbled on this place but I promise you tho I will be returning there the rest of my vacation."}
