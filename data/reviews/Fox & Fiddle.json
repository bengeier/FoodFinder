{"text":"Decent enough. Nothing to write home about. The special house ground burgers are good and the beer is cold. When Im feeling like a pub they do the trick."}
{"text":"Holy heck this place SUCKS. The waitresses are SO slow, and honestly they're lazy. Not prompt at all to get you menus, take your drink order, and  they rarely check on their guests. With the prices being not necessarily all that great (they're competitive, not too bad, but not worth what you get in service or quality for food) the ONLY reason I have to spend money here is that I live in CityPlace. I feel like the only reason this location is successful is because of their address."}
{"text":"I have been here twice!  The 2nd time, I had an issue and what seriously impressed my was the way the bartender handled the situation.  The first line of resolution was amazing and very rare with most establishments.  My friends was also impressed on how they can take a negative customer experience and turn it into a positive for the customer.  I left the establishment as though nothing negative happen and have no issues returning or recommending this place.  The menu selection is also extensive!"}
{"text":"All I can say is...party!  Had a blast at the City Place Fox. I have been to a few of them and have always had a great experience, good food, polite staff, big menu with lots of options, etc.  This one had us buzzing!! The atmosphere is so much fun and they always have great talent playing.  Not much parking in the area but worth it!"}
{"text":"3 Stars, and I'd like to give more but major problem here. The food of any restaurant is worth 2 stars in the rating.  And the food here... Sucks.  Some of the apps are okay... But as far as variety goes -1 and as far as taste and seasoning, etc goes -1.  1+1=2  Minus 2 that is.  The staff are all pretty good. Cute girls in plaid skirts. Not bad on the eyes. But, the menu is just so dull and bland on paper and in your mouth, no amount of pasty legs falling out of short skirts can help."}
{"text":"The food is frozen and reheated.  The service is slow and the place is dreary and cramped.   I've heard it's a better location in summer so here's hoping that's the case as I'm not really sure how this pub even survives."}
{"text":"ive been here a few times before and after jays games.   yes it's busy after a game. last  night i was expecting a wait list. the manager (who looked hungover, leaning heavily on the host podium) blearily mumbled theres no list, no tables. I wait a sec, then ask politely what he recommends I should do, he waves his hand dissmissively and says \"go somewhere else? i dunno\". I wait a bit more, probably a joke... nope. I overhear the same suggestion to the people next in line as well.  The servers are really nice, although def overworked some nights. game nights need many more wait staff on hand.  The food is extremely average, and massively overpriced.   The manager should not ever be allowed to talk to customers.   Worst area because if you can't get in here, there aren't any other decent bars nearby. I highly recommend walking east or north after a game, never west. never."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty.There is a good avriety. the beer is abundant but the cocktails rather weak. the servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a lazy Sunday brunch.  They have a massive patio, with about half the seats in direct sun, and half in the shade. Just perfect.  More importantly, they have $4 caesers and mimosas and $9 steins on Sundays until 2. Makes brunch easy!   They have a bunch of standard pub food on the menu, but I'm a particular fan of the poutine selection. The buffalo chicken poutine is one of my favourites. Well worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by The Fox & Fiddle for a later dinner, and I thought that I'd share our experience with all of you.  We walked in, and because it was busy, decided to order food to go from the bar. We've been there more than 100 times, and spent 10 minutes talking to our favourite server outside before heading in.  Upon approaching the bar, a very drunk guy was spinning around with a pint of beer in his hand and bumped in to me pretty hard. I put my hands up defensively as he came towards me, and he continued to approach. He took a couple of swipes at my face before I pushed him away, and his friends pulled him away. The staff(including a \"bouncer\") did nothing.  At this point we decided that it was best to leave before anything else happened, but were stopped by the bartender who said \"Sorry, he's had too much to drink\", and the owner who said \"He's a good guy. I'll buy you a round of drinks next time you're here\". I think it goes without saying that we're not going back.  Just thought I'd let you know what to expect in case sometime tries to start a fight with you at The Fox and Fiddle."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and always leave happy.  The staff is great, and so are the caesars.  They offer a deal every day of the week, and Stein deals during Jays games.  Spinach dip is great!  Will be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"This bar is a complete dissapointment. Like other's have said the location is all it has going for it. Let's begin:  Bad drinks: Worst mixed drinks ever. We've ordered (on many occasions) mixed drinks such as jager bombs and ameretto sour. The drinks come out tasting nasty and very disproportionate. Next time I'll walk the extra few feet to another local bar when I want to entertain guests.  Average food: Fish and chips, wings, burgers, the class bar food is below par with even the lowest of bars in Toronto. Einstein's is gold compared to this and that says a lot. Expensive and very average tasting.  Terrible seating arrangement: Tiny tiny bar area, weird, isolated seating area. Hard to explain but the seats continue behind the bar. You get seated in a long narrow hallway-like room. Very dark and doesn't allow you to really socialize.  No parking. Photos below are extremely misleading, the bar is about 6 feet across with room for 4 people.  Make the extra walk to St. Louis"}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Tasty food. They're happy to accommodate split bills. Nightly specials and even better weekend brunch deals"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been impressed with a Fox and the fiddle and this location is no different."}
{"text":"Terrible in every sense of the word. 2 stars is generous  but you CAN get a cold beer... eventually. Food is horrid. Plenty of alternatives in the area that are worth spending some cash at."}
{"text":"Ive reviewed this place before and gave it a 2 star rating. Im updating it to 3 star simply because its one of the few fox and fiddle branches around the city thats remained consistent with its service and quality since my last review.   Last time I visited was on a PACKED saturday night when the leafs were playing and food and beverage arrived within twelve minutes of entering the bar! Product was quality and inexpensive. Our server was nice, cute and friendly (pretty much all their servers are like that and approachable). No fuss or complaints!  Keep up good work management! Ill def keep visiting!"}
{"text":"I went there with my mom, my husband and my 2-month old daughter to have a beer in the afternoon.   The pub was quiet and cozy, we had a big booth and it was very comfortable and maximizing privacy - which is great since I have to breastfeed every two hours!!!  I like the beer on tap and the poutine!!! I'll try going back to watch a baseball game next time, since they have a lot of TV screens everywhere!"}
{"text":"2 stars for service. 0.5 stars for food.   Came here on a Saturday night for dinner with a few friends. Thankfully it was pretty quiet as the Jays game was still going on. Seated quickly and had \"decent\" service (but that was to be expected as there was only about 3 tables occupied in the restaurant and there were 4 servers). We had to flag down the server for water refills despite her coming by and clearing our plates. We also asked for 3 separate bills and she comes back with 2 bills?!   I ordered the blue cheeseburger with lettuce wrap instead of the bun ($16). I laughed when I got my order. First off, the \"wrap\" was literally a piece of lettuce on the top and two pieces of lettuce on the bottom. Secondly, the blue cheese .... was non existent. Literally just maybe one small cube of blue cheese that was melted. I thought, okay maybe there was some cheese in the meat. Nope. The wedges were decent enough.   I cannot believed I paid $16 for probably the shittiest burger I've ever had - mcdonald's was honestly better. Honestly for that price, I'd go to Smokes Burger on King/Spadina - their blue cheeseburger is about the same price and actually has blue cheese (amongst other toppings) and wraps their burger with more than one lettuce piece."}
{"text":"- this place will never be empty because of its location at the base of a ba-jillion condos - pretty average pub here. nothing really that special. - they have beer. they have tvs. they have an awkward shaped dining area."}
{"text":"An obligatory stop if you live in cityplace. Not great and not terrible. Usually only go here for hungover breakfasts, lazy weekend lunches, or convenient meet ups with other cityplacers.   Was going to say reviews are probably worse than it deserves, but it just took the waitress 20 minutes to notice we're here during a slow afternoon. Next time I'll take that 20 min to walk somewhere better."}
{"text":"If I could give a minus I would  Food: Would have been plain bar food but each person at my table received it cold.  Parking: what parking there are 10 spots beside the restaurant that are owned by the city we had to wait 30+ minutes for a spot then had to pay.  Server: Great server who apologized for the food.  Manager: informed the manager (Adam I think) about the food he didn't really care. He looked like he should be washing the dishes instead of managing the restaurant.  Overall impression: Stay as far away from this restaurant as possible don't be surprised if they are out of business in the near future"}
{"text":"They do not honour reservations made for pay per view events. I watched my event through the window on the patio and could only see 70% of the screen.   Background:  They told me that if I someone was there by 9:30PM the reservation would be honoured. However, that was not the case. Upon arrival, it was made clear that our booth was given away with the excuse that we were supposed to arrive at 9pm. Then the story changed that they could join us to another table. My two friends who were at the bar waited at the table with two empty chairs for myself and a friend to arrive. When I got there I was told the bar was at capacity and me and another friend were not allowed in! Those two seats should have been accounted for before capacity was reached.  Management - Please work on your reservation system. I understand you want to be at full capacity to make maximum profit but as a patron with a reservation this was disappointing. Either don't take reservations or honour them its as easy as that."}
{"text":"Very busy on a Friday night! Patio is big and has a variety of seating. There is also live music inside. Lots of booths and seating around the bar.   We wanted a seat on the patio. The hostess cleared a table and grabbed some chairs to get us seated. Service was hard to get ahold of on the patio though. The servers were so busy, people were getting waited on out of order and the wrong order arrived at our table as well.   Great spot with a great patio, who can resist??"}
{"text":"We have been there few time. There was nothing special, it's just close to our condo  The last time we went there was 2 weeks ago. Everything was not bad, the waitress kept asking \"Is everything ok?\" it was nice BUT when we asked for substituting fries with onion rings, she said ok without a mention that \"COSTs $3\""}
{"text":"Came here before the Blue Jays Game last night. I had the Guinness Stew thing and my girlfriend had some kind of beef sandwich. For Beer I had a Rickard's White and my girlfriend had a Creemore. They were both kinda skunky.  While this location is a bit better than the Danforth one, there really is nothing to recommend this place other than proximity to the Roger's Center."}
{"text":"We stopped by here around 12:30am on a friday night as we hadn't eaten dinner and this was one of the closest places opened that served food. All I can say was that the food was terrible. The \"spicy\" chicken sandwich wasn't spicy at all - it just tasted sour and was drenched in sauce. The \"medium\" chicken wings were more of the same story - very sour. It was probably some of the worst pub/bar food I have ever had.  The atmosphere however was fun, lively, and there was live music playing. But the food itself was terrible and I won't be back here for food ever again (maybe for drinks or to watch a sports game!). The waitress was responsive and quick, which was another bonus as well.  Overall, I would not recommend a friend to go here for food, but more for a night out at a bar to relax and watch a sports game."}
{"text":"Pretty standard pub fare but wings were a good size and tasty. The Korean Barbecue sauce was very good.  Staff was very friendly and service was good although it was busy inside. We sat on the lovely terrace outside and enjoyed the sunshine.  Nothing super fancy but we had a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Wanna watch a game? Great. Eat some amazing wings along with it? Even better. I loved the honey garlic. Now.... If you want someone to forget your order....  You just might get that as well. My boyfriend and I came in again after ordering the wings to go and falling in love with it. We said let's go again. This time I ordered a steak and he ordered a chicken parm... That they forgot to order..... But yet the girl that came after us got her order first.... I have to leave it as is... Its a sports bar... Can't expect much. But pay close attention next time."}
{"text":"Cap staff, seems like they all got trained through the \"Cheers\" bar training program of doing nothing but chat. Food overpriced for what it is. To boot, have a bouncer who tends to be a dick stand around and haggle ppl wanting to be patrons while he hits up the girls and let's them in. Terrible place..."}
{"text":"Really nice and friendly staff, always willing to chat and not in any business of brushing you off or ignoring you. Costs the same as any other non-Britified Fox and Fiddle restaurant; naturally you're going to expect high prices. My friends ordered the sweet potato fries and LOVED them."}
{"text":"Our entry was greeted by stepping into carpet  flooded with ice water. We started with beer which was simply coloured water. The Nachos order was all wrong and on complaining we were offered to bring missing ingredients on the table (should we take them home?..lol) and  quesadilla lacked salt. It is funny how a restaurant bar can't get basics right! Such a good location is going for a waste..."}
{"text":"Bar food is bar food. No real surprise. I went during lunch time and there hardly anyone there. The place actually looks smaller than it looks - especially since it's in the condo complex. The wait staff were nice and attentive but don't know what it would be like if it was busy.  I had the roast beef jus and it was good. The fries were a little too crispy and oily but still edible. Can't really complaint but nothing really blew me away. Just convenient to have a restaurant in the building but I wouldn't give an extra star because of that. Even though I did it for Sobey's across the street."}
{"text":"The first night of my vacation, my girlfriend and I decided to try this place. I must say the decor was sweet! TVs wall to wall! We ordered a pound of their honey garlic wings and they were amazing! But, the last night of our vacation wasnt good at all.....smh. We placed orders for our food just to find out an hour later that the waitress behind the bar forgot to place my order. It's not rocket science, besides the place was pretty empty. Poor customer service. Also no discount for that screw up was offered. I ordered Chicken Parm with the pasta of the day, (Which happened to be spaghetti) , with a ceasar salad. The dressing on the salad was extremely bland, the spaghetti sauce was disgusting, and the chicken parm was way over cooked. Simply horrible. Save yourself a headache and only order wings from this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place !!! Best burger in Toronto and a good veggie selection.  Beer is cold, food is delicious, service is ok .  Best kind !"}
{"text":"Decent service, OK food.  Came here for dinner on a Friday evening - we had a booth in the back corner but the main area/bar was packed with people. They had a few games on TV but no sound. Instead, they had music blasting which made it a bit difficult to make conversation at the table. This didn't make sense to me.  The service was pretty good, the server answered all our questions and made sure everything was OK.  The food was average but a bit overpriced. I got the fried chicken sandwich which was big, but a little dry and bland. I expected a bit more for $16.  Overall it was just OK - nothing great but nothing terrible. The atmosphere seems like it is more suited for a few drinks with friends, rather than a dinner/get together with a group."}
{"text":"As a condo dweller, it is great to finally have a pub in close proximity to my home. However, it eerily feels like a place you could find in the suburbs and not in downtown Toronto. The vibe is overly commercial and sporty. The crowd is a reflection of the neighborhood - corporate young professionals.   That being said, the beer was fresh. They have a good selection - Guiness, Kilkenney,  Creemore, ect. The food was your basic pub style - but tasty enough and filling.   Though, the price felt a little steep at the end considering I had two beers, my boyfriend had three and we ordered 1 burger to share. The end price was $60 after tax and tip. Some may argue that this is a good price - but I still feel it was a bit steep considering there was only one meal ordered."}
{"text":"Came in and the place was packed. Asked the server (short, undercut hairstyle) of the back section if a table with empty mugs was available. He said yes and he would come to clean up. Sat for 5 minutes without even a stare back from the server. Got up to used the washroom and asked him where they were...he rushed by and completely ignored me. Found the washroom, came back and sat for another 5 minutes without any service and decided to leave."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this pub. Same for the food. Service could be much better, we were waiting for Mediterranean wraps more then 20 minutes. Patio looks fine."}
{"text":"I've never been when a game is on, but sometimes my husband and I stop in when we are in the mood for pub food.  No complaints, the menu is quite extensive and the food has always been good.  Recently I had some sort of Philly cheese steak open-faced sandwich, and I'm STILL thinking about it weeks later.  (It was so good!). My husband usually gets the wings and seems to enjoy them.  Decent patio.  Staff are always friendly, too."}
{"text":"nothing special here.  the price is a bit high, but the food doesn't worth that price.  it's a good place for a quick dinner if you are living in the area."}
{"text":"Below average pub with below average but not terrible food. Service is good and it's nice to sit on the shady patio."}
{"text":"Since I live across the street this place is one of the closest bar options in the area.  The good: - Wings - Taco Tuesdays  - Nice patio - Servers are friendly - Cajun Chicken Wrap (I had it for lunch today)  The bad: - Prices are high and they don't offer many specials. (Happy hour would be great) - Inside is small and feels somewhat cramped - Don't play sound for NFL games and the TV setups are that great in the back area if you are a Sports fan.  Overall, I go here because it is close, food is decent but nothing amazing. When Hunters Landing opens I think they are going to give them a real run for their money though."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now for lunch/dinner after the Jays games. Although the food is better than most Fox and Fiddles and the staff is friendly, they have a tendency to forget you're there if it isn't crowded to the max! Hence, dinner can take a long time. Fish and Chips are light, not greasy and the Calamari is my favorite. I'll go there again, just wish I were a little more 'visible'."}
{"text":"So we decided to have lunch here cause it was a long weekend & u can NEVER work the whole day on a Friday of a long weekend in Canada!! I ordered the house salad w Blue Cheese dressing. The salad was blah & nothing exciting. I also ordered the chicken/cheese Quesadilla. This should have been better cause it's sooo easy to make. The food was clearly rushed as the cheese wasn't even melted. What stood out for me was our waitress...she was an unsmiling bi**h that was clearly uninterested in working. Not once did she crack a smile while serving us. Business is tough in the restaurant biz....u simply HAVE to do better then this if u want your customers to come back. Doubt I would go here again."}
{"text":"Pretty chill place but it gets pretty crowded when the weather gets warm. It is a little hard to get a spot outside in the evenings or on the weekends. The food is fine. Normal pub food. Nothing crazy. The staff is nice but they seem a little flustered when things get busy. It is a convenient City Place spot."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some grub and watch the game. Wide selection of beers on tap. I recommend the Rickards white. Service is alright. I recommend their sandwiches and poutine. I wouldn't recommend large groups."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night before the Jays game as we live next door and wanted something quick.  As we walked in the door, the hostess walked by us and pointed to the table closest to the door and said in a hurry \"you can sit there\" as she brushed by us out the door.  We decided not to sit at the worst table in the place and sat at a high top near the bar.  There were four waitresses stood near the bar chatting, not one of them said hi or offered a menu. We sat there for about 10 minutes without any attention so we walked out and went to St. Louis down the street.  Not an employee bothered to ask why we were leaving.  I will not go back if I can help it as St. Louis or Spot are fairly good for a nearby quick bite before games.  If I want good food I would not be going here anyway as it is cheapish bar food. I hope the Adam (the owner) realizes that there are plenty of good dining establishments around and the competitors offer far better customer service than this.  Had I wanted to be treated like I did not matter, I would have gone to Real Sports."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Blue Jays game and was disappointed with my experience. Upon walking in we were told the entire back area was reserved, luckily we were able to sit near a TV but only one of us was able to face it. Not their fault, events happen, but was slightly frustrating.  We had to ask for a drink menu and were oddly presented with a breakfast menu even though it was 1 30. I decided to grab the chicken parmesan and the girlfriend got a Pecan salad. Both of our meals looked delicious but unfortunately the taste did not match at all.  We got a pitcher of beer which was good but they had a modest selection, maybe 7 beers on drought that we were able to choose from.  Most annoying part of our meal was being seated next to the kitchen door where one of the waiters thought he was Jackie Chan kicking the door with all his might everytime he came out with his hands full... not necessary given ever waitress was more than capable to gently open it with their side or back without giving us a mild heart attack everytime they came through the door.  All in cost us about 60 bucks and I'd say it was not worth it for the food or the experience."}
{"text":"Patio is decent. Nachos are fabulous:). Servers are great."}
{"text":"I am surprised at some of the negative reviews. I have been here several times and have enjoyed every visit. Great bar food (wings, ribs, and nachos) and they always have drink specials (ask the waitress what specials are on before you order). It's a great place to watch the Leafs, Raptors, or Jays, and you can see the televisions from almost every seat in the bar. They also have live entertainment on weekends.  Service for me has always been fast and friendly. If  I have one complaint, its not to sit near the table just inside the front door in winter. I don't know if I would have a full meal in here as its more of a sports bar than pub, but it is clean and for me the service has always been fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place to catch the game! Horrible place to get any service. We ordered drinks and an appetizer to enjoy the basketball game. There was only two waitresses working and hence the lack of service. Its the game! Shouldn't you be well staffed? It took 15 minutes to order, 15 minutes for drinks and almost 25 minutes for a buffalo chicken poutine! The worst part was they changed the largest screen to baseball when basketball was not even over and it took at least 10 minutes to get it changed back. The waitresses were hesitant to do it or was it that they do not know how to do it? Never go here for a game. Saving my money for other places."}
{"text":"This is our \"Local\" Public House.  Cityplace just off Spadina.  Great location, lots of young people, great patio facilities.  Varied menu, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I always find it weird when chain restaurants that usually have consistently good food/service etc. Fail so bad in one specific location. These guys need to up their game - out service was nice and the place has potential but the food was bad to be honest."}
{"text":"Overall, I'd say a 3.5-star facility with a 1-star round up for being right in my building.  Pros: -Did I mention it's right in my building? -Lots of seating -Tons of TVs for watching the game of your choice -Very large patio -Large variety of food -What I've had has been pretty good  Cons: -Service has been spotty so far. Some of the wait staff has been very helpful and with it. Some got easily lost in the shuffle. Some were completely clueless. All of this could be growing pains to having recently opened, so the experiment continues. -Food isn't exceptional - decent, yes, but nothing so far has really stood out. -Prices aren't the best. Not bad by any means, but I always feel a little sting. -Gets very, very busy to the point of distraction at times. I don't really hold this against them - except for the service issue as mentioned above, but it's something to be aware of if you're wanting to have a conversation with someone.  Overall, I'm very happy with The Fox, and will definitely be back time and again."}
{"text":"I like it here..it's in the same condo my bf lives in - so that's cool.  I like the ambiance, even when it's empty...maybe I'm easy to please?!  The staff have always been really nice - the last time I was there the server was patient enough to deal with my bf and his channel change demands! lol.   I like the food, the service has always been fast and I have no complaints whatsoever."}
