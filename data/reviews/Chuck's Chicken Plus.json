{"text":"Checked this place out tonight as it was the old Mary Brown location. Wow is this chicken really good!!! Not too salty and so tender!! Loved the crispy exterior of the chicken. My kids loved the fries. So good we got second box for next days dinnee as we don't live nearby. Very friendly folks s free customer service!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Best chicken I've ever had!
I highly recommend this place. It's a five star as far as I'm concerned"}
{"text":"Love this chicken!! It's really hard to find good food in aurora but this place is worth the trip! The chicken is always fried fresh to order so it's hot and juicy...not just sitting under a heat lamp all day. It's flavorful and super crunchy. The place is clean and the staff are friendly and happy to cater to your chicken needs. If you're tired of the same old dry lukewarm chicken, you gotta try this place out...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good tasting fried chicken that is not too greasy.  Food was fresh and tasted good.  Prices are a bit high and you don't get much in a \"combo\" but it's worth paying for premium product.  Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised. Snow day and didn't feel like cooking. Pieces of chicken were huge, crunchy and  juicy just like you expect but rarely get. I would absolutely recommend. They even delivered"}
{"text":"this place is pretty legit. the pieces of chicken are so much bigger than any other fried chicken places . deals in store are also good ."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken in town no doubt! Crispy outside & juicy inside. Courteous & kind  staffs as well. Been coming here since it re-opened with new name."}
{"text":"This is probably the best fried chicken I've tasted my whole life. I also like that they have sweet potato fries as a side with no additional cost, but the chips are pretty terrible. Dinner and lunch specials mean this place is best value as well."}
{"text":"Best chicken place I've eaten at from Vancouver to St John's. They have the crispiest batter and is not greasy like KFC or Mary Browns. The batter texture is similar to Popeyes but without the Creole flair and spice. I really like this place. They accept call in orders and it's ready for pickup every single time I've gone at the exact time it was promised. If you don't feel like cooking and you want to try something new this might be the place for you. NB it is in fact our \"New Favourite.\""}
{"text":"The chicken was typical fried chicken. Not sure why all the rave reviews, perhaps a bit better than KFC or Popeyes. Overall good, nice place. Wide variety of sides."}
{"text":"Another great lunch today, I ordered 1 enormous crispy chicken breast and  some tater tots which is something new. Delicious...."}
{"text":"Very good fried chicken, not greatest- but very good. 
Ordered a 3 piece combo and happy to see 2 varieties of coleslaw as a side option. I went vingear slaw and the name holds true. Perfect amount of vinegar taste and good texture to veg.
Tried the waffle fries which were wonderfully crispy but a little to large in diameter. Would like to try taters next, look great!
The chicken came hot and fresh- so all in all worth the 12 minute wait. Got a leg, breast and side so lots of meat. Chicken itself was just moist enough but the batter lacked a little something extra. It was missing a peppery pop or combo of seasoning. The crispiness almost made up for that but not quite. 
Will definitely go back and try the burger and taters, I'm a huge fan of the big mary at Mary Brown's so that's the bar it is up against.

Service was outstanding and they walked my order to my table, thanks!"}
{"text":"Hidden jem! I was told about this place so decided to give this a try! For the price and the quality you get, my gosh is well worth it if you ask me!

I normally would stay away from deep fried food because everyone knows it's bad for you so it better be good if I am to eat them! :) I gotta say, this chicken place is well worth the trip just by the chicken quality alone. It's crispy on the outside and very juicy from the inside. And most importantly, its very fresh and smoking hot when u take the first byte! So be careful when u eat next time! 

Also tried the burger and it is crunchy and meaty as well! Last but not least, the fries/potatoe wedges are very fresh too- fresh off fryer and piping hot, crispy outside and soft inside! Yum!

Now, given the good food quality and the good price(eg. 2 can dine special for $10.49 with 4 pieces of huge chicken, 2 sides and 2 drinks), I can give this place a 4 stars without any hesitation. I would say more than 4 and less than 5 stars.

Oh one last thing, their services are very friendly - another plus!

Oh one one last thing, the only not so good would be the wait time for the chicken but I guess I would rather wait for the chicken to come off fresh from the fryer than the pre made ones where they just scope the chicken out after u ordered."}
{"text":"Your eyes will drop when you see the size of their chicken pieces! Also the juiciest friend chicken you will have, wedges were also really good!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Great deals. I could compare this to Popeyes. Super fresh made to order! Definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Delicious, crispy, crunchy chicken and fries. Very friendly and fast service as well. I recommend the waffle fries which are proper crispy golden."}
{"text":"Cant get enough of it! Visit once a week..Very good quality and portions are huge.  very tasty, very crispy and seasoning is perfect.  Owner buys chickens from local farmers... valient effort.  He puts a lot of effort in soucing high end quality products for excellent value!!  Potato wedges are a must... Why isn't this Franchised yet... this little shop needs to be mainstream.  Its smokes KFC and Mary Browns.  NEVER greasy...no comparison in my opinion.  A MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken strips. They were very good. The breading is nice and crunchy and the chicken was moist and delicious. I had a side of waffle fries. The fries are pretty standard. I will definitely be going again in the future."}
{"text":"Crunchy and light chicken that was well cleaned before being fried, it was very good. Waffle fries were excellent, not to chewy not to crunchy. Good place for lunch or dinner after a long day or during the workday."}
{"text":"Crunchy and moist chicken is always a winner. With lots of competition in the space, Chucks fall in the middle of the pack. Unlike KFC, it's a lot less salty, but the coating also has less seasoning delivering a milder flavour. 

It's nice to have a variety of sides, including wedges, sweet potato fries and \"lattice\" chips. Give Chucks a try if you are in the mood for quick chicken."}
{"text":"Just fantastic it's really what I think by the way which ones Chuck? Great fries, and superb chicken, I and my family really enjoyed this place. I would put them up against the big players (KFC,Mary Browns, and Popeyes) this was our first visit but won't be the last! Just the best chicken ever"}
{"text":"Their price s fair as well as quality. It doesnt taste as greasy as other fried chicken joints, but I do prefer Stockyards more. However, within the general vicinity, I think this will satisfy the fried chicken craving. They do need to have a spicy fried chicken option. 

The place is not a restaurant, but they do have seats that you can sit. Service was fast and the food came quickly."}
{"text":"Very good fast fried chicken. They didn't have exactly what was in the deal so they hooked it up so I'm not sure if this is normal but the price was great and portion size was huge. My wife didn't mind the macaroni but it wasn't my favorite. They also gave a spicy mayo which was good and a sweet chili sauce that was also good and a gravy that was very good. No need for any of the other fast fried chicken joints, it's all about Chuck!! Oh and my wife said the guy told her the chicken was from local sources but did't get all the info and their fries seemed pretty fresh can't say for sure but they were good!!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times already and they haven't disappointed me yet. The chicken is always fresh, very crispy, and the pieces are massive. It's not as cheap as the specials at Popeyes but it does taste a lot better. Love this place and I hope their consistency in quality continues as this is my only go-to fried chicken place right now."}
{"text":"Wow.  Nice people. Fast service. Yummy chicken!  

There is a continuous stream of people going through Chuck's.  The chicken itself is wonderful and keeps a few days in the fridge.  

Brings back the fried chicken into all our lives!"}
{"text":"I don't review often; I was motivated to do so this time because the man behind the counter was so friendly and patient. 

We ordered a three piece chicken combination and five chicken strips. Both came out quickly. The three pieces were a bit greasy, but in a good way. The skin was crispy and light and each piece had a generous amount of meat.

The chicken strips were all white meat and had a crispy, flaky breading. There's a choice of six different sauces. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was really sad when I saw Mary Brown's gone from this location... to my surprise this place is even better!

We were looking at the specials sign outside when a friendly staff invited us inside. The d√©cor is exactly the same as Mary Brown's, with the floors redone and cleaned up a bit.

We ordered the 6 piece & medium wedges for $13.99 - they have specials Monday - Friday 4-8PM and all day weekends. The specials are similar to Mary Brown's (2 sandwiches for $8.99, 11 pc for $16.99, family special for $26.99).

We ordered to go and as soon as I got in the car, it smelled amazing. The fried chicken was fresh, moist, crisp and still piping hot! The wedges were also extremely fresh and there was way more than enough food for two people.

I will definitely be back (and hopefully with more people so I can order the family special!!)."}
{"text":"My friend raved about this so we went.
The meal price was $6.99 for the fried chicken burger, small side and drink.
I choose the vitamin water but didn't know she charged it on top of the $6.99. So I paid for the drink separately. She didn't tell me it wasnt included in the meal promotion. I didn't get the free drink that was supposed to come with my meal. That really annoyed me. My friend paid so I didn't notice the overcharge error until later. I also didn't like how she combined my order with my friends. I wanted to pay separately. 
My friend who has been there many times also mentioned that the side portions are extremely small. He said it looked like I got 5 onion rings. My box wasn't even filled. He also said that the small sides from the B section were like a \"1 spoonful serving.\" aka. One bite!
In terms of the food, it was pretty good. The chicken was super crispy and the spicy mayo was delicious. The bun was oddly soft and squishy. More soft than any other bread. It was also the perfect amount of spicy. The onion rings were okay. I like burger king better (more crispy and thicker batter). Next time, I would get the burger by itself or try a different side.
Side note: I also puked right after this, but I don't know if it was from this as my friend was fine..."}
{"text":"Good is amazing
Staff is friendly
Food is a bit too salty
Takes too long to get ready
When will you guys bring delivery"}
{"text":"I love the chicken here, and the waffle fries are not a bad alternative to my craving for Chick-fil-A waffle fries!"}
{"text":"This located used to be Mary Browns Fried Chicken.  The new owner took over and it's now called Chuck's Chicken.  My boyfriend keeps raving about this place so I had to try it.  The service was amazing everyone's super nice. Met Chuck of Chuck's friend Chicken who's the cook he's super nice and friendly. Everyone that went in know him well. I ordered a 4 piece 2 can dine super cheap for $10.99 it comes with 2 sides and 2 drinks. The order was done quick. Got our food to go. Got home and my food was still nice and Krispy and hot. You can tell it was made as we waited and the Chicken was not just sitting in the kitchen. I ordered onion rings as my side it was delicious not too much batter on the onion rings. My boyfriend got the potato wedges it was coated with a seasoned thin batter, so so good. The Chicken had good quality meat and was super tasty and so much better than Popeyes! I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Better then kfc and marry browns by far. The chicken was juicy cripsy and made fresh to order. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"EXcellent chicken!  Fresh and well seasoned.... friendly staff too.  Only thing i didn't like was my macaroni salad was luke warm and too much mayo in it.....it was kinda gross....i couldn't believe how warm it was too.  But def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food is awesome. Nothing to complain about here! Ordered some of everything. Chicken sandwich was juicy and the wings with different sauces to dip. Love the slaw"}
