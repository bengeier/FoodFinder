{"text":"This is my new favorite place! Collar greens, chicken, sweet potatoes are generous and awesome."}
{"text":"Discover it when we parked near it while going to Cornish Pasty. We went there and picked up the original pudding, chocolate, and strawberry flavored to-go. They are delicious! Make sure you stop by immediately. The cafe is adorable and I can't wait to go back to try lunch (and get more pudding!)"}
{"text":"I have been craving banana pudding... so when I found this place, I put them on a very high pedestal. Not disappointed!
I got Sunday pudding and my husband the basic pudding. 
It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for awhile now.  What a disappointment. There is literally no banana pudding in the banana pudding.  it was a cup of whipped cream with banana slices and vanilla wafers.  Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed in everything about this meal. I wanted to be able to give a raving review for this gorgeous little shop, but I can't. The restaurant is beautifully decorated! Clean and bright! The food however was not good at all. I actually feel bamboozled by what I paid for! Banana pudding is supposed to be Bananas, Vanilla Wafers, some whipped cream and PUDDING! This banana \"pudding\", that I paid $5 for, was simply a few pieces of bananas, Vanilla Wafers and lots of whipped cream. No pudding whatsoever. Scrapped all of the way to the bottom and nothing. Definitely disappointed. Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing little place and the people couldn't be nicer. Not sure about the whip cream comments from other reviews, my banana pudding was delicious.  We'll definitely be back to sample the rest of the menu ASAP."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit and we're fans! Our server was really nice and the food was yummy, but of course the banana pudding was the star! Our server even gifted me a birthday (Leo's Rock ) banana pudding  Sooooo gooood! We'll be back and we'll definitely recommend to friends and fam."}
{"text":"Waste of money. I ordered the Original Banana pudding. The entire dish was filled with whipped cream, literally NO banana pudding was in it.. plus the bananas were warm and the whipped cream was cold..  WTF!!  Where was any pudding?  Get it together. One and done for me!!"}
{"text":"heard some good things about MGBP from people at work and thought i would give it a try.  Overall it's a nice place but they don't have a lot of menu options.  The good thing is the food is really good. i ordered the chicken breast with mac and cheese and the tip potatoes.  The chicken breast was on the small side compared to other places but it's totally worth the taste.   The sides were also good so i was overall satisfied with the portion size.  Anymore then that and you really are over eating.  The stand out for the sides was the tip potatoes. Give me a double portion next time

thank you for the good service and great food"}
{"text":"This place is the cutest little hidden gem! If you meet \"the girls\" for lunch, and want to be the one who knows of all the awesomely obscure adorable hotspots, this is for you! I'm going to attach pics next, because I just can't even describe the cuteness. I work nearby, and you can't miss their little themed food truck parked in the lot. You're like, \"Wha???\" And then you see the little red chairs outside their cafe for eating al fresco, and follow them inside the cafe, and you're like, \"WHA?????\" \"How is this here? How did I not know about this?!\"  Well now you know. Get yourself some soul food for lunch (chicken, greens, Mac n cheese, oh my!) and a banana pudding (with Nilla wafers and sundae toppings!) for dessert. Everything is divine, and like homemade. (If your mom was a REALLY good cook.)"}
{"text":"The place is super cute and I really just came for the banana pudding because that is the name of the place. I didn't know they served food also and there customer service was really nice and efficient. But I expected more from the banana pudding. I thought it was going to be made the soul food way. Which is the banana pudding being layered with cookies and baked or something. But it was the typical bland way and it wasn't anything special. I was kinda disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to make the trek over here as I browsed the latest and greatest eats next to me. Small, quaint, and beautifully furnished restaurant. Since I arrived towards closing time, I decided to sample what there known best for, BANANA PUDDING! It was good, not great but missed something extra special. There were fresh bananas inside the pudding, vanilla wafer cookies, and caramel topping. Will definitely make the trek back to try out  there wide range of desserts and ala-carte menu."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time tonight, got the chocolate banana pudding. The customer service was outstanding, we got it to go but ate outside on their cute yellow tables and chairs. She brought us each a cucumber water in to go cups, very thoughtful and appreciated. The banana pudding was different than expected, it's banana flavored whipped cream as opposed to custard, but the cream, bananas and chocolate were all fresh and yummy. Next time I'd probably try the banana split version."}
{"text":"This place has great vibes! It's food is delicious and the people who work here are extremely nice. I'm going to keep coming back. THE WINGS ARE GREAT!

P.S. try the St Louis chips"}
{"text":"Banana pudding that uses a banana flavored pudding?  Sorry, but no.  

Chicken was a bit overly salty.  Sides were the highlight. 

Make a banana pudding with vanilla base, and I'm a convert."}
{"text":"My granny never made banana pudding quite like this! Actually I never really saw my granny make anything at all so it's probably a moot point.

Anyways, this shop is in the space formerly occupied by Iss' Magic Oatmeal. They redid the interior a bit and I love the bright, sunny yellow accents to echo the banana theme of the restaurant. The menu has a limited but delicious selection of soul food as well as a few varieties of their signature banana pudding. I had the breaded chicken wings with collard greens and tip potatoes, and finished my meal with some banana split banana pudding.

Our server informed me that the chicken wings are made fresh and would take 25 minutes to make. Well, good things come to those that wait I figured! We did get some sweet, soft dinner rolls to start with. The sides came next. I liked the deep earthy flavor of the collard greens. It was such a concentrated flavor I could only take a few bites at a time though. I loved the tip potatoes. They had a spicy seasoning and even though it had what looked like Kraft cheese singles melted on top it actually was a good combo with the potato chunks.

The chicken wings came out piping hot, super juicy and tender. I loved the crispy breaded skin. It was perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of crispness and chew.

On to dessert! The banana pudding was amazing! It isn't your typical idea of pudding. This pudding was very light and whipped, kind of like a mix between pudding and whipped cream. It was served with Nilla wafers, strawberries, fresh banana slices, chopped nuts, chocolate sauce, pineapple, and whipped cream with a cherry on top! I loved all the elements together except for the hard, dry Nilla wafers which distracted from the other textures for me. Maybe if they were softer (Lightly soaked in something perhaps) they would go better with the rest of the dessert.

Service was friendly and sweet. 

I will definitely be back for more soul food and pudding! They have a tasty looking lunch deal that I will have to try one day too!"}
{"text":"The Banana Pudding was pretty good but my grandma has made it better, it was still pretty good tho, I was just a tad bit disappointed, also with the Mac and Cheese I was extremely disappointed because I was thinking it was going to be like a \"soul food\" type of ordeal. I'm not sure if is supposed to be a \"soul food\" ordeal because I ordered it from Uber eats rather than going into the actual location. But overall I would say the food it good, it has potential to be better tho."}
{"text":"I love this place the chicken breast dinner is delicious. You will not regret eating here. This is my spot"}
{"text":"The food was really good but service was a bit slow. There wasn't anyone in the restaurant when I got there. And the food took a while!!"}
{"text":"It would be nice if you were open during your posted business hours. Very disappointed, first time customer, will not return."}
