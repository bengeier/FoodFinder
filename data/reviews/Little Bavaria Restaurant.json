{"text":"Love this place!  Johnny is a great chef and host.  He can usually be seen at some point in the dining room greeting guests. The food is great and we live the schnitzel options. They are also willing to accommodate guest requests. Portions are large, so there is usually leftovers for the next day. Prices are great especially considering you also get soup or salad with your meal.   Johnny also hosts special events during the year.    We try to get in here at least once a month. Truly a hidden gem in Scarborough."}
{"text":"This restaurant tries to hard to be German and might be just fine for a foreigner but for a German it fails twice. First the food. The Schnitzel doesn't give any authentic taste. Maybe its the meat itself or the way its processed or not. It could also be the coating which reminds me of the one you can buy in a Canadian supermarket. The Schweinsbraten is very basic but ok. The meat is tender but too flawless. The sauce again like the Schnitzel coating, tastes like a mix and its not what a Schweinsbratensauce should be like. The sauce needs to be thin like a soup, golden colored (I can hand out instructions). If you want the best Schweinsbraten, you need a piece of meat which also has some fat/skin layer like the pigs back or shoulder to get that tasty crust. The Sauerkraut and Blaukraut was good. The Spätzle were really plain. I never saw pale Spätzle. Normally they're kind of golden. The second part is the decoration which is only secondary and didn't affect my rating. Its trying to hard to be Bavarian. Nothing in Bavaria is blue and white like this or is the Queen on every single wall, plate and table cloth in a British restaurant? Less could be much more in this little restaurant which otherwise can be pretty authentic. This all sounds really harsh but I think there is a lot of improvement possible. The reason why I ended up only giving 2 stars has 2 reasons. First the pricing is over the top and can even compete with the typical tourist traps in the Munich city center but if the food quality improves the thoughts about cost will be forgotten. Second, the day after I went to the Dutch restaurant biermarket which has a Oktoberfest special going on and I have to say it tasted better and more authentic. Maybe one day I'll take the effort again to bike all the way there from downtown to see if things changed. I'm always open to share further knowledge about certain Bavarian food if wanted."}
{"text":"Tastes like my oma's schnitzel... very authentic cuisine! The decor is true to many older generational German homes ... very cute cluttered and cozy! If you want to scoff down amazing food check this place out! If you want to see some great entertainment.... go on Oktoberfest for a real cultural experience!!!"}
{"text":"Once again, I thought I might find a proper schnitzel here, but I was very wrong, despite positive reviews.  This is just another business riding on past customers, making NO effort to provide diners with a decent experience.  1.  I first notice the \"German rye bread\" in a basket, a whole allotted TWO slices of cheap bread that is not German rye.   2.  I order wiener schnitzel, comes with two sides, soup or salad.   The house salad was bland and watery.  I ordered French dressing and got 1000 Island. No biggie, still looking forward to a great schnitzel dinner.  3.  The side of \"mixed vegetables\" was literally two TINY pieces of BROCCOLI MUSH, and two TINY pieces of CAULIFLOWER MUSH that I couldn't even lift to my mouth without it falling apart.  Pathetic.  The homemade potatoes were gross and glistened with grease everywhere.  4.  The worst was the schnitzel.  It was JUST GREASE GREASE GREASE!  It wasn't even blotted up.  No chef with self-respect would serve a pile of grease, both sides, literally forming a moat of oil when I pressed down on either side.  I had to use my napkin to absorb the oil, then ate my cold, still greasy slab of $17 pork.  Oh, and the \"wiener\" schnitzel is pork, not veal as it should be.  The VEAL schnitzel is 21.95 vs. 16.95 for the pork. But the good news is that I am sure they soak it to death in oil, so ask for extra napkins, blot off all the grease, then just ask them to microwave it for you....no biggie, right?  Pathetic restaurant.  I paid over $20 for 4 TINY, massacred/mushed pieces of vegetable and A SLAB OF GREASE.  Avoid like the plague.  Toronto has no authentic, PROPER wiener schnitzel anywhere anymore."}
{"text":"Little Bavaria has the WORST GERMAN FOOD myself or my fiancee have ever eaten. We walked out feeling like we had taken a wrong turn into a Berlin ghetto & suffered a mugging at the hands of ruthless gypsies. Let me explain why we had one of the worst food experiences of our lives ...  1. They had a special menu tonight for a \"German carnival\". When I booked reservations I wasn't told we had only 4 menu choices ... two schnitzels, one smoked pork hock & one \"sliced turkey breast with peppercorn sauce\". We weren't in the mood for schnitzel (especially for $17), so she ordered the sliced turkey breast & I ordered the pork hock ($24, but I was used to the MASSIVE pork hocks at The Musket, so I was willing to pay the price).  2. The rye bread they served was so stale, I speculate it was recently salvaged from Hitler's bunker. It actually CRUMBLED as we buttered it. But the dinner was about to get much worse.  3. The \"special\" menu choices came with cheap wilted iceberg lettuce salads drenched in disgusting store-bought bottled dressings.  4. When my fiancee's \"sliced turkey breast\" arrived we were shocked to see it was TURKEY SCHNITZEL with a side order of what appeared to be Elmer's glue with dead roaches in it (on closer inspection roaches were peppercorns). We informed our ditsy waitress of the error regarding the turkey. She claimed it was SUPPOSED to be schnitzel. I asked her why the menu did not say \"schnitzel\" or \"breaded cutlet\" or anything to indicate the \"sliced turkey breast\" was going to be adulterated with breading. She didn't know. I asked why the other two schnitzel items on the menu specifically utilized the term \"Schnitzel\" but the turkey breast item did not. She did not know. Needless to say, my fiancee was a real trooper and ate as much as she could. It was barely edible.  5. My \"pork hock\" could better be described as \"bone covered in ball of rubbery pork skin with bits of meat and fat embedded within\".  DISGUSTING. The rind was the consistency of an elephant's foreskin. At The Musket the rind is the best part--very crispy & can be eaten straight. The hock served at Little Bavaria was ONE THIRD the size of that served at The Musket. Luckily for me, my girlfriend's schnitzel was so bad that she stopped after eating half of it, giving me a scavenger-like opportunity to consume her throwaways.  6. Our side spaetzles were barely pedestrian. Her side sauerkraut & my side red cabbage were most definitely from a bottle shoplifted from the dollar store.  7. After the food was served we were IGNORED during the entire meal by the wait staff--I guess no one dared ask how the food was. After we consumed a sufficient quantity of calories to allow us to survive the drive back home without entering into dangerous hypoglycemia, I asked our waitress for the bill, which never arrived. Several minutes later I escalated my request to management. I informed our waitress & then what appeared to be the owner's daughter, that the food was TERRIBLE. The owner (who claims to be East Indian from Germany) came out & ARGUED with me as to how to properly cook German food (even though I used to do food reviews on tor.eats & have eaten at several German restaurants). When I told him about the error in the menu's wording regarding the turkey breast, he just brushed me off like it was no big deal. Then he told me that the reason why The Musket's pork hock tastes better than theirs & has deliciously crispy skin is because they DEEP FRY it while Little Bavaria GRILLS it. I asked him why he even bothers serving it if he cannot prepare it properly. He ignored the question. Then I asked him why the serving was so small for $24. He would not address my question. I told him that the hock he serves costs him $2-3 & that the markup is CRIMINAL. He stood there looking like a con artist that was just found out by a shrewd mark. I was so full of rage that I instinctively reached for my cutlery to impale him, only to find that the waitress had taken it away just moments before. My fiancee reached over & comforted me as the object of my scorn scurried off out of view.  Tonight was the first time in years that I gave a waitress ZERO tip. I paid the bill knowing I would get my money's worth writing this review everywhere on the internet over the next few weeks ... thank you Al Gore! That's worth $50.   Anyway, we're home now. Our Shih Tzu (named Mountain Bear) is chewing on the pork hock bone, which I secured before we fled the culinary crime scene. As I write this review he's ferociously destroying the bone. I was concerned he'd choke on it, so I said to him \"Mountain Bear, that's the most expensive bone you'll ever eat. Cost me 50 damn bucks. SAVOUR it boy!\" He isn't listening. Oh well, at least someone with the same culinary taste as the owner of Little Bavaria is enjoying their food! I feel sad for the elderly people that frequent this Google ratings trap. Jesus forgive them, for they have lost their taste buds & know not what they eat!"}
{"text":"I am German and have had the food there. The LBR definitely holds up to the name. I must admit that I love their Beer more than the food. Fresh cool Hacker-Pschorr from the tap is probably the nicest drink in the world when accompanied by Schnitzel, Sauerkraut and Spaetzle. However, I could never figure out why they parked this gem in the midst of a rotten strip mall in deep-end Scarborough. This area really smells. This restaurant would be a top pick if it was located in central Toronto. Enjoy the Little Bavaria Restaurant without regrets, it's the best right after the Musket out at Kipling. But only if you survive the trip to get there without getting bullet holes in your windshield ;-/"}
{"text":"Great little dive in scarborough. Situated in a seaty neighborhood, you'd never know that this is one of most authentic German restaurants in toronto. The food came out very hot and fresh. The schnitzel is incredible. Friendly and fast service.  A little pricey but the meal is worth it, a dinner comes with the choice of a soup or salad, sauerkraut, spetzle or roasted potatoes"}
{"text":"A random craving for schnitzel brought a friend and I to Little Bavaria. Located in a plaza at Eglinton and Markham, it wasn't what I expected when I entered; it was completely decorated like a German pub. So festive! White linens and flags everywhere!   We seated and scoured the menu. There's meat with more meat and a side of meat. Even though the menu has a lot of meat, there ARE vegetarian options. Sweet! I went with the Jäger Schnitzel($18.95). It has a red wine sauce with mushrooms and onions. My friend went with the Bavarian Plate($22.95). It comes with schnitzel, kassler and krainerwurst. Both came with soup or salad and 2 sides. SO MUCH FOOD. The schnitzel was ok, a little fatty though. The Bavarian Plate was good! I had a taste and it was pretty good.  Know what else is good about German restaurants? German Beer! I got myself a pint of Erdinger and enjoyed my meal! They also have a selection of German wines and spirits. A nice change from regular restaurants.   The service was good. It wasn't busy and one server was working. There was a large party there, but it didn't affect the speed of our food or service. The food was cooked fresh to order."}
{"text":"It's really difficult with a German background to find authentic German food in this city. However there was a time over 30 years ago when this restaurant was at the top of its game. Owners have changed at least 3 times during this period and most of the decor is still left over from the first owner. It was a real treat having this in Scarborough at one time and I believe there's still an opportunity for this place to excel. Unfortunately like many things it has changed too. The area is seedy and feels unsafe at most times of the day. The food doesn't have the same loving commitment that the first or even the second owner demonstrated in their culinary skills. The prices are far to high for the quality of food. Added to this is a poor wine list and only limited beers. Fortunately once you're inside the restaurant the atmosphere takes you away from the outside view. (small blessings). The best I can give this place is an OK. At least try the schnitzel with home fries and red cabbage. Oh and don't forget a cold Hacker-Pschorr. Top it off with a Rüdesheimer Kaffee on a cold day."}
{"text":"I like the complimentary german rye bread. I like how the vegetarian Schnitzel is made vegan. I found the Schnitzel too fried in my opinion, but a delicious treat.  I also liked devouring the fresh broiled veggies of broccoli, potatoes, and carrots. The atmosphere was cool to be immersed in. Seems authentically German influenced interior decorations"}
{"text":"The service was good and the waiter was very friendly, but we found the food to be lacking in authenticity."}
{"text":"This is my review which pays RESPECT to all those hard-working future Chefs, but temporarily Culinary Students. For Restaurant details, please refer to Jennifer K's review.   We were offered the Lunch Menu and we ordered a stand-alone HUNGARIAN Goulash Soup which is in the first quarter of your curriculum, Soups & Stocks.  It was hearty with flavourful Beef Stock and an added kick of Paprika.  The Beef Chunks were cooked tender and the Potato Cubes(Peel & Pre-Cook) as well.  Rahm Schnitzel in Creamy Mushroom Sauce($10.95) included a Dumpling Soup as starter which was your classic Chicken Stock, which you'll probably remember your Chef telling you not to be afraid to SEASON your food.  The Dumpling=Spaetzle made from spooning runny dough past a sieve into boiling water, which comes in the second half of your course in the Pasta section.  We opted for the Sauerkraut but that along with Red Cabbage is going to be during your Vegetarian lesson.  It was served warm and soft as I learned from prior German food research.  The Creamy Sauce is your Bechamel Mother Sauce with Button Mushrooms.  Just don't make it too THICK with your Roux.  Common mistake!  Most modern cooks don't use much Roux anyways, because it's too rich.  Small amount of Beurre Manie will do fine as final touch.  The lightly breaded Veal Schnitzel need some ELBOW grease to pound thin.  Cooking isn't light exercise, it's sweaty physical hard work.  It tasted A-OK.  For all those future Chefs out there, this place is truly where you'll see the basic techniques and cookery at display but at the same time that's why it's called BASIC, therefore an A-OK meal for it's value.  Here's hoping your success. Zigga Zagga Zigga Zagga Oi Oi Oi!"}
{"text":"4/5 for the ambience and decor, the place is cozy and cluttered with German ephemera!  I had the parmesan schnitzel which I think is the best one. My parents were ok with their schnitzels but didn't seem very impressed. I enjoyed coming here but I feel like their menu is hit and miss."}
{"text":"This was literally a hidden gem. The food was good and authentic. Very tasty and just what I had in mind.  We ordered the food to go because of the location. I had the Parmesan schnitzel with spaeztle. My hubby has the cordon bleu schnitzel. Both were very very good! Very tasty! The meals came with bread and a side salad. We also ordered a side of gravy. We love cheezy food. And the cordon bleu was spot on! The cheese oozing out with the crisp breading was just heaven!   Very small restaurant. Would seat 40-50 at most. Very discreet entrance but when you enter, the resto is embellished with all German accessories. I just hope they move to a more welcoming area.  Location location location. We used to live here in the area for about 2 years ago but always wanted to try it. Only problem was the sketchy location. Because there were always people standing around, sometimes drunk. So now we just ordered ahead, picked up, and left. Would have wanted to eat there for the full German ambience."}
{"text":"We ordered a Cordon Bleu Schnitzel and a Jager Schnitzel for dinner.    The cordon bleu schnitzel was a chicken breast stuffed with cheese and ham.  The chicken was moist and tender.  It was evenly breaded and deep fried to golden brown.  There was plenty of cheese, and it was good cheese, but little ham.  If I didn't know it came with ham, I would not suspect it.  The jager schnitzel was a plain pork steak with a red wine sauce with onion, smoked meat and mushroom.  The pork was tender and hammered thin.  The sauce was rich with onion flavour.  There was loads of mushroom but little smoked meat.  There were 2 waitresses for a crowded restaurant.  They were friendly and effective.  We were seated quickly.  We were left alone most of the time other than order taking, delivery and payment.  No asking if everything was okay or water refill.  Efficient but can be more attentive.  The exterior storefront is unpretentious, and may I say overly so.  It looks old and almost seedy.  The interior is decorated richly with everything German - picture, soccer balloon, lighting, poster.  It has its character and charms.  Price wise, it was on the expensive side, but it has so little competition that it is pretty much a case of take it or leave it.  Overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant was ok. Although you get a lot of food, a $20 dinner at Markham and Eglinton seems like a lot of money.  The food was a bit bland, but my dining partners really liked the their meals, so maybe it was just me!"}
{"text":"Lots of schnitzel. Not a schnitzel fan so I had the bratwurst instead plus a huge stein of beer. Decor is very Bavarian and staff are friendly. Good place to get up and walk around and admire the decor. Left the place tipsy from drinking lots of beer. Thankfully wife was driving. Would totally go again."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for a long time so, we finally decided to check it out. Little Bavaria was a bit tricky to find as it is hidden in a small plaza... thank goodness for GPS.   We went with a group of 6 and most of my friends in this group were German. Tough crowd to please. So... we found that the service was quick and friendly. Food was delightful. A few of us ordered Rouladin which passed all of my friends picky tastes. Phew, I felt relieved.   One person ordered the Cordon Blue Schnitzel and just loved it. Another person ordered Jager Schnitzel  and enjoyed it as well. I must say all of the meals served were very juicy, moist and done to perfection. My friends (who are kinda picky) all enjoyed their food which surprised me. Yay it was a hit!!  I thought the prices were fair for the type of food and portions served. Authentic German beer offered. The restaurant may look a little bit cluttered but that is how many German places are so everyone felt quite comfortable. I will be back for sure. Great food, great value and a great night with my friends. Did I mention most of them were picky??  I would highly suggest making a reservation as space is limited.  One point lost for the location as it was in an odd area of the city."}
{"text":"There are not that many traditional German restaurants in Toronto.. and it is really rare in Scarborough to find a \"Western\" or a German restaurant!  Little Bavaria is located right at the corner of Markham Road and Eglinton... in a seedy strip plaza. A location which I doubt I will come by myself in the evening!   The interior is nicely decorated with German memoriabla and cheesy German items... like a soccer ball hanging from the ceiling...and German music playing in the background and you might think that some dancing waitstaffs will come out from the back and perform German Folk dance any minute.  The nice waitress here does wear a German folk looking top but not a Dirndl and she is not German :). And of course no dancing.. no low cut dress but the food here is authentic German...  The food choices here are really simple with lunch specials starting from around $9 that includes soup or salad and some cardboard tasting good for you Rye bread basket. I do love the soup... Goulash Soup is great.. dumplings Soup is meh...... the veal is tender and the sauce rich in favour.  Little Bavaria for sure is a little German gem in this Scarborough area!! It is an great alternative if you are sick of Asian/Middle Eastern/Indian food in the area.  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Here visiting from Detroit and was happy to find this place. Excellent service. Bad food. Bavarian plate was mostly bland with a side of grease. Goulash soup was $9 for a small bowl that tasted slightly burned or perhaps reheated poorly. Beef was gristly. Would not return here and I rarely leave poor reviews."}
