{"text":"Good food. Clean. Friendly service.  Four adults for lunch was less than $50"}
{"text":"Went there once. Plastic coffee cups. Its closed. No surprise. Would not have gone back anyway."}
{"text":"Don't bother if you want to eat what you ordered. Cashier barely listening when you order. I had to repeat my order for two sandwiches twice. Soda fountain not working correctly and they said pick another flavor as the only solution. I returned home to find my order wrong, ate what I got instead and got sick and spent the next 2 hours on the toilet. Save yourself and go elsewhere. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"Great little place on the golden mile highway.   This is our new cure for the remorse feeling we get every time we walk out of Panera or Dicks Diner.   A tad more expensive than Panera but the quality makes it easier to pay.   It is independently owned and is only open till 3pm.   They serve breakfast all day on the weekends.  Panini's, salads, pretzel sandwiches homemade soups.  I've had the marinated chicken salad (crisp,fresh, filling with lots of grilled chicken) and the turkey bacon panini, excellent!"}
{"text":"We are thrilled to have Cafe Lola in our center. The owners are awesome the food and service are spectacular. Super trendy with tons of deliciousness !!  The decor is only surpassed by the food.  My fav...Italian Ice!!  Strawberry, lemon, orange....? I can't decide!! Must visit! Does not disappoint."}
{"text":"The cutest little spot ever. Make your morning, afternoon or even the day you choose to play hooky from work great with an ice latte and some yummy butter me up toast! 

ADVICE: make sure you go dressed up cute with your face looking 100% else you'll miss out on the perfect selfie opportunity! 

I'll be back soon and more often!"}
{"text":"Just went to @ilovecafelola and it was honestly the cutest Instagram worthy place. There was both indoor & outdoor seating that was perfect for hanging out with friends or even for parties! However, the coffee was decent & was overpriced. I thought this was an average cup o joe that definitely wasn't worth the price. The customer service wasn't the best either, we got most of our drinks right away but, we ended waited 15-20 mins for a smoothie that they forgot to make. They didn't offer compensation over the wait! Wish I would have had a better experience!!"}
{"text":"Super cute, delicious fun girls day get away
Froze, special lattes, toasts, wine desserts love the rose gold fixtures. Instagramable walls"}
{"text":"SO PRETTY  Absolutely love the decor here! The beautiful wall of flowers  is such a pretty touch to the place and a must for picture taking and selfies of course!!

The pink old fashion phone and white girls bicycle with the flower basket was my favorite decor in here, reminded me of old pictures of my mom in The Hamptons in the 60's. Lol we couldn't resist had to take fun photos it's such a cute setup.

My friend and I started off with the Cupcake Latte Iced I had mine with Almond Milk and it was sooooo delish! The mini cupcake on top was so moist and had so much flavor. We both really enjoyed this! 

We decided to get a few items and share that way we could experience more. The Let's Avocuddle was AMAZING so much flavor in the perfectly ripe avocado, it was lightly seasoned and that just gave it the right amount of zest. Savored every single bite of this toast.

Next we had the Granny's Sammy and also added avocado to the breakfast sandwich it also was so savory only thing we wish we would have added the bacon to give it a lol crunch and some saltiness to it. 

Lastly got the meat & cheese plate as well it was the perfect portion size and was beautifully displayed on s gorgeous platter. Had very good selection of cheeses each very different but all complimenting what else was on the plate. Yummy those almonds were tasty and I loved the fruit preserve on the toast too!

Oh yes we were so full and completely satisfied BUT we couldn't leave without getting any dessert!! That's my favorite meal of the day lol and their selection looked really good!

We chose to get 1 each of the macaroons, vanilla, pistachio, passion fruit, raspberry (I forgot the other one) 
Ahhhhhhh macaroons if made right are 1 of the best sweet indulges you can have and let me tell you these melted in your mouth were so light and airy but had the perfect slight crunch when you bit into them but were so moist inside. I would go back just for these absolutely a favorite here! 
The blueberry loaf was good too had just the right amount of blueberries in it was very moist as well and that touch of lemon made it have the perfect zest. Thankfully it was not a huge piece and we shared it and could barely fit in the last bite.

The prices are good I feel you pay a lil more at a cafe' like this but you get much better ingredients and quality of food & drinks are higher then an average cafe'.

Next visit definitely getting the Frose' this is a highlight of theirs and I've heard great reviews from others it's a must try! Plus I need more reasons to come back :))"}
{"text":"Such a cute little coffee spot! Came on the weekend when they had just opened. Service was a bit slow but understandable that this may occur on an opening day. Very welcoming, the place is so tidy. I love the theme this cafe displays and the food is very delicious, can't wait to come back and try more items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Cafe Lola is definitely somewhere you want to be if you want to socialize and take instagram worthy pictures.  However, if you're looking for place to grab some brunch that will satisfy your taste buds, you are in the wrong spot.

 My girlfriend and I ordered the Matcha frappe and the iced Emerald latte.  The Matcha frappe literally tasted as if I was drinking water with a hint of matcha.  We complained and they offered to swap drinks.  We then got the iced Emerald Latte which was also immensely watered down. We didn't even bother to make swap it out again.

 We then got the toast with berries.  It was good, but definitely not worth $10.  The toast consisted of berries, cream cheese, and honey.  Nothing spectacular.  

 Don't waste your time.  I give it a 10 for aesthetics, but a 1 for quality."}
{"text":"A cute new cafe located in South Summerlin, such a great location and easy to get to. The decor is perfect all white and hints of black and pink. I got a iced chai latte, a breakfast sandwich with bacon and an açaí bowl. The chai was good and not too sweet. The breakfast sandwich was fresh and the bacon made it perfect. The açaí bowl was perfectly sized and tasted well. All their food is served in cute pink plates and bowls. One side of the walls is a rose wall and writing with neon lights! It's so beautiful you will need a photo! Will be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Cafe Lola is trendy as heck: customized latte art, a pink flower wall, neon sign, more toast than you can handle. But they also have vegan options, and comfortable seating, and friendly service, and an evening menu with charcuterie, and did someone say frose?! There are certain dining destinations that are termed \"an instagrammer's dream,\" and this place is definitely that. 

You'll probably spend a pretty penny here on your food and beverage, but  I want to stop shy of calling it overpriced- you don't have to spend $12 on a specialty tea latte with rose petals but you can. The salmon on their Barney toast was generously portioned for the price, and the Cupcake Latte includes a bite-size treat. Their croissants are the size of my face and they have salads and sandwiches for those looking for a more filling lunch in the area.

There's only a couple of things this spot needs: a few outdoor tables (seems to be shaded so that's a plus), more clarity on alternative milk fees (coconut milk is $2?), and more excuses for me to be on this side of town!

TIP: Limited exterior signage, same building as BWW."}
{"text":"This place it has a nice atmosphere but overly price because they serve very small portions , nothing special something you can make at home I believe they still working and testing the  menu hopefully they improve it..the coffee was good but not enough food paid 50 bucks for literally two toast with regular  fruit with honey"}
{"text":"Holy Moly. 
My boyfriend and I love finding coffee joints on the weekend to try and this is place is one of the best we been to. Cafe Lola has a great way of putting their personal twist on their menu items. I had a Granny Breakfast Sammy with avocado and bacon, my boyfriend ordered the same. Man oh man, let  me tell you, If I could order a supply of their english muffins I would. I also ordered an iced white mocha. I order this every where and Cafe Lola's is in my Top 3 now. My boyfriend mixed a couple favorites of his own and ordered a Matcha Horchata Latte, you will have to see his review on how much he loved it! @Alexander Gonzalez 
I know we will be back for more, they have us hooked"}
{"text":"Really pretty. I'd like to come back with some girlfriends. My kids liked the frozen hot chocolate and I liked the hot Cocoa. They do need MUSIC thou. Because there was no music plating everyone was speaking low or whispering."}
{"text":"Can you say Instagram worthy?! This cafe is just a bundle of cuteness! It is a bright and welcoming setting filled with colorful floral decorations. 

To the right, you'll see a rose covered wall. Once you look up, you can see the beautifully set chandeliers that brighten up the room. The wall by the counter is decorated like a perfect Pinterest picture (they have a bike!). Literally every corner is a beautiful place to take a picture in 

My friends got the cupcake latte. Yum! It is topped with whipped cream and pink sprinkles. It also comes with a mini cupcake (in our case since cupcakes were sold out, it came with a macaron). I ordered the very berry truffle latte. There wasn't as much of a coffee brew taste compared to the cupcake latte, but is had \"hello beautiful\" printed on top! Cute right?! 

Food is pretty tasty as well! It was great for a brunch get together  have to come again! 

I'll post pictures for you to see now"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Had the pesto chicken flatbread and Lola burger. Flatbread was tasty and burger cooked very well with good flavor. Will definitely stop again. Only downside was the coffee. For a coffee shop you don't expect a cup of joe that has been seeping in its pot way too long."}
{"text":"The day of the soft opening, was a better experience than today (5/24/18): poor coordination on fulfilling the simple food order placed, specially considering they only had 2 tables at the time.

Cinammon roll was stale, other food items were just fine. Poor... poor... poor... customer service in addition to a long wait.

I really hope the owners can put together a better team to serve their clients."}
{"text":"Cute cute space that's easy to find!  Loved loved loved the avocado toast (chose it on multi grain).  The breakfast sandwich with bacon on an english muffin was delish!  Not to mention the lavender iced breve...not too sweet, just right.  The staff was friendly from the minute we walked in the door until we left.  Loved the decor (cutest pink telephone on the wall!).  See ya again Cafe Lola!"}
{"text":"I love finding new cafes and I'm so glad to have found this place. I went for brunch with my mom on Sunday and the ambiance was super nice. There was a DJ (not sure if that's a normal thing) and there were so many people dressed nicely. I got a London Fog (iced) and honestly it was watered down I think because of the ice but I would definitely try it again before I make my judgment. The smoked salmon toast (I forgot the name) and the avocuddle toast was bomb! I would definitely go back to try more things! Also for you Instagram fanatics this place will be an adorable place to get some cute pictures in ;)"}
{"text":"The cutest little coffee shop ever! So trendy and always a good time! The meat tray is great and love the Italian ice!"}
{"text":"Come for the pictures. The décor at Café Lola is THEEEEEE CUTEST ever. 
And the drinks were pretty good. My friend and I both got iced tea drinks. She got like a hibiscus flavored tea and I got a coconut crème white tea. Delicious and very refreshing especially in the hot summer afternoon!!
I would love to come back here again so I can try their coffee and food items.

Only one side of the wall is decorated with flowers and greenery while the other side is pretty plain. Wish they decorated the other wall as well so everyone isn't fighting for tables by the flower wall. Café Lola opened about a month ago so hopefully they're still adding some finishing touches to this place.

Also, I wanted to try the Lola's Signature Vanilla Rose Latte but that thing cost $12.18!!!!!!!! For a latte!?!?! It's oolong rose tea, organic rose water, milk, vanilla, crushed rose petals served with a rose macaron. Why the heck is this so expensive!?! Is it because there's \"organic\" rose water!?! -__- oh geez. I swear, the minute the word \"organic\" in something...the price shoots straight up! For that kind of price, I better lose 15 pounds IMMEDIATELY after drinking this!

This is really a 3 star review but I bumped it up one more star because of the décor."}
{"text":"Super cute new cafe ! I had a hazelnut latte with soy milk . They have a crazy amount of options on milk varieties , reminds me of LA. The breakfast sandwich I had was super tasty with loads of avocado , no skimping there ! 
The price was steep but I'm willing to pay for quality . It's pretty inside the cafe but is missing a coziness that's hard to put your finger on ."}
{"text":"I have been dying to check this place since I've seen it all over social media. This place is defiantly a cute place to take cute pictures and enjoy an upbeat atmosphere! 

The place was PACKED when I went there, with limited seating and a small building in general, it almost made me want to leave, but as I've been dying to try this place out I stayed. The customer service was honestly not good and the pricing for their menu items are a little pricey for just a coffee and the food items. I know the workers were over whelmed as the place was packed, so I'm sure the customer service would have been better with a less stressed atmosphere! 

I got the berry toast, which was absolutely amazing! Very sweet and very yummy. I also got the lavender latte, and it was good but not the best lavender latte I have had. I would go here again, but I would go later in the day to avoid the crowd (I went around 1pm on a Sunday) and I would go for their fancy cocktail drinks to try and avoid the morning/brunch coffee time. 

Overall I think this a very good/cute place to go too! defiantly a cute spot to meet for a girls days. But a little overrated and not worth the hype."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just checked this place out for lunch. The place was crowded with people when we walked in. The decoration is super cute, modern, and have a high end feeling. There's also a DJ  in the place. We ordered the Barneys Toast, Butter me up, green tea, hazelnut latte, and a cookie. The food was very fun and unique to taste. We really like it! The drinks are a bit bland, but we are willing to try again. Cookie was light and not too sweet. I REALLY LIKED IT. We enjoyed the experience A LOT and would come back to try other stuff. I definitely recommend everyone to come and try it out."}
{"text":"A super cute coffee/brunch stop. I ordered the egg sandwich and was pretty surprised at how much they gave in comparison to other coffee shops. The cupcake drink tasted pretty good (with an added cupcake bite). The only downside would be that it is a bit pricey. However, what do you expect for a super hip coffee shop in Summerlin? 

I'm also not into taking selfies and whatnot but the customers that come here definitely are. The majority of the customers that I saw were mostly busy trying to get the perfect picture/filter before they even touched their food. It was almost funny to watch because so many people were obsessing over it! So for those of you Instagram lovers - this is your spot  

Overall, I love the environment. I'd come back for another egg sandwich and maybe one day I'll try those vegan donuts."}
{"text":"This place is more about being Instagram-worthy and less about actual quality. 

I really wanted to like this place. Don't get me wrong, it's an adorable set-up with super cute decor, but if I end up spending $63 on what's essentially toast and bougie tea, I expect more from the supplier. I have no problem dropping cash on something that I deem is worth the price tag, but there is no way I could justify paying as much as I did for the product that was turned out to me at Cafe Lola. 

My friend and I each ordered the Vanilla Rose Latte, which is supposedly a signature drink of theirs. It tasted like water with a very faint essence of rose. Definitely not worth the equivalent of the $12.96 we paid for each drink. I also ordered the Butter Me Up toast, which is basically a single piece of toast with almond butter and some fruit on top. If I'm spending $10.18 on a piece of TOAST, I expect more from what was served to me - maybe thick, artisanal bread that was baked that morning with some kind of garnish on the side. Not something I could've made at home for half the price. 

My friend got the Let's Avocuddle toast, which looked a little more hearty, but still didn't warrant paying $10.56. She also got a salad - that was probably the only thing ordered that we felt the price matched the product. 

For 5 items, the total was $63, and I felt like I flushed my money down the toilet when I paid for it. So absolutely not worth it at all. Again, I have no problem paying that amount if the product that was turned out matched in quality, and this was far from it. Basically, if all you care about is Insta-worthy food and drinks, this is your place. I'd personally suggest saving your money for a place that turns out a more quality product for your dollar."}
{"text":"Cafe Lola has such a sweet decor going on. The pink flower wall to the neon sign adds such a touch to their minimalistic chic theme. There are many opportunities to take some pretty hip pictures here.

When I entered, the place was packed but luckily a group just left so there was an empty table. 
Although there is a wall menu, the employee gave me a paper menu. She was pretty nice by the way.
They offer coffee, tea, wine, champagne, baked goods, and food. 
I ended up ordering the 20 oz Matcha frappé (over $7 with tax) and the 5 macarons in a box ($14).
The drink actually tasted like a blended, unsweetened soy milk. I did the like the whip cream on top though. The macarons were soft and delicious. My favorite would probably be the raspberry flavored.

In my opinion, Cafe Lola is a bit on the pricier side but I would come back to try their tea."}
{"text":"Honestly the place is really cute . I was really disappointed with the customer service. Took a girlfriend today to have breakfast. Ordered the Avocado toast and the salmon lox toast . Food was really good, but overpriced. My disappointment comes from the \"guy\"  making the coffee. Totally rude . I ordered a chai and it literally tasted like water . I asked for him to Make it more dirty chai and he Seemed irritated. After making my drink . It still tasted awful . I didn't bother asking to make it again . Didn't want to deal with his poor customer service. I just read another commenters review, same complaint he had .... coffee and lattes tasting water downed."}
{"text":"Cafe Lola is super cute!  Their menu is small but trendy... different toasts, salads, and baked goods (and champagne and wine) but we went for the coffee!  Both my sister and I got the horchata latte which is made with almond milk, honey, and cinnamon...with latte art!  I usually stay away from flavored coffees because they tend to be super sweet but this wasn't. They put just enough honey to add to the flavor but not make it overly sweet.  The cinnamon also cut the sweetness of the honey.  We both enjoyed it!

The place was SUPER crowded but the staff was on top of it.  They had a runner picking up orders and delivering them to tables immediately.  They had several people working the counter and the line moved quickly.  For having just opened a week ago, they were on top of things!

The decor was totally cute, I could see people having bridal or baby showers there.  It is definitely a place for a Sunday girls brunch date vis a vis Sex in the City.    We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The epitome of mediocre! Over priced drinks and food, don't be fooled by how \"instagram-able\" the interior is. Paying $10 for a small latte for it to taste like a Starbucks Coffee on a bad day. However, that cheese platter was pretty good. Could use more than 2 pieces of bread you stingy bastards"}
{"text":"Great environment and beautiful floral blush pink and white interior ! My lavender coffee was amazing ... my salmon toast was okay, nothing really special, but tasty ! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"SUCH a cute place to grab a small bite to eat and coffee/tea. It was pretty busy when I went with almost no available seating but I would've waited it out because I knew I wanted to try this place. Kind of a hole-in-the-wall type of cafe, if it wasn't for google maps I wouldn't of recognized/seen where it was just by driving by. I got the berry toast (super yummy!) an iced mocha and my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich and a fresh squeezed OJ. Everything was great but my boyfriend wasn't full off of his dish which is why I mentioned in the first sentence 'small bite' to eat. It held him over for an hour or two but then he needed something else to fill him up. When we were ordering there were quiet a few workers behind the counter which was great but they all seemed pretty frantic, busy, in a hurry, stressed, etc. friendly but just felt a little rushed when ordering. I heard one of them apologize to the table next to us for the wait, that they were down a barista. All-in-all, great place! I'll be back."}
{"text":"The cutest cafe I've ever been to!! Super clean and very cute and chic. I love the decor there! The employees were really friendly, it takes a while for your order to come out but it's probably because it's made with love :) The froze was really good, the tea is okay they could make the flavor of the tea stronger, but other than that, I'm in love!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Lovely decor and great menu selections. I ordered the salmon lox toast and the horchata iced latte with almond milk and both were delicious and made promptly. Total came to $19 which I thought was a little pricey but can understand that you're paying for the nice ambiance as well. My friend ordered the breakfast sandwich which came with a bounty of avocado and the biscuit was thick and fluffy; definitely could have been split between two people. I can't wait to try more of the items!"}
{"text":"This morning we came to cafe Lola and ordered a few things to try. While we aren't critics, my girlfriend, myself and my kiddo are foodies at heart. We shared a few things to see what all we may like we started with the Beauty and the Beet salad and the Berry Delicious toast, my best friend had the lemon tart and my two year old had a vegan sprinkled donut. She had a matcha and I had a peach tea, everything we ate was perfect. I'm not even sure if the in house made gelato is on the menu yet, but it was SO good and refreshing. It also shows the business even though in its infancy is working hard to continue to evolve and serve its customers. It was a beautiful quiet morning and it was pretty busy on a week day. The owners were there, interacting with customers like family. You can tell they work hard and love what they do. I did see a tip that this is not a good place for kids, let me note... we were responsible enough to call ahead and bring our own personal booster seat ( there isn't a changing table in the bathroom) but maybe soon they'll have booster seats, I don't see high chairs in their future but that could come too perhaps. 

I'm going to say as a mom of a very well behaved & potty trained two year old if you don't have a child who would sit quietly or use soft voices  during a 1-2 hour movie in a theater or you wouldn't take them to the smith center for a show... probably save this special cafe for adult outings BUT there were a couple of other moms who walked in with their daughters (under 5) and they all behaved and it was sweet to see how something so beautiful like this restaurant brought so many people out to enjoy their cafe, predominantly women and couples. Even some ordered at the counter and left (because you can always enjoy the great food & drinks at home with kids of all ages among the chaos right?) haha 


If you came here for a work meeting it's quiet, if you came here on a Date it's chic, if you came here for lunch it's delicious and you'll be glad you stopped by... but I was blown away by their hospitality and will be back. These people have found the water and soil  to keep Cafe Lola blooming! Thank you for your service!"}
{"text":"Definitely an instagram worthy place to get a cup of coffee/tea!
I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are going to study, I made this mistake (thinking it was a quiet cafe) but it is not. It is a cafe to take pics & socialize...so yes it is LOUD.
-I really love the decor & flowers on the wall
-Attentive service & friendly staff :)
-Tea & coffee were good (just a bit overprice)
-Breakfast sandwich was delishhh"}
{"text":"This place is too overpriced! I ordered the berry delicious toast, and there wasn't anything special about it. It costed 10 dollars. I also ordered the matcha frappe, and it tasted watered down. This place is aesthetically pleasing but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Beautiful girly and a little rose , yesss hunty yesss! Absolutely lovey. Pretty busy, no reservation (unfortunately since it's kind of a free for all) and you can't drink at the tables outside (know that in advance). Great place for a girls brunch or a birthday. Good is super yummy too. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Proper, prim, and pink are just some of the verbs that can be used to describe Cafe Lola. This little cafe is filled with fluffy pink cloud that sparkles and shine down with Rose champagne. It is a perfect and girly experience that is shear elegance and extraordinary.

The service here is impeccable and the staff offers suggestions at every turn. They treat the customers with prestigious and are so polite. I decided to have the tea latte. Wow this was amazing and made my taste buds flip around on my tongue.

This cafe offers vegan menu and even donuts that are vegan too. I had one of the rainbow sprinkles donuts and it pairs nice with the tea latte too. The donut is too pretty to even eat I feel, but I managed to consume it. The donuts was magical. I was upset no unicorns visited the store why I was here."}
{"text":"Delicious parfait, great atmosphere, and the best lavender latte. Great for Sunday morning brunch with friends. I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overpriced!!! Nothing special about this cafe. I got a drink with the avocuddle toast and my bill came out to be $15, the avocuddle was simply just a whole avocado sliced up on a toast. On a positive note, it's a clean place with nice decorations and they were pretty fast at serving our drinks and food."}
{"text":"Ok if all you want is toast and wine. No sandwiches or anything substantial. Won't be backo"}
{"text":"We went to Cafe Lola since I've followed them for so long on Instagram waiting for them open. It's a cute cafe decked out in millennial pink, and honestly, I'm a sucker for anything that is themed well. The owners were there helping run food orders and generally checking up on people. 


We went on a weekend before a large rush, and grabbed a few drinks and food. For the price, it's kind of expensive for what you get. I got the vanilla rose latte with macadamia milk and a croissant. My bill was closer to $18-20. My friends got a toast and charcuterie plate, and it was pretty pricey.

The vanilla rose latte comes with a macaron which isn't too bad of a deal, but it's definitely not worth $12. They do put rose petals on the top of the foam which is a nice touch. The latte itself was kind of watery, but I think that might have to do with the macadamia milk. Since it's not real milk, it doesn't get the nice, fluffy foam you usually get with whole milk. The latte still didn't have a ton of flavor. It's okay, but it's not great.

The toast and charcuterie plate were really good, but definitely not worth the price. I might get the toast again if I'm feeling zesty, but as for the charcuterie plate, I can probably get it somewhere else for a better deal.

Overall, Cafe Lola is a nice, cute cafe to hang out with your friends and chit chat. The staff are friendly, and the owners were there to help out with orders. It made for a good experience overall. I wouldn't say this place is the best in terms of value and flavor for your food, but at the same time, it's a great place to enjoy the company of your friends and family."}
{"text":"This place gives off the ultimate \"fancy brunch\" vibes. A cute modern little cafe that serves more than traditional coffee. For starters, they're doing great! Especially with their advertising; however there are some kinks that still need to be worked on. 

Although their products are picture perfect. The tastes aren't quite there yet. I ordered a lavender latte where I could taste a bit of lavender here and there, but ultimately... it just tasted watery. Similar with the iced vanilla latte we ordered. 

Also, the staff and menu don't advertise the great machine that creates the adorable designs on the lattes. I think maybe giving the customers an option that could improve the place up a bit. 

The menu is however on the pricer side. Like don't get me wrong good quality products don't come cheap. But I don't think that the signature featured drink should be a vanilla latte with rose petals that's $12. I mean if it had some alcohol in it then maybe it'd attract the audience even more... And after my 2 watery drinks i'm a bit relieved that I didn't try out the signature latte. 

It also gets fairly busy here, and there are rarely any spots. I suggest coming in the morning on a weekday to beat the rush, and since many are normally at work. There's not much seating and it is fairly warm inside. 

The staff is great, they're all friendly and dressed in theme attire. It's like walking into a little france cafe. They are all extremely attentive towards detail. TRUST ME. We went when there was a special event, so they reserved the entire wall with the signature cafe lola neon sign. 

The staff literally were shuffling back and forth during our entire visit just to move tables by a centimeter. Kinda sucked since they ended up in the background of ALL of our photos :/// And since the tables were reserved we weren't able to take any other great pictures with the cafe lola sign and the floral walls."}
{"text":"Be prepared to spend upwards of $40 on the mediocre food and drink here if you're trying to feed two. But, at least you'll get Instagram cred when you post a photo with their flower wall."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the prettiest/most feminine coffee shops in Vegas! The menu serves unique lattes, light meals (avocado toasts, parfaits, croissants, cheese boards etc), teas, and even some alcoholic beverages. The space itself is huge, with many 4-seater tables, ok for studying but more suited for socializing. Prices are on the higher side, and taste-wise everything was good but nothing mind blowing. If you love the color pink, and want a super cute instagram picture, definitely go here!"}
{"text":"50 Shades Of PINK 

I'm uncertain if Cafe Lola wanted crazy obsessed insta photo junkies but that is definitely what she's getting! This coffee shop is soo damn cute and full of sassy little decor I wish I had in my living room. My favorite unfiltered dame and I stopped by for a quick look and coffee to go. 

The concept is sophisticated chic and lets be honest millennial's don't mind over paying for avocado toast and coffee as long as the selfies are poppin!

I'm certain I'll be back soon for (toast of course) champs & selfies with my favorite girl!"}
{"text":"After my friend telling me this place has been the talk of the town I was excited to try it. I love vegan/GF food and judging by their IG and website it all looked delicious. 

We started our experience there today by being scolded that my friend had her small service animal with her, and then proceeded to get glared at by the owner sitting at a table on her laptop.

The cafe is so cute inside, kind of poorly laid out though, there's nowhere to really line up and order without encroaching on someone else's personal space. 

For my meal I ordered the Secret Garden toast, the passionfruit jasmine black tea, and a vegan donut to-go. It came out to almost $20! $4 for a \"tall\" sized cup of tea and $10 for ONE piece of toast. Completely flavorless toast at that. I would understand these prices if I was somewhere on the strip, but this place is on a random street corner in Summerlin. The prices are absolutely ABSURD. My meal probably cost them $2 to make. I guess we live in a society that only cares about a good instagram photo-op. SO disappointed."}
{"text":"Gorgeous little coffee shop! I had been seeing 
Posts on my newsfeed on Facebook for a while about this place so I couldn't wait for it to open! I was just in Paris and it reminds me of some of the cute cafés they have. All they need to do is play some French music to set the mood and it would be perfection! The menu is extensive. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They even have one of those lasers that grind up coffee beans to make pictures on top of your latte! I got the royal treatment with Megan and Harry! Love this place can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places now! Service is great! Coffee is delicious along with their food. I can't wait to head there more often!"}
{"text":"This is the cutest little coffee and tea cafe! The first thing walking in you notice the decor.. it's lovely, fun and fresh! Then the tea and coffee I got both of course... the London fog and the lavender latte! I was impressed that I came in with my golden knights shirt for game day and they made my tea with a logo on top! Go Knights! I ordered the vegan donut which was delicious.. if I could eat those all day and be skinny I would!!! I also tried their Avocado toast... it was amazing! So fresh and the toppings tasted literally like an everything bagel! The lavender latte was refreshing with ice! I'm so excited for this place and I know it will be a summerlin favorite"}
{"text":"Pretty in pink is in the House!  This cute cafe is just south of Flamingo on Hualapai right next to Buffalo Wild Wings.  As my fellow Yeeps know, I am a coffee snob so when this place popped up I had to swing by.

The shop is adorable! Like seriously so cute and comfortable.  I worry that it didn't seem laptop friendly though.  I was thinking maybe the BGHS kids would meet up after school and do homework while sipping on a latte and munching on some avo toast or a macron. 

But let's get to the coffee/espresso drinks.  The hubs and I both had iced lattes that were really good.  Only complaint I have is that they need to have a simple syrup available to customers to sweeten their own drink.  All amazing coffee spots have a sugar/milk \"bar\" with a liquid sugar (easier to stir) and milk choices.  They do offer milk alternatives but no oat milk just yet. I did mention it to our barista and she looked at me like I was a bit cray cray.  Seriously oat milk is HUGE on the east coast and it's slowly popping up around Vegas.  

Anyway, drinks and snacks we had were great.  I did feel our 2 lattes were rather expensive coming in at over $12 for both.  

If we are in the area we will go back but I won't be going out of my way...."}
{"text":"Yes, this cafe is beautiful but unfortunately that's all they have going for them. Their coffee and pastries are below average. We had come around 3:00 and the place wasn't too busy which was great. We tried ordering two different drinks but apparently they were out? I have never been to a cafe before that runs out of ingredients 3 hours before they close. Instead, we had ordered the hazelnut latte, a blueberry muffin, and a summer peach iced tea. The hazelnut latte had no flavor and it was a little ridiculous for it to be classified as a \"specialty latte.\" I was also shocked that all their coffee was served in togo cups. Most people enjoy drinking their coffee from actual coffee cups especially when dining at a upscale cafe. I personally think that their pastries could really use some work. They were quite bland and they easily fell apart. Overall, their interior design was immaculate but I wish they focused more on their food and coffee."}
{"text":"Can you say INSTAGRAM WORTHY! Once you enter the place, it's so cute and decadent. From the flower walls to the cute trinkets by the station. We came on National Rosé Day. So the frozes were half off. We decided to give it a try and the vegan sprinkle donut and the green tea and rose macarons! They were all AMAZING! 

We ended up staying a little later after they closed, and they were kind enough to let us mingle for a bit till we were ready to go! Definitely a cute spot for gatherings, work space or just getting something to go."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overpriced, overpriced! A cute little design of a  urban coffee shop. The portions were small , but still tasty. The music was way too loud , a little speaker in the corner on the ground to create the ambiance for the shop. Only table left open was next to it. I couldn't even hear my fiancé across from me. 70$ toast, salad, meat cheese board with mini champagne serving . Not sure if I'll return ."}
{"text":"One word : Ladies 

This is a place designed by gals for gals. I made eye contact with a few dudes who were obviously dragged her by their significant other... and we acknowledged without words the awkwardness. 

The irony is it sits directly next to a Bdubs. So my suggestion guys is you grab some wings and let her grab a latte. 

I may be scarred .

Coffee is fine. Food is fine. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this new place a 5 star but the DJ was way too loud for a Sunday brunch. I should be able to give my order early and chat with good background music. I get the idea but taper that down a bit. Other than that great decor and location for this up and coming hot spot for the ladies and a couples coffee chit chat."}
{"text":"I was sooo excited to check this cafe out since there is a big buzz. So, I had my hubby take me for my birthday brunch. It was my hubby, me and our babygirl. I was excited because their Instagram feed looks super inviting their food looks appetizing and there rose wall is too die for! We get there and it's a small place it was a bit crowded luckily by time that we ordered we were able to find a spot to sit (by the rose wall it was a plus). We sat down first came out our drinks I ordered the horchata latte cold and my hubby got it hot. Don't order the horchata it's horrible! By that time people were starting to leave the rush hour was done. I want to say maybe 15 minutes after we got our drinks we got our breakfast sandwiches we ordered and mine this is were it went wrong my sandwich had a white paper stuck to the cheese melted on there! It completely threw me off! And then ten minutes later we got our açaí bowl. Their açaí bowl was good. I wish all our food came out at once instead of waiting what it seemed forever! Any who, for what it is is completely over priced. It's a beautiful scenery super cute and instagram worthy for pics. But that's about it!"}
{"text":"A charming cafe with lighter food options and plenty of drink choices.  Great place for meeting up with friends, a casual first date or getting a quick bite!  Love the decor and this as an option vs the traditional cafe meeting spots."}
{"text":"Loving Lola and all it's offerings! Avocuddle + Secret Garden are my go-to's. Shout out to Chef Steve! The Emerald Latte w/ Coconut Milk is where I get my liquid fix. We need more Lola's in the world."}
{"text":"Cutest cafe ever!!! So girly! So happy this is only 5 min away from my house... such a cute place to hang out... got the cupcake latte, avocado toast and granny's breakfast sandwich and everything was sooo good! Plus most of their sweet treats are vegan and gluten free! 10/10 recommend! I'm obsessed"}
{"text":"Such a cute new cafe in the Summerlin area! Very creative decor - a coffee loving girl's dream! What I ordered:
Gossip girl smoothie, hazelnut latte, ham & cheese croissant, blueberry muffin
Everything was amazing & perfectly made. Of course the decor is also amazing! Highly recommend this new local business! Great job Cafe Lola for bringing tasty food, drinks, and atmosphere to town!"}
{"text":"This is literally the cutest coffee shop ever!!! It's so pink and girly! I love the floral throughout! Not to mention the food and coffee are to die for!! One of the best coffees I've had here in vegas!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile.  Just to note, unless you have it on your GPS, it is easy to pass by as the sign on the street is pretty small and does not stand out much.  It is nicely decorated inside, and especially if you like pink.  I guess we did not feel overly welcomed when we came into the store.  The owners/managers were all on their computers at different tables and barely looked up.  The barista/cashier did greet us, but we just felt that it would be a nice touch for the owners to show a little welcome as they just opened.  The coffee was just ok, and for almost $3 for a cup it seemed a little pricey.  Also, the coffee was not strong enough.  The blueberry muffin, although good, was too pricey... almost $5.  Can't say it is in a great location, not a place I would make an effort to go out of my way, and especially with the high prices."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe! The mocha latte isn't as sweet as you'd think it would be, which is perfect for me. The Emerald latte tastes more of a watered down matcha drink. Make sure you are dressed up if you want to take photos against the cute flower wall! There is even a white seated swing out front which would be cute for photos as well."}
{"text":"Super cute girly place!!! Went on a Sunday and they had a DJ with great music! Lots of desserts and yummy food to pick from. I got an iced while mocha caramel latte, Sammy with bacon and avocado, vegan donut, and lemon tart!!! Was so good! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing photos of the beautiful decor on IG and man this place is ah-mazing! Customer service is great, atmosphere is fantastic. The decor has roses on every table and in the center is a little decoration that says \"Whatever Lola wants...Lola gets. The baristas kindly greet you as soon as you walk in the door with a loud \"welcome to Cafe Lola.\""}
