{"text":"Not my favourite place for a sandwich. I know quite a few people who rave about this place so I must be the one off
The eggplant parm sandwich is very dry.. Just their way of cooking it and with my Italian background there is a place up the street who prepares a much better sandwich. I also find with the size of the sandwich and the way it's packed makes for a messy and soggy meal
They are also a cash only place but have a debit machine for those like me who only carry debit"}
{"text":"The food here is great and I have been enjoying their food since my parents brought me to the downtown location in the 60s.  The sandwiches have not changed since then. My only complaint is that their payment process has also not changed.  They only accept cash. There is an ATM that is owned and operated by the restaurant so the $1.25 service charge is a surcharge that goes directly in their pockets. In this day and age, I am surprised a company will still inconvenience (and ripoff$ their customers to this extent.  On a sidenote, I was pleased to see on my last visit, that the ATM machine was not working and watched at least four customers come in and leave (including myself) without placing an order. Maybe they'll get the message at some point that accepting debit and credit is good for business."}
{"text":"This is a good franchise, service, the bun, especially the sauce.. cool how they serve two different size sandwiches which I have not seen at other locations. Cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Solid consistent tasting sandwiches, been coming here for years...

used to order veal, but i find it a bit tough to bite into, maybe this is coming with age. haha

order chicken instead now and top it with onions, mushrooms, and sweet peppers. mmmm fantastic, fresh ingredients, on a kaiser, the sandwiches are little up there in cost $8+.. but you get practically two sandwiches for the price of one. It's a manwich! 

the difference with california sandwiches is that each sandwich is made to order -- you have a nona dipping the breading and prepping the sandwich. it's real good.

check it out, it's in the plaza North of Collosus movie theatre."}
{"text":"If you're craving Nona's veal or chicken sandwiches, this is the right place to eat. All the sandwiches are freshly made to your order and my favorite is the breaded eggplant with cheese. I always get no tomato sauce on the sandwich but on the side. They also make great lattes and home made cookies. Great for dessert. The service is always on point. The ladies at the register are friendly and always ask me if I want my latte stronger."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly, veal sandwich is awesome and hits the spot. I live up the street so it's super convenient. Not much more I can say, I'd take a good hot sandwich over fast food anyway."}
{"text":"Sandwich was OK, but there are plenty of other Italian sandwich shops in Vaughan.  Fillings were a little skimpy compared to other places and prices are a tad higher than the comparable alternatives.  Really busy and popular place (possibly a little overrated) so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Veal-ly beloved! I have lead the you a stray and for this I apologize. How could I go this long without reviewing my most favorite place in all the GTA. California Sandwiches! (or if you're one of those Jersey shore wanna be types - Cali-sands (how does that sound appetizing guys - come on)).

By show of hands, who hasn't had a Veal/Chicken/Meatball on a bun courtesy of California Sandwiches? You? You...Oh you in the back? Well sorry friends you may as well stop reading because we can't be friends until you go eat one and report back....

....ok so for those of you rejoining us or those who've never left - HOW GOOD WAS THAT? You remember that scene from Harry Met Sally in the diner when Sally goes into full Orgasm to prove a point? Yes yes, the \"I'll have what she's having scene. Well that's how good a Veal (my personal fav) on a bun - simply orgasmic.

So what do I get? Well unlike my siblings who have a mouth on for only the meatball, I am a California Sandwich purist and will nary stray from the magic that is their Veal on a bun.

Starting at $8.25 for veal, kaiser and sauce (and free medium or hot peppers) this is where the fun begins. If this is all the adventure you can handle, I hold no judgement. You are Aces in my book kid. However for those wishing to explore (as I do) the flavour menu here you can help yourself (for a charge) to provolone cheese, cooked onions, rapini, mushrooms and others. 

My personal fav is the Spicy Veal, with provolone, rapini and mushrooms (and extra sauce). I suggest this with a Brio soda OR an Orangina. Might get a little expensive, but its so worth it

This location in Vaughan is ALWAYS Ram-dangled, so make sure for your first time you arrive early. Its clean, the staff is friendly, and service is quick.

Special note: A sign of a good restaurant is when elderly members of that culture (in this case Italian) are the ones doing the cooking in the back - California Sandwich has this going on in spades and that is why you will never have a bad experience here....EVER."}
{"text":"Have had their sandwiches multiple times and they're hot and delicious as always! Whether it's the chicken or veal (with cheese!) it's always a satisfying sandwich without any disappointments. Often busy but the staff get the job done and serve a consistent quality product."}
{"text":"When you have that certain craving for a hot lunch with a little kick, you can't go wrong with visiting California Sandwiches! They never disappoint and if you visit just outside the core lunch hour, you can avoid the lineups.
I grabbed the usually veal and added provolone, onions, and medium spice, damn its good!!
The bun is just the right firmness, although if you take it to go, be prepared for a little sogginess! But eh, Paesan, grab a little extra napkins!! Eh oh!! 

They also have lots of other options and while I've tried a few, I always come back for the veal sangawicha!! Buon appetite!!"}
{"text":"OK so California Sandwiches is truly an iconic place to get a veal sandwich.  I've been here probably about a million times and never really review it.  Well to start I order a sandwich from work over Uber Eats.  No better way for my first experience to be from California Sandwiches.  My order made it to my desk in half hour which I was really impressed.  I order a veal sandwich with medium hot pepper, cheese and mushrooms.  The sandwich was not just any normal sandwich it was a MANWICH.  It was huggeeeee.  Had to release the saw in order to be able to bite the sandwich.  The veal was tender and the toppings were generous. My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit to sweet for me but that's all personal preference.  I also found a chunk of onion in the sandwich as well which im sure was an accident.  None the less these are not overly huge reasons to complain nor are they reasons to cut off the restaurant.  I have been coming here for years and I will intend to continue doing so.  If you are craving a veal look up California Sandwiches and im sure there will be a location near you."}
{"text":"Veal sandwich is great... i usually top it with onions and mushrooms... mmmmmm.... i want one now... :)"}
{"text":"I read that the veal sandwich is a must from here and really, it was just OK. The steak and onion sandwich we ordered was also just OK. The meat in both sandwiches didn't have a lot of flavor and I didn't expect both to be covered in a tomato sauce that was good, just nothing special. Both sandwiches were significantly improved by adding extra onions and jalapeno peppers. I think for the price, I'd much rather eat elsewhere. It was $21.51 for two sandwiches and a soda. I wouldn't refuse to come back, I just probably wont."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the food, especially the vegetarian options. Overpriced for just some white bread and a few vegetables. 
Was even less impressed with the service. The woman wouldn't give us a cup of water, said no to giving us the wifi password, and overall wasn't friendly. Bad vibes. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"What can you say about breaded & fried veal....they make a rocking Sammy. It's the veal with onions & mushrooms. And of course lunch cannot be complete without Orangina!! Love the Italian sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"OMG... There's a lasagna in the middle of my sandwich!! At least that's what it looked like when I lifted up half of my veal, cheese and mushroom sammy. It was all layered together. I was happy I hadn't actually eaten any breakfast that day. I made a valiant attempt at eating that bun of glory.. But fell short of finishing with about 3 mouthfuls left. I just could not fit anymore into my belly.

Cash only. Gargantuan sandwiches. Busy even at 130 in the afternoon (shouldn't these people be at work??). And so worth at least one visit to check them out."}
{"text":"Super busy during lunch but fast turnover. The lady at the cash is so cute and nice!!! I wish the sandwiches were a bit better. The veal sandwich was tasty but needed a kick of something.. A little too plain for me. I will come back and try a different item next time!"}
{"text":"Best location to get it from. They also have the mini sandwiches unlike richmond hill.

No debit or credit though."}
{"text":"Expensive - yes. Will I go back - probably. 
Decent enough vegetarian options but man these sandwiches are HEAVY - could not possibly eat more than one a week (even the vegetarian ones!!).  Every sandwich can be customized, which is nice! Very friendly and funny staff."}
{"text":"Monster size appetite? Then these sandwiches fit the bill. The veal sandwiches here are huge, and very saucy. Three slices of breaded veal on a kaiser type bun. Sloppy and tasty and will definitely fill your belly.

At $8.25 for a basic sandwich with no toppings is a hit to the wallet, especially considering how many veal sandwich shops are in the area. 

As much as I do like these sandwiches, I can drive up the road and get a veal sandwich for $1.75 less and it's a pretty beastly sandwich too. So it's hard to justify the extra expense. 

These are very good and the sauce is great and if your in the area then you can't go wrong. I have yet to be disappointed by the food here. Also be for-warned they make it to order so things take a while, if your tight on time."}
{"text":"The last time I had visited this California Sandwiches location was over a decade ago. I was with a friend. We had shopped so much at the various stores in this plaza that we decided to take a breather and have lunch.

I love veal sandwiches. I have fond memories of eating them as a kid.

Back then, I thought that the veal sandwich here was okay. I decided to give it another try and visited on a Saturday.

It does get busy in the parking lot on weekends. Sure enough, I walked in and there must have been ten people in front of me, waiting to place their orders. Yikes!

Every table was taken. I knew that I needed to take my sandwich to my car to eat it.

I ordered the veal sandwich with mushrooms. It's my standard. I like bell peppers, but this sandwich is so massive that you end up eating your toppings as if they were a salad.

Speaking of salads, while I was approaching the counter, I was admiring the salads that were available. The seafood one looked intriguing, with what appeared to be shrimp and calamari. You can also get spicy olives and pepperoni slices. Cool.

I was order number 57. I stood by the wall closest to the plastic knives and forks, waiting for my order.

Customers are interesting. There was a woman behind me with her daughter. The woman whined, \"It's so slow!\" Her daughter handled the situation much better. At one point, the woman grabbed her side order of spicy olives and went to sit at a table with her grand total of three kids. Interesting.

Staff work hard here. They are busy, but are cheerful and friendly.

I got my order in a bag. I thanked the woman and left.

I went to my car and ate my sandwich. I like how my paper bag with my sandwich also came with a ton of napkins. Believe me, you'll need them.

The bun was crusty and chewy simultaneously, which I love. The veal wasn't as tender as that at the Rutherford location. I definitely needed to chew a bunch of times before swallowing.

You cannot bring food or drink from other locations into this eatery. I remember the sign stating this fact, simply because I had thought about bringing my free venti iced black tea and pineapple drink from Starbucks with me. Luckily, I was eating in my car, so I had plenty left to wash everything down, including the tough veal.

I will stick to going to the Rutherford location. it wasn't as busy and the veal sandwich was better.

{"text":"The California is my all time favorite veal sandwich place. I have great memories of family taking me to pick up sandwiches before heading to the Wheat Sheave  Tavern for lots a draft beer when I first came to Toronto many years ago. The California does a wonderful job of keeping the tradition alive with continuing to make quality sandwiches."}
{"text":"The best veal sandwich, ever!  A ginormous, warm, delicious, veal sandwich.  I can't stop thinking about you.  I missed biting into that nice warm kaiser bun, full-flavoured provolone, tasty tomato sauce, and that deliciously crispy fried veal.  Cruncha cruncha muncha!  And what hurts the most is, I'm over 3,000 km away from you... :(

{"text":"On a hot summer day, I was looking for something refreshing and stumbled into California Sandiwches.  I wanted to see what options they had, other than their famous giant veal sandwiches (I heard they also had salads)...and I AM SO GLAD I DID! 

They have one of the most freshest and generous portions of a Seafood Salad that I've ever had! It was fairly priced at $7.50 or so... and tasted amazing. I 100% would recommend trying this seafood salad.  You will not be disappointed! 

It was the perfect lunch for a hot Summer Day - light, fresh, perfect portion size, and a really simple no-fuss, no-mess salad.  

Just a side note: I've had their veal sandwiches before - and a Full Size one is just massive! If it's your first go, I'd recommend getting the Half sandwich."}
{"text":"When I first arrived in Vaughan my husband said the one place we had to go to was here. Usually when someone builds something up so high you're bound to be disappointed but not this time! The sandwiches are massive, I could only manage half and then had the other half for dinner! I ordered the veal sandwich with provolone and hot peppers, it was fresh, the bread was Crusty, drenched in sauce and tasted amazing. They are generous with every component of the sandwich so I definitely felt as if I got my money's worth. We also ordered the rice balls as a side, those weren't nearly as good as the sandwich. We were expecting arancini type thing but it's literally just rice in a ball but I guess that's on us as the description didn't lie."}
{"text":"I visit here quite often as it is very close to my house. California sandwiches is yummy. Their veal is tasty and breaded well. Their chicken is also breaded well, but a little to thick for my liking. The steak sandwich with fried onions is my favorite. 
The staff there are always super friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the menu. The restaurant is always clean. 
It is a little on the pricy side but the sandwiches are large. I can usually only eat half. 
All in all I enjoy the food and the restaurant. Will always come back for more."}
{"text":"The only complaint I or anyone I've gone with to California Sandwiches have is that other people know about it. I have NEVER gone in when there has not been a line....people in the know flock to this place. Seating can be problematic...but I'd stand on one foot, hop and sing the national anthem to have one of their sandwiches.

I usually get the chicken or steak......both are mouth watering and dripping in sauce. If you don't like mushy buns, or don't like getting messy hands while eating...this is not the place for you. Indulge!

As you approach the counter you order the type of sandwich you want...then order your toppings. I traditionally get cheese and hot peppers. A friends father makes hot peppers from his garden...and they are HOT...so are the ones used here....but add so much flavour and heat to the meal that not to have them is a shame.

I've also had the meatball sandwich....which repeated on me all afternoon. I felt sorry for the person I was with because I was burping up garlic.....but it was so worth it even if it cost me a friend....the sandwiches are that good. LOL

Friends come here for the veal...something I don't eat (my Italian friends cannot fathom this fact) but every sandwich I've had has not disappointed. If you've tried Centro...the sandwiches are close...it's the sauce that makes the difference.....and I'll do the drive to get their brand.

As an added bonus, they now serve \"mini\" versions of their sandwiches...but let's be real. Get the regular.

How good is this place? When my brother visits from Windsor..he has to bring a sandwich home for my niece. I brought her here when she came for a visit and she is hooked. And she is the pickiest eater on the planet!

Staff are uber friendly and enjoy working there. Nonna is working in the back......"}
{"text":"this location is ok, been here a couple of times and they've messed up my order each and everytime, also I find that the flavors of the different options on the sandwiches are different then my home location(Queensway). this location also offers quite a few more options then my home location as well, items such as cacciatore, a jalapeno spread, and jarred sauce. 
I only come to this location if I'm having a craving and can't get down to my home location. 
staff makes this location better then the food sad to say, outstanding service, a clean restaurant, and lots of parking available make this place great, but the inconsistency brings the star level down, sadly."}
