{"text":"Alright BBQ place.

I came here on a Friday around 6pm. We were seated immediately. A cozy place with not too many tables but has a patio.

We ordered a few dishes to share between the two of us:

Cobb Salad: Nothing special. They served it in a mason jar. You add the dressing to the jar and can shake it to mix it up. A fun way to do the salad but two issues 1) the outside of the jar was dirty making it very slippery to shake 2) it was very hard to pour out the salad from the small opening.

Duck Wings: Crispy and dry. Not a good combo. Duck wings are already quite dry and these are no different. Not flavourful and not very good.

Beef Side Ribs: Came with a side and a biscuit. The ribs were smoky, flavourful and sticky sweet! However, we had to ration the amount of meat on this. I feel like they could've left more meat on these. The waitress later told us that the ribs are actually smoked at another BBQ place down the street (I can only assume Greenwood) and were cooked here... Why would a BBQ restaurant outsource like that? Why would I then come here if i could just go to the original restaurant? However, the ribs were the most flavourful item we had that night. 

Smoked Sausages: Nothing special. Regular smoked sausages.

We paid just under $80 after taxes and tips (the boyfriend had a beer and i had a coke). 

Fullness level: 7/10. We probably could've taken our money and had a feast elsewhere with better food.
Price vs. Satisfaction: 5.5/10.  I was full, BF was not.
Atmosphere: 8/10. Cute place, has a nice patio
Food Quality: 6/10. Food was very average, still can't believe they outsource smoking their meats...
Service: 9/10. The staff were quite nice and attentive.

Overall, I don't think we would come here again. I'm a bit offended that they don't actually smoke their own BBQ."}
{"text":"So happy to go to a BBQ place with delicious vegetarian options! Officially I am a meat eater but I sometimes have issues digesting meat so I appreciate seeing diverse menu options. The tempeh ribs were pretty good - could have used a bit more sauce as it's quite dry tasting - but the smashed potatoes and biscuit on the side were great. As an added touch, it would be nice if the biscuit was grilled or heated up. The hot sauce they serve is DELICIOUS, I would eat it for breakfast. The fried grits are super cheesy and go well with the hot sauce. 

It's a small space, but cute, and they have a little patio too."}
{"text":"So most of my extended family lived within a two block radius in this Riverdale neighbourhood along with most of the kids I went to high school with a loooong time ago.   My grandparents lived on one corner, cousins down the block, other aunties and uncles just up the street.  All the old immigrants are now basically gone and replaced with a new gen young families and the process of gentrification.

There are always pros and cons that go along with it, but one of the pros is good food coming in, and the best of the old food hanging on.

Gerrard between Jones and Pape almost overnight has become a food destination.

Right in the middle of it all is this new BBQ place.  It's a small place with a small patio that has classy dive vibes.

Got their bbq'd pork belly along with some smashed potatoes.  All of which was quite yum-o.  They've got a small but very diverse set in their menu. 

Already thinking of my next bite here."}
{"text":"Meh. Ok but not great. Small portions at best. Service was excellent though. 
Had: riblettes, Cobb salad (was missing the A's-advertised bacon), fried chick (tasty but small), corn (overpriced single ear)"}
{"text":"I love the food at this place. I had the deep fried cauliflower with mac and cheese and the small ribs. The two items were delicious.  My partner had bbq pork and coleslaw and he said it was great as well. A welcomed change to the neighborhood.  We'll be going back for sure.  Our server was very friendly and polite. Blackjack you have a great thing going on. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This place is definitely \"hot and new\". Before I get into the food, let's talk vibe. Very \"up\" feel to the place. No raucous disco music, but blues and swamp-ass southern rock - just what I would expect. The glasses are mason jars with handles and the dishes are served in metal plates - southern style. The wait staff is well informed and friendly without encroaching on your space - I need that. 

Now, let's chow down on the food. 

You gotta have the cauliflower Mac n' Cheese. It is sick off the charts good. The buffalo sauce of the cauliflower offsets the creaminess of the mac n' cheese in such a balanced way. We also shared the sausage appy and it too was done just right. We decided to share the beef ribs as it seemed like a lot of food and the only disappointment I would say, is that we found them to be not warm enough. The meat was super well cooked but delivered at a lukewarm temperature. I would also have added another rib at that price. 

Had it not been for the beef ribs, I would have given 5 stars. Oh definitely have the mud bar for desert - insanely yummy."}
{"text":"This place is a treasure. The food was to die for! I could not recommend this cute little BBQ spot enough.

I came with a group of four, so we split a couple of apps between us. We enjoyed the collard green dip and the jalapeño poppers. Both were really good. The collard green dip was a touch salty, and the jalapeño poppers could have had more jalapeño, but despite this, it was good enough that we ate every last bit and enjoyed it wholeheartedly! 

The mains were definitely the standout items. Each main comes with a side, which is great because their sides all sound delicious. I opted for the short rib sandwich with slaw, and smashed potatoes. My partner got the fried turkey with smashed potatoes. Both were awesome, and I actually couldn't believe how good it all tasted. It was one of those meals where you just stop and have to take a moment to really appreciate what you're eating. My partner got cornbread for free as well - not going to lie, it wasn't the best cornbread I've had, and I think it should be served warm. But it was an appreciated little extra, as were the pickles.

For dessert - not pictured - I got the peach crisp. It tasted like warm, comforting oatmeal! It wasn't overly sweet, but it was really nice and it gave me some major Autumn breakfast feels.

The service was average, not much to comment on. 

I'd give this new spot a 4/5. There is room for improvement here and there, but overall, I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and I think it's on its way to becoming a neighbourhood staple."}
{"text":"tasty bbq, hot hot sauce, great house beer, terrific service an nice addition to leslieville :-)"}
{"text":"A friend and I went there on a Saturday night within the first month of opening. I must say, I had a great experience. The food was great, but I do  hope they think about adding fries to the menu at some point lol. Our server was great. The atmosphere was lovely. I would recommend this venue for the food and great staff! #yougottago"}
{"text":"Place I must definitely see. Would take my dear friend Michael Dorn & Monica & Charles very soon!!!"}
{"text":"My wife gave this place a shot after a long day and empty stomachs. I ordered the grilled chicken and she ordered the Blackened catfish both with brussel sprouts slaw. Where to begin? 
The slaw had too much celery seed to the point of being unpalatable. The biscuit was inedible. The grilled chicken was fried and then placed in the grill for grill marks. The blackened catfish was breaded and then deepfried. I'm not from the Southern United States but I can say with absolute certainty that is not what blackened means. I really wanted to like this place the East End gets a new wave or restaurants bringing unique cuisines closer to home. However, Blackjack BBQ needs to be honest about what they're selling because it isn't Southern BBQ. it isn't even Canadian."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened for about a week now. They do have patio seating but it is limited. The service was very friendly. Our waiter, Aaron explained the menu and gave excellent recommendations. Even the bartender took the time to chat.  We ordered a beer and Shut The Huck Up drink which was very tasty and light. The entrees come with one Fixin'. We had the Texas smoked short rib sandwich with charred corn and the beef back ribs with smashed potatoes.  I normally don't eat potatoes but I ate them all. Both meals were delicious and we will come back to try the other items on the menu.  This is a nice addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Was excited to see a BBQ place in the neighborhood - but left feeling underwhelmed. Seemingly not a lot of traditional BBQ options on the menu i.e) no brisket, no pulled pork. The menu choices were interesting, but not inspiring. The food was average and made us long for a more mouth-watering experience."}
{"text":"I really disliked my meal: Louisiana Catfish ($17 and came with a buttermilk biscuit, smoked butter, pickle spear and I picked charred corn)

The fish was mushy, the biscuit was cold and stale, and now that I think of it, where was the smoked butter?? Also, don't list pickle spear as something I'm getting - that's a garnish. The charred corn was so small.

I only gave it 2 stars because it was warm out and so it was nice to sit on their patio."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... neighbourhood spot in a fun atmosphere with good service.  I just think the food is more towards a 3 star.  It's possible we ordered the wrong dishes that would have made this a 4 star experience instead.  Looking at everyone else's review, the Mac & Cheese or Short Rib main might be the better options.

Blackjack is a new addition to Leslieville and from my understanding, they completely redid the interior.  With a great patio and a great fun Southern and Rock influenced decor, it really gives a fun vibe.  Visually, there's a lot of great things to keep you interested on the walls.  The thick rope lighting fixtures are unique and it's really creative.  

Service here is really friendly and warm.  There was never a pushiness and it's just relaxed in a good way.  I came for a pre-dinner snack and saw the good reviews coming for this place.  With the nice service and inviting patio, I can see why people take to this place quickly.  

For me, I think the 2 dishes we ordered may have been wrong choices or weaker ones on the menu but our server did mention the smoked riblets was ordered for every table she served that day.  It was one of their more popular items.  That and their mac & cheese.

Smoked Riblets - With 5 glazed and gleaming pieces arriving to our table, I could smell the very sweet BBQ sauce before I even dug my teeth into them.  The server mention the order is set by weight rather than set pieces.  Normally she says 6 or 7.  So we got some big boned ones and some nice and juicy pieces.  I'm not sure how they were reheated but these were more on the lukewarm side instead of warm.  If this was intended, I like the ribs more on the hot side.  As for the ribs, some were tender but most of the ones I ate were definitely tougher meat pieces that had some large dense cartilage pieces.  I couldnt try to eat those pieces even if I wanted to.  I didnt taste any smokeiness but the rib pieces were heavily doused in sauce that it probably covered it.  I found the sauce to be on the sweet side and would have loved a bit more spices or tang to it instead. 3/5

Countdown Duck Wings - I love duck and the idea of duck wings really interested me.  I think the idea of this is a bit better than the reality of it.  When it first arrived at the table, I thought they were ribs.  Picking them up, they were more on the lukewarm side and had a bit of a crispy edge to them.  I dont think this is an issue with Blackjack but more on the duck, these were definitely not meaty and more like chicken wing tips.  I think the 4 wings had less meat than 1 of the riblets.  The order gave us 4 slim wings which is a little more than $2 each.  I figure it was unique to try.  Biting into them was like biting into very dry meat... it almost had a jerky like texture to them.  I'm not sure if this was meant to be the case.  Flavour wise, they are more richer and gamier in flavour compared to chicken.  I tried it and now I know duck wings aren't for me.  2/5

Their menu does have a lot of interesting things on it.  If I did have the opportunity to come back, I wouldnt get what we had this time but maybe the other BBQ dishes instead.  Service here though is great and a nice spot to relax in the neighbourhood."}
