{"text":"Really good Greek food. Get the lamb for sure it was absolutely amazing. Pita was fresh and delicious. Feels very authentic. Cute little space as well."}
{"text":"I have been to Fat Lamb Kouzina twice now and both times had my mind blown by their creations! I have been to MANY Greek restaurants and Fat Lamb Kouzina's Bifteki Gyro is by far the best tasting Gyro i have EVER had the pleasure of eating. They make all their own Pita, Tzatziki and Filo dough for their amazing tiropita and hortopita FROM SCRATCH!! The tea they use is fresh from the mountains of Greece, and you can taste it. The Leg of Lamb is, simply put, phenominal! Mouthwatering succulent and ever soo tender. EVERYONE needs to try it. Then there is the home cooked dishes they create, which make me feel like my Yai-Yai just cooked for me. You will NEVER get these dishes in any other Greek restaraunt anywhere, making Fat Lamb Kouzina the most unique and traditional Greek restaurant in Canada. The staff is an absolute pleasure to talk with. Super friendly and completely informative and open about every thing they cook. 5 out of 5 in every aspect for Fat Lamb Kouzina!! I am a regular for life, thank you Fat Lamb Kouzina!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh homemade Greek food. We had roast pork gyros with tzatziki and pita all made in house, potatoes and salad. All first rate. The owner seems passionate about the quality and authenticity of the ingredients. Service was friendly and the place is bright and clean. A great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"By far the best food I've had in Toronto.
The roast lamb Gyro was filled with lots of delicious meat and yoghurt. Way too much for one person, but just had to eat it all."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in the area!  I've been here three days in a row now and have tried the Pork Gyro, Bifteki Gyro and the leg of lamb....all three are beyond amazing.  The Pork Gyro is in my opinion the best Gyro in the city, hands down.  The fluffy, moist, homemade Pita and perfectly seasoned and cooked pork is topped with an incredible homemade tzatziki that just takes it to another level. This place is the real deal for authentic homemade Greek food.

To top it all off, the owners are amazing- super welcoming and very genuine.  They seem to know everyone on a first name basis and are really interested in customer feedback.  Can't wait to go back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Quiet little restaurant/take away place, family owned and they make home made food. Had lamb and potatoes, chicken and potatoes. Both were really good! Potatoes were very nicely done. The seating is very interesting as well. A large dinning table that everyone can sit around. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype and beyond! Delicious homemade-style authentic modern Greek cuisine by young owners/chefs who are clearly passionate about the freshness and flavour of their food. If you're looking for quick and delightful, simple food made with love, this is the place. Oh, and the Toronto Star was right that they make the most \"Really, Really Awesome\" pita bread ever. Try it with some gyro or their daily special, and a Greek coffee for dessert. It's all really, really awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent, lamb and potatoes, pita and sheep's milk cheese pastry.
Simple, homemade, so so good! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a lamb gyro, and although it didn't come with fries or salad, that gyro filled me up so much that I didn't even need sides! Their homemade pita is so thick, a little oily, but deliciously filling; more like a thick roti than the cheap store-bought pita bread that you get at other places. These are authentic, handmade meals that are deceptively small, but certainly well-executed with love."}
{"text":"If FAT Lamb Kouzina had existed during our year in Toronto, we might not have moved back home to NY. We sat at the counter, ate the best lamb gyros imaginable, and chatted with the owner, who somehow managed to be composed, friendly and charming amidst the Friday lunch rush. The queue was out the door, for good reason. We will definitely return on our next visit. Hard to believe some folks rate the pork gyros even more highly than the lamb. We look forward to a taste comparison!"}
{"text":"I tried their herb roast lamb leg and it was pretty good. Cooked to perfection with a nice yogurt topping."}
{"text":"Excellent and beyond excellent.  Super friendly, it's like stopping in for lunch at Yiayia's place."}
{"text":"I decided to try them out recently.  It's a small cute place. I ordered the lamp and potatoes. It was good but nothing different. Pricey for the portion and no chicken options."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is so popular.  I tried their herb roast leg of lamb and was not impressed.  The lamb meat, although tender, was salty and heavy.  After a few bites, I was done, but forced myself to finish the meal.  The lemon potatoes offered a different tone, but overall, I was overwhelmed with the flavours that duelled for my attention.  Gyros for $12 and roasted leg of lamb for $15 just doesn't fall into the range of reasonability for take-out Greek food.  

Not much of a sit-down area: communal tables and a bar-like area facing the window/street.  Worth the try once to see what the hype was all about, but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I grew up in a daycare run by a Greek lady who would frequently cook the most amazing meals for all the kids. Since then I have never tasted a Greek meal that had the succinctly homemade taste to it. 

That is, until I tried Fat Lamb Kouzina. My god. I had the beef special- which was similar to risotto in a lot of ways- and that blew my mind. The meat was melt in your mouth good and it was a perfect portion size for a hungry lunchtime. I also had the cheese pie at the counter, I'd strongly recommend. The owner makes the filo fresh every day and that comes through in the textures and flavour of the dish. Amazing. 

Anyhow, my big gripe is I don't work close to here, and currently they are only open 11-5. I spoke to the owner and she says they are already looking to expand those hours later for the dinner crowd. Amazing. I can't wait to pick up meals on my way home from work!  Worst case, they are open on Saturdays so hit this place up on a weekend."}
{"text":"Extraordinary.  I'm from Montreal and pretty much can't eat Greek food in Toronto overall.  I've had some that is half decent compared to Mtl Greek but haven't had a \"good\" meal out here.  Well last night I had a GREAT Greek meal out here!

From great people who obviously love what they do.  Simple, fresh, homemade (tziziki and pita) and their lamb was noooooo f'n joke at ALL.  Some of the best lamb I've ever eaten anywhere and easily some of the best Greek food, and I'm tempted to say the best, that I've had in my life.  Top notch. 

I feel bad giving the review because I don't want them to change what they do at all and expansion sometimes does that.  But food this good deserves to be shared so I can't be a selfish a-hole about it.  Thus, the 5 star review.

If you care about the care put into your food, then put this food into your mouth.

If quality is important to you, then show yours - go to Fat Lamb Kouzina.

If you're a foodie, (you can even ask Judy) eating here is your duty.

Now.... do you see?

Great staff, food, and atmosphere.  Small, cozy, and super real.  Super, natural, maybe supernatural.

I got so sidetracked by the food I forgot to mention how engaging the staff are.  Really good guys who really love what they do.  This is a passion for them and it shows."}
{"text":"A good place to go when you want to treat yourself. Prices are a bit steep for lunch, but the quality is there in the lamb. Service is also a bit slow and there's almost always a line so it's not a good place to go to if you're in a rush. Everything I've had here so far tastes good and according to other Greek people I know, it is authentic too."}
{"text":"Yelpers, I followed you to this place close to my office for a lunch bite, and alas, I was not satisfied. The price point is high for the portion and the flavours didn't stand out as I was promised. Perhaps because I didn't get lamb? There was a decent lineup at lunchtime that kept me thinking there's much to be had, and the rave reviews were more promising. Unfortunately, things fell flat.

I can't even remember what I ordered exactly, a wrap that wasn't lamb but still appeared to be a great alternative. It served up after a short wait but aside from being your generic gyro wrap sort of thing, it wasn't much else. I finished it easily so it wasn't a large portion, and the price I paid didn't really justify. The interior is cutely decorated and not a bad place to sit and dine, but lunchtime does not really allow for that, which was disappointing.

Overall, not much to write home about with \"Yorkville pricing\"...which I have no belief in when it comes to average food."}
{"text":"I came in randomly with a friend and ordered a pork gyro with a strangely delicious pine soda water.  The sandwich was the stuff of dreams.  Homemade pita unlike anything I have ever had before.  Succulent, crispy slices of pork.  Fresh veggies.  And creamy tzatziki.  If you don't like this sandwich, you are dead inside."}
{"text":"First off, the flavours... Divine!  The food was tasty, well-seasoned, and just plain delicious.  They've truly put in a lot of effort into perfecting their dishes.  

Service was lovely. Welcoming and grateful.  You could tell the customers are top priority.  

So why not five stars?  

The portion sizes seemed kind of small for the price you pay.  I had a lamb special served in a small-ish box for $15.  There was tender and flavourful lamb, a few potato wedges, and a dollop of tzatziki.  If the prices were brought down by about 10-15%, it would seem more reasonable for the amount of food currently being served. Otherwise, add more potatoes.  Put in a little salad.  Give a bit more to bulk up the serving.  Perhaps if the food was served in a different container, the presentation of quantity might be perceived differently as well.  I'm just offering some constructive feedback, that's all.  

I would like to emphasize the owners seem like lovely people who are cooking with heart and soul. 
I'm all for homemade, homestyle, authentic cooking!"}
{"text":"I'M STILL SALIVATING JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW FANTASTIC THIS MEAL WAS.
Having opened just about 8 weeks ago, this cute little home-run restaurant is located conveniently along Yonge street within the Yorkville neighbourhood.

I came with a few friends and inquired about which menu item was the best seller. I was informed it was the Pork Gyro so I ordered one and MY OH MY, DID IT NOT DISAPPOINT. When it arrived, it was picture perfect and accordingly so, it tasted absolutely delicious. In fact, this was by far THE most delicious gyro I've ever had - succulent, flavourful pulled pork atop an amazingly crisp yet fluffy pita, paired with fresh tomatoes, onions, dill, and sour cream. YUM! The total was $12, which is more expensive than what regular restaurants would charge but it was 100% well-spent. They were fairly generous with the pork and it was overall a filling portion. 

I would highly recommend you pay this place a visit if you want a taste of REAL, GOOD, AUTHENTIC Greek/Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Their pork gyro is fantastic. It's the best. Perfectly cooked and flavourful. The home made pitas are also amazing. However a bit pricey for just meat and pita (with a couple of tomato slices). Or maybe the portions are too small. Anyway I would expect to be full after $12."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about how delicious this was....

Goat cheese pie was great. None of the ingredients overpowered each other. A little drizzle of honey and it was one of the tastiest slice of pie I had. It was so good that we devoured it before taking pictures!

Lamb with potatoes was tender, moist and not gamey at all. It came with well seasoned large potato wedges. We ordered a side of pita for $2 and you can tell that it's not store bought but homemade. 

This place got busy during lunch. The line moved fairly well. Limited seats available. The cashier was super friendly. Food is more on the pricey side but it's filling, great quality and delicious!!"}
{"text":"This fine establishment is proof that yelp works, well for me anyways. If it had not been for my fellow yelp community, shout out to dilys ,I'm embarrassed to say I never would have tried this place, or probably even hear about it. How fortunate I was to be a yelper after eating here. 

My first impression of the restaurant was a little negative,if I'm being honest. I'm so used to getting rice served with everything that at first when I was told the lamb and potatoes isn't served on a bed of rice, I was pretty disappointed. That disappointed dissipated with the first bite of that tender lamb. It was literally cooked to perfection. I have never tasted meat, lamb meat none the less, that was so moist and full of flavour, that didn't cost 100$. Lamb has a tendency of being dry and has that gamey taste; NOT HERE. I'm still in shock at how amazing this meal was. Potatoes are pleasantly flavoured and paired with a hearty amount of homemade tzatziki sauce. For only 2$ more I got a house made pita bread, which yes you guessed it, was also incredible. 

I'm seriously looking forward to coming back here again, maybe try the moussaka. What I can tell you is this; The lamb and potatoes won't disappoint you"}
{"text":"Delicious! The pork gyro is very flavourful, and the homemade pita bread is amazing. A slight splurge at 12 bucks but the quality is definitely there. Love that it's family run, will be back!"}
{"text":"A great Greek restaurant with amazing Gyro. Meat melts in your mouth, warm Pita, and amazing sauces."}
{"text":"Really superb place.  Feels like a \"hole in the wall\" kind of place, but clean and good service.  Take out with one large table to sit and enjoy.  Pricing a little steep for the portion size, but very rich food and therefore you don't need more than what you get."}
{"text":"Premium meat, premium taste, premium price. My new go to! The Lamb leg dish has a ton of meat which justifies the price.

Note the prices they list on the board include taxes."}
{"text":"They lost me at hello. This is the Greek version of the Sienfeld soup kitchen. Who needs the abuse and let down. It was dismissive and disrespectful, full of themselves, the lackluster choice of food was way overpriced (essentially a potato and small chunk of meat will cost you $14), shockingly under proportioned (Barbie on a diet portions) and all served in crappy take away containers that leaked everywhere. I felt utterly ripped off. Stay clear of this place its a DUD."}
{"text":"This is a place to get excited about. I love food, and can usually find some capacity to enjoy it in regardless of what's being served. It's not often though that I eat something and get physically excited about it. The lamb pita at FAT Lamb Kouzina is one of my favourite things to eat - not just in Toronto - but ever. It's essentially perfect. The lamb is succulent, and verges into mutton territory in terms of flavour. The fact that I write that as a positive thing is a testament to how good this is. I hate mutton. I've never understood what people like about it. Having had this (which, to be clear, isn't mutton), I totally get it. This pita is a tribute to the distinct flavour of lamb, with every element of the sandwich emphasizing a different quality of the meat. Don't get me wrong, each ingredient is an occasion onto itself. The pita bread is hands down the best I've had in my life, and I'm Mediterranean. The tzatziki has the perfect amount of garlic and richness. Tomatoes and onions are super fresh. What I'm saying though is that when these things are combined, you get something really special. I can't emphasize enough how much I enjoyed this. I ate the whole thing in less than 10 minutes. I know I should have taken more time to appreciate it, but when something is that amazing, you appreciate it most when you get to reflect on the experience of having eaten it.  

The owners (husband and wife?) are lovely, and happy to answer questions or give suggestions. I had to walk back just to share my enthusiasm with them."}
{"text":"It's definitely pricy at 15$ for a smaller portion than I'm used to - I got the lamb pita, but it's wonderfully cooked and my favourite part is that you can straight up tell that all of the ingredients are fresh and high quality. I personally did not like the taste of the lamb which is why it's four stars, but I'm also desperate to go back and try something that's not lamb. Will update when it happens!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food worth every penny.

Where do I start, the lamb and pork is soo tender, perfectly seasoned, juicy, amazingly flavourful fat without feeling oily or heavy grease in your mouth. High quality olive oil, nice subtle balsamic dressing on the salad, amazing boureg crisped on the outside but soaked feta cheese with zuchini that melts in your mouth. Potatoes are creamy, skins are browned wonderfully. All ingredients are fresh especially the house made pita bread, like nothing you've tried. I'll be coming back soon. the owner even came and asked about our meal. homey atmosphere, traditional greek music playing. come early because they run out of spanakopita. Go NOW."}
{"text":"The staff, maybe owner was very friendly (just back from holiday, probably helps!).
The quality of food, very good. Clean interior.
Plate size (lamb dinner) small for the price, 15 bucks.  Will try wrap next time, bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Fat Lamb Kouzina, saw you featured on BlogTO, alongside photos of the delicious homemade food you offer.  I rallied the troops at my office, ran over to grab lunch, devoured the pita and haven't stopped thinking about it since! Tried the pork pita, which was stuffed generously with meat, tomatoes, onions and parsley. This won't be the last time, please continue to bring us these amazing flavors! Best Greek I've had in a longgg time and the business is run by the most pleasant people!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! So cozy with very friendly, helpful, and attentive staff! The slow cooked lamb was great! It easily melts in the mouth. The beef gyro also tastes perfect, well-seasoned and well-cooked. I'll return for sure."}
{"text":"I am blown away by how delicious the lamb is. The friendly staff at the counter explained that the lamb is marinaded for 24 hours before being  slow cooked for another 12-15 hours. After it is cooked, the meat is pulled from the bone. The lamb tasted super fresh, was perfectly seasoned and had amazing texture. The pita bread tasted as if was made in-house and baked to order (nothing like generic store bought pita pockets). The lamb pita comes comes with tomatoes, onions, parsley and a generous serving of tzaziki sauce. It doesn't look big, but is in fact quite filling. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Fat Lamb Kouzina is an awesome neighborhood spot in Yorkville to grab a quick bite!

They are only open for lunch at the moment and close down around 5pm. I got pulled pork wrapped in pita bread and it was so good!
The portion was pretty big and there's a generous amount of pork wrapped up in the fluffy homemade pita bread. It's definitely comfort food with oil dripping through the wrap. But that's what made it so delicious! The owner was telling us about how they travelled through Greece to cook with the grandmas. Because who knows better how to cook than the grandmas? :)

Can't wait to try their lamb next time! It was sold out on the day I went. :( Go early if you can!"}
{"text":"If you are around Yonge & Bloor area, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RESTAURANT! PERIOD!

What beats home cooked food? None! You are going to have authentic home cooked Greek food here!

If it is your first time here, order first item on the menu: Herb Roasted Leg of Lamb, Lemon Oregano Roast Potato, and Signature Tzatziki ($15). You will not be disappointed.  This dish was so aromatic, you can smell it from meters away.... Portion is huge, good size of lamb meat and 4-5 big potato wedges. Meat is tender, juicy, flavourful, heavenly...and not too salty (bonus point). Potato wedges are super starchy inside and crispy outside.

They open for lunch. A lot of people working around this area coming here for takeout. But they also have a big communal table (love this!!!) can fit 10ish people.

I placed my order and waited for 10 mins. If you choose to dine in, they will bring the food for you. 

I will for sure come back for their gyro. I saw others order and they look yummy!

Also price on the menu is after tax!"}
{"text":"When you go to a place named Fat Lamb Kouzina, it's only appropriate to order lamb, right? I love lamb and I love gyros but I didn't see it on the menu. No problem, my server said I could get that but they only serve gyros on a pita. Hmmm, I didn't want a sandwich. No problem, I could get lamb gyros with potatoes, and a salad. Yay!

I paid for my food and sat at one of three window seats looking out onto Yonge Street. They only have one table, a rather large one, with shared seating. The smell of the food was making me hungrier.

A young lady brought my order to me. Hmmm, two (takeout) boxes? Okay, everything is served in takeout boxes but I'm still a bit puzzled. One box had lamb with potatoes and tzatziki and the other box had lamb with salad and tzatziki. Did I order two dishes? Is that why it cost $19?

The salad was very good, well dressed and tasty. I was, however, a bit disappointed with the lamb and tzatziki. I found them both to be lacking flavour. The lamb needed more seasoning and the tzatziki needed more garlic.

Darn, I really wanted to like this place with its cool name."}
{"text":"Saw a post on BlogTO, best choice and must visit. Very flavourful and delicious. Had one lamb and one beef both mouth watering and not dry at all and not greasy at all probably because I know what I ordered. And as for the price, people need to understand this is Yonge and Bloor, it's the correct pricing for today's economy.  Especially for well made food like this I am surprised they didn't charge 20$+."}
{"text":"Just opened last week.  Already had 2 meals here. Leg of Lamb on first visit and herb roasted pork on the second. Both had excellent flavour and were very good value. Had that good home cooked meal feel in my stomach 

Good Greek Grub you should give it a try"}
{"text":"Delicious, homemade food made by individuals who obviously care very much about the quality of food delivered! 
I definitely recommend taking the trip here to indulge in authentic greek and mediterranean cuisine. 
5/5 - would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Really great lamb but way too expensive for the small portion size. They weren't even generous on the lettuce for the salad. Even in the area, I was shocked at the prices - but do have to say the quality of good."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet: my first visit to FAT Lamb Kouzina this afternoon was phenomenal. In fact, it exceeded my expectations even--which were high, mind you. Had their Bifteki Gyro and 'Tiropita' Pie. Both were perfection. Suffice to say, I'll be back a couple times a week and won't rest until I try the whole menu. Incidentally, the owners were extremely warm and welcoming. Great addition to the Yorkville neighbourhood.

UPDATE [6/9/2017]: No surprise here, but my next two visits came only days after my first. And yes, each was better than the last. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Probably the one of the only places in Toronto to get some good lamb, succulent and juicy, you can taste the garlic and herbs. Haven't tried anything else but I will be back for the pork that's for sure :D"}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb with potatoes for about $16.00.  The lamb was very tender, but I found it to be a bit too salty.  Overall, the food was good, but a bit expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm the one out of million person who thinks this place is just ok. But it must be me who is not the most into tzatiki sauce! There's a lot of tzatiki sauce that I couldn't really handle to the point where I feel like all I taste is tzatiki sauce, and didn't get a chance to enjoy legendary lamb!"}
{"text":"Tip:  If possible, try to come earlier on in the day as they run out of items.

I came an hour before closing and there were only gyros (lamb or beef) and salad left.  And there was a line-up!  Pitas, as per review and website, were definitely homemade, so that definitely sets Fat Lamb apart from other pita competitors.

I must mention that this place is not a cheapie place.  They had run out of pork gyro, so offered lamb ($15) at the entree price, but replaced the orzo with pita.  Lamb was very tender and filling.  Pork/beef gyros are $12.  Granted, lamb is a more expensive meat and there was a good amount of it.  So just brace yourself if you think it's going to be quick-pita pit type pricing.

Village Salad was $12, looked gorgeous with all the colours, rip tomatoes were bright red, but it came in smallish-square takeout box.

There is a bit of a wait for the food which is home cooking, but expect sitdown prices.  There is bar seating at the window (3 seats) + at the order counter (3 seats) + a large table in the centre, which half of it is unusable because patrons would be lining up on the other side."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 
FAT Lamb offers two main entree bases - Pita or Potatoes served with your choice of Lamb, Chicken, or Pork. The prices are a little steeper than usual ($15 tax in for a Lamb Pita Wrap, $12 for Pork). The pitas are made in house and appeared freshly made. Drinks are imported directly from Greece and are a nice touch to get an authentic feeling. 

The food was tasty - the meat was a decent sized portion, the tzatziki sauce is great, but the price for something that usually is eaten to go should be a dollar or two cheaper."}
{"text":"It's a bit on the pricey side for a meal, but it's filling and high quality.

Everything I had was fresh and made on site which I really appreciated.

Menu is minimal but you should be able to ind something to eat.

I had one of their gyros an a side salad. I was full after.

It took a while for them to put together and they only accepted cash or credit which a bit of a downer. If you are willing to wait and don't need to pay by debit, then I highly recommend to try them out. It's worth the money, the staff are friendly and really want to make an impact."}
{"text":"I am so excited that this place exists.. After buying their tzatziki from Sanagan's meat locker some time ago when I saw FAT Lamb Kouzina had opened on Yonge I knew that it was going to be worth trying.

I decided on the beef and veal gyro and to share the village salad. We planned to eat in and I didn't think I would finish my gyro so I got it to go. Wow was I wrong.. I finished the whole thing. Everything was delicious and very fresh tasting. The woman working was incredibly friendly and kind. The food and service were both amazing 5/5. I am looking forward to going back and to try more of their menu!!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try Fat Lamb Kouzina this week for lunch.  It's located just south of Davenport on Yonge. It's a quick 2 minute walk from Yonge and Bloor Subway Station. 

It's a great small space that puts out amazing food. There is some window seats to people watch while you have lunch and there is also a communal table in the middle of the restaurant. 

I have read a lot of amazing things about this restaurant. They are all TRUE!  They blew me away with the quality of their food. 

I love Lamb so I went with the Herb Roasted Lamb with Roast Potato and Tzatziki. I decided to grab a homemade pita bread to go with my lunch. I always need some pita when I have Tzatziki! 

My mouth is watering thinking about this lunch. The lamb was cooked to perfection! It was very tender melt in your mouth. It was moist and juicy. Perfection! The roast potatoes are perfectly done.  The Tzatziki on top is a generous portion.  

This food is cooked like you would at home. It's was if my mom had made this dish. They really strive on making the food just as they would at home. You can really tell that they take the time to make sure everything is top notch and cooked to perfection. I cannot say enough good things about Fat Lamb Kouzina. 

I will definitely be back. I have my eye on the gyros and the rice pudding!"}
{"text":"Tried the slow roasted herb pork Gyro and it was phenomenal. Te service was good and the staff was friendly. 
Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Great flavour, generous portions, tender meat. Looks like it's all made fresh same day so if you don't get there early, you may not have the variety to choose from."}
{"text":"I had been passing this little restaurant for a month before I decided to check it out. After the gym one afternoon I decided to order take out and eat it at home. My order included a pork wrap, and a slice of cheese pie. 

As I always do, I asked for no onions for the wrap, and had to wait for the pie because they were sold out. They were sold out of a lot of things at 2:30pm on a Saturday. 

Once ready, my food was packaged in a brown paper bag which turned out to be a bad idea. 

Once I got home - 20 minutes away, the juice in the wrap had leaked through the bag on to my pants, the wrap was soggy, there were onions in my wrap and the $7 cheese pie was pretty small and not filling. 

In sum, I had to throw out the wrap because I can't eat onions, the pie was overpriced for what you got, and the packaging resulted in a soggy mess. 

My advice: stay in rather than get it to go, and check your order carefully (if asked to omit an ingredient) before taking a bite or taking it to go. 

Cost:

Slice of cheese pie $7
Wrap $12

P.S. Cash and credit only and they are only open on weekdays and Saturdays during the day. Not open for dinner or on Sundays."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef gyro and it was delicious! Every bite was divine. One thing I love about this restaurant is their consistency, same thing every occasion & no surprises. The pita is freshly baked, the meat is nice and tender and their tzatziki sauce is homemade. Definitely recommend if you're in the Yonge & Rosedale area!"}
{"text":"Not worth it!

$15 for just a pita bread/gyro wrap! Very average in taste. I don't think i'd recommend this to anyone. The quality of the ingredients were okay but the taste was very bland and not that great. The meat was a bit raw. 

I didn't enjoy it. Felt I was ripped for the price I paid"}
{"text":"Where can I start?? Upon entering it's clean, wonderful aroma and welcoming staff. It's a little expensive (of course it's Downtown Yonge & Bloor). I paid $15 for a lamb wrap which I instantly regretted! Anywho, come to my surprise the wrap was full of grease (not sauce)...leaked everywhere! Despite the grease, I took a bite...tasted good but I got a kick of the greasy lamb! Sadly I had to throw it away...$15 bucks down the drain!!"}
{"text":"My favourite \"treat yourself\" lunch in the area. This place is rightfully busy and a bit cramped at lunch but I've been lucky to get a seat both times I visited. I can't imagine eating this delicious food at my desk at work.

The lamb pita is amazing - soft pita, flavorful and creamy tzatziki, perfectly cooked lamb (like actually perfect) and yummy toppings.

I got the pastitsio on my first visit. About 2/3 was a really custardy and delicious bechamel and 1/3 pasta with meat. I would have preferred it to be more equal in ratio. The salad that came with it was a refreshing complement.

The lady who takes orders during lunch is very on top of things, brisk and pleasant. Kudos to the kitchen staff, they hustle!

P.S. there is a bit of sticker shock but as a treat yourself place this is so worth it. Will improve whatever day you're having."}
{"text":"This little lunch spot is plain amazing! We got the \"GYRO WITH LEMON & OREGANO ROAST POTATOES\" ($15). This was not the gyro that you may be familiar with. Instead, it was gorgeous slow cooked pulled lamb. I must say, it was one of the most delicious plates of lamb I've had. The potatoes were excellent too. It came in a small takeout container, but don't let size fool you - it was a generous heaping of delicious goodness. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Oh wow!. ....Where do I begin. So, here's the deal: I saw this place on Yelp and I LOVE lamb. No one ever makes lamb well these days. You have the pretenders and then you have the people at FAT Lamb Kouzina. This place does lamb right! 

I ordered the Lamb gyro ($13.27) for me and the Lamb and Roasted potatoes ($13.27) for my colleague. The lamb......oh the lamb, so tender, so juicy and soooo flavourful! The pita was delicious and I had to have the gyro over 2 days as it was FILLED with lamb. FAT Lamb, never stop being you. 

The place is clean and family run. The service is wonderful and they are happy to chat about all things food!  Since this was a 'to go' order, I didn't take any good photos but I will be going back here to eat in and grab some proper photographs. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Great family style Greek restaurant few items so worth every penny delicious . Yonge and Davenport kinda hidden unless you walk in the area . I wouldn't say it's cheap but medium range ."}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb and potatoes -

Plus:
Good chunk of lamb that was really good, well cooked and juicy.
Big portions.
Nice staff.

Minus:
Only one large table to seat, so when it is a bit busy you can't order for here."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Greek food. I had the moussaka and it was fantastic Highly recommended for people who would like to explore the cuisine given they introduce a new dish every week. Definitely try this place if you want to broaden your horizon beyond chicken souvlaki"}
