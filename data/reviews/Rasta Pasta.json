{"text":"At the new location, the food was not any better. They had a grill on the street, but the cook was reheating the jerk chicken leg only. The jerk sauce was tasty, but only a small amount is staying on the chicken, so basically its a bland chicken leg with a few flashes of taste in random interval."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier with this place, it is my go-to while at work in the market. Friendly service, the staff moves quickly to prepare food, and that food is DELICIOUS. I frequent the side that sells panini's, which is amazing. 

The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star rating is one of the ladies at the main location next door has constantly been rude to me since I started coming there, and of course the side I go to doesn't have a debit machine so I have to interact with her every time I forget to bring cash. Otherwise, I highly recommend their food! 

*Try the Vatican Panini, very filling for 6$ and tastes awesome!"}
{"text":"A fantastic place for lunch. Their food is very consistent and always delicious. Also incredibly reasonable pricing for how much food you get. The jerk chicken and pork are both amazing, get them with rice and beans with a side of coleslaw and you are set.

For the pasta side I have only ever had the panini but it was amazing."}
{"text":"After seeing a picture of their jerk chicken panini on instagram I thought, I need this in my life! Saturday I ventured to Kensington market and as soon as I walked in I was greeted by the lovely folks working there. I ordered two panini's to go.
The chicken was filled with so much flavour and the gravy, oh my madonna, it was freakin good! It was a packed panini on a coco bun with coleslaw. 
I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Definitely a must for everyone!"}
{"text":"Best Jerk chicken I have ever had with a nice smoke flavour to it. Friendly service and can grab a filling lunch for 5$!"}
{"text":"Huge portions! Flavourful! Ordered medium chicken with beans&rice, small pork with jasmine rice, take-out, can't find anything to complaint."}
{"text":"First time trying the place, had the jerk chicken/rice and peas
So good! The chicken was juicy and falling off the bone - great tasting sauce
Loved how the bones were cracked for easy access to the marrow
Extra points for not overcooking the rice
I live in the neighbourhood and will definitely be back!
The owners were super nice too"}
{"text":"We ordered through Foodora, there was an error made by the restaurant which was promptly addressed. The gentlemen on the phone was very nice. It took only about 30 min to get our food which I appreciated. Try it out if you're in the area. Their menu is definitely larger if you visit their store location. There are limited items via Foodora site which is understandable since the food may not taste as great if you factored in delivery time."}
{"text":"5 $ lunch box is just right. They pack alot of flavour into the styrofoam. There are many jerk restaurants in Toronto, and many jerk restaurants in Toronto that cook all their chicken in the morning and sell it to you for the rest of the day while it sits in heaters (like Jerk King). This is not such a place. Everybody knows the big homie from Rasta Pasta is always cooking up something delicious. Anybody that isn't a tourist knows that Rasta Pasta cooks the food fresh. While their grill game isn't as strong in the winter, you can bet the meat game isn't slacking. Whether you're out front chatting it up with the owner (super cool dude, always up to chat) or you're inside feeling bad about the lady trying to juggle all the customers, you know its a home grown business. 

i DO wish they'd have a SUPER SPICY JERK option on the grill. I love carribean scotch-bonnet based heat, not the watered-down \"NOT TOO SPICY\" seasoning that alot of toronto hipsters and tourists enjoy. GIVE US SOMETHING WITH THAT REAL HEAT RASTA PASTA YOU KNOW YOU CAN . 

4 stars still. This is somewhere you can bring your small-town friends, your inlaws, and all the other losers who want to feel worldly and multicultural (within their safe zone) while still respecting yourself."}
{"text":"I love Rasta Pasta.  I work in Kensington Market at least two days a week and I'm always happy to have it on my regular lunch rotation.

It's truly all love in the service.  All the folks who work here are what I refer to as feeders:  In the business of getting you something good in your belly with no suggestion that you might be inconveniencing them as a customer.

My food is always great and I always leave with a smile on my face.

Go to Rasta Pasta.  You deserve it."}
{"text":"Every time I try to try something else in Kensington, I end up at Rasta Pasta.

Since moving to the core last summer from Scarborough, I've tried to find a Caribbean restaurant to fill the void left by being so far away from Fahmee Bakeries. Rasta Pasta has been the only spot I've been to that fills this void. 

The jerk chicken here is the best I've had in Toronto.The coleslaw and mixed vegetables are a great compliment to everything I've tried here.

The staff are very friendly and I'm in and out very fast every time I'm there. This is especially impressive as every time I've gone, they're bombarded by food couriers picking up orders. 

I recently went and saw that they were raising their prices starting June 1st - I'll always be a returning customer but please don't raise prices too much or it'll be harder to justify coming every week!!!"}
{"text":"This was awesome, you could smell the BBQ down the whole street.

And it tasted even better, got the medium chicken jerk for 7$ w/ cole slaw and rice with beans.

The portion was fairly large and the chicken came directly from the grill.
The gravy was super delicious."}
{"text":"The chicken is moist, flavourful, and sold at a very fair price. What more can you ask for? Oh and the owner/staff are all sweethearts. if you're looking for an inexpensive lunch, this is def the place to go."}
{"text":"$5 lunch special, can't really go wrong. The chicken is deliciously full of flavour and super tender. Highly recommend for a casual cheap lunch. The sides I could do without, and just eat piles of chicken.
Also clever rhyming name, definitely wins them extra points!"}
{"text":"You can locate this place when in Kensington just by putting your nose up in the air and following the BBQ jerk smell. The jerk chicken is always cooking on the bbq outside, and probably the best jerk chicken I have had in Toronto. Smokey saucey meat that just falls off the bone steaming. 

I keep wandering over here when the Seven Lives line is just too long."}
{"text":"Food was delightful and reasonably priced. It is a small place so expect to wait a bit, but it's totally worth it. The other side sells patties and pasta. The patties were crispy and awesome. Great place overall. I'm a huge fan of Jamaican food and RP will be my go-to whenever I'm visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is amazing!!! The sauce is also on another level!!  Get there early because it's rare for them to have any left in the evening... It's that good!  It's worth the trek from Richmond hill."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after reading all the rave reviews. I decided to order the lunch special ($5) and the jerk dumpling a.k.a. jerk chicken stuffed in a dumpling ($3). While the seasoning itself was good, I can't say its the best jerk chicken I've had, or even close to good. Reason being, the chicken. The chicken was fatty and wasn't cooked with a crispy shell or even a light crispy shell. It felt more like steamed and so I was disappointed. Halfway through my meal, I found myself wishing I had gone to 7 lives instead (sigh). I give the jerk dumpling 5 stars for innovative idea, but it needs more fine tuning.
The lady serving us was nice. The hot sauce they have IS truly hot (loved it). I might just go back and give it another try. Maybe the person cooking the chicken today was in a rush to get it off the grill or something. We all have our days."}
{"text":"The chicken is literally out of this world. If you're looking for true authentic Jamaican cuisine this is the place to go. 

I've had the chicken and the pork and both are amazing. 

Please know you will have to wait if you get there on the weekends. You know it's good if you get there and there are 20 people in line. 

The owner is one of the nicest guys too. I've enjoyed talking to him each time I've gone to rasta pasta. 

Eagerly awaiting the Italian side of the restaurant to open!"}
{"text":"A great spot.... a must try if you are in the area. I had the medium jerk w a bottle of Ting and I don't even think the bill exceeded $10.00... their house pepper sauce is nice."}
{"text":"Food's good, there's nothing wrong with it.  I only had the goat.  It was tender, there was hardly any bone or fat and it was good, It didn't 'wow' me like Chefydrew's though..  This is one of the places that shares a space with South American food counters.  There are a couple of tables but really, this is more of a take out joint.  I didn't try the pasta, I've just been sick of pasta in these recent years, but the dishes do sound interesting."}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken!! However the service was HORRIBLE. I'd eat again if I got it delivered!"}

{"text":"Thank you!  A descent Jamaican Restaurant in Kensington Market. 

The stuff there were all very nice and passionate, they make my day!!

I would definitely recommend going to this restaurant!  I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Came here with an open mind. I wasn't sure what to expect with the fusion. I ended up ordering The Tuscan panini and was surprised at the flavour! the jerk chicken was moist with a nice balance of flavour it had all the makings of a great panini with a Carribean twist. Everyone working there is very friendly, looking forward to returning to try some more
of the menu."}
{"text":"A spectacular fusion joint in the heart of Kensington. Delicious Caribbean food with generous portions. Modestly priced and excellent for takeaways. This place is generally crowded and fast moving. The Italian portion of this place does not seem to attract as much people as the Caribbean section. I would highly recommend the Jerk Chicken and the Oxtail."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is fall of the bone, melt in your mouth delicious! Had the medium and it was perfect, its a really good size portion.  Jerk chicken has a lot of flavour and the jerk sauce is awesome. Could be slightly more spicy, but other than that was perfect!"}
{"text":"The best jerk chicken ever!!! So much food for $8! Will make you want a nap. The service can be optimized. When I went there they had an office order of many boxes...3 employees were packing them and one person servicing the queue...which got longer. But that sauce was worth the wait. Get the sauce!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some jerk chicken while strolling around Kensington market. The flavour was great and cooked fresh. The $5 lunch combo is definitely worth getting."}
{"text":"Really nice spot in Kensington that offer a mixture of both italian and jamaican food. Loved their Jerk Chicken."}
{"text":"Really fun concept with an interesting fusion. Unfortunately they're always sold out of their signature pasta dishes and Italian fusion cuisine. The only thing I've had here is their classic Jerk Chicken in Jerk sauce which is delicious but not exceptional. It's worth trying of you're in the area...maybe you'll get lucky and actually try one of the paninis that other reviewers are raving about!"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken has heat but no real flavour. Missing something. The woman who worked the counter is extremely rude. Was nasty to everyone in line. Also ran out of several items on the menu and there was a line out the door. Why not tell people in the line what you are out of or write on the chalk board?"}
{"text":"Come here every few weeks for some jerk chicken & plantains. It's absolutely delicious and all morning I'm eagerly looking forward to my lunch.

Can't wait to go, who knows, maybe later today!"}
{"text":"I have been to Rasta Pasta many times, and I can say that it has got to be the best $5 lunch deal in the city. Chicken, rice, and vegetables. A double order is $9, but that's just a crazy amount of food."}
{"text":"This is the best lunch deal. Its on at all hours and everyday. $5 for regular order of jerk chicken straight off the BBQ or $9 for a double sized order. Served with rice and steamed vegetables . It is truly delicious and I sort of don't want you to read this because I don't want more people eating my chicken.

PS They are now located at 61 Kensington Ave."}
{"text":"I just ate the most flavor I've ever had for $5!! I stopped by late in the lunch special time frame (11-2), from the options picked chicken (or pork), beans and rice (or jasmine rice) and cole slaw (or cooked veggies). I think the chalkboard referred to the chicken as jerk, and while it wasn't a burn-your-mouth-off experience (I'm learning the range of what \"jerk\" can mean, I think), the taste was deep, rich and complex, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and moist. 

I'm not one to get excited about cold slaw, but it was creamy and delicious, with a good balance of vegetables. 

And, well, rice and beans. 

But they offered me extra sauce! (What is it with *other* restaurants being stingy with sauce?) I could eat a bowl of rice and that sauce and be happy. 

It's not as big of a portion as some lunch places offer (at higher prices), but I'd also consider this a healthier portion size for lunch. 

Best part? Not only getting served by the cheerful staff, but I snagged one of the two tables (I'd love to hear comments from others where they eat this when space runs short), and listened to their enthusiastic exchanges with people coming and going. They seemed to know everyone that walked by and greeted them like family. It felt like what I'd imagine a small town diner to be, in the middle of the big city."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today and I understand now what all the hype was about. I ordered a small jerk pork meal. The pork was cooked perfectly and was wonderfully juicy. I was also given around 6 large hunks of pork in my small container and it filled me more than adequately. It came to just $6 including tax. I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Had take out from Rasta Pasta yesterday. I ordered the Jerk Chicken, rice/beans with steamed veg and the Jerk Pork, jasmine rice with steamed veg. They messed up my order and gave me all chicken, which was disappointing since I didn't realize till I got home. But it ended up ok because the chicken so tender and flavourful. I ended up being very happy with my order. I would recommend the rice/beans combo rather than jasmine rice. It's more interesting and quite hearty."}
{"text":"First timer to this place and omg I don't regret trying it. The price is amazing and it tastes sooo good. They are also very happy friendly people especially the guy who was working the grill.  

Very pleased with this place deserves a 5 star."}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Came in around noon and was told to wait about half hour. Went back after 30-35 minutes and the food still wasn't ready -- mind you it's nearly 1pm now, and they opened at 11 am. The workers didn't seem to care and they didn't even offer a solution, so I guess I'll just waste away and turn to dust. I've heard from others that the food was good.  Obviously I can't comment since I never got to try it, and I probably won't be coming back again to find out."}
{"text":"I got the large oxtail with stewed vegetables and rice. Frankly, for $13, I expected more than a couple of small pieces of oxtail. Secondly, the oxtail was under seasoned. The oxtail is not authentic at all. If you're a big lover of oxtail, you'll most likely be greatly disappointed. Shame on me - a place that sells Carribean and Italian food - I should've known better.
Based on the reviews, it looks like they're most known for their jerk chicken."}
{"text":"We stopped by on Sunday afternoon and surprisingly, it wasn't that busy and there was a table open. We ordered the curry goat and the jerk pork, and a side of fried dumpling (of course!!). They were pretty good! I'd say pretty on par with Ritz, and maybe a tad more salty.  The coleslaw was really good (better than Ritz's). The fried dumpling was not as crispy, but we bought the last one so it was probably not as fresh. The price is very reasonable and includes taxes.

Overall, the place was clean and nicely decorated -- very, very small and cramped though. As we were sitting and eating, a short line formed, but it went through the door so the cold kept coming in (luckily it wasn't too cold that day though). The people who worked there were really friendly."}
{"text":"It's certainly not bad, and the portions are decent, but the emphasis is mainly on smoky sear and fiery chili heat. I had the Jerk Chicken because it smelled so good - definitely a bit greasy and heavy, the chicken seasoning lacked some other depth of flavoring besides hot peppers, and the beans-rice-oxtail gravy was actually not well-flavored at all, kind of dull and wanting some satisfying texture. Steamed veg on the side just functional.
Alberts kills this place except for the just-off-the-grill smoky food and the fun of Kensington Market."}
{"text":"I tried this place out a while back. I ordered a bunch of their mains to see what's up and they tasted pretty fine until something happened. So I couldn't finish my meal, hence I decided to store leftovers in a fridge for the next day. As a male that lives alone, I was happy I didn't have to think of what to cook because jerk chickens were in my fridge. Although the chickens weren't spectacular by any means, I was just happy I had something to eat for tomorrow. At least, I kind of enjoyed the spicy kick (jerk sauce) to it since I'm an advocate of spicy food. Also, maybe I could tell how fresh their chickens were by storing them in the fridge. Then the sun rose.. I was all dancing and smiling b/c I didn't have to worry about my breakfast. Then BAAAM!!! Their chickens tasted so bad and smelled so gross to the point where only vegetables were edible. Something was definitely not fresh. I wasn't sure if it was the chickens or the way they cooked. Something was just not right. 
I'm simply giving them 3 stars just because it tasted fine when it was \"freshly\" made. Although the \"freshly\" made meals weren't that spectacular and the chickens were somewhat dry, I could see how it attracts people with generous portions and decent price. I might return if I work nearby and just want to grab a quick meal that fills your stomach. Until then, bye bye."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Rasta Pasta. For $5 during lunch you can get a delicious piece of jerk chicken, rice and veggies. It's simply unbeatable! The jerk chicken is cooked outdoors on a charcoal barbecue and has that unmistakable flavour. Juicy, tender and with a little spice, I simply can't have enough. Outside of lunch time the chicken is $7 for a small and $9 for a large.

They have many other menu items here such as oxtail, jerk pork, curries and pasta dishes. Jerk chicken is definitely their signature dish, however, and is not to be missed. Most of the other menu items are around the $8-$10 mark which isn't bad at all.

The only thing that's lacking here is some outdoor seating (there are only two tables inside) so maybe head across to Bellevue Square Park on Augusta and eat there."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Toronto and we had a blast. This place was one of the reasons why our experience was so rich! The food was awesome. Usually, i drop a star if the customer service lacked but this place was so good you just can't!!!

However, the lady behind the counter (caucasion, brown hair, mature) was so rude. As a non local, unfamilar with the offerings or order style she was not the least accomodating. In fact, while another patron was opening the door, the wind blew and my money flew across the counter. The facial expression she made seemed as if she was pissed to pick it up. She had a bad attitude for sure, but the other staff in the back seem pleasant. I mention this because a poor encounter with staff can really make or break an expeience if a customer returns. In any event, we loved the food. In fact, this was THE BEST jerk chicken i have had outside of being in Jamaica. Hands down they know how to jerk and it shows. I'd return for sure even if the employee/owner whoever was rude. I'll just tape my money to me! Lol."}
{"text":"Amazing hole in the wall! I passed this little food place after shopping on Kensington Ave. A small  jerk chicken dish was 5 Canadian dollars and it was a steal! Generous amount of food! The jerk chicken dish came with rice and steamed vegetables. You can opt into cole slaw instead of steam vegetables. There was also many difference sauces to choose from. I chose Grace's hot and spicy sauce and it was so good. I would come back in a heartbeat! Best jerk chicken I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is Jamaican me crazy. Literally! Hands down the best jerk spot in the 6ix. Consistent, incredible, and always satisfying. Please don't ever change! Its a small place so lucky if u can cop a seat. But its so great I would stand outside in 40 c heat or -30 below weather just to have a taste of this place. I salute you!"}
{"text":"There's two sides to Rasta Pasta, one that involves Caribbean food with pasta and the other side has more traditional dishes with rice and veggies. We visited both. We had the alfredo gnocchi with jerk meatballs which was really good and also had the jerk chicken with steamed veggies and rice. The jerk sauce was so good. Not much seating, more of a take out place, but decent service. The pasta chef made some really good suggestions on variations to his dishes."}
{"text":"Great small restaurant in Kensington market with long lines during the lunch rush. Their menu offers your typical Caribbean fare such as Oxtail, Curry Goat and of course Jerk Chicken.  As one of the top places to try in Toronto according to so many reviews, blogs and websites, I knew that I had to try it eventually. For lunch I ordered the large size of the Jerk Chicken for only $10 (including tax) which came with a bed of rice and a side of coleslaw.  When I got my take out box, I swear it weighed over 2 lbs. Upon opening the box, I was in awe as they provided a hefty amount of chicken (3 thigh, 2 drumsticks). Not only was the portion large, but the chicken was extremely tasty, had a good balance of spices and was very, very juicy. Every bite was so succulent. On top of that, their coleslaw was the freshest that I have ever tasted in my life. Koodos to Rasta. Definitely deserve to be a 'must try' place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Rasta Pasta is a true Toronto staple. 
Most amazing Jerk Chicken and on weekends, you can find the owner barbecuing jerk chicken right in front of the store! They also make really good paninis for an afternoon snack if you're wandering around Kensington.  They give extremely generous portions for both the chicken and rice - the box is packed for only $6! I would also recommend trying out some of the Carribean Italian fusions - this is the only place that serves it! I personally like the Rasta Pasta which contains gnocchi and salted fish but they also have jerk chicken lasagna! I have yet to try everything on the menu but this is one of those places where I am willing to come back over and over again until I do!"}
{"text":"Awesome food,great price.But make sure to get there early before the food are sold out lol."}
{"text":"My favorite jerk spot downtown. We haven't tried the pasta side of the restaurant but the jerk side is really good. It's always busy. The chicken is always well seasoned and nicely charred. The portions are generous for the price. We get the chicken with goat curry gravy on the rice and some more on top of the chicken. I prefer it to extra jerk sauce. The hot sauce is hot!! And I love it!!"}
{"text":"I've had jerk chicken before, and while it was enjoyable, I never \"loved\" it - either because it was overly spicy, salty or one ingredient in the sauce was to overpowering. Being on a budget (and working in the area for the past 7 years), I finally opted to try Rasta Pasta after seeing them on a best \"Cheap Eats by Neighbourhood\" list. I tried their $5 lunch special was blown away. The seasoning and sauce on the chicken were perfect - a great blend of heat, sweetness and all the other spices that go into jerk sauce. The rice and beans were also incredibly delicious with the rich creaminess of coconut milk, but the coleslaw, while helpful to cut some of the heat (both temperature and spice), was relatively bland compared to other two items. They do offer steamed veg instead of coleslaw as well, which I have yet to try, but on a hot day the coolness of the coleslaw is still welcome. I haven't yet had the pleasure of having the chicken straight off the grill like others have, but I will definitely be back and hopefully will get to experience that one day."}
{"text":"Great Jamaican food in a fun atmosphere. Try the curry goat!"}
{"text":"A group of us took a road trip to Toronto and stumbled across this restaurant. We went an hour before closing and it wasn't packed or too crowded. They have seating outside but for about 5 people at a time. The food was incredible, fresh and delicious. We had the shrimp scampi, jerk chicken lasagna, meatballs and spaghetti, along with the gnocchi with chicken- every single meal was delicious and made with love.  The staff is really really nice and very welcoming.  

We saw a fight break out while we were eating outside the restaurant so that was an interesting addition to our dining experience. Overall, EVERYONE visiting or living in the Toronto area should check it out at least once.  I will absolutely be back the next time I am in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Great Jamaican Food! Great Italian/Jamaican fusion. Jerk chicken meal, goat dinner and lasagna all bomb dinners!! I make sure i visit whenever I'm in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is the thing to get. Meat is tender. It's spicy, but has flavour, not just heat.

You can get lunch for $6 - jerk chicken with rice and salad.

This is supposed to be an Italian Jamaican fusion place but every time I've gone, they've only had lasagna, and none of the other pasta options."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place since last year but it looks like they've expanded somewhat and boast a more expansive menu.  I tried their jerk pork with rice and peas and steamed veggies.  I personally prefer their jerk pork to their jerk chicken as it was a lot easier to eat and although the pork wasn't heavily spiced, it was doused with a good amount of jerk sauce.  The rice and peas were also perfectly cooked which was really nice.  I could've used a little more steamed veggies though.  But overall, this place is very popular and it's for a very good reason."}
{"text":"They seemed to have moved into a new location at 61 Kensington Avenue as they have their own place  Don't go there to dine in though as it's still catered to take out like their previous location (the place is tiny).  There is one small table there so if you're lucky, you might find it vacant.  I tried their lunch special which was rice (well cooked - too many places serve mushy rice which drives me crazy so this was a pleasant surprise), steamed vegetables (still crunchy which was a nice touch), and jerk chicken.  I must say that the jerk chicken was beautifully cooked and seasoned.  I devoured it within minutes.  The smell of the chicken barbecuing outside on the grill was enticing to say the least.  I can't wait to come back and try their other stuff like curry goat, curry chicken, or ackee and salt fish.  Seems to be a popular place as there was quite a line-up (went quickly though).  Staff/owner(s) are very friendly."}
{"text":"My university days favorite. Generous portioning on every visit, even the smallest portion can fill ya up. They also have some of the best coleslaw in Toronto according to me. Insane lineups for lunch and weekends. Also closes at 7pm so that's a bummer. 

The difference between their medium and large size is pretty mysterious. I'd just go for either a large or small (special) portion. 

Please bring cash, they really appreciate people paying with cash. Otherwise just order on Ritual to avoid talking to them."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some authentic Jamaican jerk chicken with beans and rice Rasta Pasta is the way to go. The portions are huge and the price is reasonable. My husband and I split a medium portion and it was plenty for the both of us."}
{"text":"Jamaican food barbequed on the doorstep of this amazing little spot in Kensington will make you want to sit curbside and devour your lunch as soon as you plunk down the change to buy it. Delicious jerk chicken with rice and beans or curry goat with cole slaw, you pick what you want and that's that. Get that quick counter service and move out of way because there are more people in line for this fantastic cuisine. Caribbean soul food that will make you feel great and put a smile on your face!"}
{"text":"Popped into the Caribbean side for a quick meal and didn't realize how big the small portion would be. Nicely flavoured spicy jerk chicken with beans and rice. It's nice to find jerk chicken that's still juicy, not dried out. Their pepper sauce adds some kick too!"}
{"text":"Don't go on a weekday lunch time if you're in a rush because the ladies that work there do not pick up the pace even when there's a long line up. The jerk chicken was okay, a bit too salty and is definitely not fall-off-the-bones soft."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful is the best description of this place. Food is ok, service less than ok, music is good and over all a fun place. They could improve the service a lot with just a smile."}
{"text":"This place is just simply AMAZING. I can't even describe how good it is. There's not a lot of seating, so it's more of a pick up and go kind of a place. However, If you're looking for fall off the bones kind of meat and delicious food for affordable prices, this is the place! I'm getting hungry as I write this. Definitely a requirement if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Meh.
The food isn't great. Ordered a jerk chicken with rice and slaw. The overall taste was nothing special. Not as spicy nor flavourful as in other places. The slaw is quite good. 
No place to sit and the service is quite poor. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is bbq'd right outside on Kensington Ave.  Yum!  The $4.99 lunch special is a perfect size if you don't eat too much, but they have larger sizes available too.  Very friendly folks who run this place.  Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Got Uber eats take out from here. I tried the Vatican pannini... It was amazing. Everyone else got the regular jerk chicken meals. They're having a hard time with the spice level, especially the ones that added the hot sauce (they are severally regretting their decisions...). This was all delicious, regardless of the spice!"}
{"text":"with a $5 jerk special you can't go too wrong...but walk in with your ipod on loud and your order pre-written on a piece of paper to hand to the ratchet prosty working behind the counter so you don't have to engage her massive unpleasantness...seriously, you guys should start a donation jar to pay for an employee who hasn't run out of fucks to give

p.s. badmon chopping the jerk outside is amazing and pretty sure he hooks up a little extra chicken to offset the potential sand you may get in your rice from the vagina of the woman behind the counter...also about the rice, the peas are usually a little undercooked but thats easily fixable (as is firing the sand prosty) 

p.p.s. I ask the person i ate with today if she wanted to add anything to this review and she said, and i quote: \"ya mention that woman behind the counter, I wanna stab her in her face hole\""}
{"text":"Great find in Kensington. I can't believe I never tried it until today. I came right at the end for the lunch special. $5 for two giant pieces of jerk chicken, coleslaw and rice and beans. It was also covered with a liberal helping of gravy. 

Its a little take out joint so there aren't any seats and service is very direct... But its great food and quick!"}
{"text":"Hands down delicious, best ubereats I've ever had. 

Food showed up in 20 minutes flat despite me being a solid 15 minute bike ride away and my \"medium\" jerk chicken dinner was 8 dollars and more food than I knew what to do with. Next time, a small. 

The hot sauce is smoking and stellar and the chicken has some nice somewhat sweet jerk sauce. Get the rice and beans and coleslaw and muck it all together for even more joy."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this two store in one. One store serves a Italian Cuisine fused with Caribbean influences and the other store, serves traditional Caribbean cuisine. They are located side by side. 

I visited this place in Kensington Market back in late July of this year. I can't believe that I never reviewed this place. I decided to try their traditional dishes instead of the fusion. The store is small and there's very few seats inside. Most people do take outs. 

I decided to get their Jamaican Me Jerk Chicken even though the people ahead of me were all getting the Jerk Pork. The chicken was delicious with a nice blend of spices and flavour. The sides of rice and vegetables were uninspiring. I'm still interested in coming back for their Jerk Pork. 

A must stop when going to Kensington Market. 
Recommended!"}
{"text":"I was really happy with my food, the jerk chicken was absolutely delicious, juicy and perfectly seasoned, cooked  on their smoker grill. I'll definitely go back. Fair prices too. A great addition to the Kensington Community."}
{"text":"Actually a 2.5 stars.

This is my second time having Jerk Chicken in Toronto, and I thought I'd try this restaurant off Just-Eat. 

The delivery time was excellent, the value for money was excellent, but the food was just not as tasty as I thought it would be. The rice was very bland, the vegetables were bland, and the chicken was a bit dry. The only tasty part was the skin of the chicken, which was drenched in Jerk sauce.

As I said, for the price, you get a lot of food, but I just didn't particularly like the chicken here, so I won't be ordering it again.

Overall, I would not recommend this location to a friend, as there are better Jerk restaurants around town for the same value."}
{"text":"Stopped by again to try out their \"rasta\" side and I can definitely say this will be my go to place for Caribbean food. I picked up the jerk chicken lunch special that's served with your choice of rice & peas, white rice or jasmine rice, and veggies or coleslaw, all for $5 tax included. Sadly the plantains weren't ripe enough so no 4 for $1 fried plantain for me. I found the lunch special the perfect size for me but if you like a little bit more you can get the medium size for a couple dollars more. Don't forget the spicy jerk sauce! They also have jerk pork, curry goat, ackee & salt fish to choose from, all reasonably priced. The space is small but there's a few spots of you to sit and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and had not just their Jerk Chicken but also their pasta which has the Jerk spiced meatballs. 

Jerk chicken was okay, I was hoping for a tad bit spicier meat.
Pasta with Jerk spiced meatballs was a pleasant surprise, too bad I tilted the takeout box and a lot of the sauce leaked out. 
And recently I tried the Oxtail as they didn't have any of the Jerk meat ready when they open their door. (As oxtail would be ready ahead of time)
The steamed vegetables was undercooked, and under seasoned. Oxtail was full of flavours and nice and tender. Rice and beans were lack of beans. 

Service was okay, as it's a lunch counter store.  
It's cash only."}
{"text":"my first time, try Jamaican food !!
it was really delicious. and sauce was a little spicy but good. i like that sauce."}
{"text":"Legitametly the WORST jerk chicken I have ever had... I'm shocked at the good reviews on here, anyone who rates this jerk, doesn't know real jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Came here one sunday afternoon for lunch and order the jerk chicken special ($6). Came with a very generous portion of chicken, coleslaw, and rice with beans. Although it was worth it for the quantity, I didn't find the sauce to be anything amazing- it was average."}
{"text":"Love the jerk chicken! It's even better with the oxtail gravy if they still have any left. Food runs out near the end of the day so you have to get there pretty early"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing price. Every time I walk by this place I reconsider my lunch plans. Prices already include tax and the jerk chicken has a delicious taste from the charcoal grill. I recommend the Rasta side over the pasta side but I've only ever had 1 sandwich from the pasta side."}
{"text":"Heaven, the highlight of my short trip to Toronto

2 kitchens side by side

I first went to the past side, where I got fresh homemade linguine with bread crumbs and a rich sauce.

This side does not have seating, so I went to the other place, where I had the Smal Jerk Pork as well as Jerk Chicken.

The pork tasted better than the chicken, the jerk spices were more absorbed throughout, 

the side of slaw with rice and beans complemented it all.

I will definitely go back in the summer, they seem to have an outside BBQ

Best part is the price, the pasta is $6 and the small plate is $5"}
{"text":"Had jerk chicken and it's very good.  Well-seasoned and very reasonable.  $6 for 2 pieces of chicken with rice, bean and slaw.  They ran out of jerk pork which I wanted to try.  A must-tried place when visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot! I eat here at least once a week and have recommended it to people looking for a good place to eat in Kensington (and they are always very satisfied afterwards). 

They have an italian side which serves unique pasta dishes, paninis and then their Jamaican side which is my fave.

If you go during lunch hours you get the most flavourful jerk chicken with your choice of rice&beans or white rice and your choice of veggies or coleslaw for only $5!! I definitely recommend the coleslaw. The small size is pretty filling but you can always get the larger size for a little more if you have a larger appetite. 

Their homemade hot sauce is a must try if you can handle the heat but be careful!

Its a small place with only two two person tables for seating so most people who come do takeout.

Definitely check this place out you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fun place and good find for jerk chicken. Hot but not so hot you don't want to stop. The place was busy but they get the food out. Some great looking sandwiches and meatballs for pasta. I had the jerk chicken and salad. The chicken was great and a good portion. The salad was over dressed baby greens and that was it. Over priced for $10. Next time I'd do without the salad and just go for the jerk chicken. And yes, looking for the next time!"}
{"text":"First time in Toronto, so a friend recommended this place. NOT impressed. I let my spouse pick the food for me. We had 1 with pork, white rice and cabbage I think. The other with jerk chicken, dirty rice and beans and \"cabbage\". I tasted both, they didn't scream out at me. Not a \"I have to come back\" reaction. Kind of disappointed. Meats were favorable. The dirty rice wasn't good. White rice was better. I would recommend this place nor would I go back, even if it was RIGHT next door to our hotel. I think #BUST!!"}
{"text":"There are two locations next to each other. We entered one of them, which offered italian dishes. We were confused, but the person behind the counter advised us that the other options are next door.

First thing I see at the corner of the menu on the wall is a note that says \"all prices include taxes\". Sounds like a good start.

Got the $6 jerk chicken special. They took out a small box, which worried me a bit cause it looked pretty big from the pictures and the small box seemed a bit small.

Rice and vegetables were added, then they proceeded to fill the rest of the box with a leg and thigh, finished off with jerk sauce. What space-efficiency.

It's a small store, with 2 small tables in the corners with 3 seats each. There are some seats outside, and of course you have the curb.

I found that the flavor hadn't sinked into the meat and most of the flavor was in the skin, but it still had some light flavoring which was alright. I found it more salty than spicy, but perhaps that is how it should taste.

If you're looking to get a quarter jerk chicken, $6 is not a bad deal.

No chopsticks are available, but I suppose that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals I had during my stay in Toronto. It was yummy and economical, I had the jerk chicken with rice and beans, I loved it. I was sad that the pasta was all done for the day but I went not too long before closing, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"$4.99 for a jerk chicken lunch.. yum!"}
{"text":"Really good moist chicken.
But the sauce is a bit lacking for me. it feels like its bottled instead of homemade.

Sauce is sweet."}
{"text":"Excellent food, prices and service. Only a couple of tables inside but plainly this is more of a take-out place, so that's no sin. I would love nothing more than to become a weekly regular here.

BUT

I can't feel good about the fact that all their food is served in styrofoam containers. If they can shift to a greener way of packaging their tasty meals, I'll up my review to five stars and become a regular in a heartbeat. Right now, I'm just too put off."}
{"text":"Its been getting better but not to its former glory. The last chicken special I got was really sad, they gave me like 50% less rice which wasnt enough for this over seasoned hot mess of chicken thats been cooking in the oven. Don't kid yourself they don't charcoal grill the meat anymore."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in the GTA! The man controlling the grill was super nice. Their $5 special is the best bang for buck in the market. Unfortunately most of the time they don't have any pasta, I've always wanted to try their pasta-jerk chicken fusion. Hopefully next time."}
{"text":"Finally understood why people go on about jerk chicken. Supremely flavorful, subtly spicy, falling-off-the-bone tender. Ackee & salt fish excellent too. The sides were very good and even the rice and peas was better than any I've had. Superb place, will be back. Soon. Probably to eat more of the same though I do want to try the oxtail. But, for sure, best Caribbean food I've eaten & among the best meals I've had, too."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing - and the service is really friendly. For $5 you get two pieces of jerk chicken (definitely get the sauce), rice AND coleslaw. Can't beat it! I would actually give them five stars for the food - I gave 4 because there isn't anywhere to sit and enjoy it! Only two tables in a very busy location. Still - check it out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here because of the hype on Yelp. I got the size large Jerk chicken with rice platter. It came with 4 large and tender pieces of chicken with delicious jerk sauce. However, my personal preference is for the sauce to be a bit spicer, and the skin to be crisper underneath. Though this was a tasty meal, it didn't have the heat I was looking for."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite place in Kensington Market : ) The food is always delicious......best chicken I've ever had.....great flavour. Excellent prices. The owners are super friendly, as are the staff. 

I get take out from here once a week. Love it."}
{"text":"best jerk chicken in Toronto, PLEASE ARRIVE EARLY. They sell out of many many things very quickly during the weekend. Very friendly staff and owners I always recommend this place to friends when they ask where to get jerk chicken. portions are amazing for the price and there's also no tax :D"}
{"text":"I had the very affordable ($5 including tax) lunch special and can definitely say the jerk chicken was probably the best I've ever had.

I have walked by this place for years and thought nothing of it. Then a friend who lived in the area dragged me there. Since then I have been telling everyone I know about this spot. 

This is very much a take-out place, with only 4 seats in the joint, so expect to pick-up something and head to the nearby park to enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a great Caribbean spot in the heart of Kensington Market. One side is traditional and the other side of the restaurant is Italian with a Jamaican presence. Great jerk chicken. Stop by when you're in the area to taste and see whatagwan."}
{"text":"They're really fast and really nice. I've been coming here for their really cheap jerk chicken special for a while now. 

Jerk chicken is soft, tender, juicy and luscious. The rice and beans have a considerable amount of sauce, but the coleslaw is nice but a little too sweet for my taste. 

Overall, great place for take out. I always order from Ritual."}
{"text":"Warning!! The amazing aromas will get you! I went into this amazing gem of yumminess and my mouth salivated at the moment I read the menu. The list of fusion pastas was to much excitement for me... However, Rasta Pasta seems to be short on the \"pasta\" part. I asked the guy when they carry their pastas and he didn't seem very sure of himself if they have even carried anything pasta related other than the lasagne. This made me sad but nonetheless, Jerk chicken panini for me please!

One word: Scrumptious! It was the right amount of spice, sauce and the chicken was just so juicy! I gobbled this panini paradise within minutes. I would of went back for more if it wasn't for the shame of having eaten some of my fiancees panini as well. Yes, it was that good! You yelpers need to try this now!

I vow to be back even when my heart yearns for the Jamaican/Italian fusion!"}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken and Jamaican chicken dumpling. The service was friendly and the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is a great treat. I really really regret not taking a picture of my food. The rice and peas are good and you get coleslaw on the side but their specialty is the jerk chicken. That is something you must get when you come to this place. You smell and see them roasting the chicken outside. Very very nice."}
{"text":"This is probably ONE of the best representation of goat with brown rice and peas, you won't be disappointed. Price is fair compared with others that sell mutton instead of lamb"}
{"text":"Came out here on a Sunday afternoon and instead of ordering in the restaurant, they had set up an outside booth carrying a lot of their staple meals - Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, Oxtail, and Goat Curry. Got the goat curry ($8) with rice and beans and it was pretty good for something in a small take-out container! I would say that the amount of goat was pretty generous (5-6 pieces that are decently sized), and it wasn't dry or tough at all. 

There wasn't a place to sit, so I got to enjoy the meal with one other person sitting on the side of the street in Kensington (as did many other)."}
{"text":"Smells great but way overpriced. Exactly the same as every other Caribbean spot in Toronto for double the price, complete with the rude ass staff tchhhh"}
{"text":"Small storefront that is packed with some big explosive flavours of the Caribbean! I am drooling all over again just thinking about it.

We were on a small snacking tour of Kensington Market and Rasta Pasta was one of the stops.

We ended up sharing a portion of their famous jerk chicken with a side of coleslaw. I wish we had more rooms in our stomach to order more. My brain was saying \"Yes, yes!\" but my stomach was responding with \"We are all full down here!\"

The jerk spice has so much flavour and that heat that will warm you up during the colder months and make you sweat during the hotter ones. If it still isn't spicy enough for you, you can add more hot sauce from the counter and also try their hot pickled veg too.

The chicken meat is so tender and juicy that it's hard to stop yourself from digging out every morsel and only leaving the bones in your styrofoam container.

Prices are so so reasonable for something that is just done with care.

Excuse me while I dash off to get some more Rasta Pasta...."}
{"text":"The food was great. Got the chicken jerk chicken, it was delicious but the lady at the front is a jerk. She was rude and my friend overheard some things that she said to her workers which was very mean and uncalled for. She wasn't nice to her customers either. The interior is very small and there is always a line. You better know what you want the first time or she's going to say some unnecessary sh#t to you. The food was good though, simple. But there's nothing that special about it. I can get rice and chicken somewhere else."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is great value,  but the Rasta Pasta is an absolute disaster.  It's small yet expensive and way too salty and oily.  For ten bucks,  buy two small jerk chicken meals instead."}
{"text":"We were hoping for pasta, but it wasn't available even though it was on their menu.  Our first-choice panini wasn't available either, so we went with Vatican Panini.  The jerk chicken was pretty tasty.  There are no seats inside, just 2 chairs outside which we were lucky to grab.  Next door is also Rasta Pasta.  It was confusing.  You wouldn't know which place sells what food."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in Toronto. Tastes just like the jerkchicken I had Jamaica. So good"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Kensington Market I make a point of treating myself to the jerk chicken. It is my favourite in TO. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted to come here for a very long time but when I finally got to try Rasta Pasta, I was a bit disappointed in my order. The chicken in my rosé rasta pasta was dry and the rosé sauce was just average. The staff were really nice though! I would be open to coming back but I think I'll try something else, like the jerk chicken rice."}
{"text":"I guess you could call me a jerk connoisseur. I have probably been to every Caribbean restaurant in Toronto to test out the jerk and Rasta Pasta is by far the best. I am so happy that I have found this place which is a short walk from my condo. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are large. I recommend this place to everyone. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Love Rasta Pasta!!! 
1. They are conveniently located in Kensington market
2. Best Caribbean food downtown and maybe ever! 
3. Amazing prices!!! 
4. Amazing staff and ownership! 

Highly recommend you try the jerk chicken with rice/ jerk panini / beef patty / oxtail! 

You can't go wrong!  highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you!  A descent Jamaican Restaurant in Kensington Market.  Finally!  Went for stroll at lunch time craving rice and peas.  Ended up at Patty King and hesitantly ordered a small jerk pork with rice and peas $7.50.  I decided to keep walking down Kensington.   I see a line up outside on a cold day.  Hmm...what is this?  Rasta Pasta...Italian Jamaican?   Huh?   I look at the outside menu...what is this?  Jerk Chicken?!?!  I look at my bag...I look at the line up then chalkboard menu.  Dangit...should I try it?   

Well...getting on that line was the best decision I made that day.  I had a medium jerk chicken, coleslaw, rice and peas with oxtail gravy $8.  I went back 2x that week.  I believe I've been there 5x in 3wks.  I've had the jerk chicken and the jerk pork.  I've had both the jerk sauce, which I have to say is a bit too sweet for my taste.  sthe oxtail gravy works much better with the jerk meats.  The coleslaw works perfectly with the spices.  I look forward to trying the oxtail very soon.   Their daily special is their small jerk chicken or pork with your choice of jasmin rice or rice and peas, coleslaw or steamed veg $5 w tax.  Simple menu done well."}
{"text":"Not the best jerk chicken in town, but I had high expectations from here because of the amazing reviews. It's a solid 3. The selling point here definitely is the lunch special for $6 which is 1 breast, 1 thigh on a bed of rice with beans + a small side of coleslaw. The spice is non-existent and it was a bit salty but the coleslaw helps."}
{"text":"You definitely have to try Jerk chicken!!! Small was too tiny for me so I went back and have my medium one on the next day!!! You can chose white rice or the other type, salad or vegetable. Must eat in Kensington!!! (They have two stores, the right hand one is served with rice, left hand one is with pasta)"}
{"text":"Their lunch size is such a good deal! They give you lots of rice (you get to choose jasmine or rice & bean), so it was enough food for me. The sauce is spicy!! Be aware :) Overall, it was a very tasty meal. We got there on Saturday right after they opened, so it was not busy at all. But because this place is so popular, it will be almost impossible to dine in. I recommend to avoid busy time or just do take-out."}
{"text":"Great lunch deal, Only 5 bucks. Had the jerk chicken, Really good for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Order: Jerky chicken special 

(2/2) Price vs portion

(1/1) Taste + food presentation + drink (most recommended at the top)
+ Sizzling hot food (rice, meat)
+ Fresh, juicy, tender jerky chicken with deliciously seasoned skin that easily comes off
+ Meat sauce fused rice, meat, coleslaw together

+ Wide variety of drinks, \"Ting\" was ok

+ Food come in clean foam container

(1/1) ambiance + customer service
+ chill reggae music
+ clean and very fast cashiers
+ Friendly employees

(0.5/1) Wow!
+ 0.5 price vs portion

Recommendation for a good experience:
1. Come during low traffic hours
2. Don't be afraid to line up, very quick service"}
{"text":"Dropped by to grab some lunch to go recently. They were sold out of the lasgna I was after so I got the alfredo instead, and wow, it was tasty. The chef was not particularily friendly, but she sure didn't skimp on the cream! 

My takeout box was leaky, maybe switching to a plastic container that seals or chinese takeout-style box instead of styrofoam would bethe way to go"}
{"text":"I was super disappointed by this place. With a name like rasta pasta and being in Kensington there was no vegetarian options. Get with the times, the area and rasta culture please! Although she did offer me salt fish as a vegetarian dish.. Real Rastas will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The bar/food scene in Kensington Market is absolutely nuts. There's so many good places, it's impossible to list them all off the top of my head.

Even amongst stiff competition, Rasta Pasta deserves high praise. I've eaten here maybe half a dozen times since first discovering it and every single time, I've received phenomenal service. Everyone is super friendly and passionate about the food that they serve.

Speaking of the food, it's awesome. As you can probably guess by the name of the establishment, they try to fuse Caribbean and Italian cuisine together. Sounds odd but it works surprisingly well together. The portions are huge and they don't just try to fill you up on the pasta/rice either.

Don't sleep on Rasta Pasta!"}
{"text":"I have been to Kensington many times just to try this \"fusion\" of Italian and Caribbean. The last couple attempts were especially disappointing. One week there was no chef to make the pasta, so I had to let it go. Today, I was given the tourist treatment (tho I live here, my looks maybe?). Anyway, I asked for the Lasagna with Jerk and... it was noon and they had none. The chef told me he was going to make jerk shrimp just for me. And yes, I fell for that. And ended up paying for a scampi pasta. Very disappointing, and makes me wonder how the poor tourists are treated. No jerk pasta for me."}
{"text":"Best takeout spot for good authentic caribbean food.  

I got the large box of jerk chicken with jerk sauce, rice and beans, steamed veggies, suicide sauce and spicy pickled veggies.     It was only 10 dollars and the box had 2 thigh pieces and 3 drumsticks!   It was awesome!   I actually had to portion this into 3 meals because it was so large (2 dinners and a lunch).  

Their jerk chicken is fall off the bone, their jerk sauce is a must have...get extra jerk sauce if you can, and their suicide sauce....is actually very very spicy.  Yes I got mine with some....and I'm actually fairly good with spice, and times my mouth was ON FIRE....the heat builds and doesn't want to let go!     The spicy picked veggies was delicious though...I would get more of that in a heart beat.  

I wish Kensington market was right next to where I live so I can get food here at least a couple times a week.   It's that good.  I can't wait to try out everything else they have...jerk pork, braised oxtail, even fish.     I salivate as I write this.  :-)"}
{"text":"I had the oxtail for take out. The portions are good and price is very good. This could be a goto Carribean joint when your near the Kensington area. I gave the place 4 stars bc i wasnt too much of a fan of their oxtail, but i had to be the standout and order oxtail when everone else ordered jerk chicken. 

Next time, ill go jerk chicken and see if that changes my rating to 5."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday. They were closed. Then went again after a few days. They were out of curry goat. Finally ended up there early afternoon and bought their curry goat. It was really good! Huge portion for a reasonable price. Want to go there again to try other things on their menu, such as the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Very cool place to eat.....had the jerk chicken panini which was very good, though a bit on the spicey side......staff are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"If you're going to visit anywhere in KM, don't miss this!

This jerk chicken is LEGIT and freaking cheap as. Don't be deterred by the lines. They move fast and it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the small jerk chicken with rice and peas with steamed veggies. There weren't a lot of places to sit and enjoy but we managed to grab a 2 seater. There are 2 stores when you go there (Italian infused + Jamaican ) which is just a few steps away, overall it was good."}
{"text":"I love the concept, standard jerk chicken on one side, pasta the other.. Unfortunately for me pasta sold out, weekends are pretty busy. Another time. Jerk chicken dinner very good."}
{"text":"First time tried this greasy Jamaican Jerk Chicken, i chose rice and beans rice and vegetables as a side dish. Only need to pay $5 because it's lunch special. Tastes good but need more spices to it. Overall, I'm fully satisfied with it! Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"The jerk chicken here is pretty phenomenal. As you walk by, it's hard not to be drawn in, even if you've just eaten, by the sight and smell of the chicken being grilled outside the store. The cheap $5 small lunchbox is definitely a steal, with rice, veggies, and a good portion of chicken fresh from the grill. The meat is tender and flavorful, and they give you enough to be very content. If you want something more, they have other, larger plates featuring other meats as well."}
{"text":"Kensington Market is full of great food, so it's hard to really stand out. Rasta Pasta is one of those places that does. Personally, I love the rasta, and pass on the pasta. My go to dishes are the Jerk Chicken on rice and peas, or the oxtail, also on rice and peas.  in my opinion, it's the best jerk chicken in all of downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"They had the best jerk chicken dumplings I have ever tasted. I go there all the time when I am working in the area. A must try."}
{"text":"After seeing them busy throughout the entire summer, I finally stepped in on a crisp Fall day for their lunch special. Did you know that for $5 you get jerk chicken, hot sauce, rice & peas and veggies? 

I loved the hot flavour, loved the barbequed jerk chicken and love the atmosphere. The place only has 2 2-person tables inside, so be prepared to eat outside, possibly standing!

But this is well worth it. For sure, next time I am doing my grocery shopping and I am hungry, I am eating here instead of the $2.50 Chilean empanadas!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with high value!! Must try!

There are two kitchens 61and 63 Kensington Av. I went into No.63 providing some seats  and have a great lunch inside.  The small size of Jerk chicken was only $5 tax included. It contains two pieces of chicken, steamed vegetable and rice( actually I highly recommended the recipe rice with lots of kidney beans).

The chicken was tender, juicy and very easy to chew. The sauce was wonderful for both meat and rice with a little spice.

The stuff there were all very nice and passionate, they make my day!!

I would definitely go back and tell my friends about this good restaurant."}
{"text":"Reading all the reviews here on Yelp. Decided to give it a try. Tasted really good. We only got the small size on both, since that's just snacks to us. So, don't order that size if you are hungry. But again, they are only $6 each.
Will go back again."}
{"text":"Rasta Pasta is a small jerk joint in the heart of the Kensington Market. The place itself actually splits off into two, with both carrying different menus, which is cool. The place is rather small and could only hold 2 small tables, so its primarily a takeout spot.

I had a small jerk chicken special, which comes with rice and slaw. The jerk chicken pieces were juicy and just spicy enough to enjoy. The sauce that the lady put on the chicken was beautifully sweet, which might sound bad on jerk chicken, but I enjoyed it. The chicken skin and meat are very moist so it's hard to get something else. The rice and slaw are nicely done as well. I definitely need to try the pastas, but they all seemed a tad too heavy for me at the time.

Food runs out rather quick so the later in the day you go, the unluckier you will become. Be sure to look at both menus before making a decision because both are rather interesting. One side is more traditional, while the other will have pastas and paninis."}
{"text":"I never understood the draw of jerk chicken until having it at Rasta Pasta and after that first bite, it was like a light went on and I thought \"oh, this is why you eat jerk chicken!\" My husband and I had just come from lunch so we split the $5 lunch special: A jerk chicken leg and thigh, coleslaw, rice and beans. (You get a choice between jasmine rice or rice and beans and coleslaw or vegetables.) I think the special is served from 11:00am-2:00pm and is basically a dollar off their standard portion size. 

The brown sauce was incredibly flavorful and perfectly spicy. The chicken was tender and mind blowing with the sauce on top. I'd say there was nothing particularly special about the coleslaw or rice and beans but you almost want it that way because the chicken and sauce are so amazing. We looked to see if we could buy this amazing sauce but didn't find any for sale. Too bad. We'll just have to make sure we get back here! This was one of the highlights of our food adventure in Toronto and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The food is great. From the jerk pork, to the jerk chicken, I really always enjoy it. A unique taste, with that house made hot sauce, your set for a treat.

Why the not so great rating? What the hell is up with the wife (italian white lady). She's so rude to customers, always has something to say to a customers request. Its pretty ridiculous. She cant seem to handle pressure at all. Can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.

The male owner is a super nice guy, genuine and I really do wish them the best. But missy change your attitude. 

Otherwise definitely check this place out. great food.

Edit: Great diarrhea today."}
{"text":"Probably the best jerk chicken I've had in Toronto.  Moist, flavourful and the perfect gravy.  The rice and peas + slaw were fantastic as well although I have had better slaw.  Great price for $8 to $10, you'd be hard pressed to find a better meal for that price."}
{"text":"Hands-down awesome. Best $5.00 meal in the city that includes Jerk chicken, rice and vegetables. Now I know why there's lineup's out the door on weekends. :)"}
{"text":"I heard good things about the jerk chicken panini so we grabbed a couple the last time we were rolling through Kensington.

Dang bitch, that's a fine sang-wich!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious jerk, and the Italian fusion options are fascinating - favourite stop in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"My go to place for jerk chicken. This place by far has the largest portion size to dollar ratio - $8 (including tax) will get you close to half a chicken's worth of delicious, fall-off-the-bone jerk chicken on a bed of rice and steamed vegetables. Whenever I open up the styrofoam box, my friends all ask me where I got my meal from, because it's just that good! They even have a $5 lunch special that might just do the trick for you (but not for me, cuz I eat too much )

There's a reason why there's almost always a line up outside, but it moves fairly quickly, making it a great alternative to Seven Lives just down the street if you don't want to wait forever. They're also open rain or shine, hail or sleet, blizzard or hurricane - you can often see them standing next to the grill outdoors in the dead of winter. 

I haven't tried their other menu items, but I'm confident that they're just as delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrific food and value! My daughter and I went there as part of a ramble through Kensington. Jerk chicken (great portion size) , rice/peas and coleslaw (really fresh!) was reasonably priced. Sure you have to look for a place to sit somewhere in crowded KM but that adds to the cool factor. I can't wait o go back for the salt fish and ackee."}
{"text":"You'd think this place is a gimmick, existing for tourists and an excuse just to rhyme two things together. Guess again: Rasta Pasta has it GOING. ON. Most people go straight for the jerk chicken side of the house. But next door is the pasta side, where dishes are made to order. The speciality of the house is the gnocchi Alfredo with salted cod fish (bacalao). Oh my god is this good. So is the lasagna made with jerk chicken; the sauce is clearly San Mariano tomato-bases, and it packs a fiery punch! I wasn't a believer until today and I regret having put off trying this place. I was at the airport tonight and some people came up to me and said, \"Weren't you at Rasta Pasta today? Man, that was GOOD!\" Yep, it's that kind of place."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Toronto for the first time and really enjoyed trying out Rasta Pasta. It is definitely more of a take out style place but you don't have to wait long for a small table to open. There are two parts to the store. The left one is a Jamaican Italian fusion pasta place and the right side serves just Jamaican food. 

Ordered: medium jerk chicken, medium jerk pork, both with rice and beans and cole slaw, ting and the guava juice

Portions were great! They really fill up the box with good portions of meat and rice. My jerk chicken was cooked to perfection with the meat falling off the bone. The jerk pork was tender as well and flavorful. You can't have Jamaican jerk without rice and beans which I thought was cooked just right. 

Make sure to get that extra jerk sauce on top of your meat and try their homemade spicy sauce and pickled veggies to go with the food. 

If you want to have that authentic Jamaican experience you can't forget to add a bottle of Ting to your meal. My husband got the guava juice and it was pretty good as well. 

After our meal we walked around and I so very much wanted to get a second one to take back home with us. I really regret not doing so! The line definitely picks up here so make sure to go early so you can also sit down inside to eat. Most people seem to leave 15-20min after sitting down."}
{"text":"What a deal!

Time to pile on with the crazy great reviews.  Here's what you do:
1) Wait in line to order.  It's OK, it's worth it, don't panic.
2) Hand over $5.00 (yes you read that right) for the lunch special of jerk chicken.  Always take sauce--what weirdos don't take sauce?  I also recommend the coleslaw which is fantastic and fresh.
3) Smile at the friendly Jamaican ladies.
4) Place your container next to the BBQ grill outside and wait for your chicken to be placed in it.
5) Enjoy!

Seriously, the jerk chicken is awesome.  It's so good, I haven't even tried the other items.  I'm assured by friends that they are also delicious."}
{"text":"My Airbnb host mentioned this place when I was asking about good food in the area, and I stumbled upon it when checking out Kensington Market.  I was hungry, so I figured why not.  $5 for a big bunch of fresh jerk chicken with vegetables and rice?  Amazing price for this town.  Super enjoyable meal and I'm sure I'll be back during my time in Toronto!"}
{"text":"When I visited Toronto this year, this hidden gem was one of the places I was stoked to try out. The food was delicious and fast. It is in a small place, but it's perfect to eat on the go while walking around Kensington Market. Cheap prices and good food. I will definitely go back when I return to Toronto"}
{"text":"Ordered the goat curry small $9 with a water. Tasted great, my two travel companions sampled twice from me!

May want to just take out as there is only 2 tables."}
{"text":"I drove to Toronto with a clear idea of what I wanted, Dutch Pot oxtail. But on my way there I was overtaken with a pasta craving. Knowing I hate choosing one thing in any area of my life, I had to get both. So I decided on the oxtail and the Jerk lasagna. 

I need to say I have never been more happy with my indecisiveness. The jerk lasagna was mouth watering. They do not skimp on premium ingredients that elevate the dish completely. Each bite was filled with jerk chicken. The pasta you can tell is fresh which is a nice touch. The ricotta had a nice balance to the kick of the jerk. I'm so happy I have left overs (it's freaking huge).

Then on to the oxtail, quite good. They give you a lot of oxtail for a small, I swear portion size in relation to meat vs. bone, meat is about 4 to 5 times that of bone which is a lovely change to other places I won't name on this post. But y'all know who I'm talking about. Also thank god for actually having rice and peas and not rice and kidney beans. Flavour profile wise it was good, I felt like it was missing something. If that idea comes to me I'll let you know. I would just say it didn't stand out as much as that lasagna did.

Overall I can't fault them on a \"quite good\" meal, as it still hit the spot. I'm going to head back soon for both a meat eater and a vegetarians perspective. Key words there are \"I'm going to head back soon\""}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken!  I ordered the medium jerk chicken with rice and peas with a side of veggies for $8.  There is a small size for $6 and large for $10. You can substitute for jasmine rice and coleslaw. 

It was a generous portion of food, very saucy, three pieces of chicken with a great kick!  

The restaurant actually has two sides with two separate entrances.  There isn't much seating so it's ideal for takeout. 

I would definitely recommend going to this restaurant!  I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Holy smokes! Best jerk chicken EVER. 3 pieces of the most heavenly BBQ chicken with a spicy sauce for only $4.99. Such a steal. The line was crazy. 
I ate here twice in 3 days as the chicken, the sauce was just so amazing. Still craving for the chicken."}
{"text":"Got the lunch special off Uber Eats. It came in a small styrofoam box and I thought it wouldn't be enough... but it most definitely was.

The chicken is fall-off-the-bone tender and delicious. It was a bit on the spicy side (was sniffling afterwards) but nothing too crazy. Would definitely eat again and again."}
{"text":"I've meaning to give Rasta Pasta a try for quite some time now, but there's been an intimidating crush of people inside the tiny joint every time I've walked by. Finally, on a beautiful June afternoon, I passed the restaurant and noticed just a handful of people milling about, so I knew my time to sample this oddly-named eatery had come.

I was in the mood to eat and walk, so I quickly zeroed in on Rasta Pasta's selection of paninis. I eventually settled on the Vatican (\"our famous jerk chicken with our housemade coleslaw\") and waited a few minutes as it was prepared in front of my eyes.

It's a good sandwich. The creamy coleslaw provides a nice balance to the heat of the jerk chicken, and there is, generally speaking, a good amount of both items contained throughout the 'wich. I just wish the flavors had provided a more forceful, bold punch, as, aside from the aforementioned heat, the jerk seasoning is mostly drowned out by the slaw and bread and is, sadly, hardly noticeable.

I'm still giving Rasta Pasta four stars because I did enjoy the heck out of this concoction. I just can't envision myself ever going out of my way to return, especially given the joint's proximity to the vastly superior Torteria San Cosme."}
{"text":"The name is a little deceiving as you think you are getting both Caribbean and italian food together. They share a store but they also have a wall between them and you have to pay separately.

We had walked into the Caribbean side and ordered the special size jerk chicken and a small oxtail.

Special size chicken was the perfect amount and a good price! The chicken was tasty! The oxtail is good too!"}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken. At 5 bucks with rice and veggies. Though the rice wasn\t so great.

Place is tiny. So u gotta u just take-away"}
{"text":"Awesome Jerk Chick and Pork!  Went by here during Pedestrian Sundays.  Really tasty, great price, and nice people.  Can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant in Kensington Market and you can easily miss it. I had the jerk chicken lunch special with vegetable and rice & peas.  Their jerk chicken was spicy, and I got hot sauce on the side so my mouth was basically on fire.  I really enjoyed my meal and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with a $5 jerk chicken special. Nice visiting in the summer when the jerk is fresh of the oil drum grill that they cook on right out front. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times already and my favorite thing to get here is the BBQ jerk chicken with rice. That is amazing. The jerk chicken has alot of flavor, it's bbq'ed to perfection and love. I love that it had a bit of spicy kick in the skin, personally I like to eat things with a bit more spice, and I really like what the chef does when putting together his spices to lay it over the chicken. It's really delicious and alot of the times when i'm down in kensington market, this is the go to place for sure. 

I had also tried there pasta side of Rasta Pasta, and I had ordered the fettuccine pasta and I was amazed how good it tasted. It  didn't look very appealing when I opened up the box but when I had tasted it, everything I had thought how it was going to taste was completely opposite. Really, don't judge the book by it's cover. The texture of the noodles were a bit more doughy and chewy instead of it being flat and soft. The sauce had a good level of creamy-ness and they added some spice as well so when you eat it it's slightly mild but goes well and gives the overall pasta more taste. Definitely will go back always, never really enjoyed jerk chicken until I found this place. 

#1 place to get jerk chicken by far!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday around 5 to get takeout for dinner with my friend and it wasn't too busy. I docked some points based on one of the ladies that were serving who was kinda rude. She didn't speak unless she absolutely had to (pointing at things rather than answering), when she did she didn't look at the person and just generally looked like she didn't want to be there. Fortunately, I got the lady who my friend told me was the part owner and she was really nice. 

After a long debate with my inner fatty, I just ordered the regular size jerk chicken with rice and peas and coleslaw. You definitely get the bang for ur buck at $8 for 3 pieces of chicken (2 drums and a thigh). We couldn't resist and actually sat outside to eat a couple bites before we left. The chicken was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of spice (for me anyways), the gravy they put on top was flavourful and went well with the rice. I was going to get plantains but I got distracted by the man ordering goat in front of me and claiming his son looks exactly like the guy in the logo. As soon as she started putting together my box of food I just went full tunnel vision. I'll definitely be back to try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"as an african girl i love chicken (stereotype much? lol) and i was locking forward to meet the famous jerk chicken that everybody talk about.
i really like the place an especially the fact that they grill the chicken outside, what a delicious odour ( don't pass by there if you are on diet)
The price are really reasonable for what you get, you can choose the rice and the vegetable.
The rice was really good, i don't know what kind of sauce they use but the mix was glorious!
As for the chicken i was a little bit disappointed, for me he was just a -good- grilled chicken, same as the one that i usually eat with my family. Nothing really special. 
As a novice in jerk chicken i dunno what it suppose to taste, so maybe i was tasting the right flavour, but if so for me it just a lambda grilles chicken accompany with a superb rice! 
So if you want some cheap chicken good grilles chicken with rice that's the place to go!
For a good jerk chicken i'm still looking!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to to go to this place for a while and finally came on the recommendation of a friend. One side does the pasta (left) and one side does the \"Rasta\" (right). I got the jerk dumpling which had delicious jerk pork? inside. The doughnut was thick, but good. My one big criticism was that they were pre-made, and had that old fried stale taste as they were made a while before I got mine. If they were fresh, I think they would have been great, but stale food just really isn't my jam."}
{"text":"Rasta Pasta is impossibly delicious.  Their jerk chicken is an inexpensive and simple dish.  For $5, we got a pile of rice and veggies (or cole slaw if you prefer), and then you go outside.  The man outside grilling pulls a fresh chicken thigh straight from the grill, chops it, and slides it onto your rice.  It's a spicy, savory heat in every bite of moist chicken.

There are a few other menu items, but I can't imagine not getting the jerk chicken off the grill.  Part of the charm and experience of the meal is getting the chicken straight from the grill guy!  Toronto, you've done street food right!

There's only one table inside, which seats two, so if that's taken you're out of luck!  The food is served in to-go containers, but if it weren't for the table we probably would've popped a squat on the curb or along the store front.  After all, this is Kensington Market, and it seems anything goes here.

If you show up in Toronto, famished and with Kensington Market on your list, haul your cookies over to Rasta Pasta first thing!"}
{"text":"Best barbecued jerk chicken served right off the BBQ! The spice, smokiness, overall flavor mmmmmmmm. That's all we ordered since we were just passing by on our way for lunch so we fought over every bit. The Jamaican owner had fresh juicy chicken on this huge barrel like bbq right outside his shop. Inside they served salad bar items and his wife is Italian who had some pasta dishes. Definitely coming back for jerk chicken, some of the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and I love the concept. I always try to go to Rasta Pasta whenever I'm in Toronto. 

If you dont want to eat their amazing jerk chicken, then You should try the lasagna, its delicious!"}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken and Curry Goat are must eat items!! So so so good that there is always a long line up even at 3pm in the afternoon!! Definitely worth the wait!!! 

There are only 2 small tables inside the restaurants and few chairs outside.
Many people stand outside the restaurant and eat. The food is so amazing that people (including myself) are willing to stand and eat...lol"}
{"text":"The Jamaican food is good but I was looking towards the last at which they told me was sold out. I had the oxtail woth rice and peas which was very good but since I came all they way from markham I was thoroughly dissappointed. It is not phenomenal food and they raised their prices as well."}
{"text":"Inadvertently stumbled upon this establishment while walking around Kensington Market. Nice, clean location with friendly staff and as others mentioned a great value for the price. First time I came was on a Saturday afternoon right at noon, we were the second in line but the line grew quickly thereafter.

My friend tried the oxtail and I had their jerk chicken, both of us got it with rice and beans and steamed veggies. For $10 flat, the large jerk-chicken was an unbelievable steal, both in quality and quantity. For a large they gave me two breasts and two drumsticks, and my friend also received quite a bit of oxtail. The chicken, as others have said, literally peels off the bone, and carries a rich flavour that shows how long the cooks have marinated and seasoned the meat. That being said, what really made the dish for me was the slow-burning jerk sauce that they provide. The spice in the jerk-sauce is strong, but unlike western hot sauces, carries a lot of depth that makes it more enjoyable. Definitely make sure to ask for extra jerk sauce on top if you can handle spicy foods.

Coming from the West Coast, where we have little to no Caribbean food, this place was an eye-opener. Definitely a must-try if you're in the area and want something cheap with loads of flavour."}
{"text":"I have been craving Jerk chicken for the longest time. I had a couple of friends recommend Rasta Pasta to me. Of course with a name like Rasta Pasta you would think that the Jerk wasn't going to live up to the hype.Boy was I ever wrong. The chicken was so delicious. It was so juicy and tender. 

I have heard they make Jerk Pork on the weekend...Now that's going to be my next weekend adventure if I ever find the time to make it happen!

I will definitely be coming back here again for more of their jerk! Oh did I mention that it was only $5? STEAL! My only complaint is that there are only two tables inside for 4 people. It's mostly a grab and go type of place. All in all, I still loved it though!"}
{"text":"The best part of Toronto is its unique ability to integrate so many cultures without 'melting' each cultures distinctions into a blurred, unrecognizable pot. If you don't believe me, just take a look at all of the fantastically executed fusion restaurants in the city.

Located in the heart of the colorful Kensington Market is one of these fusion restaurants. Taking the soul of Jamaican food and the heart of Italian, Rasta Pasta combines the best of two cultures into one. Sadly when I went, two of the pastas I wanted to try was sold out, so I went next door to their Jamaican only joint. As expected from all authentic Jamaican/Caribbean restaurants, the ladies serving are all sassy with a take it as their own pace attitude. I got the jerk chicken and also a curry goat which was pre-made and in a heater. I prefer my curry goats very saucy, thick and rich so I found it to be a bit light here. Some people may enjoy it and the big chunks of lean meat so I can't say it was bad, just not aligned with my taste profile. The jerk chicken was incredible though! Tender, saucy and juicy, I could have eaten a whole chicken like this to myself. I'm definitely looking forward to going back and trying the pasta dishes. Definitely a must try in the area."}
{"text":"This place has been on the top of my list of to try places in Kensington Market and it did not dissappoint!!  My boyfriend and I ordered gnocchi with jerk chicken,  he had alfredo and I had tomato sauce.   It was so delicious!!  The gnocchi itself with the sauce was so good!  But the jerk chicken did compliment it well too!   The alfredo was kind of heavy,  but if you're into that,  it shouldn't be a problem!   Pretty much craving this all the time now,  will definitely be back for more soon."}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be a quick and simple review: BEST jerk chicken I have had in Toronto. It's all I've ever had there (didn't even get any rice!) but it was amazing. Good level of spice, amazing skin, falls off the bone. Only $4 for a good portion too! Or get 2 and that's a filling lunch or dinner.

Loved it!"}
{"text":"4.5 for the jerk pork. Real tender and I'd order it again. The hot sauce they have at the counter is no joke. Had a good sweat going by the end of the meal. Good portion for $8."}
{"text":"Nice tiny walk in joint for takeout! We visited the Rasta side after hearing raving reviews about their lunch takeout. At first we went into the Pasta side and was confused but was kindly directed to their other place. 

$5 lunch special! This was our first time having jerk chicken and it was so, so good. The meat just slides right off. Comes with rice and coleslaw/veggies."}
{"text":"Cons:
- Cash only
- very limited seating
- large lines usually

Pros:
- really tasty food
- amazing price
- great portion size"}
{"text":"Simply the best most mouthwatering fall off the bone jerk chicken in Toronto. Get the rice and peas with coleslaw and you're done son!"}
{"text":"My only regret was coming so late - spontaneously decided to check out Kensington market for lunch only to learn that more than 3/4 of the menu at Rasta Pasta had already sold out! 

The pasta chef was already long gone by the time we arrived, we were told that only jerk chicken panini was left on the pasta side. We luckily scored the last two. On the rasta side, we managed to grab the last order of their ackee and salted cod (only had enough to make us a medium), a jerk chicken dumpling, a large curry goat, and a large jerk chicken with coleslaw, rice and bean. It was a bit hectic scrambling the last orders while various customers attempted to creep up from behind towards the front of the counter. 

There were not a whole lot of space to actually eat inside but we managed to pull together a small table and few chairs. With crammed space and limited air ventilation, we still found ourselves eating with beaming smiles across our face - the food was unbelievable. 

The jerk chicken panini - I'm not a sandwich girl but this will top my fav of all of time. Generous serving of succulent meat smothered in jerk sauce, topped with creamy, crunchy coleslaw, sandwiched between warm, toasty bread. Can't believe this was not sold out sooner! Last menu item in the store? I will take it... All of it! 

Curry goat - aromatic, creamy, and perfectly spiced. The goat was \"fall off the bone, melt in your mouth\" good. Didn't imagine their coleslaw, rice and bean would pair so well. It certainly proved us wrong. We scraped the bottom of our styrofoam box for the very last grain. 

Ackee and salted cod - their Jamaican pride special - I'd never eaten ackee before but instantly fell in love. The creamy texture and subtle richness - why didn't we meet sooner? I wasn't as crazy about the fish - found it a bit dry. But the ackee itself would be enough to convince me to get this dish again! 

Jerk chicken - more of the amazing chicken that was on my panini. Two legs, one Breast for a large. Can definitely see why their $5 lunch special is a steal (you only get an extra breast for their $12 large). 

Jerk chicken dumpling - I had the image of Chinese styled dumplings filled with jerk chicken when placing the order. Instead i was disappointed by a giant ball of stale dough and very little (dry, crusty) chicken - would definitely recommend saving $3 and skipping this. 

Overall, I vowed to plan my days better so I won't ever again miss out on their pasta and oxtail. If we were eating the \"leftovers\", I can't imagine what the rest of the menu taste like!"}
{"text":"Ok, I visited the \"Rasta\" side of Rasta Pasta.  I had to ask as I was confused about their 2 side-by-side locations!  So one's \"Rasta\" (Jamaican cuisine, right side if you're facing it) and the other is \"Pasta\" (which is more the fusion, to the left).

According to the menu, I missed their $5 lunch special, so I cannot give them 5*!  ;)  Prices do include taxes though, so that was a BONUS.

Chicken was very tender and I loved the gravy!  Sauce/marinate did have a 'kick' to it.  Rice 'n peas also tasted very fresh and not as though it was sitting for too long.  Coleslaw was a nice 'n creamy contrast to the heavier and spicy gravy.  Seating is 2 small tables with a few chairs.  Definitely more of a takeout place!

As I left, there was a line up out the door and I can see why.  Lotsa turnover for fresh food and prices are decent too.  All you need to do is find a curb to park your butt on and munch away..."}
{"text":"Ahhh. Unforgettable Jerk Chicken. Need to say more? J/K. The only thing is, There's almost no room to sit in but thats ok. I proudly ate outside. I mean its Kensington Market. Who's gonna judge?"}
{"text":"Rasta pasta is in the heart of Kensington market and cannot be missed amid the bustle of the chaos.  The food here is pretty good for the price that you pay. My friend and I shared a $10 meal which came with a LOT of meat, rice and beans and coleslaw. The meat was really good it falls off the bone once you touch it and the jerky sauce is nice and spicy. I loved it. The rice and coleslaw were also well made!

I totally recommend this place if you ever stop by. There aren't any space to sit (very very limited) but there's a park nearby where you can sit on the grass and eat!"}
{"text":"Good jerk and wonderful people serving the food. What more can one ask for?  The price is pretty killer too.  Maybe the best Jerk Chicken joint in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have three words for you: smoked jerk chicken. For a measly $5, you can get a container of food that is satisfying and delicious, which is a rare treat these days. 

The meat is incredibly tender and flavourful. It's the best jerk chicken in Toronto. I've watched the team of food wizards preparing it - they marinate the meat for two days in a homemade jerk sauce, and then smoke the meat outdoors on their grill for hours until it is fall-off-the-bone delicious. The smell alone is enough to make me stop and hand over a five dollar bill in exchange for some of their amazing chicken. 

If you like spicy food, make sure to get a few good spoonfuls of their homemade hot sauce before you leave. 

Also, they usually cut the meat up into small pieces for you, but I prefer to get it un-cut. It's hard to eat when it's cut up since the bone is mixed in with the meat."}
{"text":"$6 for a small jerk chicken combo that comes with a leg, thigh, coleslaw or veggies, and rice and beans. The portion is definitely enough for one person. The jerk chicken is spicy but delicious, and the chicken is so tender and falls off the bone. Make sure you get the sauce!

Only two small tables, so get it for take out. They take credit cards."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken is some of the best I've had in the city. The Rice and Peas and Coleslaw is excellent as well. Prices and quantity of food are very good. Overall, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday! 

It was very very delicious! You come in and there's definitely a good vibe right away. The woman at the front was very nice and she even recommended what we should get (it was our first time there). Me and my friend got the jerk chicken with rice and coleslaw (get the coleslaw it's really good). 
The chicken was amazing, and so was the rice and coleslaw, the mixture all together was heavenly. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the skin was so crunchy and delicious! They add some sauce on top too and the whole meal was delicious. 

What i like about this place they offer Small, Medium, or Large. The small is only 6 bucks!! what a deal!! 

I really wanted to try the jerk chicken dumpling but they were sold out :( next time though! I'm definitely coming back. 

The only reason i took one star off is because there's not a lot of seating. There's 2 tables only. But that's okay i'll be back in the summer when i don't mind sitting outside to eat! :)"}
{"text":"I went to Kensington Market to grab some meat from Sanagan's and couldn't find what I was looking for, so I ended up grabbing some jerk chicken on the way home to ease my disappointment.

I was really confused when I ordered it because the lady at the counter just put rice and vegetables in the box... turns out I had to take the box outside to the smoker/grill to get the meat from another cook.

The meat was crispy outside, smoky throughout, and moist inside... I never knew jerk chicken could be so good. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Can't get enough of the coleslaw, rice and beans! Yum, yum, yum! My son loves the jerk chicken!!! Such generous portions! The absolute best in Toronto! 

Damn Yummy!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Best jerk chicken I've ever had! Not a lot of seating, but the food makes up for that!"}
{"text":"The Vatican sandwich. Amazing!!! I will definetly come back! The people were very friendly and the pasta looked fresh as well. Overall this is a 4.5 to me. Will come back for a detailed taste of the jerk chicken. But the sandwich was very nice."}
{"text":"It is definitely the best jerk chicken i ve had so far. The sauce wasn't too spicy. Only downside was the lady didn't give enough jerk sauce."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOD.

Rasta Pasta was legit the first place we went to in Toronto back in November. My girlfriend had planned our whole trip and she kept going on and on about this place. And, my god, I get it, man. The food is amazing and definitely lives up to all the hype on TripAdvisor and here.

We both got lunch specials. I was trying to get the pork special, but they sold out for the day. So get there early. Anyway, we ended up getting chicken lunch specials with rice and cabbage. 

My only issue about this place is how small it is. I mean that can't be helped, however I feel its meant to be a takeout spot so the two small tables they have inside take up even more of its limited space. We didn't really care too much though. We ended up wandering around and sat on the steps of a church, eating like we never had a meal before. 

The chicken was so delicious, and oddly succulent for it to be jerked chicken. Not complaining, of course. Hell, the chicken was so good, I didn't even notice that it was dark meat. 

We'll be back in August for Caribana and we'll have to hit this place back up."}
{"text":"Man, this place was DELICIOUS! My friends and I were just walking around Kensington Market and stumbled across this place since the line came out the door. We knew it had to be worth the wait so we follow suit. We waited a good 15-20 minutes for the food but we didn't mind the wait since we were talking to locals to find out other yummy food places to check out while we were in Toronto.

We tried the Jamaican Mi Crazy Chicken, the Dutch Pot Oxtail, and the Portland Jerk Pork. They were all delicious but my favorite would have to be the jerk chicken. The meat literally just falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The oxtail was pretty good, too but I wasn't too blown away by the jerk pork. 

This location is small, only a couple of tables on either side of the store. A lot of the people here would buy it and take it home or eat on the streets.

A must try if you're visiting Toronto or in the area!"}
{"text":"kensington is one of my favorite places in toronto and rasta pasta is one of my favorite places in kensington. 

i'll mainly talk about the food, because for a place like rasta pasta, that's really why you go. 
i'm not a jerk expert, but imho it's the best in toronto. i can't put my finger on it (unique spice blend? smoked?), but it's different than all the other jerk places i've tried. anyway, it's really yummy.

service is friendly and the food is great value."}
{"text":"Been there before and got the Jerk Chicken.  It was the BEST Jerk Chicken I have ever tried.  Full of flavour and delicious.  Had a craving for it and went on a Monday but they were closed! SUCKED because I raved about it to a co-worker who came with me.  

Got a jerk chicken craving today and going today :) Looking forward to having spicy jerk chicken and their yummy coleslaw and rice with beans!!!"}
{"text":"$14 bucks for average spaghetti, generic non-spicy tomato sauce and 4 dry meatballs? Never again"}
{"text":"I've got to take a second and say I ordered this through one of those delivery things, I can't remember which one but I have to say the food was amazing!  I ordered this because for my Honeymoon I was going to Jamaica and I had NEVER had any Jamaican food, with the reviews I figured here's where I should try.  They did not disappoint.  

What I like most is when restaurant give you GOOD food and don't charge you an insane amount for it.  These guys know their food is good and they know if they charged more I'd still be ordering but they don't and they give you a healthy amount of food, more than enough for one meal.  I actually brought mine home for dinner :) 

All in all, great job guys.  Really fantastic!"}
{"text":"Some of the best jerk you will find in Toronto. They run out pretty quick and most weekends there's a line up. It's a must visit while in Kensington market. Get some pepper sauce on the side"}
{"text":"Amazing rice/jerk chicken deal!! great taste, wonderful cook, best value! Happy eating"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent prices. The only suggestion I would make is to cook more of the dishes that keep selling out quickly. Every time I come here, the plantain, coleslaw, and jerk pork is always sold out. The jerk chicken is quite spicy, which I love."}
{"text":"Actually thought this place was some fusion Italian for the longest time... never appealed to me. One day I walked by and noticed they had a smoker bbq out front. Dropped in and said what the heck. Wow!!! Jerk chicken was sooo moist and to finish it on the grill made it taste amazing. Probably best jerk chicken in the city and that says a lot. 

The lunch specials are best value. You get a jerk chicken leg, rice and beans, and some slaw. So cheap and super good! I've had the oxtail and jerk pork as well, which was average. Stick with the good stuff."}
{"text":"Real thing. Not a jerk chicken expert since west coast options are scarce but Rasta Pasta was lit af. House hot sauce and hot peppers set my mouth on fire. Tears, neck sweat, nose running, fever - check. But enjoyed every minute of it. To beat the heat: mix the coleslaw with rice & beans, oh and a ting soda. I ordered a small jerk chicken (drumstick and thigh), comes with rice & beans and your choice of coleslaw or steamed veggies. Perfect portion size and left me comfortably full. $6 meal homie. Don't forget to ask for extra jerk sauce. 

Like the other reviews testify, the chicken literally falls off the bone and the flavor is superb. Easy to find at Kensington Market, pretty busy during lunch and not a lot of seating. I didn't look into the pasta. Hope to try more jerk chicken spots next time I'm runnin thru the 6."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located in The Kensington Market on Kensington Ave. Street parking is available but I would not park there on weekends because it is so busy and hectic! Instead, try to park in a parking lot nearby.

[SERVICE] - 4/5
The lovely lady at the cash had spunk and was also efficient. We received our food quickly because we beat the crowd! A line quickly formed behind us but she still organized everything very well.

[DÉCOR] - 3/5 
Small hole-in-the-wall shop with a couple tables if you want to dine-in. Otherwise, this location is ideal for take-out orders. 

[QUALITY] - 4/5
High-quality and flavourful chicken and ingredients in homemade dishes. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Jamaica Mi Crazy Chicken (Medium) - $9.00 (taxes included): Choice of 
(1) Rice and Beans or (2) Jasmine Rice, also choice of 
(1) Steamed Vegetables or (2) Coleslaw. I ordered the rice & beans with steamed vegetables. Chicken was SO tender, juicy and fell right off the bone. Sauce was rich and savoury and complemented the spicy chicken very well. However, this dish needed slighlty more veggies to balance out the spice. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5 
The chicken was definitely the highlight because it was seasoned and cooked so well! I would definitely recommend this place for their deliciously saucy jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"What a little pleasant surprise! So I had 5 hours to kill in Toronto so I decided to check out Kensington Market. It was a gloomy chilly day, and the market was kind of dead but then I smelt something.

The little joint was packed and the grill outside was smoking hot with juicy looking chicken! and it was only $4.99!

People who come in here are all easy going and nice to talk to, too. 

Wow! The juicy spicy jerk chicken was by FAR better than kind of over priced Reef (in Vancouver) jerk chicken. YUM!!! I would go to Kensington Market just for this."}
{"text":"Authentic Caribbean cuisine, generous portions, very flavourful, reasonable prices :) I love Kensington Market, and this small Caribbean joint is one of the reasons why. If you are craving anyting jerk you must try this place mon :)"}
{"text":"Ok. Sorry. Time for an honest review. I read this is an authentic jerk place, BUT this chicken was not jerk.  It looked like jerk but I didn't taste one ounce of jerk seasoning. It wasn't even spicy, nor was the sauce.

 Authentic jerk is cooked on smoked sweet wood or the sweet wood is used in place of regular bbq coal, but NOPE, here it was your good ol coal from Canadian Tire. Yep, the same kind you use for your American hotdog in your backyard bbq.

The chicken was just plain and salty.  
They need to step up their seasoning marinade game!

The Rasta part is a walk in for jerk and jamaican food. The Pasta portion is a separate walk in next door.  Sucks if you want both. You have to go in two separate establishments. 

A big miss."}
{"text":"Chicken jerk is out of this world. The portion size is good relative to the price. You order it with plain rice or rice and beans and steamed veggies. The spiciness is on point. Id say go and try it despite the queue"}
{"text":"Great dive.  Preferred the traditional Jamaican side (3 tiny tables) over the italian fusion.

The jerk chicken made me think of the white sands of Jamaica.  Cooked perfectly with great seasoning and sauce. 

Super hot scotch bonnet sauce available if you need to really make it it."}
{"text":"One of the best jerk chicken spots in GTA. Their kitchen is so clean and it's quality food"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients with explosive flavours - my go to place for a quick lunch.

I have visited Rasta pasta several times in the past two weeks because it serves some of the best food in Kensington. I have tried the lasagna, the Tuscan panini and the Venetian panini, and every single one of them was very tasty. The lasagna, while simple, tasted very fresh and the flavours complemented each other well while the olive oil added richness. However, the paninis are what bring me back time and time again. The Tuscan has a sort of spicy chicken with coleslaw and the Venetian has juicy fall apart pork. Each protein is cooked perfectly with a blend of spices that really enhance the flavours. The bread is slightly crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside, and they grill it until there are golden brown and not blackened grill marks. Overall, they serve some of the best paninis I've had in Toronto.

I have only tried the pasta portion of the restaurant, but the staff working there are extremely friendly and courteous. One thing to note is that they often don't have all the options on the menu available so although there are ~ 5 paninis listed only two are currently served. 

If you ever need a quick bite and are passing by Kensington definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Bbq Jerk chicken served on coleslaw and rice ($6 for small size) 
My boyfriend and I just missed the lunch special (until 2pm), or this box of jerk chicken and rice would have been $4.99. This jerk chicken was amazing - the chicken was nice and juicy with a good kick of heat from the jerk sauce. You probably won't feel the spiciness for the first few bites but by the time your half way through, you'll want some water as the heat slowly kicks in. Oh and don't forget the skin, it was so flavorful as it fully absorbed the jerk spices. P.S. once they sell out of jerk chicken they are done for the day. When I came bak later wanting to get take out at 5pm they were sold out."}
{"text":"A Torontonian friend pointed me to this place while I was visiting. The jerk chicken was so good I came back 2x during the week I was there! And such a ridiculously good deal at $5 for a very reasonable portion (whole drum & leg, rice & peas, veggies, hot sauce). I'll be coming back when I'm in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Food was great and value was even better. I wasn't sure if this was a result of eating here but I had a stomach pain after. I'd probably be back though because jerk chicken is amazing!"}
{"text":"Rasta Pasta is an established Kensington staple where you can always expect delicious food and quick service. For me, the default order is jerk chicken with rice, plantains, coleslaw and a bit of sauce. This is a fantastic deal for $5 and change even if the portions have been shrinking a bit lately. The jerk chicken itself is fall-of-the-bone delicious and is probably my favourite in the city after Alwyn's. To top it off, the island tunes in the background and the nice staff more often than not ensure you have a smile on your face even before your order is ready! On the downside, there is barely any seating in the shop / nearby and you would do well to plan where you will be eating the food beforehand.

Overall, a great spot to grab some good jerk chicken on the cheap!"}
{"text":"Pedestrian Sunday! 
Walked by and the smell made me drooool. I had to try it. And boy am I glad we did! 

Best jerk chicken ever! It slid right off and oh the sauce..the rice.. Soo delicious. $5 and bf and I shared it. Next time we go, I'm so not sharing!"}
{"text":"Now this was special experience for me. Being Jamaican, I was dam excited when I saw this place while walking through Kensington Market. It had all the staples of an authentic jerk hut in Jamaica... The chicken being grilled outside, reggae music playing and the standard Jamaican guy handing out fist bumps to all that walk by.

I walked up and ordered a medium plate of jerk chicken with rice & peas and cabbage. The chicken came fresh off the charcoal grill and was chopped up on a cutting board just as it's supposed to be. 

After the perfect scenery display, I dove into the meal while sitting on a fold out chair on the sidewalk. It was like being on white plains road in the Bronx and eating at one of the dozens of delicious Jamaican places there. The meal was lights out delicious and as authentic as you can get. Chicken was seasoned perfectly and had a just the right amount of crisp and spice. Rice a peas were right on point and so was the cabbage. Just an overall perfect meal.

There is an Italian place in conjunction with this spot located right next door, hence the name \"Rasta Pasta\". They mix both cuisines and I can only imagine how delicious that must be. 

This place is a dream. If you want outstanding Jamaican food, get here. There are many places to visit in Kensington, but this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Had to stop by after smelling the BBQ, glad I did as it was one of the most moist and tender jerk chicken Ive ever had.  Pricing was really good, alot cheaper then the fancy locations in downtown....and 10x better in taste."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty solid for such a small takeout spot. They've branded themselves well with the whole 'Rasta Pasta' name and the fusion between Jamaican and Italian cuisine. I've yet to try the Pasta side, but I can just imagine it turning out well. The $5 special makes this place hard to beat. 

Must-try items:
Jerk Chicken

Caribbean food in the downtown core and surrounding areas can be hit and miss. The customer service was decent and I really can't complain about much here except for the lack of seating. I'd come back and try their other dishes for sure. This is one of the many spots in Kensington I wouldn't think twice about stopping at for some grub."}
{"text":"NEW ADDITION! Right next to the original Rasta Pasta is their brand new second store serving paninis, pasta, meatballs and the same good old jerk chicken you've grown to love!

Their classic signature dish is $5 BBQ jerk chicken with rice and beans and with either steamed vegetables or coleslaw. Even though the portion is called small, it is quite a large portion! 

Right next to Seven Lives Taco shack, this place is a huge foodie hub and I'm not surprised they've expanded. Perfect spot for lunch. Pro tip: limited seating; you'll have to find somewhere else to sit to chow down."}
{"text":"Taste too sweet and weird sorry but my boyfriend liked it tho ... Just not my cup of tea"}
{"text":"Having been wanting to try this place for 2 yrs! Does not disappoint ! 

$10 u get about $20 food! They generously give u a LOT of chicken! I got 2 drumsticks 2 big thighs with rice n beans !!!! Usually a jerk chicken place will give u 1 drum stick n 1 thigh for $10 . Me n my bf were well fed for $10 

The chicken meat fell right off the bones! ! U can tell they slow roasted the chickened! The meat is juicy n tender! As chicken drumstick cooker at home myself ! I know only slow cooked chicken at lower tempreture can get u tender chicken like that .

-longer in Oven: top layer fat from skin all cooked out, u get Chrissy skin) , 
-lower tempreture : cooking  the chicken without burning skin or drying out the chicken meat inside. 

So there is a sweet spot about roasting chicken legs n thighs. This place does well!!! I hate eating chewy roasted chicken , n I hate fatty thighs! I got tender flavourful beautifully cooked chicken on freshest bed of rice!

Not only their chicken is good ! Their rice is amazing ! Their rice is not as chewy ! So fresh! Usually rice don't taste good aft 3 hrs in the pot , they harden gradually as they keep losing their moisture.  This place has high turn over of food u get very freshly made soft rice with roasted jerk chicken n jerk sauce tossed on top ! 

Going back this weekend !"}
{"text":"FIRST LOOK: Rasta Pasta only leaves room for you to Takeaway, but, for a lunch deal of $5, you will be more than happy to!

OBSERVATION NOTES: The outside smokey grill is the biggest (advertising) attraction to Rasta Pasta, all by the pure attraction of the nose - they save by sending out incredible smokey BBQ Jerk Chicken scents in all directions from the store front. 

AND I'M IN LOVE.

**This awesome lunch deal?
Jerk Chicken Lunch Special ($4.99) 
With Rice + Lentils & Coleslaw

AH, YOU'VE MADE IT SO EASY: Quick service, at an awesome price! It's a simple two step, make your order at the counter, and if your choice is Jerk Chicken, you will receive a bed of either Rice and Lentils or White Rice and Coleslaw or Steamed Veggies. 

CONCLUSION: The Jerk Chicken is the best that I've ever had, a great size for lunch. It is smokey, and an absolute fall-off-the-bone goodness. So tender and delicious. The rice was an OK for me, along with the Coleslaw... The five stars all goes to the winner winner, Jerk Chicken dinner.

I will be back to try out much, much more of their menu. Oxtail, you are next."}
{"text":"Decent jerk chicken. Fell off the bone, good flavor. Losing stars for the rude white lady on the cash register. Because of her, I will never go back, nor would I recommend this place to others. Love the concept and pretty good food. But that lady....."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. Summer, winter, doesn't matter. The portions are huge and it's not just carbs. They give you a massive amount of protein. The gravy is probably the probably the best that I've had. Coleslaw? Forget about it. You probably haven't had better. 

Best to go on when they're actually grilling the meat outside. That freshly seared and cooked chicken is unrivalled. I always intend to try their Italian (I know right?) dishes but the smell of the jerk chicken, oxtail, gravy, all of that, deters me every time. 

They make everything simple and ire. Taxes included in their pricing, nice and quick service. Come try it out."}
{"text":"Excellent food and value.  Great people.  $6 for the special you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Their $5 jerk chicken is enough to satisfy my hunger. The chicken is spicy enough for my taste and with the pineapple soda it's only $7. They only have one table with 2 chairs so it's not a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Disappointed with my visit here due to the fact that they were sold out of their signature Jerk Chicken Rasta Pasta. Had to settle for the Shrimp Alfredo pasta with parmesan cheese; wasn't impressed. The pasta was chewy and had a weird after taste."}
{"text":"This is like a hidden gem in the heart of Kensington market. I dropped by one day during dinner time and it was packed. Constantly. And theres a good reason for that. 

Their pastas and lasagnas are all freshly made, and totally delicious. We ordered gnocchi and jerk chicken lasagna, with a side of jerk chicken. I was blown away by the jerk chicken. The meat was so flavourful, very tender and juicy to boot. The spiciness was just perfect, warm enough to taste the kick, but not too hot to make it unbearable. 

Sadly they have ran out of goat curry, ill definitely be back to try that one day!"}
{"text":"This is place is ridiculous. The Jerk Chicken is incredible and the value is borderline too good. Eat it!

They deliver from foodora (previously hurrier) as well."}
{"text":"I stopped in and got the lunch special, and boy oh boy was it great.

For $5 (including tax!!!!), you get a drumstick and a piece of breast on a bed of rice and coleslaw. The coleslaw was fresh, crunchy, and sweet, and the chicken was tender, juicy, and succulent.

DEFINITELY coming back again."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!! I'm visiting from Queens, Ny and this is the best Jerk chicken in Toronto, just enough spices and flavors. Great customer Service!"}
{"text":"I have only tried the jerk chicken here.  Reason: Its the best I have ever had so I haven't bothered branching out to the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I just ordered today through ubereats and I waited 1.5 hours for my delivery to arrive. 

I talked to the driver and he said it's because they had 6 cancellations that morning so they wouldn't make the food until he came to pick it up. 

So because of others cancellation I have to wait longer? As an actually paying customer, that is ridiculous logic therefore I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Very good. Meat was juicy and flavourful. Little spicy and little sweet. 
If you feel like eating jerk chicken, this is a great option in the area."}
{"text":"I'll echo the other reviews. Their rice is mediocre but their chicken is a dream. This is a really busy spot for lunch but service is fast and efficient. Ordering from Ritual makes the process even faster. 

Would definitely come back for more chicken."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best take-out lunch spot downtown if you're looking for the best bang for your buck! If you drop by around 11am-2pm, you can get a $5 special but it's not that far off from what you usually get for $6. The Jamaican Mi Crazy Chicken is amazingly generous in portion with the rice and coleslaw - you won't regret it eating this if it's your first time. Be sure to ask for extra jerk sauce!

It does get a little chaotic on the inside as there are only two seat and a few chairs outside. But most people are just bustling in and out for take-out. I'll definitely be back to try their jerk chicken dumplings (they were unfortunately sold out when I went)!"}
{"text":"This place had great jerk chicken!  I found this place on yelp and decided to check it out!

I was not disappointed, the chicken was cooked to perfection with great flavor.

It was located in the Kensington market.  I loved that entire area and there were several shops and food around there.

If in the area, check this place out!  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm wrapping up my Kensington Market reviews with Rasta Pasta.

This place gives you the tourist treatment. I showed up at around 2 PM on a Thursday and they're talking about \"we're sold out of pasta.\" okay so the next day I show up at opening time and then they're talking about \"give it another hour before the pasta finishes cooking.\" Like the f***?

Both times they ask me if I'm into vegetable dishes. What kind of a sales pitch is that? Anyways, having no other option since I had a game to catch midday I went with their lunch special of jerk chicken with veggies and rice, What's Rasta Pasta without the pasta??

Lucky for them the jerk chicken was marinated right and the chicken was tender enough to hope that it was free range.

The rice and veggies steamed and cooked near breaking point. 

It sounds so simple but it was a cultural delicacy 

Come here for the pasta but you'll probably end up with rice and chicken, which isn't a bad consolation prize."}
{"text":"The Jerk Chicken is really good.  You can taste the seasoning right through the chicken and also taste the smokey flavor of the charcoal bbq.  Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and got a small jerk chicken with rice and beans and steamed veggies for $6. The veggies were pepper and cabbage, which was good as I expected the typical steamed broccoli or carrots. Added some additional hot sauce on top of the jerk sauce and it was amazing! My mouth was on fire."}
{"text":"**Please note that this review is based on Uber eats**

Ordered lunch from here with a group of coworkers. I got the jerk chicken with rice w/beans and coleslaw, the rice was delicious and chicken was seasoned well. A little spicy for my taste but glad I got the sauce on the side. Would definitely go into the restruant  - overall a good experience"}
{"text":"$5 no tax quarter jerk chicken lunch special how can you go wrong with that. The employees are friendly and makes you feel its a  family run business. Often, i guess too often they run out of chicken!!! which is disappointing. They cook their chicken on the oil drum bbq outside and the guy chops up the chicken in front of your. The bbq adds a nice charcoal flavor. I also gotten their chicken  during the winter month when they can't use the bbq outside. it still good but nothing can replace the charcoal flavor you get when you bbq meats."}
{"text":"Rasta Pasta is made up of two tiny storefronts in Kensington Market, right next to Chinatown. It is a pretty convenient location, but there is little to no seating, so it is more of a takeout place (two tables of 2-3 in one storefront). The menus are pretty small, but they make the dishes they offer very well. Our group decided to try out the Carribean food side as opposed to the Italian side.

Decided to try the Jerk Chicken with veggies and rice with beans because I haven't really had authentic Jerk chicken before. It was a large portion of basically 1/3 of a chicken over a heap of rice/beans and veggies and it was so reasonable! 

Food: 
Jerk Chicken ($9) - Really good sauce, very tender chicken with so much dark meat. It was quite delicious and a good change of pace from the normal rotisserie chicken I eat. Veggies were pretty standard and rice with beans were good.

The only issue that we had was there was no seating inside on this cold Toronto day, so we ended up sitting on the seats right outside the storefront. It was very difficult to eat chicken that is overflowing from a takeout container with no table and plastic silverware, but somehow we persevered and the chicken was so good/filling. 

Also, **bring cash, it's preferred over other payment types."}
{"text":"Best thing I ate in Toronto. Great seasoning on the chicken and excellent price. Unfortunately they were out of plantains when we visited."}
{"text":"My friends and I made our way to Rasta Pasta after we were betrayed (sadly!) by an overcrowded café we'd scouted out before arriving in Toronto. Especially after \"working from home\" all morning, we were looking for a tasty meal within walking distance, and fast. Luckily, Yelp really pulled through on this one. While I hadn't expected Caribbean/Italian mix to seem appealing, I was hype to try out this unique mix. Especially interesting is the fact that Rasta Pasta is actually two restaurants, one rasta, and one, well, pasta.

The restaurant(s) are tiny; besides three tables and a countertop for serving, the Caribbean side of the space runs on a bare-bones setup. Despite that, the restaurant was full of foot traffic from passers-by, the usual lunch crowd, and delivery orders flying out the door. The entire place was staffed by women who clearly knew what they were doing and were happy to get it to you with a smile. We got our food and ended up sitting on fold-out chairs outside the restaurant to eat.

While a lot of people in other reviews have raved about the amazing jerk chicken here, I saw oxtail on their succinct menu and I knew I had to get it. I got a small-sized oxtail with rice (had the option of the rice and beans or jasmine rice, but I got a mix since they were low on rice and beans) and vegetables. While I was nervous at first that the oxtail wouldn't be cooked quite right (it is, after all, full of bones, cartilage, and connective tissue, and lacks meat) and would feel like an unsubstantial meal, I was very pleasantly surprised. The oxtail is rich, complex dish that clearly has been simmering and seasoned with care for hours. Much of the connective tissue has cooked down and kept the meat moist and tender, and the spices make way for a umami-rich sauce that is incredible when mixed with the rice and vegetables, which are a great foil for the real star of the dish. I found myself working hard to space out the oxtail and its sauce throughout my entire meal so I wouldn't ever be without its rich flavor.

I wish I could say more about some of the other dishes (I got a bite or two of the jerk chicken but I had tunnel vision over this oxtail, not gonna lie), but I'm going to be honest here--I probably will only have eyes for this oxtail the next time I come back to Toronto and to Rasta Pasta. At least I know I'm not afraid of commitment, right?"}
{"text":"I guess I reviewed their older location? Well, the goods are still good. Nay, great. Nay, better than ever. 

For $5 you get rice, sauce, veg and the best jerk chicken and sauce this side of Jamaica. Inside you talk to the lovely lady behind the counter, she gives you most of the goods and you pay her. Then you go outside with your styrofoam container in hand to the grill, and the gentleman manning this makes your life better (forever) with chicken and jerk sauce. 

This is one of the best lunch deals in all of the land!

Wait, did I mention sauce?"}
{"text":"Call off the search! I've found Toronto's best kept lunch secret. 

4.99 gets you a heaping styrofoam container of rice, beans and veg and then you trot it outside to the BBQ where the grill master will top that masterpiece with a quarter jerk chicken and some spicy gravy. 

Rasta is small, and there are only a few tables but on a nice day there are plenty of stoops around you in the market. Heck, this lunch is good enough to eat in the cold. Enjoy. 

PEPPER PROPS to Kent P for showing me the way, mon. You're so good at jerking off."}
{"text":"3/5 decent value, $7 jerk chicken special. However, we've had better jerk chicken elsewhere. The chicken was less juicy than in other jerk chicken joints, but it was nicely seasoned and cooked. The rice and beans were stellar, but the gravy that came with it tasted artificial. The steamed veggies were still crisp, which was a nice touch. All in all, decent place but wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Good chicken, good value, super bland rice and peas.

Terrible service; female owner treat customers like they're inconveniencing her, employees just act plain miserable, move slowly, don't greet customers, etc

This would be a 5 star review if I could just pay and get my order, not have to interact with these sour ass people, and not walk through this dirty decrepit bum infested area that Toronto likes to pass off as \"culture\""}
{"text":"Located very close to Seven Lives Tacos, this place can often be overlooked by people. But give this place a try and I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Their $5 jerk chicken lunch special is the best you could find in town. For anything \"jerk\" (chicken, ribs, etc...), the meat is cooked outside. You place your order and pay inside, the lovely ladies behind the counter will prep your rice (a choice of jasmine rice or rice & beans) and veggies (steamed veggies or coleslaw -- go for the coleslaw!!) Then take your container outside to the guy who does the grilling and he'll complete your order. Don't let the small container fool you, I think the portion is perfect for lunch :) I also got the Dutch Pot Oxtail and it's just as delicious as the jerk chicken. The oxtails were meaty and tender. They fell off the bone easily, but not mushy. I'm planning to try the jerk chicken wrap next time. That is if I could resist the temptation of their $5 lunch special, lol ;)"}
{"text":"Rasta Pasta was pretty good, I had the jerk chicken alfredo and a Kola pop. It was good but next time I'll probably just get their original jerk chicken and rice.  The one complaint I do have is that the wait for my food was waaay too long. It might be because they had just opened but still took too long."}
{"text":"I have been trying jerk chicken all over the city and this one has been at the top of my list to try for sometime so I had pretty high hopes of receiving mind blowing chicken. Long story short... this was NOT my favourite in city thus far.

We came in on Saturday afternoon around 2:30pm and I could see the line forming out front. The restaurant itself is split into separate establishments which are not connected. The left side serves pasta only and the right side serves the jerk chicken and other west indian dishes such as oxtail, fried plantain, jerk pork and dumplings. 

It is a very tiny shop and has two tiny tables on either side with the line up of patrons running through the centre. Both tables were taken however I would not recommend on eating here unless you don't mind the line up of people gawking at you chow down as they wait there turn to order.

Although the place was packed the line up moves quickly and efficiently. The jerk chicken comes in 3 different sizes - small = 2pc chicken, medium = 3pc chicken, and large = 4pc chicken. You also get a choice between red beans and rice or jasmine rice and veggies or coleslaw.

Hubby got the large which is easy for a large male to polish off and I got the small which was still ample amounts of food. We both got the red beans and rice and we both unanimously found it dry and bland. Hubby got coleslaw which was served on the side in a separate container which he appreciated so his food didn't turn it into a hot soggy mess however it wasn't anything special. I got the veggies as I'm not overly fond of coleslaw but the veggies were just a scarce mixture of steamed and buttered cabbage, carrots, and red peppers.

Onto the chicken ... the chicken itself was very moist and fall off the bone, the skin was crunchy and well seasoned. However I didn't find the chicken to be spectacular mind you it was good. The best part was the jerk sauce they put on top. They ask you if you want jerk sauce (it's optional but free) however had I skipped it the chicken would have totally been lacklustre.  The jerk sauce is where the heat your looking for was hiding not a lot of heat but a good little kick as the chicken alone has no heat.

Overall this place has good chicken but not the best jerk chicken I've had. Ask for extra jerk sauce as the chicken has no heat on it's own. The portions are a very generous size and the costs are very affordable. However the accompaniments (rice, veg, coleslaw) aren't anything remarkable. If you do go here come with no intentions of dining in as the seating arrangements are very sparse."}
{"text":"I agree with much of what has been already said. GET THE JERK CHICKEN FOR $6. Rice and beans are meh, and definitely need some extra spice in my opinion, but I guess that is what the jerk sauce is for. JERK CHICKEN IS GREAT - not too spicy but definitely flavourful.

My one issue is that I do not really see the Italian fusion... at all! There menu looked entirely Caribbean. After living in the Caribbean for a bit, this food was very familiar to me. In fact, I do not see much creativity in any of their menu items. 

Point is, I would definitely come back - not because I think the food is creative, but because the food is worth it at its price point. 

PRO TIP: If you like heat, they have a great hot sauce on the counter that you can add. I tasted like habaneros! It was great."}

The price was very good too. I'm looking forward to going back and trying one of their jerk chicken pasta fusion dishes."}
