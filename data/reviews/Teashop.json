{"text":"Le service est courtois. Ils prennent le temps de bien te conseiller quand tu ne sais pas quoi prendre. Les lattés sont très bons. Ils ne sont pas trop sucrés. L'endroit est propre et bien rangé. C'est vraiment un endroit parfait pour profiter d'un bon latté."}
{"text":"Super cute little spot to study or to have some tea! They have a large variety of teas that are amazing! The way they organize their teas and stuff is super neat and clean.
