{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch on a weekday and ordered a chicken/avocado/bacon sandwich and a hefeweizen. The sandwich was delicious, with fresh, well-cooked chicken. Got a side of potato salad which I was happy to see wasn't just a mayo overload, but was well-balanced. The hefe was good, nothing extraordinary, but perfectly hit the spot on a warm day. Service was quick and courteous, but again, on a weekday lunch there were not a ton of people around, so I don't know what it's like during a busier time of day. I walked out well-pleased and would certainly come again."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Could not ask for more in a neighborhood brewery.  Every house beer is delicious and unique, and they get their customers involved in the process by doing beer samples with different yeasts and hops. The food is amazing (best bison burger in the valley, hands down), fresh, flavorful and not a hint of grease like you find in other sports bars and breweries (looking at you, Four Peaks).  There's a TV in every line of sight which makes it perfect for a full day of beer, food and football, and the staff are always friendly, enthusiastic and engaging. The owner is always on his feet, either serving beer or food or checking tables to make sure everyone's having a good time.  And happy hour all day Sunday. Incredible."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, and we were pretty impressed. We both tried the beer flights. Most of the samples were great! We also ordered food. I had the fish,and chips, Walleye even! My wife had the Burger, and that was amazing too. She added the homemade chips and those were very tasty too. All in all a great place to go, and take friends."}
{"text":"We tried this place last night.  I'll get right to the point...  The tots had good flavor but were cold in the center.  The wings were not good at all.  I appreciate the effort on the smoke, but you HAVE TO drop the wings in the fryer to crisp up the skin.  The sauce was not spicy either.  I would have preferred a traditional buffalo sauce like Franks.  The fish and chips were ok.  No lemon with them.  The fries were soggy/soft.  The beer was OK.  About as good as Four Peaks.  The service was good.  I am always amazed at these Scottsdale bars/breweries that have nothing to do but stare at a TV.  Pool tables, shuffle board, darts would be nice... We actually cashed out and went to Fate for a pizza cuz we didn't finish the food at SBC.  We may try it again.  Maybe not...."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and overall great atmosphere! Also can't forget the best part, the beer! Had the IPA and pale ale and both were perfect."}
{"text":"We just came across the Scottsdale Beer Company about a month ago and we love it! The beer is great and it's super cold! The food is great! Our favorite are the fried pickles! The employees are amazing and the owner always comes around to talk as well as the Brew Master. This has become our favorite place to come and have a beer and appetizers."}
{"text":"The people are friendly and very knowledgeable about their beers. You can watch them brewing as you eat and drink in the restaurant. Great outdoor seating with powerful misters to combat the Arizona heat. The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This was probably my 5th trip SBC and always had a good experience. My 2nd time there a gentleman sitting at bar told me to get the angus burger medium rare, and it was best burger he's ever had. I ordered it that day and was impressed. It's always good. This last visit though, they floored me with absolute burger awesomeness. My burger just melted in my mouth. It was cooked perfectly and just oozed with juices. Oh, and they have great beer to go with a fun atmosphere. Go there now!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this new brew pub. It starts at good when you get fried pickles that barely have a breading on them and are deliciously briny and decadent with a cucumber dill sauce to accompany. We split the burger (going out that night) and it was divine- especially the cheese curds on top. With a luscious challah bun, roasted tomatoes and a garlic aioli, it was delicious. We sampled a couple of beers and they are great! It has a nice bright atmosphere and the service was great. Welcome to Scottsdale for sure! We will be back. Laurie and Rodney Malone"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday afternoon for happy hour. The parking is a little weird, just a few spots near the doors, the rest are behind the building by Pier One...maybe they want to see if you can walk afterwards. The waiter was a little rushed, barely waiting for us to order. Maybe he had too many tables? We tried their Amber Ale and the Bandito Brown Ale. The Amber was a little hoppy for me so I joined my husband with the Bandito. It was a rich, satisfying brown ale, 6.2ABV 30 ibu, so NOT hoppy, yay for us!! They have an extensive list of their own brews, most seemed to be IPA's or variations of them. They also have a full bar and wine menu. Our pints were $4.50 but $3.50 during happy hour, 3-7 weekdays and 11-4 Saturdays. They also had $1 off all appetizers. We tried the smothered fries and fried pickles. The fries were good but the gravy wasn't as rich as the one at North Mountain Brewing. You could add bangers for an extra cost (not sure about sausage with brown gravy though!) I really liked the fried pickles. They were more like pickle chips, thin battered deep fried slices with a great cucumber ranch dip. The place got a little noisy toward the end of our visit, happy hour in full swing! There were several groups with young children, too. The waiter seemed to have a little more time for us at that point and helpfully explained that getting a growler fill on Tuesdays was 1/2 price. Wow, that's a deal!! We will be back, cuz they serve fish and chips, and I have a friend who puts that number one on her microbrew list!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Always great service and the food is fresh. If you are looking for somewhere to grab a quick lunch or relax after work check this place out."}
{"text":"Atmopsphere is great, food is Delish and they were super accommodating for my son's egg allergy. Family friendly or great for a night out with adults!"}
{"text":"The place has a nice sports bar feel to it, a lot better than most...its not typical, it has a modern flair.  The roasted cauliflower was slightly above par...next time I'll go without the tomato sauce.  The wings were GREAT.  I ventured into the Thai & Sesame, can't wait to try other dishes and other wing flavors."}
{"text":"Party of four ate here in October. Three of us had the Angus burger and one the pulled pork. The burgers were fantastic; great bun, meat, toppings and cooked the way each of us requested. Pulled pork was good too, but not slathered with BBQ sauce, so if you like the sauce, ask for it. The fries were really good (thin with crisp outside). Tried both the Scottish and East End ales. The East End had a slight hoppy tone to it (for a 34 IBU beer), and the Scottish ale was right on with a more sweet hint. Both were great. Overall a good eating experience. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time yesterday to watch the Cubs game. We had a fantastic time. The entire staff, especially our server Terry, were fun, competent and attentive. Great value on beer and small plates on the happy hour menu. The Giant tots with truffle sour cream were excellent as were the pretzels and cheese dip. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"You really are going to want to get here to try their new beer \"Chef Collaboration Bay leaf and juniper berry pilzner\" As always  great service, awesome food and beers that are really worth taking home!"}
{"text":"We are signed up on their email list and get a notification when they have a new beer release. the bar is larger and spacious. Put it on your must stop by list if you are a craft beer enthusiast!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out. Nice decoration, liked having booth right by window where can see their brewery, good atmosphere, even liked the music on the speakers (some good old school 80s music at the time). Felt very spacious, whereas some places, cram you in. It was also incredibly clean and no bad smells, nor flies, or anything distracting like that. We found it to be quite comfortable there and laid back (in a good way).  The server and staff were really great, friendly, and quite helpful. Needed a bit of help deciding from their giant beer menu, and our server had some suggestions. They had all sorts of variety.   Got a good belgian blonde ale they had on special and on tap. Man, that was a great beer, good enough that itself alone would be a great reason to go back. Too bad I didn't remember which one (because I'd probably go buy it in the store instead). But it worked great.  Gave the fried pickle chips a whirl. Not my thing, but I found them tasty, juicy, crunchy. The breading was perfect. Not soggy and damp, but had a nice crisp. One bite and you feel the juices unleash. Went perfect with the type of beer we were having (don't think it would mix well with anything dark unless that's one's own preference). She liked it a lot though, since coming from eastern Europe, she grew up developing a taste and sense for pickle products, so if it won her over, that's a great sign.  We ordered burgers. I'm not a fan of fancy burgers. They didn't use \"normal\" tomatoes, but was some kind of ripe, deflated, real tart, roma tomato. In simpler terms, it tasted like someone took some ketchup and reformed it back into a tomato. Was quite \"ketchupy\" in taste, but you can tell they did a lot more to it. Not a bad twist (not sure if it was intentional). Takes getting used to and looks horrible (like it was a small red alien that got run over). Some people have a real thing for these, but I couldn't get used to it and ended up just taking it off. No lettuce but some kind of kale or red-stemmed leafy alien plant (can't remember too clearly), didn't care about it. There was a sauce, I asked for it on the side. It was some kind of aoli tartar sauce or like that. WHO PUTS THAT ON A HAMBURGER? Well, they did, and while she loved everything on it, I didn't (as I pointed out). Good thing I asked for it on the side.  BUT the beef was very, very good, juicy, thick, tasty, it began to fill us up fast. Great char on that patty, nicely seasoned. The cheese melted well and worked great with the flavor of the patty and the BACON.  I love it when a place GETS BACON RIGHT. THEY GOT IT RIGHT. About 85% of any place I go to, they serve undercooked bacon or skimp on the bacon. I won't name their names here, but suffice to say, there is simply no friggin' excuse for undercooked bacon, or skimping on the bacon. Bacon should be generous and cooked crispy but not too dry (hence, some grease on it).  At this place, I'm proud to say, I got some good bacon, the portions were right, the pieces were huge, and they were very thick, and not undercooked. THANK YOU.  They also got the french fries right. I didn't get pile of undercooked or anything that tasted like it was in a freezer for years. They were crisp, delicious, and I was very impressed with the portion size.   Everything was well worth the price, given the high quality.  We had a very enjoyable experience there and recommend it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, and fantastic beer. When I come back to Arizona I will make it a point to be back here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Donnie the chef made incredible food for our Beer Dinner! This is a amazing place you will want to check out"}
{"text":"This is a really cool place just tried it.. We are on mission to try out all the breweries..the food was really good..decent beer selection atmosphere super cool really like this place.  Restaurants struggle on this corner so I'm I'm hoping that they are successful"}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the charred broccoli app, spicy and cheesy and delicious...everything you want in a broccoli dish, right? Golddigger IPA is awesome. Good service and nice patio setting."}
{"text":"So great when we went last night !!! Sat at the bar last night had great service. Order several of their beers, which were all great. Also ordered the Mac and cheese which was amazing. Overall fun atmosphere and great service, definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some good craft beer"}
{"text":"This place was a big surprise. When I think brewery, I think decent food. This brewery has very quality food across the board. The Kale and Salmon lox salad could be best kale salad in town period. I also had the roasted cauliflower and it was prepared perfectly. Not overdone, sharp cheddar and hint of bacon. My buddy had the angus burger and said one of the best burgers he has had. This buddy has been part one of Arizonas all time restaurant groups for years. I tried the porter and stout. The stout was good but the porter was just ok. Again, the food is top top notch. A must go."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Went with my brother and split the pretzel and the wings. Both were amazing. Then I got the bison burger which was delicious and my brother got the regular burger which was equally yummy.  Can't wait to try their walleye fish and chips! And don't forget about the handcrafted brews which are brewed in house along with other crafts beer companies on tap.  I will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"The beer was nice but the food really not so much. The wings are small and where dry. The roasted cauliflower with cheese was nice. The bacon wrapped meatloaf I tried based on another viewer and was not that impressed. The chicken sandwich which looked good was dry the fries where tasteful. I think we would definitely go back for a drink but not count on the food. The men/ waiters need to act more like they want to be there and smile be a bit social."}
{"text":"Very nice beer selection. Server was friendly and knowledgable. Our party tried several appetizers: hummus had a nice selection of vegetables, pretzels were basic, but had a nice beer cheese sauce, the mac and cheese stole the show by far - we ordered a second bowl of that. Love the openness of the space and their great patio."}
{"text":"Beer is good.  Really good even.  It gets super busy and when it does they have trouble keeping up.  Everywhere.  From the young hostess who is on her own to the overwhelmed server that takes 12 minutes to greet us, to the astoundingly long wait for the food to come out...sporadically....and bad too.  At first I thought it was just bad because it was cold, but that wasn't it.  Some things are so overly flavored or salty or something that they are nearly inedible (cauliflower app, sprouts app, hummus) while other items were so bland and tasteless (mac n cheese, Korean bimibap, soup) that I thought I lost my sense of taste halfway through the meal.  I heard they've gone through a few different chefs recently...and it shows.  The burger used to be fantastic but I think they changed it too.  And the cookie skillet is a joke.  Burnt and undercooked at the same time is hard to do.  Clearly no oversight in the kitchen.  Maybe they're just too busy for what they're trying to do back there...?  Idk but I hope they figure it out soon."}
{"text":"Cool place. Nice service! But really should take the GF off the label. I get that cross contamination is an issue at most places, let alone a brewery, but if nothing is actually gluten free then don't advertise that it is."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I love a good craft beer and this place has plenty.  I've been in quite a few times since their opening and have always been impressed with the beer and food. I brought out of town friends here when they were visiting and they were equally impressed with SBC. There is a beer for everyone's tastes and most of the servers are great at helping you find what you will like.  For the most part service has been great. The host is very pleasant and accommodating and they have a great bar staff.  We had one less than stellar experience with Elizabeth as our server. But everything else has been great and we will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Used to be a fan of the food at this place but seems they took a few things off the menu we used to enjoy. Now pretty much everything tastes like it has dill added to it. So, if you love dill and its neverending aftertaste, this is your new fave spot. . Skip the smoked wings and drive 10 mins north to Twin Peaks for some of the better smoked wings in the area. My teen said the mac and cheese is still good though so I was able to justify a 2 star."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The food was terrific. Service top notch. And the beer.....tried a sampler of 6 and the a pint. All 7 were well crafted."}
{"text":"The place looks cool inside. Menu looks good too. That's about it.  Fish and chips - fish was good. Chips were fresh and decent.  Pulled Pork sandwich - not good. It was dry and had a weird flavor to it. Did I mention it was dry? Mac n cheese - woah with the truffle oil. And the noodles look like Easy-Mac noodles.   We asked to sub out the fries that came with the sandwich. Waitress said we could sub for other sides. We chose the Mac n cheese. Bill comes with a FULL PRICED Mac n cheese along with the other items. When we bring this up she gets defensive saying she never told us we could sub. First off, don't tell me I'm wrong. Just figure out how you can make it better. And don't act like you did me a favor when you got it removed from my bill.  Not going back. That building must be catnip for terribly run restaurants. I give this place 6 months."}
{"text":"Great beers & food. 1st time here. Tried The sampler flight of six beers and loved them all! We had the walleye dinner and the roasted cauliflower and they were delicious. we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always delicious, the beer selection is great and the service is consistently strong. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing spot in Scottsdale! The service, food and beer is awesome! Happy hour has great options, we loved the tots, huge Mac n cheese, pretzels, and street tacos. The beers on tap were so good! The prices you can't beat. The fish and chips were to die for, huge portion with a ton of fries."}
{"text":"Scottsdale Beer Company has a creative menu offering a wide range of food to serve vegans and carnivores alike!  I highly recommend the quinoa salad.  Yum.  And the beer is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a great new local pub/eatery! Great food, terrific service (really nice people - owners very friendly will stop by your table to explain the beers if you ask for them to do so).  We've waited a long time for a place like this - one we could walk to and has both great food and beer!  Try the fish and chips - generous portion and not heavily battered like elsewhere!  We plan to stop by there weekly, at least for a beer and appetizers - very nice bar setting.  For dinner, try to get table outside while our weather is still comfortably cool!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food yet but the beer is awesome!!!! The triple ipa is a must try and not strong as it sounds. It's smooth and goes down easy. Be careful. Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Food was awesome and their craft beer was awesome.  This location has always been difficult for restaurants.  They come and go but this one will stay.  The inside is spacious and clean.  Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and decided to try this place. REALLY great service and the food was innovative and yummy!  Loved the fried Brussel sprouts and the dill chips. We're definitely coming back before we leave town."}
{"text":"Fried pickles were great, kept the batter minimal so they stayed light and sour. Beer was above average my favorites were definitely the black hole sun black ipa and the the jolly olly pale ale. Bring your growlers for a fill."}
{"text":"pulled pork sandwich is awesome but unfortunately I found a hair in my street taco  not sure if I want back.... so bad..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few quick happy hour beers, and was not disappointed.  Beer and service were both very good, no complaints here.  Looking forward to coming back to try some of the food, the burgers at the next table looked delicious."}
{"text":"1st time here! Love local microbrews!  Working a Texas tea double chocolate imperial stout !! Very good! Service was great ( at the bar) both girls made great choices (I asked them to choose my beer)!  The walleye fish and chips were great although seemed a little pricey. This is a new place so hopefully will pick up the atmosphere a little Will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"Back again in two weeks.  Before leaving Scottsdale for home, wanted to come back to this establishment one last time.   Same great staff, beer and burgers.    Had gone to another very well known brewery in the area, their burger just didn't come close to the fantastic burger here, thus a repeat visit.  I was surprised to find out this business has only been open since January and wish them well.     Will definitely recommend to others and be sure this brew house is on my my list to revisit."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch after reading reviews. The State 48 IPA  & Centaur Monster double IPA were both very good. Menu looked interesting and I had to try the Walleye fish and chips. Fish was very good but Fries were overdone. It has a sports bar decor but at least had some good music playing. It would have been nice if one of the big screen TVs had CNN"}
{"text":"Food allergens beware!  I have a nut allergy which by the way is extremely common these days.  Waitress had the audacity to say those are hard allergies to find food.  Been to lots of restaurants in Scottsdale and never been to a place where we could not find something we wanted!  Maybe SBC needs to figure out how to be more food allergy conscious!! Read the stats SBC something like 15 million Americans have food allergies!!!  Response to their response: Really?  Wow, most restaurants these days have gotten rid of using peanuts entirely in their restaurant because of so many people have nut allergies and rather than risk posing a health issue for someone they chose to refrain from nuts.  Oh well, McFate brewery here I come!  They always are patron friendly and the beer is even better!  Best of luck to SBC!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Caesar salad was really salty and we didn't have that great of service. We didn't like the beer that much either. We really wanted to like this place because it has a cool atmosphere, but probably won't come back."}
{"text":"A wonderful (and much needed) add to the neighborhood! Atmosphere and service were great. We sat at the bar and had a couple beers (both from their own brews and guest beers, their beer list is new daily!) all were delicious. Pub Pretzel, Cobb salad, and chicken sandwich were all great too! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place and the people who work here, starting with the owners, Doug and Tom, who always come out and check in with every table to see if everything is okay. Terry, one of the bartenders, did a great job to make sure that my mother had a great experience while she is in town.  I am also convinced the brewer, Brad, adds hops and dreams to create the magical beer served here. Couple that with melt in your mouth tacos offered on the wonderful TACO MONDAY there is no better way to start your week than at SBC!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great service, impressive food and amazing beer! Highly recommend the wings and the Easy Amber Ale!  The Pulled Pork and Mosaic American Pale Ale was the top ranking for my husband. And our kids loved everything, but especially the complimentary Popsicles!"}
{"text":"I am going to give this place 4 stars as they just opened and working out a few kinks I think. First, the atmosphere is great! Huge brew pub industrial feel w TV's etc.. Fun place to drink some beers. I had the Amber Ale which I thought was pretty good. The menu is a British pub style menu which seems kind of odd for the atmosphere.  Of course there is the Kale/quinoa salad that I swear every new restaurant has on the menu regardless of cuisine these days.  I had the chicken schnitzel sandwich which was pretty good w fries. The fries are great. Someone else had the bangers and mash which was also good. Another person had the Shepard's Pie.. Which honestly was not good. Very runny underneath the potatoes.  I definitely will go here again to drink and maybe happy hour. Oh yeah the loaded fries were awesome! The entrees are kind of pricey for what you would expect at a beer house but it's a fun place. Just not sure about the menu yet."}
{"text":"This is my new neighborhood brewery, it's never too crowded, the people are friendly and after several beers it's easy to make some introductions and strange conversation. :-)   Great place to enjoy watching the sports, they make a good bloody marry along with their new Saturday and Sunday brunch.    Hamburgers are on a pretzel bread bun and for $5 you should try out their homemade jerky. Free Wifi with outlets at the bar is perfect to act like your working during happy hour.   Oh and the beer is good too    I'll be back! This is my New chill spot."}
{"text":"Pale Ale is good. Fried pickles are ok. Beef jerky is no bueno. Pretzel is avg. Hope the make it. This space is cursed"}
{"text":"Most brew pubs get either the brew or the pub food right.  This place does both. The beers are well rounded & true to style. The food is scratch made & tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale Beer Company has only been open 2 days and the food and service were fantastic !!!!! Great new local hangout!! Didn't try the beer but it looked like they new what they were doing!"}
{"text":"Another awesome happy hour at SBC. Home made tots, awesome. Best double IPA in town!  Great place."}
{"text":"This place is a great local find. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The beer tasting flight is reasonable at 6 tasters for $10. This was a great way to taste all of the SBC Flavors. I was blown away by the food as it was delicious and they are also healthy conscious offering salads, veggies and gluten free options. I had the grilled chicken wings, which were tender and just right. The Thai sauce was my favorite. The brunch menu was ending when we got there so we only had Time for the donuts, which were phenomenal. I will be back to try out the rest of the brunch menu. brilliant job Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This post has nothing to do with the service or food.  The one star rating is for poor management and false advertising.  They are listed on Local First Arizona as a participant in the 20% off for independent business week but do not accept the coupon.  I contacted Local First Arizona and they will be removing them from the list of participants."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a craft beer and watch the game! Fish and chips were the best I've had in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great beer and even better service. They were out of wings so the manger gave us a gift card to make sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"We ordered the fried brussel sprouts from their happy hour menu and were unpleasantly surprised they were NOT vegetarian, despite what the menu said. The happy hour just names what is half off so it just said 'brussel sprouts\" with no description of what was in it. At a quick glance we opened the full menu to see it said brussell sprouts with a 'V' next to it (which they explain at the top of the menu is VEGETARIAN) and ordered it. We were eating it than I got to the middle and say chopped bacon. We told the waitress we thought these were vegetarian and she smiled and laughed and said no. As I explained my husband is vegetarian for religious purposes and we are shocked to find meat in these vegetables, she just laughed again and said nope they are not vegetarian sorry. We were disgusted and didnt say much after that. I said I wanted the bill and she charged us for it. My husband said politely, we are not going to pay for the appetizer and she looked dumb founded as to why not. She said she had to speak to her manager about that. She came back and said they took it off. Im happy they took off the appetizer but really disappointed that she didnt take the matter seriously...at all. We are really nice people but im afraid if it were anyone else who was vegetarian for religious beliefs and they ate something off the menu that is claimed to be vegetarian and it is NOT, this restaurant could have a major lawsuit on their hands. My suggestion to this company is to change your menu so it is clear and concise before you get in serious trouble.  I have posted the menu and if you see brussell sprouts it has a red \"V\" next to it, now on the very top right of that menu and can see it says V means VEGETARIAN, NOT, modified to be vegetarian."}
{"text":"Excellent  service, attentive staff, charming bartenders with a personality! Baseball fans, great spot for spring training post / pre game must. Delicious crafted beers, highly recommend  the vanilla porter! Meat loaf kills what culinary  dropout offers. The two girls behind the bar are awesome,  super fun, and have great recommendations, they do their homework! Thanks Kersten, Deanna, & Doug !  Only negatives:  Really slow on food coming out on first trip, but Doug [manager] handled it professionally and promptly. I've been back several  times since, and will continue to. Haven't had an ossue with long waiting since."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, I really enjoyed my overall experience. We had the pickle chips, which were the best that I've ever had. The beer was about par, nothing too outstanding in either direction. Their wheat beer was good, and the pale ale was by far my favorite. You really can't go wrong with any of their beers. The food was also phenomenal, but I was a little disappointed in that I ordered sweet potato fries and they accidentally sent chips instead. I could have spoken up but they were pretty busy and our server was not around too often (not that we were neglected by any means). Overall, it was a great experience and I will be back next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Great place, staff and beer.  Burgers are a solid choice, as is fish and chips.  Spicy wings used to be the best in town, but they've changed the recipe recently and no longer stand out from the crowd.  Beers are brewed on site and are very well done.  Service is consistently very good, with plenty of staff to take care of you."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this brewery. The quality and variety of the beer was good. Thanks for brewing plenty of non hoppy options. The menu was diverse and hard to choose just one, so we ordered multiple and all the food was delicious. I liked the fried pickles the best and my boyfriend liked the steak tacos the best. Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there about a week ago. Tried a few different beers, which were good. Surprisingly the food was really good, more than we expected from a bar. We had the pretzels and grilled meatloaf, gravy was excellent. Also had the mac and cheese with chicken, delicious. Our server was pleasant. Only complaint was that it took a little while for the food to come out, but it was hot and tasty!"}
{"text":"A very welcome addition to Central Scottsdale, Scottsdale Beer Company so far has proven to be awesome!  I've been there twice since their soft opening on January 3, and I must say I am very impressed.  To put it this way, with independent restaurants that have no existing brand or footprint to have as support, it is up to the owner/developer to create something that works, and that won't fall victim to the statistic of the ever-so-prevalent failed restaurants/bars.    I think the owners/developers of Scottsdale Beer Company have it right, and I wish them much success.    When trying out new restaurants over the years, I can tell that sometimes it takes a good amount of time for many places to smooth out the wrinkles and overcome the glitches that can inevitably happen with a new operation.  Well, after these two visits, my experience was absolutely stellar from start to finish.  I have no criticism whatsoever!   Overall, I found Scottsdale Beer Company to...  ...have excellent, attentive service from every employee encountered.  And it wasn't just solid service - everyone went above and beyond to see that the food, drinks, and overall experience was top notch.  You could tell that not only did they hire the right people, that they must have been well-trained to really care about their customers.  ...have very tasty food!  The fish and chips were amazing, the blackened fish sandwich scrumptious, and the desserts very good.  My friends seemed to really enjoy their selections too.  Extra points for very nice presentation too, with nice dinnerware, etc.  ...good beer!  Granted, their brewery is not at full speed ahead yet, but their guest beers were really nice choices for all tastes.  In most bars around the area, it seems IPAs predominate the \"craft beer\" taps.  Nothing against IPAs, but they are not my personal favorites.  I tend to gravitate toward Belgian-style beers, porters, stouts, bocks, etc.  In their guest beer list (which changes daily), they had a really nice Belgian quad and Russian imperial porter, both of which were top notch.  ...a really nice atmosphere.  It is apparent from all the TVs throughout, that this would be a great place to watch a game.  Additionally, even if it were packed, there is enough spaced to where it wouldn't feel crowded.  The decor has clean lines and feels urban and industrial, which I like.  There was even an artist there chalking up nice designs on their really large chalkboards.  Nice music in the background, but just at the right volume to where everyone can still hear each other.  On nice 75 degree days like today, I would guess the \"garage door\" style windows they had lining one wall to the outdoor patio could really make the place have an amazing open, airy feel to take advantage of the great Scottsdale weather.  ...was impeccably clean.  Granted, it is brand new, but sometimes that doesn't mean anything to some restaurants.  The bathrooms were super clean, as well as everywhere else.  Bottom line, it is not only apparent that the owners here seem to really care about hopefully turning this place into a cash cow success, but they also really seem to care about delivering a fantastic experience to their patrons on all levels (which is the key to that cash cow success!).  I hope that they can keep consistency, and that many subsequent reviews from other Yelpers can exclaim about a great time as well!  Best wishes to Scottsdale Beer Company.  I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Great last meal in Scottsdale.  Went with appetizers and an ale and ipa. Liked everything. Server was very friendly! Will be back to try their burger!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit here and still unimpressed with the beer. The selections were uninspiring and lacked the crisp freshness of being produced on site. You need to hire a real brewmaster to develop something of a higher quality.  The food is good. Their menu has all you need to choose from in a local brewery. I personally liked the meatloaf and everything else I have tried so far. The kitchen staff know what's going on. Quality ingredients prepared by people who care.  For a place that tries to capitalize on the Snottsdale name, they should elevate their game. Great friendly staff and food, but the beer is simply meh."}
{"text":"3 stars for now.... Their beers concentrate on the light end but they do have some unusual guest taps. Menu looks delicious but I didn't try anything. I just checked it out. Seems to cater to the golf crowd. Easy access at the Pima Crossing light on Shea. Easier access than those women's jeans in the 70's that zipped back to front.  Fair pricing on the beers! Informative and good service, happy hour deals. I might give it another try sometime soon but for now nothing bad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The patio is dog friendly, food is awesome and they have great happy hour deals!"}
{"text":"Good service and very friendly. Beer was good however they screwed up the order. They fixed it however it did take a while to get the right food back out. I would go back and try them again. Things happen I know!!!  Also Portions were very small for a salad bowl about 1\" deep and 9\" wide 15$ lol I was still super hungry! But whatever. Flavor was good. Again portion was really weak. Even my wife is like that's it lol! I told her they must of thought I needed to loose weight!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, beer was fine, facility was nice and very clean.  But just nothing really stood out enough (great or terrible) that I'll go out of my way to come back.  The extra chair in the ladies room looked super comfy, so I did sit for a moment or two for a sip of my beer...  Fellow yelpers, gimme recommendations and force me to come back!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Fort Worth, TX where we have been spoiled with great food and fantastic craft beer.  Scottsdale Beer Company was right up there with the best of the best.  They have a wide selection of great beer of their own and also some quality outside brews.  The food - wow!  We had the poutine, Brussels sprouts, fried pickles, and mac and cheese.  Oh my gosh, that was the best mac and cheese I've ever had.  Between four of us we were unable to finish, but every bite was heaven.  We also had the chocolate texas tea cake and peach cobbler for dessert.  Our servers were SUPER friendly and made the experience that much better.  They are genuinely nice, good people.  The environment is very relaxed.  It wasn't too busy on a Sunday night but I imagine when it is busy it still isn't overwhelming.  There were TVs around to watch the games and booths were comfortable.  We are already planning on spending some quality time at Scottsdale Beer Company when we next visit AZ in the summer!"}
{"text":"This has quickly become our go-to spot.  Some of the best IPAs I've ever tasted, and the prices are cheaper than anywhere else around.  Then there is the food. I have yet to find anything on the menu that wasn't insanely delicious. It becomes a struggle deciding if you should save room for one last pint, or any of the amazing food selections available."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the beer but whenever I know I'll be in the are I for sure always stop in to get the growler filled. The vibe always seems to be happening at least the two times I've been in. I'm glad the craft beer scene is taking off in the valley there is nothing better than local brew."}
{"text":"SBC is my favorite hangout in Scottsdale! So many pluses with this place...food, drinks, atmosphere, music and the list goes on. My sister and I find ourselves here at least twice week. Doug the managing partner is doing an excellent job!!!"}
{"text":"I've gone to most of the breweries in the Phoenix, Scottsdale and Metro Phoenix area and this was one of the best. I had their blackberry sour and charred broccoli bowl during happy hour.  As soon as I sat down, Alex (bartender) was courteous and suggested beers and the broccoli bowl. She had a great attitude and it went well with the place.  I got there as happy hour started and soon it got crowded but service was still great. Good job Alex and crew, I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Very good food with a unique spin on traditional favorites.   Had the burger,  cheese n mac with pork belly and pulled pork in our group.   All very good.  Potato salad but a favorite for traditional potato salad lovers.   Pork belly salty but it's supposed to be!   They have Popsicles and otter pops by door for free.   Good for kids and those who are waiting.   Good beer too.   Noisy"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have some good beer. The food was also pretty good. Sit outside and watch the crowd or catch the sports on many TV's I had the \"east coat ipa\" good flavor and aroma. A place to come back and try a few more beers"}
{"text":"Doug and his team helped us pull off an AMAZING beer dinner as a surprise birthday party. We selected items from the menu, which Terry paired so well with the available beers. We were lucky enough to be seated in the brewhouse and our intimate party of 12 could hear all about the beer and food, as well as hear each other talk! The beers here are amazing as well.Looking forward to tasting new food from the new Exec chef.  Thanks again Doug & Terry!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and I love the staff! I'm not a huge beer drinker, but the ones I've tried I really like and they have a full bar as well. We will definitely be back a lot! Kids love the kids menu as well!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is always really tasty and the beer is always cold. I have been going here for over a year and have only had one bad experience, the server was less than stellar. Many people have joined me here and all have also had great experiences. I would definitely suggest splitting main courses, they are large portions and are easily split between two people.   PLUS taco MONDAY is the best. $2 delicious tacos for the win."}
{"text":"Beer good and cold. Typically pretentious douchebag craft beer joint. If your as sick of IPAs as I am, don't waste your time. Food menu typical sports bar crap, reasonable prices, food not too good. I'll pass. You should as well."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Portions are huge and food is well prepared. A bit on the noisy side at times. Beer and wine selection are ample. Fried brussel sprouts are amazing. Burgers and salads are great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bar tender was awesome! Very attentive, friendly, and gave great recommendations for beers to try."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try out the local flavor. The street tacos were delicious and the local IPA'S were smooth. The only complaint I have is that they didn't have a wider variety of IPA'S, but what they do have on tap are worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out, great atmosphere.  I like some of the beers but not all of them.  The texas tea is the best and the vanilla porter is good too.  The happy hour is a little lame with only $1 off appetizers and the selection of appetizers could use a little help.  The hummus is awful, no taste.  The mac and cheese side/dish is outstanding."}
{"text":"Awesome Service!! Our server was perfect and we enjoyed her company, prompt, on top of what we needed, helpful with suggestions....made our experience a perfect lunch. 2 if us had the Walleye....Fish & Chips.... Fantastic!! 1 had a burger, enjoyed it! Serve a ton of food so you won't walk out hungry. Great location, inside/outside seating.  So many terrific Restaurants in this area, make this one a plan!!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here today and the place only had 3 diners during this time period. The restaurant has a great local neighborhood feeling and we were glad we got there before Happy Hour started.  The menu isn't big and overwhelming, it's just right and our very nice server Liz gave us a great rundown of every menu item. She highly recommended the street tacos but we were craving chicken wings and sliders and that's what we ordered.   So we ordered the Cowboy sliders (3 beef sliders) with fries and the Triple Cooked Chicken Wings with BBQ sauce. All the food came out at once as we were sharing the plates family style.  The wings looked fresh and the BBQ sauce was evenly spread, the sliders looked dry and didn't look like anything special. The wings were tripled cooked meaning they were fried, grilled and sauced. We had never heard of this and were convinced this would be the dish that could of been an epic fail. It turned out to be just the opposite.  OMG, we had yet discovered a wings place and this order was amazing. It was a healthy amount of wings to share, had a nice ranch dressing on the side and a small portion of carrots and celery. The taste of the wings were incredible. The dish was served hot and with just enough BBQ sauce on the wings. These wings were finger licking good. We could of devoured 2 orders if we were here to hang out and watch some games. One word...YUM  As far as the sliders were concerned, this totally missed the mark. As I suspected they looked dry and had no taste to them even though they had a little piece of cheese and some baby onion rings on the sliders. One word...PASS on this.  We probably should of had the street tacos...next time  Overall server was polite, the bathrooms and restaurant were clean and for a meal under $30 it was worth the drive out from Fountain Hills to try a new place. We will def be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to watch the Cubs playoff game as we were out of towners from Chicago.  We were pleasantly surprised to see the game on when we arrived, and we sat at the large bar.  We had the SCO hefeweizen (delish) and a guest Maple Porter and Campfire Stout.  This place has awesome beers!!! To boot, the pretzel and cheese was amazing, and they had the best fried pickles I've ever had--super thin cut slices with a light and refreshing cucumber ranch.  Just what we needed while watching the game!!  We will recommend to all our family and friends when in town."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! We drive all the way from downtown Chandler to come here & love it! The atmosphere, service, beer, and food are always awesome! We've never had a bad beer or a bad meal! I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, after going to college in the North West where breweries are huge.  I have to admit I had my doubts because the standard was set with Ten Barrel Brewery in Boise, Id.  But Scottsdale Brewing just became my new standard.  The food was amazing, great burger, fish and chips were on point, and the FRIED PICKLES is a must if you come here!  If I didn't have to study I would have grabbed an IPA, but all more the reason for me to come back after finals!  On a Final note the staff was super attentive and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer.  Many choices on menu. Eaten here several times and food is very good"}
{"text":"Just walked in and felt comfortable. Nice music, ambience and attentive staff. Ordered a few samples of beers and settled in with Puppybird American Pale Ale.   Appetizers were delicious - soft pretzel and house made beef jerky. I was going to be good with a beer gut buster salad, but a burger walked by and I couldn't resist!  Our group had NE Clam Chowder, Roasted Cauliflower and of course, a most delicious juicy burger!!!!  If you are fortunate enough to meet the owner - Doug - you'll know why this place will be a success!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times, the first two trips sucked service wise. my friend and I sat at the bar the first two times, we had Shaylynn who couldn't stop talking about herself and the Coco who pretty much ignored us, kind of like going to Home Depot. I swore I wouldn't go back but got dragged in by my friend. trip three was awesome! understand this, the beer selection and food kicks ass, the service sucks, at least from a personality stand point. We sat at a table and had Kelly, what a delight! she truly cared about our experience, smiled the whole time, danced at our table..... all the things the bartenders don't do. We'll go back now!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the food/appetizers. I've tried a little bit of everything and it has all been good. The service has been awesome, never waiting long at all. Great atmosphere too.  ...and to top it off... 64oz Growler refills for $11... the brews are insanely good. The dunkle I had recently has been my favorite so far."}
{"text":"Cool place....we're big fans of Fate Brewing just down the street, but came into SBC since they're open later.  Cool atmosphere, lots of space, though a bit tucked away off the road and hard to spot.    I tried two of their beers - their porter and a stout.  Both were very good, had lots of flavor and despite the stout being pretty strong, it didn't taste that way.  Soft pretzels were good (though Fate still takes the prize), and my wife enjoyed her hummus plate.  Friendly service as well.    I'd definitely return - seems they're off to a great start."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place several times...always busy, so we decided to try it out. Their Texas Tea Double Chocolate Stout is very good...the fried pickles were on point...and I can honestly say they make the BEST burger I've ever had!! The service was great, and the patio was perfect on a sunny day. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout yesterday for dinner so I won't discuss atmosphere, alcohol or service; I'll update my review when we hit this place for happy hour, which after last night we definitely plan to do.  The food alone deserves four stars.  I had possibly the best meatloaf I've ever had and my dining companion had mac and cheese that was rich and flavorful, even after sitting for the trip home."}
{"text":"I've been through here a few times; each time it's okay.  Not the best brewery in town, but certainly decent.  What I do LOVE is their citrus, beet, goat cheese, and arugula salad.  Delicious!!  IPAs on tap are usually good; service can be a bit lacking at times.  Overall, good spot for elevated bar food and craft beer."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and staff. Beers were mostly a bit hoppy for my taste, but like most micro-brews, they'll be rotating flavors. I was there just before closing last night (Friday) and was a little surprised there weren't more people there, but it is new. Definitely a place I'll be visiting again :)"}
{"text":"Came here for first time tonight.  Had awesome waitress named Melissa.   The ranch potato chips were really good and so was the homemade potato salad.  Had the ham and cheese sandwich.  It was also very good"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Hubby had the grilled meatloaf and I had the bison burger. Both delicious and the beers were great."}
{"text":"Tried this place while visiting Scottsdale in April. Great food and beer. Will come again next time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"First time.  Expected more beer selections.  Just tried the soup.  Ok.  One visit isn't enough to judge.  Surprisingly busy on a Saturday noon.  Including families with kids.  I will return to get a better assessment.  For now OHSO in north  Scottsdale is the better bet for wide craft beer selection and food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Actually went in before they were officially open.  I didn't know that, but upon entering, I was told that it was a private pre-opening event, YET they still invited me in, and gave me a free beer to try.  And even had a chance to chat with the owner, Douglas.  Once I told him I was an IPA fan, he gave me a sample of their triple IPA, (from the back).  Keep in mind, that I wasn't even supposed to be there.  So, on top of being very welcoming, the beer is GREAT!.    Went in a few days later with the misses, and enjoyed a great beer and pretzels.  Again, very good and tasty.  I just love the layout, the beer, and they type of food on the menu is my type of food.  I expect to be back often the try the rest of the menu, and based on my initial experience, this is a great addition to the craft beer scene, and its in a super location.  An another plus for the female side, yes they have a few TV's, but they are not trying to be a sports bar, so you will not get overwhelmed with the sights and sounds of dozens of TV's.  So if you looking for a good locals hangout, with good craft beer and food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Just had a four top near the Bar.. was Perfect! Great Food.... Street Tacos, Fish/chips/ etc// A little noisy... Chef came by the Table along with the Manager.... Just need to add some Domestic Beers on Tap.. We will return....GREAT Food and give it a try~!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!!! Great beer, good food, and awesome bartenders. Shaylyn has always been working when we have stopped in and she takes great care of us! She is super friendly and always welcomes us with a big smile :) She suggested one of the wraps on the menu, it was so good we get it every time now!"}
{"text":"As a supporter of Craft Arizona Brewing, we were excited to try Scottsdale Beer Company for the first time on Friday 2-27.  When Uber dropped us off,  we noted at least 20 people waiting outside for a table.  The hostess was friendly and provided a 30 minute estimated wait time.  We weren't deterred, but it did take a long time to get a beer to enjoy while we awaited seating.  Perhaps it was just timing, but the bar staff were in the weeds until well after Happy Hour was over.  A very nice couple offered us their spots at the bar and we ordered the SBC version of Poutine.  It was a little salty, but still quite good.  My hubby and I split a Schnitzel Chicken sandwich which I would order again in a heartbeat.  We absolutely did not care for the Mac N Cheese, which tasted like pickle juice was added??  Some of the beers on the website/menu were not available, but the 48 State IPA was a pleasant pint.  We were nearly done with our dinner when the \"buzzer\" went off to seat us at a table - 55 minutes later.  The staff really can't control the turnover for tables, but hopefully they will get their Friday night routine down soon.  Good Experience & we will be happy to return to Scottsdale Beer Company."}
{"text":"Even though it was really busy on a Friday night,  we only had to wait 15 min or so for a table, which was nice. The patio was a really nice place to sit since the weather was great and it's still covered.   As for the food... the chipotle chicken salad was pretty good,  but just lacked something.. color, a little taste, as you can see in the pic.  As for the Brussels sprouts...wow! They were rich and full of flavor! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after reading a bunch of positive reviews on Yelp. We started with the warm pub pretzels which were very tasty and gave us high hopes for the rest of the menu.     Next came the half order of mac and cheese.. Not our cup of tea.. Our 3 year old spit it out instantly, ironically the only person at the table that enjoyed it was out 1 year old, but seeing how he also eat play-doh I wouldn't read to high into that.    My wife and I each ordered a different sandwich. She the grilled chicken and myself the pulled pork. The grilled chicken was flavorful, but too flavorful. Really the only flavor either of us could taste was lime. My pulled pork was very good however, the fries were a different story.    I wanted to give their beers a chance so I ordered a flight of 6 different beers to try. To be honest I had a hard time even picking six as it seems most of their beers lean towards heavier beers such as ipa's and porters. Seemed odd for a warmer climate. Half the beers I tried were average to pretty good. The other half I left in the glass after tasting as they were not worth finishing."}
{"text":"Decent selection of beer here, but I'm a very big fan of the food. You get huge portions, and it tastes great.  Definitely a fan of their more edgy dishes. For once, their poutine is one of the most authentic I've had from the brown gravy to the cheese curds. The giant tater tots are a perfect marriage between loaded potato skins and tots. The house jerky is a great peppery bite. And the triple cooked wings maintain a great smoky flavor - though I do warn against chef's whim - sometimes that whim means no sauce at all!  In terms of the entrees, I appreciate them all. The burnt ends fried rice was a decent cross between Asian and southern cooking right down the middle, and the mac and cheese is very generous with plenty of customization. If you come for brunch on the weekends, the donuts have a great sugary bite and the pancakes are very hearty (with bacon cooked in too!).  I've had Nitros, stouts, and porters here, but you'll find plenty of IPAs and ales too. I was pretty happy with everything I got, and it's a good range from local breweries to in house. Selection can change in as little as a week too, which I like.  I've been to similar joints like OHSO, Fate, and Four Peaks, but I definitely believe SBC is leading the pack in terms of food. No doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. Great happy hour specials and the multiple different beers they have is amazing. The wings, fish n chips were on point. I will be back again and again. I support good local businesses."}
{"text":"Went with a large group and they did a fantastic job serving everyone.  The wings were some of the best I've had.  Fried pickles were too salty, but i think they were going for a chip-like pickle and they were novel for me.  I had a bison burger, which was difficult to eat but delicious.  Overall a great experience and I highly recommend for larger groups as they can certainly handle it."}
{"text":"We ended up here after having a horrible experience at Red Robin. They turned a bad night into a good time. They were friendly and the food and drinks were excellent. They all so accommodated my daughter's request for oranges that weren't on the menu. Thanks guys for a con good night."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  Why aren't you here?   Fun, informative,  fresh,  tasty!  Want chicken strips and standard nasty frozen food... forget this place.  This a scratch kitchen using locally sourced foods, produce and house smoked salmon,  bacon and wings.   Want fresh,  higher quality. .. come here.  Want standard fare? Go across the street to Culver's or Chili's.  Beer? House brewed Pale ale and amber currently on tap. More to come this weekend.  Ask for samples of what's coming up. Very good drinkable beers.   All in all. .. we love this place,  but if lacking a beer list or mac & cheese without a breading crust is keeping you away, well.......  All I request is popcorn cooked in bacon fat topped with crumbled bacon for a great bar munchie."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Sat. evening . Place was packed but only waited no more than 10 mins. for a party of 2. We sampled there 2 stouts and they had a porter on nitro. We are dark beer fans. I always base my visits to a brewery/restaurant that has either a stout or a porter and good reviews about there menu. My wife had her usual veggie burger that had pickled veggies to go along with her patty. The patty was very big but a little mussy. The bun tasty.  I had the Salmon BLT which was very good. My only problem is when you have a sandwich that is piled high once you remove the toothpick the sandwich falls apart. We both had fries with our sandwiches that comes in a metal bowl which was piled high.  Good beer and good enough food equals a return trip to Scottsdale Beer Co. in the future."}
{"text":"One year in and SBC checks all the boxes. I think the best thing about this place is the attention to customers and employees that the owners insist upon. They have created a staff that cares, and customers that appreciate their efforts. The food is really really great. And Brad is a tremendous Brewer.  He's not afraid to try new things on a weekly basis. These guys care. A lot. Tom, Doug, Brad, Terry, Jaz, and the entire staff get a tip of the cap from me. Here's to many more successful years."}
{"text":"First time at SBC. The staff is awesome - a waiter noticed I was cold and turned on our heater on the patio. Our server timed her visits well and didn't interrupt conversations. The food is pretty good but nothing I'd ever crave. The tots are small for sharing and the pulled pork was ok. Fries are really good! Beers pretty good too."}
{"text":"I don't think I have EVER in my life written a bad review or felt so compelled to do so.   Tonight was my dad, my mom and my first time here. I am so easy to please, having worked in the service industry for as long as I can remember...  In which I will say, our server was great. (Thanks Tyler!)  My parents and I came to watch the game and celebrate my late grandpas birthday for him. My dad was telling my mom and I a story and he opened up his arms, not knowing a waitress would be directly behind him with three beers. He almost knocked her, but didn't. She decided to throw a nasty look at him, proceeds to walk away and TURN BACK to give my father a dirty look AGAIN.   I don't know if y'all have worked in a restaurant but that stuff happens, maybe she shouldn't have made such a tight squeeze. It happens, life goes on. I'm pissed, no, actually FUMED at the disrespect. I will make sure to tell everyone I know not to support this establishment.   (She had long red hair past her behind)"}
{"text":"I brew beer and love beer! My wife and I tried 4 different beer tasters and I just wasn't impressed! The service was good! But the beer not so much! We ended up leaving and going somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff in a clean and inviting atmosphere. Food is choice. We take clients here for happy hour and they always seem to like the vibe. We own a personal training facility in the airpark and have some particular clientele. Always impressed when we take them to SBC. Thanks guys! Never a single issue ever."}
{"text":"We went on my birthday for drinks and eats (7/10). The sign at the hostess station indicated we were wait to be seated. So we waited, and waited and waited. Several of the wait staff including the blonde behind the bar saw us, but no one came to seat us. We went to Chile's across the parking lot and received excellent service and food! We were, up to this day, regulars at Scottsdale Beer Co., however nobody's food is that good that lousy service is accetable!"}
{"text":"Came in on July 3rd weekend with my fiancee.   First thing i noticed upon walking in was their huge bar. No problems for seating. Due to it being a holiday weekend. It was not that crowded. The waitresses were really prompt and were happy to answer any/all questions that arose about pricing/beer.   I did not get a chance to taste any food.. but i was able to sample some tasty beers..  Flight:  SBC Dunkelweizen .- Crisp beers. Gives you a bit of a Hefe taste.. also with the banana and Wheat flavors.. turned out to be a nice fresh beer.  Old town Brown Ale.-Caramelly and Rich and not super sweet  Gila.- ibu loviness(100). Dipa. Malty. Yum.. Really Hoppy if your in to that. Hop in your mouth! The Shea- barrel taste. Oakey flavor. Good balance. Texas tea. Thick stout. Chocolate lovers dream. Really good if in to chocolate. Room42. Ibu+ goodness. Imperial ipa. Barely aged. Hoppy goodness. 11.5%. Really. Good.  They had a special on growler glassware.. $3 for a 64oz!!! $11 for a fill.. total $14 for a 64oz craft. that was an awesome deal!!  Good service and beer. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Management is in left field!  Clueless and hired one very disrespectful bartender! Watch out for her - she may do you a favor and get you a drink!  Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"1st visit, Friday lunch.   Good nibbles: Fried pickles, roasted caulifower.  Veggie burger, nicely seasoned, flavorful & moist.  Grinder - large, meaty.  Very good in-house beers.  Nice atmosphere. Decent service"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The fried pickles and fried Brussels sprouts are excellent. We split a bison burger with a fried egg on top and homemade chips on the side. Had two of the locally brewed beers. It was all outstanding and the service was great."}
{"text":"Good but pricey unless it's happy hour and brunch. Servers are great and so is the beer. I guess it was just the price that was too high for the portion."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers. You have to give this a try. They have amazing craft beer and a full bar. The place is very well done with a classy industrial vibe. Sports on TV is always a plus, but not a focal point.   I had the beef jerky made in house and the onion soup. Yumm!!!  Wife had the grilled chicken on a pretzel bun and loved it. There many great choices, so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good Beer Good Wings, wonderful service and Fish and Chips to tempt you. Customer and puppy friendly, this spot that we were taken to by our wonderful friends that transported themselves from Indianapolis to Scottsdale.  We were amazed at the portion size as well as the flavor factor!   Hope to go back soon!  A memorable experience for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  I had the beef skewers, onion soup and meat loaf. All of it was perfect.  Beer is incredible.  IPA...STOUT. WHATEVER. All great. Deanna, the bartender, remembered what I beer ordered two weeks earlier. OK, that's easy when you work at Zipps. Not so much when you work at a brewery serving 10 house brews. Order the Texas Tea. You will thank me. That is,  if you really love beer."}
{"text":"Got the burger this time visiting. It was pretty good. Bartenders were nice, could use a bit more for beer selection though. Hope to see it improve in the future."}
{"text":"Had an hour to kill so stopped in for a drink... Service was great, beer was good and it was HH so prices were great! We didn't eat but the food looked and smelled delicious.   I got the beer flight and give it 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Walleye doesnt taste or look like walleye. Super thick breading with strong beer taste. Fish was way below par.  Good burger cooked properly. Fries are solid.  Great fresh beers and a above average bloody mary."}
{"text":"My buddy and I came here for dinner after flying in for work. I had The Burger and he had The Bison Burger. We did the house made beef jerky and fried pickles as appetizers, and each grabbed a (fantastic) beer.  Service was fast, food was cooked to order perfectly and tasted amazing. The tomatoes on The Burger were sundries, and the salt and vinegar chips it came with were house-made and glorious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place! Not a huge selection of beers but still a fun place to go. Lots of TVs to watch sports and enjoy food with friends."}
{"text":"The place is not in the party zone, therefore it will draw an older or family kind of crowd. I glanced over the menu, but it appeared that no creativity was put into the choices. One hamburger, a chicken sandwich, etc. Plus taking only a buck off beers during happy hour really does not qualify as a happy hour in my mind and they already raised the prices after a few weeks. Anyhoo, I tried the $5 Vanilla Porter beer and it was not even close to being as tasty as Brekenridge Vanilla Porter. Due to lack of choices in this part of town though, the place should stay crowded, but they need to jazz up the menu a bit and offer better discounts at prime hours to get me over there."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly casual atmosphere, and great beer. I highly recommend the meatloaf and Shepard's pie along with the cheese and pretzels."}
{"text":"Just had a great dinner with the fiancé and I.  This place is a micro brewery so instead of writing about the beer, you have to just go ahead and try it.  The thing about beer is you can't say it's good or bad, it's up to the individuals taste.  So in other words, order a cold one!!  Had a burger and the only thing I wish is that is was grilled over flames compared to flat oven.  Not complaining but the bun does get soggy from the juices in the meat since you don't have that sear.  Mandy had the fish and chips and kudos for having Walleye as the fish.  Not to heavy breaking and quite delicious fries.  So instead of going with Bud, make the trip to try their brew."}
{"text":"So. much. food. We love this place.  For dinner, lunch, brunch -- this place has it all. I will note, the brunch menu is limited, but they do have mimosas and if you have read my reviews, I love me some mimosas.  We love the service and the food here, great people, great mellow atmosphere. (we are clutzy people and have knocked many a thing off a high table while talking with our hands)  We've had a ton off the menu, latest was the mac n cheese, veggie burger, boyf had the meatloaf, warm pub pretzels, house chips.   The mac n cheese is HUGE, and great for left overs, and overs and overs. Also the veggie burger is amazing and made in house. The homemade chips are divine.   Great for date night and also--- TACO MONDAYS"}
{"text":"Good selection of beer! We had several different appetizers.. Delicious!! Definitely try the tots and beef jerky! We will definitely be back! Great little spot."}
{"text":"We walked in and it wasn't super busy on a Saturday night. I have to say I am surprised because this place was amazing! We ordered the fried pickles: I am not a fried pickles person... But they were super thin and almost like a potato chip! Highly recommend. We also got the giant rolled tator tots, bison burger, street tacos and cobbler. Everything was amaaaazing! By the way, it was our cheat day so don't judge lol"}
{"text":"The beer is consistently great. They rotate their beer selections so there is always something new to try. I love IPAs and they brew some really good ones. My husband likes all types of beer and is never disappointed.  They do growlers too.  The homemade beef jerky is outstanding! Love the fried Brussels sprouts, the street tacos are packed with delicious pork, the hummus platter is awesome, great salads and sandwiches.  The Cheese n' Mac will leave you speechless. Delish!  The service is consistently good, the atmosphere is very comfortable.  Great place to watch a game, lots of TVs and a patio with roll up garage doors. Awesome happy hour, specials, Monday - Friday 3 pm - 7 pm, Saturdays and Sundays 10 am - 7pm. They have an awesome brunch Saturday and Sunday from 10 am - 3pm.  All day Saturday and Sunday they have $5 margaritas, bloody Mary's and mimosas. They also have wine if beer is not your thing. Free Wi-Fi too.  This place is locally owned which is a must. If you haven't been here you are missing out."}
{"text":"I have frequented this pub often since its beginning. The food and beer are great, and there atleast 2 dozen TV's in this place. Truly one of my favorite places to go in Scottsdale.   I went to watch a Diamondbacks game with a friend, and figured SBC would be a great place to go since there dozens of televisions! Long story short, the owner refused to change one of the two TV's on our side of the bar because they were \"both reserved.\" The only other group on our side of the bar supposedly had one of the TV's reserved, I understand that.   However, the second TV was broadcasting the 4th quarter of a 30 point blowout in a basketball game which was also being shown on at least 10 other TV\"s. I kindly asked the owner if he could reconsider changing that 2nd TV broadcasting the blowout, in which he said \"sorry it's reserved\" and basically walked away. The dude was very rude and disrespectful, I've heard that he's an egomaniac and he sure is!  I was incredibly disappointed with this experience.I loved coming to this place but unfortunately I won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, great food, and a good beer list. The inside is well lit with a lot of natural light and there are a lot of TVs so you can watch a game from anywhere. The outside patio area has a good number of tables, and the parking lot/shopping mall it's next too wasn't too busy while we ate on Saturday at lunch.  The menu and food really stands out. My husband got the shepherds pie, which was gigantic and so good. I got the beet salad, which was so fresh, flavorful, and high quality. It wasn't big enough to make a meal of, but that's the only complaint.   Definitely recommend this spot, even if you only want food and aren't drinking."}
{"text":"Speedy service! Great customer service overall! The food has been amazing every time I've been there! The street tacos and the onion soup are amazing! If you love spicy then make sure you order the extra spicy wing sauce on the side to use on the tacos! The atmosphere is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"The beer was good. The fried pickles were AH-Mazing!!  It has a great vibe and good service. I'd stop by again if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour though some beer was included. The beer is great, perhaps the best in the Valley of the Sun: interesting flavors and plenty of hops. My wife liked her burger. I was disappointed in the Brussels sprouts IDE and the bacon and cheese tots side. I will keep returning for the beer."}
{"text":"The place to go for great beer and burgers. The beer list is always full of great options  (Texas tea is my favorite). The burger is top notch, always add egg.   High quality food, beer, and service."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a Saturday night and it was packed! Other than the long wait we were able to grab drinks at the bar which was great since they let you sample all their beers before buying! The food was very good portions and the vibe was fun! It's a dog friendly patio too!"}
{"text":"I've had a flight and while all beers I tasted were good, the one that stood out was their salsa saison! It was AMAZING! I drool just thinking about it! Sadly that was over a year ago and I haven't seen them bring it back on tap since. Please offer it again!!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Friday, there was a 20 min wait which was unexpected considering SBC had only been open for 3 weeks! However we took the wait as a good sign. After we were seated we found out why SBC is so popular: the food is fantastic! We ordered chicken wings for an appetizer, they had a wonderful grilled smoky flavor with a modest kick. Our entrees were the fish & chips and the grilled meatloaf. Both of which were fantastic! Be sure to come hungry!!  There service was good as the food runners and bussers made up for the waitress, who we had to flag down more than once. The place was busy so her lack of attention is understandable but it would've been nice if we didn't have to flag her down.  Despite that I would have given a 5 star rating were it not for my primary complaint: the temperature of the beers. SBC has a variety of wonderful craft beers which are made on site. However they are all served at the same temperature: ice cold, which is a great temperature if you're serving a mass-produced beer that doesn't have any flavor. However it's not a good temperature to serve a finally crafted beer.  We ordered the yellow monster IPA and the vanilla Porter, both of which had to sit for at least 15 minutes before the full flavor started to come out. Once the beers had warmed up they were fantastic and full of flavor but it would've been better if they were both served at approx 50-55° to start with.   The temperature of the beer is a fairly minor complaint, especially since they can always warm up. I would highly recommend checking out SBC for dinner, happy hour or just to relax and have a beverage!"}
{"text":"Decent local brewery with a limited menu selection that has some very overpriced items. We've been there twice now. First the beer - since its a brewery. There is a pretty large selection of craft beers, but I must say most of them seem to be \"trendy hipster\" type beers. A connoisseur would probably enjoy trying all the different types; I'm more of a lager guy and I really could not find a single beer that seemed light and refreshing for the hot Scottsdale weather. The waitress could only recommend a pretty hoppy and malty pilsner. We ended up taking a gamble on a beer that had quite the poetic description of its flavor profile; it was gross and we couldn't even finish a glass. There wasn't anything wrong wit the beer, some people may absolutely love it, but it wasn't for us - it was just too pungent and overwhelming. While I can appreciate the artistry of the beers they craft, this simply isn't a brewery that caters to my tastes, it's more for trendy hipster types who like fancy & esoteric brews.   The food - some of the items were quite good, but way overpriced. If I had to recommend 1 item, it would be the Bison Burger. Really good! but, again, expensive at around $15!  My girlfriend had the veggie burger and found it \"ok, nothing special\". Again, not worth the high price. The biggest disappointment was the fish 'n chips entrée - the walleye. For almost $20 I got three tiny pieces of fish, about the size of a small chicken strip and mostly just oily batter, and then a ton of soggy fries. I would definitely NOT recommend this dish - you get about $4 worth of food. I totally felt ripped off.  Overall, with a decent atmosphere and locally crafted brews, the food is good but way overpriced. If I was rich, I would be a repeat customer, otherwise I can't really think of a reason to go back - unless they discounted the Bison burger! Two people can easily spend $75 there and I bet that 50/50 chance that at least one of the entrees will be disappointing. Not good value at all."}
{"text":"I loved LOVED this place! Such a great atmosphere, A+ service, and food. Our server, Melissa, was the sweetest and most amazing server. She made our experience super enjoyable and I most definitely will come back and ask for HER! Go here and you will not be disappointed. :')"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my evening here. We stopped here first on our way to a play at the neighboring Don Bluth theater. The restaurant is pretty large and wasn't incredibility packed. I ordered the East End Amber beer and found it pretty tasty. My server recommended the Chicken Molé Tostadas. They are made up of beer brined chicken thighs braised in red molé sauce served over refried beans and topped with cheese curds and jalapeño crema. Yep - pretty amazing. Happy hour is 3-7pm and they have a discounted menu with limited items to choose from. Plus they knock off a buck on pints, well drinks and wines. A nice find for any beer lover in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"The beer was ok. We had a blonde and amber. The fried pickles were very thin and no taste. The cucumber ranch was good. Grilled chicken was juicy and the jalapeño sauce was very yummy. But the Brussel sprouts had way too much honey mustard. Good portions but not going again."}
{"text":"The best small brewery in the area! This place has it all- good brews, a full bar, delicious smoked wings, and a variety of tasty foods. I enjoy coming for Brunch (hello bottomless mimosas!) and for dinner any day of the week. Another perk is you can bring your dog and sit on the patio. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Loved this place so much! The bartenders were so fun. Shaylyn was so friendly and fun. The happy hour was unreal. Prices are gonna be kept a secret, they are that good and don't want anyone taking my new bar stool. I had the beef jerky and it was so amazing. Perfectly done. This will for sure be my new hang out no doubt."}
{"text":"Bigger kind of brewery. Lots of variety in Brews. Me and my wife stopped in for a beer and appetizers during our motorcycle ride. Got the blonde this time. Next time, it's the Hef. Their \" house jerky\" was great.  Great waitresses and nice and lively crowd. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was a really cool place - met some friends there for lunch. Lots of TVs, lots of beers on tap.  Ordered the bbison burger and got the mac-n-cheese as a side - really nice!  Need to go back for a refresher!"}
{"text":"Food and beer was great. I had the berry sour! We ordered nachos and shrimp tacos. Both had great flavor and a bit of a kick to them.   No complaints at all but just a heads up, it feels more like a restaurant with a brewery inside rather than a brewery that serves food. Still a cool place and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Was here on a Tuesday night.  The atmosphere was good yet the place was pretty empty at 8 PM. Tried 7 of there beers. All pretty good, which is rare for me to find. None were spectacular but really enjoyed the galactic IPA, the Dank Triple and the Rico's Revenge Red IPA. The grilled chicken sandwich was awesome but the fries were a let down. They could have been amazing. There method of cooking and serving is spot on but the shitty potatoes ruined it. If I could post a pic of the pile of rotten ones it would make you go WOW!!!  Coming back??  Hmmmm??   Maybe give it another chance!!!"}
{"text":"We came during the NFC Championship game, at the second half and then stayed through the first half of the AFC championship game.  The place was not crowded and we tried to sit at the bar but the TVs were too high, too small and at no angle so sitting at the bar you needed to raise your head too much and your neck gets a crick in it. We moved to a hightop table to the right where the TVs were farther away and you did not have to crane your neck up to see them.  We ordered the Asian barbecue ribs - they were a little dry, and flash fried to make them crispy. They did have a delicious crunchy fried garlic and fresh scallions on them, but the warmed over flavor could not be missed and several of them were a little too thin and dry.  The smoked buffalo wings were good, but not great. They need to cook them a little longer to render off some fat from the skin. We were at another nearby restaurant the day before and had way better wings that were both baked fried and then grilled.  The house cured and smoked ham sandwich with egg on a brioche bun was the bomb! For $13 for the sandwich including a side dish it was a bit steep given the amount of meat they gave (which was not much) however the flavors were so intense it made us almost forget the price."}
{"text":"Scottsdale Beer Company had the feel of a large chain to me.  Not necessarily in a bad why but still somehow just had that feel.  The restaurant/brewery is very large with a huge bar and tons of table seating.  The service was average and we did not have any food, but the menu did look really good.  Many of the food items looked tasty and interesting.  I wasn't as excited about the beer menu.  I mean, it looked good, just not as large of a variety as I would like to see.  I did try two, the Bandito Brown (ok) and the Texas Tea Double Chocolate Imperial Stout (good)."}
{"text":"Worst salad I have ever been served in a restaurant, Cobb salad. Said it had Alvacado black beans ect. All lettus, had to dig to find 2 pea (I kid you not) size pieces of Alvacado. Same for the beans and everything else listed. Also no flavor, was just some greens with a lousy vinaigrette and it was like $10. Beer was cold not a pint, 13oz. Other food looked good but really overpriced for the place and food compared to other comparable places."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat, drink and enjoy. The service is wonderful and it's a very relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in town! The food is amazing and so is the beer. I love how they mix up the beers they serve- you always get to try something new! The service is amazing and the staff is very friendly. We normally sit at the bar and the bartenders are knowledgeable, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Everything was perfect.  Tasty fresh salads and solid entrees at a fair price. Big open comfortable space,  great to watch sports on the multiple screens. Big mouth  pale ale was crisp and flavorful. What really made our visit special was the  service.  Melissa E. Was patient explaining the menu items and the beer and handled our special requests flawlessly . She was pleasant and professional with quick service and an awesome attitude. We will be back."}
{"text":"Don't cry for me Portlandia ... I am chillin out from the hot Arizona sun with a cold brew in hand. This brewery also has spray mists to sit under on the outdoor patio to cool off from the sun. It was mid 80's here in Scottsdale ... we need to be chillin!  I cry for you MY Portlandia ... through the long cold, snowy winter ... sending sunshine your way. Believe! Believe I will keep coolin off from the sun with a brew. I can do ... the tap list of about 15 i.e., Hefe, Stout, Session, Amber Ale, Lemon Lime Sour, Red, Barrel aged, Red IPA, Imperial IPA and more. They got a west coast tastin IPA so they got me too.  Indoors the industrial looking pub is bustling with hop heads at happy hour. Bar in center of pub hall with lots of seating spots for a meet up with your clan and chug-a-lug some pitchers ... what a good way to beat the heat!  Can not vouch for the grub, we did not fill up the tub! But a good menu with happy hour specials looks tempting. Next time!"}
{"text":"Great beer and great food.  Not only do they make a variety of great beers themselves, their guest handles and guest bottles are excellent and usually not something you will find at other pubs.   There is a good variety of food and I've tried everything and have not been disappointed.  The in house smoker makes their wings my favorite."}
{"text":"Ate here twice this week. First trip was good. Unfiltered IPA, happy hour fish tacos.   Tonight?  Veggie burger. Good fries, nasty burger. Looks good, no?  But NO. Don't order that sucker. Told our waiter it lacked only two things:  texture and flavor. He says, \"Perfect!\"  Too many great restaurants here to go back."}
{"text":"Beer is my thing... I have based vacations around brewery's. Scottsdale beer had the worst beer I have ever had. The food was fair at best, they will not allow any substitutions with there menu. They Nicke and dime you to death. They charge extra for everything excluding beer mustard. I would not recommend the food or the food."}
{"text":"I went to this brewery on Wednesday 2/4, and these are my thoughts.  As soon as you walk in, you get a cool sense of warehousey and industrial, which I liked. The bar is a wrap around bar and has ample seating. We tasted a few beers and finally settled on two we liked. The Black Hole Sun IPA is very tasty and good for those who really enjoy IPAs. My friend got the Vanilla Porter and that was also very good. They only had five of their own beers on tap, but I suspect they will have more later on. There are also guest taps of beers from around the country, so the variety is definitely there.  It was happy hour, so we decided to order a few appetizers since they were on special. The smothered fries is basically poutine. I love poutine like nobody's business, but this was slightly disappointing. It was over sauced with gravy and the cheese curds had already melted before it got to my plate. I will order it again, but ask them to use less gravy. My friend ordered the wings and got them spicy. They looked pretty tasty, but lacked the spiciness we were expecting. We also ordered the fried pickles because we both love that kind of dish. They are similar to potato chips in their size and crunchiness. The things I didn't like about the pickles is how salty they were and the thin slice of them. I prefer my fried pickles to be a little bit more...picklier.  In terms of the service, I was neither impressed or disappointed. With a larger wrap around bar, there will usually be more than one person tending. We weren't ignored when we needed something, but there wasn't a real connection with anyone. As a newer establishment, I would have also expected a manager, owner or even a brewer talking to people and asking them how they liked the place. Never once did I see someone like that conversing with the patrons.   Lastly, the crowd of people wasn't what you expected at a brewery. I am basing the clientele solely on the location and that it is in a very residential area. Lots of family and older people, but also a selection of business folks and younger people as well.  I will definitely give this place another try, maybe with a larger group of people and with different food choices, but my first experience wasn't too great."}
{"text":"Was really hoping to like this place near my house. Several restaurants have failed in this location and don't hold my hopes out for this one.  I had a flight of 5 IPA's and only found one palatable.  We ordered Mac and Cheese along with the house meatloaf. I love Mac and Cheese and this was not very good. They need to go eat at Zinc Bistro to see how it should be prepared.  When the meatloaf came out the presentation was the same as Alice Coopers Cooperstown restaurant, Mega Death Meatloaf. After trying it that's as far as it went. Meatloaf fell apart on our forks. No crustiness to the meatloaf at all. Mash potatoes and green beans were good.  For the prices being charged the food and beer just wasn't very good. Won't go back as these were supposed to be their signature dishes.  Hostess and wait staff were extreme courteous. That's the best I can say about our night. All hard surfaces and extremely loud."}
{"text":"Must stop for beer lovers  GRILLED CHICKEN SAMMY -Hearty huge chicken breast, avocado, so good! SPICY WINGS -Amazeballs  Probably the BEST brewery/restaurant I've been to - their food is ON POINT  BEER DANK - Triple IPA, WOW. Get thiss and you're done.. ECG - My favorite. Smooth tropical fruity IPA Rojito - RED IPA, decent but not for me Juice Monkey - their 2nd best IPA, hoppy  SBC Hefe - decent, drinkable, light Raspberry Lemon Sour - I had too... whoa! too sour for me :x Wholly Holy Whole Cone - interesting single hop IPA  They have tons of great IPAs but they dabble with other styles as well! Amazing food too! Check our SBC when you're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Not recommended.  I was in Scottsdale on business and had driven by this location several times so I decided to check it out.  The beer was excellent and i order wings with buffalo.   I remember the server repeating back \"Buffalo\", and the wing with bar-b-que shows up as my order.   Personally, I detest barbecue, so I know I would never order it and I remember the server repeating it back.  The server argued that is what I ordered and refused to do anything but bring buffalo on the side.  I never touch it and at least the server removed it from the bill, and then I went elsewhere because I still haven't eaten at the point.    Why not just correct the order and I would have paid for it.   Great environment, excellent custom beer, terrible customer skills."}
{"text":"This review is specifically about their food.  It isn't typical brewery/tap house fare.  All the food they offer is of higher quality, unique, fresh, and delicious.  Everything I tried during my 2 visits has been top notch.  I can't wait to return.....well my diet can, but my appetite can't.  So far I've tried:  house made chips = delicious fried pickles = amazing kids mac n cheese = eh...but my kid scarfed it down baked buffalo wings = wow french fries = very good"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Southern California and did a random google search and this place popped up. Came in with some of my classmates and I have to say this place is pretty spot on. I dove right into their beer selection. I sampled the majority the local craft beers and IPAS's they have here, and they're all great! If you're a craft beer enthusiast and you happen to be in the Scottsdale area check this place out. Ask for the top flight selection because that will give you a chance to experience the whole variety of beers. Pick one and you won't go wrong! I didn't order food but my classmates did and they were happy with what they got. I definitely will be stopping back by before I go back to cali."}
{"text":"Loud bar-restaurant, but a fun place to try new beers with a wide variety of options on the food menu."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, but seems very unorganized when clearing tables for new customers to be seated in a reasonable time during happy hour"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service was less than stellar. Waited forever on our waitress. I had asked her straight to her face to order food and she walked away.   However, the beer was excellent and the house jerky was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place as I love local breweries. I got the flight of 6 of their brews. The downshift IPA was by far their best with their brown ale after that. Their stout and hefeweizen were below par in my opinion. An important note that on multiple of the small glasses of beer there were visible lip marks from previous people. Yuck! My wife got some water and it reeked like a pool there was so much chlorine in it. We asked and they said they triple filter their water for their beer, so why not carry over to water and fountain drinks? The food was, well, bar food. It wasn't anything fancy. I had the burger and fries and my wife had the fish and chips. For the quality of food and drinks it was WAY over-priced. Wish we weren't so disappointed with our visit."}
{"text":"This place replaced the piece of my heart that was torn out when Rock Bottom Brewery closed (in the same complex).  The beer options are plentiful and you don't get that \"homemade\" taste that is prevalent in some local brewer's beer.  The owner is a great guy and very friendly.  Lots of sports on TV.  And the food is better than you'd expect from a place specializing in beer."}
{"text":"Came here me a few weeks ago on a brewery tour. The hamburger is great. The beers were alright m. It's a drive for me but I'll stop again when in the area to give the beers another try"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We tried the fried pickles, the poutine, the cheese and mac, the charred broccoli, and the skillet cookie. We were not disappointed on any count. They even had some beers that I found enjoyable, which is unusual for me."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden find off Shea! The interior is cool and you can see them brew beer. Cool garage doors that open a patio. We tried a few of their beers and some were better than others. The prices were great for happy hour on the beers and on food. The only food we tried was the street tacos but for $1 a taco on Monday why would you get anything else?! They were good and flavorful. There was a really cool bartender from Philly that we enjoyed. Would definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a beer with a friend, The beer I had was great, it was a trough good body and no harsh after taste. I am glad they had a stout as many places are becoming IPA only zones and a bit of variety is always fun.   The inside is bright and clean and open, good place to go with some friends or even some family. They have a wide menu I will try the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Food is really good....it is a micro brew house and for those who loke micro brew im sure,will love it.....however us domestic beer guys would appreciate the option...."}
{"text":"When I initially decided to try this joint, I was expecting it to be part of the Snobbsdale experience. Much to my delight, it's not some pretentious nose in the air place but rather a homey comfortable space to eat and drink.   They are always switching up their own beer selections, so that can be a bit disappointing if you find a favorite and then it disappears. But, they have a large selection (18 of their own at time of review) so you're bound to find something for you.   I don't have much experience with the food except appetizers, and strangely, my absolute fav are the fried Brussels sprouts. Only downside to them is the honey mustard, so you gotta plan ahead with your beer selection."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've eaten at Scottsdale Beer Company.... and I have to say the food has improved 100%!!!  I have to say, the wings here BLOW COMPETITION outta the water!!! And luckily, I was introduced to one of the owners.... who explained the FOUR different processes used to perfect these wings!! I actually can't wait to come back to try again!!   I'm impressed with the chefs improvements. And finding out he's an ex Binkley's Sioux chef.... no wonder. I will absolutely support this place!  Love! Love! Love!!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the north Scottsdale area! The restaurant is wide open with plenty of seating and great patio area. The place is still under construction as they just opened so you can't see into the brewery area yet, but looks very exciting! The food is very good and reasonably priced. HH is $1 off al their SBC brews (only one when I went) and $1 off snacks and apps. Definitely a place I'd recommend for a large group or a laid back date! Bonus: the management walked around a made friendly introductions. I would bump this to a 5 once they get the brewery kinks worked out."}
{"text":"What a great Taco Monday lunch! Great service. Excellent atmosphere. Amazing tacos in custom made personal sheet pan/ taco stands. Best food so far in Scottsdale. Beats the crap out of the tacos from Barrio Queen last night that were 3 times the price and awful. Beer is is cold...music good, vibe great! Sweet potato fries were tasty!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers local craft beer, in-house prepared meats, farmer fresh dishes and hardier chef crafted fair. The atmosphere is roomy and comfortable and service was friendly and efficient on my last two visits.  We started sharing a half order of the three cheddar, two ale cheese and mac with truffled parm crust. No denying this dish was tasty and layered with flavors and texture due to the delicate tasty crust bursting with truffle essence.  I came back to try the wild walleye in beer batter. It came with a very tasty fresh slaw that was heavy with celery seeds and other flavors. Nicely seasoned tarter sauce and a MOUNTAIN of hand cut fries. I got a very generous amount of meaty mild fresh tasting fish in a beer laced batter. I thought all the flavors were delicious but I think the batter was slightly off being donut like in texture and that's the reason I'm lowing the 5 stars to 4 stars because the batter was still good but not perfect. I looked at photos from other people's walleye and I do see I didn't get what they got. I do note that I feel that this is a very good restaurant to eat at and on my visit possibly due to someone new cooking or a slight slip in the recipe I got something less than what they normally serve.  I was absolutely blown away with what I ordered last time and hope to bring them back up to five stars next time."}
{"text":"Our first visit. \"Bar food\" Saturday's is a tradition for my wife and I and we thought we would give this establishment a try. We didn't know what to expect and a quick glance of the menu didn't tell us much. First the wings and an IPA for me and Chardonnay for the wife. Awesome! Smoked, grilled then quick fried. Walleye fish and chips for the wife and a great medium rare cheeseburger for me. Beer battered and crunchy fish and great fries. The beef was clearly fresh and cooked perfectly with a locally made bun. Out bartender/server \"Sam\" was delightful and attentive. I would suggest ownership tell their story either on the menu or somewhere within the establishment. Folks this place is local, supports local purveyors and prides itself on quality. About as \"un-chainey\" as you can get! Five stars and can't wait until our next visit!"}
{"text":"Just stopped here on vacation for supper.  If u like a wide variety of home crafted beers this is the place to go. The food and beer was excellent,  and the waitress we had was outstanding.  Highly recommend this place for everyone."}
{"text":"I'm not a big beer person, I come for the food. The food here is excellent and even though it's \"bar food\" it's quality. They care what they put on the plate, and it's not like going to some crappy chain like BBW or chilis. Get: Brussel sprouts, ridiculous! Hot ham & cheese w fried egg is delicious. Yes it's ham, but it's smoked in house. Even salads are very good. Everything is well done. Wings....not the best. So I would pass on those.   If you like beer, then of course you should come. Full bar as well. Plenty of tv's to watch games. Food better then OHSO, Vig, Four peaks...they don't come close."}
{"text":"Best beet salad I have ever had! I was craving a beet salad and read the reviews for a few different restaurants.  I had been here before, but had not noticed that they had a beet salad.  The review seemed very positive.  I'm so glad I tried it.  Most beet salads are actually quiet small. This salad definitely left me full.  The salad had red beets, pistachio nuts, mandarin orange slices, goat cheese and arugula. I wished it had the orange beets, but still amazing!!"}
{"text":"Best beer in town!!! Best burgers and great happy hour.  We've had almost everything on the menu and loved them all.  Two favorites are the grilled meatloaf then the jalapeño cheddar grits with home made sausage is amazing.   Staff is awesome the owners Tom and Doug are great guys and always welcome the regulars.   Brewer Brad makes the most consistent best beer I've drank in my 40 years of consuming craft beers.   We here at least once a week. Come join us you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great location and nice atmosphere. Attentive staff and good beer specials including Brewers choice. Awesome wings that are smoked, baked and grilled."}
{"text":"Long wait as there is limited seating.  Service once seated was slow.  Food options were limited, and fairly blah tasting.  Wont be back."}
{"text":"Great ambience!  Good food!  Good service!  Started with the beer pretzel.  Delicious!  My wife had the burger and it was good.  Char-grilled.  Perfectly cooked!  I had the Godfather sandwich!  Way awesome!  This place has ample TVs for game days.  We never got around to trying the beer.  Next visit we'll have a few!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok they brew their own beer, big deal right?  How's the food? Insane! Fried pickles? Whoa! Burgers? Damn!. Now it may sound weird, but I love blue cheese. Their salads and burgers with blue cheese are insane!!!! They import the cheese and it has deep blue veins. It's dank as hell. Their food is on par with their amazing beer selection. My only gripe? They won't give up the guy who gives them that amazing blue cheese! :)"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner tonight and ate the bar . The food was amazing. Had the tostados and the fried Brussels that were very good. Dani was a great bartender with lots of personality! I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Most importantly, great beer and great service.  I tried most of the beers and they were all great.  I got the pretzels for app and saugages for dinner.  Grits and sauce under sausage were amazing.  Out of towner but would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I like the beers here but the food is just okay I don't crave it. I would be back to enjoy the beers they have on tab."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food (the brussels sprouts are incredible!). Three stars for the beers. The people in our group that like IPAs were happy with the beers. The non-IPA folks weren't. The service was good - not a standout but decent. The food - our table shared a few items: fried brussels sprouts, quinoa salad, pickle chips, and the pretzel with cheese. All were great. The brussels are crave worthy.  This will go on the repeat list although half our group will stick with guest beers."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I had the Walleye Fish & Chips. The batter dipped breading was a little thick, but very good. I had a Scotch Ale with it, which was very good, smooth and fairly light. Great service."}
{"text":"Again, this year a winner. Our group comes every year and hope to get Emily who can handle large or small groups. The food is terrific, nicely priced, and with the staff that keeps things humming, you can't lose. If you have a choice, ask for Emily to be your server."}
{"text":"A very promising opening!  My parents live just down the street from this place, and boy am I glad! I had a delicious pulled pork sandwich and pumpkin pudding for desert. Can't wait until I'm 21 and can try the beer! Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. A new family favorite for sure."}
{"text":"Food was ok and service was also only ok but what was not ok is that when we asked for ranch dressing they quickly brought it out to us then....when we received the check they charged us 50 cents for the ranch. First off, charging for dressing like ranch or ketchup or bbq sauce is unacceptable but to not be told PRIOR about the charge is even more unacceptable. All other establishments do not typically charge for ranch dressing therefore good customer service would be to let your patrons know when they ask for it that it is at an extra cost so the patron can make the choice. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"This was the perfect spot to end our morning hike. They accommodated us and our canine companions on the patio with excellent service! Our waitress was so attentive and checked on us frequently as well as answered all our questions we had about the current brews. Food was absolutely amazing! I ordered the chicken sandwich and upgraded my side to the salad. My sister got this amazing juicy burger. I started to get jealous as I watched the juices seep out; although I had no regrets with my selection!! Everything was cooked perfectly- I do suggest the handmade tots as well. The whole experience was perfect. I will definitely be back to stuff my face with perfectly cooked food and cold crafted beer."}
{"text":"Absolutely great environment, food, and drinks.  We heard the food is mostly organic and local but they don't advertise it.  The blackened salmon or smoked salmon is delish! Love the Kale and Lox Salad, Bison Burger, Salmon Burger, the Bib salad, Burger, Veggie Burger, and Pulled Pork Sandwich. (Yes, we've been here a lot and love it)    Why I give them 4 stars and not a 5 are due to the things that I could pass on: the wings (smoked and grilled = weird taste), the fried pickles (batter is too thick), cheddar bacon tater tots (deceiving, really a spanish croquetta not a tater tot) The hummus and veggies is pretty good, the hummus is with white beans so it gives it a saltier taste...unique but ehhh.  Great weekend all day happy hour of $5 margs, mimosas, and bloodies.  Lots of tvs for sporting games and delicious beers!   Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ask for Sam she will take great care of you. Beer is amazing (obviously), mac & cheese was big enough for the husband and I to share. Definitely will be coming back to try more food. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Just found my new favorite hang out. This place has it all, good service, great beer selection, TVs all over the place, killer food menu, even the house music is on point. We will be visiting this place regularly."}
{"text":"We have come here a few times and really love the appetizers. The only issue I have is that they don't have many top shelf choices of alcohol instead of beer. In addition, I think they are more concerned with presentation then with flavor in their entrees. But if you want great tator tots, then they are the place to go."}
{"text":"I worked with Doug to orchestrate a surprise party for my husband. He was wonderful and detail oriented. The food and drinks were great and everyone had a wonderful time. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place with a good atmosphere. I like how you can see the brewery from almost anywhere in the restaurant. Their prices are reasonable but their menu is a little small. I would recommend this place to friend"}
{"text":"Since my last review, I have come here multiple times with my work crew for HH. They have one of the better HH in North scottsdale. A dollar off their already low price in house brews and wines and a good selection of apps. I usually get the veggie burger and it is always fantastic. But the 3-6 pm HH is still perfect for those of us that get off work a little later. Service has always been good."}
{"text":"Good beer and great service. They were able to accommodate our big group, and we were never left with an empty glass.   Only the sweet potato wedges were ordered for the table and they were good- a unique combo of sweet and spicy (pomegranate with chipotle).  Random, but the door is oddly placed. Don't park by pier one! Drive past the place and park near the gym for closer entry."}
{"text":"Love this place. Well run, great food, and fun atmosphere. I am not a beer drinker, and I love their wine list and specialty mixed drinks. The Brussels sprouts are great as is the broccoli. And the hand made potato chips and fries are way too good. I often order their soup, which changes often and is always good. Salads are also good. It is a great place to meet with friends. My favorite place to be."}
{"text":"Only had appetizers and beers. For appetizers we had the tots 3/5, jerky (5/5) French bread pizza (2/5). My husband had the vanilla Porter and the double chocolate Stout. I had the brown ale which was fine. He liked the stout quite a lot but said both were very good.  The jerky was really good.The vibe and atmosphere are very cool and staff are friendly, which is what pushes it from a three-star to a four. Definitely give it a try...we will go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by to catch the NCAA March Madness games. Good atmosphere and the outside misters are a must in the warm AZ weather. The food was good and the nice cold beer was a treat. The waiter was very attentive and managed our order for eight perfectly.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and every time I receive great service. I tried several items in the menu (meatloaf, green chile mac and cheese, kale salad, loaded sweet potato, the pretzel and more). It is definitely worth the try if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Awesome ... just go and find out.  Try out the Brussel sprouts, fish and chips  You really won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Finally something that has lasted in this location. Good menu selection as well as large beer selection. Lots of seating options. Great wings and salmon BLT as well as fried pickles. Some items may be a little over priced. Happy hour food menu is good too!"}
{"text":"I don't drink beer, but I had been wanting to take my friend who loves beer to try this place out with me! We both agreed that it was a good choice and we were glad we checked it out.  We came at like 2:30 on a Friday and there were not too many people there. We were seated quickly and I was happy to see some great veggie options on the menu for me! My friend was happy to see lots of meat options for him. And it was cool because we were seated right by the little brewery, and there are windows so we could look in. My friend ordered two beers, and he really enjoyed them. I usually don't like beer, but I had a sip and thought it tasted pretty good!  For food I ordered a quinoa burger, had fries as my side. I'd honestly say it's on my top 5 list of veggie burgers in the area..and I've had a lot! The flavor was good, very fresh, I especially liked the pickled veggies on top of it. My friend got a burger and he was very excited it came with cheese curds. He was disappointed when he got it and realized the cheese curds were melted on top, not on the side or fried. But otherwise he said it was a good burger. Prices are reasonable too. My only complaint was that the service got really slow towards the end, like took forever for us to get out check and then pay. Spent a long time there! But we enjoyed it, I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, with just the right amount of chill.   Was told that the fish and chips were one of the few that have remained on the menu since they opened, and i can see why -it was awesome with the tartar sauce and the proportions were huge. The fried pickles was a good starter. The blackened salmon BLT had just the right amount of pepper, and was great with the house made ranch chips. I love the variety and selection of beers.  The juice monkey IPA was a good mellow IPA, and the big mouth blonde wasnt bad either. Great spot."}
{"text":"Had a solid first experience at Scottsdale Beer Co. I was there on a Monday night around 9pm, so of course a pretty light crowd was on hand. Not the most exciting location or view, but conveniently located off the 101. What stood out to me was the different style of beers they offer. Off the map kind of brews! A Scottish IPA, A triple IPA, Milk stout, a strong Belgian, and an unfiltered IPA were all on tap, along with many more. Very diverse and tempting list but unfortunately I couldn't try them all! The few I had (unfiltered, Scottish, Hefe) were all well done. Next time I will venture into the food menu and try a few others. I saw and tasted enough to want to come back and maybe push the review to 5 starts depending on the food."}
{"text":"It wasn't really bad but it wasn't really great either, it was just okay.  I've been here a few times now to meet my friend who works nearby.  They've probably got one beer on tap that I can tolerate.  The food was just mediocre.  The service - one time it was really bad, one time it was good.  It's kinda like the Denny's of breweries."}
{"text":"Their beer is not spectacular, but their guest beers are fine. Food is okay. I suspect they will dial the beer brewing in over time.  13 beer selections and not one Pale Ale."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  I had the Bison burger and it was awesome.  The loaded tots and the Brussel sprouts were also great.  If I lived here I would totally frequent this place."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Len - Steal My Sunshine)  I was trying out this place On Sunday morning of last week Indulging in some tasty eats Bo Bites was hungry, all bowed and suited All crafted right for beer A comfortable 39 degrees  Now the fuzzy froth from not being there On a Sunday morning beat Inspired my singing lyrical speaks And of course you can't review if you only say What you would have tried So I didn't want to miss a crafty brew of fun  I know it's up for me (Scottsdale Beer Company) Making sure I'm not in too deep (Scottsdale Beer Company) Keeping versed and on my feet (Scottsdale Beer Company)   Scottsdale Beer Company is a nice chill spot where you can watch your sports, eat, and drink some craft brews.  We came on playoff game day and it was pretty pedestrian, but no major team alliance here; which is fine in my books I don't really care for belligerent fans!  We were happy such a craft brewery was so close to us.  Still pretty new for sure since they're working on some drinks.  I just went for a light lager since when it comes to craft brews; I'm lost haha!  For food, we ordered the fried pickles, pretzels, and for the entree I shot for the regular house burger.    The pickles I must say is the best I had around.  Lightly breaded and the pickles were solid instead of limp like most places.  The pretzels were decent; must say I didn't generally care for the beer mixed cheese thingy.  As for the burger I thought it was pretty solid; nice and juicy while the patty and bun ratio was perfect.  It was accompanied by smoked bacon, cheese curds, garlic aioli, on a challah bun.    Service was pretty good and on top of things and the ambiance still needs a pickup; needless to say still pretty new joint. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here about 10 times and each time they *almost* get it right. Almost. Every item on the menu is overpriced by about $1-$3.  We split the bacon cheddar tots appetizer which were delicious- AFTER they remade them bc the first ones were lukewarm.  We had the sloppy joe, which was meager at best. $12 and there was way more bun than sloppy joe filling.  What meat was there tasted good I think? Extremely average. Very overpriced for what it was. The rest of the items were just ok.  Unfortunately we likely won't return any time soon as it's just average and overpriced."}
{"text":"I came here the other day after swimming. I was so hungry their burger really hit the spot.  While I was swimming laps, I kept thinking about burger. I often think about food when running/exercising/hiking/swimming... As soon as I got out of the pool, I searched on burger place near the pool and this place came up on my search.  When I arrived after lunch hours, they weren't too busy and got seated nicely at comfy booth.  Just happened to be it was during happy hour and they had nice price for food and beer. TVs are throughout, it was the first day of the NFL and I enjoyed watching some games while enjoying my food.  For my burger, I added fried egg for $1.50.  Either I was really hungry or this burger is really tasty, (or could be a little of both), I quickly ate the whole thing so fast. If I were to come back when I am not hungry, not sure it will still taste as good but the time I ate, this burger really hit the spot and I was happy.  They have so many different craft beer. Not much of beer drinker here but whatever I had was just what I needed after swimming for a long time.  Friendly service, good food, good beer, plenty of TVs,.. Perfect way to spend Sunday."}
{"text":"Tacos are awesome. They have a large selection of unique beers they make themselves. The salad was mixed dark purple and greens. The service is good. Very solid brew pub."}
{"text":"Here in town for work with a colleague. We go to as many different restaurants as possible as heavy travelers, and we were thoroughly impressed. I had the bison burger, he had \"the burger.\" Service was extremely quick, appetizers were delicious, our beers were delicious, our burgers cooked exactly as ordered. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"What a great brewery! Such nice staff! Very Clean, and the IPA is out of this world! They even will sell you a awesome poney keg at a great price! Food is awesome and if you like hot wings this is the place to be! Found a new great spot in Scottsdale and definitely coming back! Sam is the absolute best if you have a chance to have her serve you!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times and each time is great. Great music, food, beer, layout, and atmosphere. I have had the Korean ribs, burger, bibimbap, charred broccoli, andouille sausage, and walleye fish and chips.all were great except the bibimbap was over salted. The beer tho"}
{"text":"My first thoughts when I walked in were \"wow this a nice big attractive place\".  The large bar is right in front and has seating and TVs all around which I like.  There are plenty of high and low tables and a nice outside patio.  With the doors rolled up you get a lot of fresh air when you're sitting inside and I love the big glass windows that look into the brewing area.  I sat at the bar and didn't see a list of beers anywhere and a lot of the taps aren't marked even if you can see that far.  The waitress rattled off the beers but c'mon a real beer geek wants to see the details on the brewer, style, abv and ibu's.  It wasn't until later in the evening when they printed up a list that I could see everything they carried including a couple that the bartender didn't mention.  I tried their pale ale and thought it was just Ok.  The flavors were a little muted and I'd love a little more citrus and pine flavor.  I ended up drinking an Avery Dugana and a Bell's Two-hearted which were great.  For happy hour my friend and I shared the hummus plate and a burger.  The white bean hummus was good but the flatbread was really tough to chew.  The burger was OK as was the mac and cheese side.  The mac and cheese would have been better if they added something like bread crumbs on top and then browned it to give it some crunch.  I'll be interested to try some of their other beers.  Arizona Wilderness and Fate Brewing down the road are doing a great job with their own creations.  It will be interesting to see if SBC can gather a following for their beers or just be another place to grab a craft beer on a rotating handle with average food."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Loved the food and the beer! Atmosphere was amazing and the staff was so overly attentive, nice, friendly and helpful. Truly no complaints and can't wait to come back.    I had the beet salad and HIGHLY recommend it. I've been craving it since I left."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: Beers great. Food needs work. We stopped by around 6 on a Saturday. I got a flight, hubby got a pint, so we had 7 beers between the two of us and every beer was delicious. It's obviously a working brewery and they want you to know it - visible fermentation was going on at least one tank, and they'd left several 50-pound bags of malt hanging out in a corner. The food sadly was another story. Hub had the fish & chips; flavor was good but everything on the tray was soggy! If you bring me battered and fried food, it'd better be crisp. I had the chicken schnitzel sandwich, which had good flavor, probably the best thing on our table food-wise, but again came with soggy fries. Boo! If they can sort out their fryers, I'll definitely bump them to 4 stars. But until then, hey folks, work on your food. Brewpub eats are more than just something to fill a hungry stomach between beers."}
{"text":"Awesome beer always. Great happy hour specials on beer food and cocktails. Come here 2-3 times a month for an afternoon bit and a great brew . Keep doing what your doing it's killer."}
{"text":"One of the best unknown breweries in Arizona. Great rotating beer options and solid food options. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Got the mac and cheese and pretzel with cheese dip and it was SO GOOD! My only complaints are that it was hard to find and the cheese dip was a little liquidy. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Loved this places! Great beer & food! We tried out the Mac n cheese and wings. Both really great with lots of flavor. They had a decent patio area as well. I recommend checking it out, Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good food. The staff are friendly and helpful. Spoke with a manager about spicy beer and he provided me with a sample of the Salsa Saison before it was available. It was delightful and had a kick of jalapeño flavor to it. Food was good too. I had the chicken schnitzel sandwich and my wife has the pork belly mac and cheese. I have since been a few times and I highly recommend their beers and food, Prost!!"}
{"text":"The food and and service was great. The walleye strips were the best. Our new go to spot."}
{"text":"You must try the fried pickles.  Ohhhhh so good!!!!  The macaroni and cheese is fantastic too. Great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Good food and beer. Came here form out of town."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in town. Chef use to operate 5 star restaurants.   Food 5+  Beer 5  Service 5+  Price 4+  Ambience 4"}
{"text":"Beer and food are okay. Have all the games on but no sound for the main sports game. Pilsner was hoppy and bitter... the bar tenders are nice and attentive. Probably wouldn't go back for food.... but for a drink yes"}
{"text":"We headed to Scottsdale Beer Company on its opening night for a friend's birthday.  We ended up having about 10 people squished into a couple of tables.  I know it was opening night, but this place definitely has room for improvement!  They didn't have a beer list.  Not on the menu.  Not written on the massive chalkboards on the wall.  Nothing.  Our waitress got a little flustered any time someone would ask about drinks.  I don't get why they didn't just write down a temporary list on one of the blank chalkboards that weren't designed yet.  This seemed odd to me.  They also didn't have most of their house brews ready yet.  It seems weird to move forward with your opening before the Beer part of your name is ready.  The food as okay.  I had the fish and chips, which is not something I typically order.  It was pretty good - I have no complaints.  My boyfriend had the vegetarian pot-pie.  I tried a couple of bites and it was pretty good as well.  It was a HUGE portion with only a little bit of crust on top.  We ended up getting a to-go container to use some of the filling as baked potato toppings the next day!    The service was slow.  Our waitress seemed to dread helping our table.  When it came time for the bill, it wasn't split, so she had difficulty remembering who ordered what. I wasn't there when the party was seated, so maybe it was their fault for not initially telling her that some people would likely want to have separate bills.    Overall, we had an okay experience.  Because of its location, I can predict that we will be back, simply because there aren't a lot of great places to grab a beer in our neighborhood.  I'm hopeful that they will work out some kinks before we head back!"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   Ahhh the incestuous life of Phoenix's restaurant industry, and we are just merely the pawns that bring our cash and lay it at the door, so another project may take place.  And today, I find myself at Scottsdale Beer Company, and even being here was not free will, but the divine intervention of the Yelp Elite.  SCOTTSDALE BEER COMPANY  Let's start at the beginning...  In 2013, partners Douglas Ledger and Tom Davidson noticed an increase in craft beer sales, estimated at $14.3 billion share value, and an open craft beer market in the Phoenix area, with less than 50 microbreweries in total.  Some of these microbrewery hot-spots include O.H.S.O., Freak'N Brewery, and other hip Yelp faves with large beer lists, like Sip, Taphouse, and Craft 64.  With these in mind, Ledger put in motion creating Scottsdale Beer Company, enlisting the help of Studio K's Kimberly Harris (the design behind Vig II, Zinc Bistro, and ShinBay), originally with Chef Donald Fawcett (Pink Pony and Salty Sow), and now Chef Justin Olsen, and my favorite, Master Brewer, Brad Williams.  So, the two seasoned businessmen saw a niche, found some solid players, made a bar, advertised on Yelp, Yelp puts out the word to Yelp Elites, Yelp Elite Brett B \"suggests\" we \"try\" Scottsdale Beer Company, and voilà, cut to me.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I've been to Scottsdale Beer Company a couple times, originally as Yelp Elite Brett B's guest.   I visited again today, and it was almost an identical experience; well, minus Brett.  Scottsdale Beer Company looks dull from Shea Blvd.  The pizazz is all in the interior. It's got flash lighting fixtures, an open industrial vibe and a full bar, and the glorious brewing tanks area.  The staff is all flash and mostly vapid; SUPER great looking, but not much depth. My bartender was Jerry, a super great guy.  Jerry gave me three samples, Big Mouth Blonde, Cannonball Pale Ale, and Pineapple Sour. I chose a full glass of the Pineapple: VERY TASTY!  During my previous visit, I shared the Mac 'n Cheese and BLT with Brett. I enjoyed both; the Mac 'n Cheese was scrumptious.  My highlight: I had the privilege of meeting the Head Brewer Brad Williams, who generously gave me the grand tour of the brewing process.  I'm am convinced that all of the depth and meaning comes from Brad. Not only is Brad the brains behind the brews, he's also most of the brawn, with help from his co-worker, Snake.  The clientele was mostly chubby beer-belly pet food salesmen, who claimed they were regulars. Their belly's definitely back up that claim.  CONCLUSION  Scottsdale Beer Company wants your money, and in exchange, they offer a flash bar, tasty beers, good food, and sexy servers.  4/5 RECOMMEND   *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: scottsdalebeercompany.com"}
{"text":"While in Scottsdale, we were looking for a brew pub and we found SBC via YELP.  We generally look for a good beer selection first, the food is secondary, as most brew pubs offer a decent burger, wings, appetizer menu.  The website boasted 18 draft beers, with some nice choices.  We ordered a 6 beer flight of IPA's, they were 5 oz tasters for $10, a very affordable price for the beer.  I generally will order flights when trying a new brewery with nothing that jumps out at me.  Four of the six beer were good, two were pretty much undrinkable.  Keep in mind all craft beer drinkers have different palates, so to each his own.  Now for the food, we ordered some appetizers, variations of veggies, fried brussel sprouts (awesome), charred broccoli (very good) and street tacos (good).  Our entries were Southwest Chicken Salad (good), Salmon BLT (good), The Godfather (good).  If visiting Scottsdale, you won't be disappointed, fairly good beer selection and food is good.  Three starts because in a city the size of Scottsdale, there are probably some really good options out there, we'll keep looking."}
{"text":"If you have more than 4 people it may be a bit of wait. Not because they are unable or unwilling to move tables around, they are just that popular. Service was really good. For the most part everyone enjoyed the beer they chose. The cheese and mac was a bit of a let down. the flavor was OK but too salty and the cheese sauce was sort of thin and runny and one of the cheeses was stringy like a pizza. One of the folks at our table had ordered the poutine and it was deemed pretty good by all who tried it.  3.4 but I wouldn't hesitate if I was that far East to stop and try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"Cool setting in here with indoor and outdoor seating. They have a beer menu that allows you to sample their beers at a price that's less than $2 each. There was a good variety of beers to choose from. My favorite was the East End Amber Ale.  The appetizers menu had a good amount of options. Entrees eaten by my party were the bison burger and the shrimp po boy. Both were delicious and well-portioned.  The establishment seems to be festive and I'm sure is pretty cool at night. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"I am home now (in Denver) and finally writing this review from last week.  Not going to lie, I am welling up with tears because I miss this place!  There are MANY new breweries in the Scottsdale area, so this place has some stiff competition right out of the gate.  Naturally, in order to make an informed assessment, my husband and I tried as many as we could in a five-day trip.  (Intentionally, leaving some for next time).  Let me just say, the Scottsdale Beer Company did NOT disappoint.  We did not have a wait the first time, and stuck just to beer.  We of course sampled 8 - with two being the hands down favorites - the Big Mouth Blonde and the Easy Rye'd Pale Ale.  GoodNESS this place does a fine beer!  The selection is vast, so you'll be hard pressed not to find something that appeals to your tastebuds.  Second visit - beers (shocking, I know) and dinner.  We were apparently a bit indecisive (and hungry) because we started with three appetizers:  Pub Pretzels (beer cheese sauce so delicious I wanted to bring it home and put it on everything from pretzels to my toothbrush); roasted peanuts (raise an eyebrow to the \"cajun spice, dried fruit, bacon - then ask yourself how you can possibly get handfuls into your mouth faster); and the overall crowd pleaser - Fried Brussel Sprouts.  Now let me tell you, I KNOW my sprouts!  I've tried everything from maple-syrup to brown-sugar-balsamic, to butter-lemon-garlic, to who knows what?  These little bundles of magic however, are unprecedented, with roasted peanuts, bacon (duh) and a light and refreshing honey-mustard sauce that literally left us wanting to drag our fingers through to clean the serving dish in a way that would have saved the dishwasher time and energy!  Pure heaven, and HOT!  Woohoo - HOT!!  On to dinner - we split the Andouille Sausages with grits and shrimp gravy.  The sausage was really delicious - although be prepared for a more-than-usual \"smokey\" taste.  The grits and gravy (that had large pieces of shrimp) were just plain to die for.  Again, high-five us for winning the clean-plate-contest on this one!  On our other visit, we had the house-made chips - oh holy crap these things are amazing!  PERFECTLY sliced and fried, and some seasoning that smacks of perfect salt-lemon-butter-heaven-delightfulness that is remarkable!!  I don't know exactly what it is, and quite frankly, don't care!  We had some leftover, and I kid you not, and brought them home (and I mean all the way home to Denver, carefully packaged and packed in my suitcase).    The service was outstanding; in fact we were quoted a time that was longer than the actual wait when we arrived.  Love that!  The establishment is well kept up, and clean.  Good for kids.  We will definitely be back, and next time, hope to enjoy the welcoming patio!"}
{"text":"Chef Justin is back!! This is NOT your ordinary bar food. So tasty, my husband said as we returned home, \"Damn, that was good!\"  Says it all. Monday tacos and Bison Burger!  You must try this place again or for the first time."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding!! The brussel sprout   appetizer was so delicious. Go during happy hour and it's cheaper! The best walleye fish and chips I've ever had. I'm from WI, where we have fish fries every Friday.  The blacken salmon sandwich was also wonderful. Our table also ordered the bison burger and that was ok compared to everything else. The waitress was average. Fun atmosphere and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Been meaning to check this place out for months, so glad I finally did!! Excellent server, friendly and knowledge about menu and questions we had. I had the vegan burger, delicious homemade patty and very generous size. My friend had chicken tenders which she said were great.  Nice patio which we're excited to bring our dog to soon!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Been twice now.  Had the beet salad both times.  Soooo good!  Had the fried pickles too.  They were great.  Really thin with a light batter.  Different than any other fried pickles I've had.  Service was great both times.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good unique craft beer at a fun environment.  Food was pretty good, but a good beer always seem to make it taste better.  Service was great.  If I'm in the area, I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Great craft beers! The atmosphere is very laid back and relaxing. Coming from a town in Oregon where micros are the only way beer is drank, I give this place two thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"Beer list is still solid. Just remember this is a brewery that focuses on beer, not sports ... you want a sports bar in this area?  Drive to Zipps or Four Peaks Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Pretty dirty. The back had a strong stink, like rotten eggs. The bathroom was gross. There was hair on the toilet seat, stuck under coats of pee?  Grime?  Worst bathroom ever. The music, terrible. The food, Gross.  The patio? Terrible dirty gross no view. There was obvious debris on the patio. The door squeaks like crazy. This place is terrible. I would kill myself if I had to work here."}
{"text":"Didn't even know this place existed till the other night but it's apparently been around a few years. Great selection of beer, very good food, good service and some most excellent fried pickles! Right off the 101 and worth a stop on the way home when you'd only be sitting in traffic otherwise. We will come again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the beer is some of the best in town. If you are a fan of beer tasting, ask for \"The Flight\"."}
{"text":"Great options for both beer flovor and sizes - everything can be ordered in a full, half or taster size. My favorite was the galactic IPA but all were good. Wings were also tasty and the location is clean and great for watching sports. Waitress was friendly and knowledgable  Even better the second time. The brunch menu is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Official opening is about a month away. However, we stopped in on Saturday for a beer and wings. Both were awesome. The menu looks great and the inside is very cool. We will definitely add this to our list of regular places."}
{"text":"really cool place and the staff was amazing. Great beer selection and the brussel sprouts are GREAT !!"}
{"text":"First and last visit for my friend and I on Saturday. We called ahead to find out if they would be airing the Kentucky Derby, which they were. We were greeted by an unfriendly hostess who did not make us feel welcome at all. We originally were going to sit at the bar, but there were only a couple spots available that had a clear view of the TVs airing the race. Odd set up with the TVs throughout the restaurant actually. When we found a table right next to the bar and made a move to sit down, we were immediately and rudely approached by a server who rushed over to tell us that if we needed to be seated we would need to go back to the hostess. I would totally understand if the place was crowded but there was an abundance of open seating and this was a bar table, not one of the dining spaces. The hostess then told us the table we had hoped to sit at was reserved for larger parties (it seated 6) and we could not sit there. Ok, I get it, but again, lots of open seating, including several tables that could seat 6 or more. So we were seated at a  table for 4 instead. Now, when I walk into a bar that has probably 20-30 TVs tuned into sporting events,  my assumption is that they know their customers are going to want to be able to watch and hear the events. The sound was on for the Kentucky Derby race itself, but then was abruptly cut off right when the race ended, before the commentators even announced the full results. When we asked our server about this, he told us that \"they try to stay away from the sports stuff\" and had to switch back to playing music. Really?  On top of this, service was slow, orders were not taken properly, and the environment was just overall a real disappointment. Would not recommend and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and great beers!! Awesome location and staff! Definitely a great lunch spot! I got the Big Mouth Blonde Ale and pulled pork and it definitely hit the spot!! We had three friends for lunch, two had one beer and one had two beers, and the plates were pulled pork, chicken sandwich, and the bison burger for about $70 plus tip! No better place to have great lunch with great friends"}
{"text":"Awesome beer and lots of IPA. I liked them all. Food was just as good. Get the broccoli bowl. Omg."}
{"text":"Was looking for something different on a Saturday night. Not a fast food fan so i searched my area on Yelp and found this gem.  I remember a co-worker mentioning the fantastic Walleye fish filet she ate here.  I was getting food to go so fish didn't seem like a great choice.  I had the BEST ham n cheese sammy I've ever had the pleasure to consume.  In house smoked ham, a fried cheese disc adorned the delicious offering. Fried egg also on top Great poutine!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Hubs and I stopped in yesterday for a snack and a beer. To our surprise they were hosting a fundraiser for the local animal shelter; that in itself is enoufh of a reason to love them! There were doggies every where, well, out on the patio. We sat at the bar and opted for 2 Bavarian Pretzels which came with a fantastic Beer/Cheese Sauce and we each started with a beer, me: Muscles from Brussels Dubbel and my husband got ???? I don't remember but it was really good! OK back to the pretzels...OMG, to die for. They are HUGE, soft, and delicious.. We are fattys and devoured both of them! Can't wait to come back, it's a cool place with a chill vibe!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love the Scottsdale Beer Company! We just came across it about a month ago and it's now our favorite place for a beer and appetizer! The fried pickles are amazing! We had the green chili pork for breakfast this morning and it was to die for! The employees are incredible! The owner is always there and comes out to talk and the Brew Master does as well! This place is so amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Earlier Yelp reviewers made the bison burger sound so irresistible that we had to give this place a try. This new pub is typical of its type with lots of TVs tuned to sports and a variety of high and low seating. It was a pleasant evening so we choose to sit on the covered patio. Of note to pet owners, the patio is dog friendly. Check in at the hostess stand then bring your dog in through the gate onto the patio.  My wife and I didn't want a heavy meal so we decided to order just one bison burger (with the fried egg) and some fried green potatoes. The burger was delicious, but once cut into halves, I found that it was structurally unsound. The innards of the burger were a bit slippery and I couldn't keep my half burger together. Despite having to resort to a knife and fork the burger was really delicious. There was a really nice balance of flavors from all the different ingredients.  Unsurprisingly, they had a great selection of in-house and craft brews. We each had one of their in-house brews and enjoyed them."}
{"text":"They don't open until 3 on most days, so we decided to eat a snack and try out some of their beer. Sitting at the bar, we were able to enjoy the open garage doors, and the great breeze. Brad delivered our Brewers Board and Buffalo Wings, and had great suggestions for brews."}
{"text":"Very good home brewed beer. The spicy wings are phenomenal. Not your typical buffalo but really good."}
{"text":"The pretzels..... are tantalizing. I dream of them. I often find myself in a daze under the spell/thought of these babies.  Everything is made from scratch! Scratch! Not frozen...but fresh!   I dig it. And you will too. I highly reccoemend giving this place a go."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best tasting food I've ever had. The fish and chips are DELICIOUS! Crispy and fresh. Fries are perfectly seasoned and also crispy. Beet salad is excellent (if you like beets), and they have pretty much a flavor of beer for every palate. Every soup I've tried there has been amazing. You can tell these people put love into what they do because all of their dishes are balanced in flavor and the portions are perfect. And the staff is helpful and attentive. Excellent food and excellent beer. Only a fool would say otherwise!"}
{"text":"This place is off the hook ! We are in town for the Good Guys Car Show and wanted a good meal . Well we got just that the meatloaf dinner was so good and then we had the Mac and cheese with bacon amazeballs .... rib eye sandwich loaded with meat ... and fish & chips was so tasty a must try !! We will be back for more while we are in town . Thank you Nicole for the great service"}
{"text":"The food was just \"meh\". Nothing really special on the menu, just typical bar fare. Quality was just ok, you can tell nothing is prepared fresh. Food seems like it could've come from a chain restaurant like Red Robin or Applebee's.   Save your money and go to Four Peaks, same prices, way better food, and way better beer."}
{"text":"Love the beer... The black hole sun IPA was my favorite and the bandito brown ale was good also"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and good food. A bit pricey, but good atmosphere  Great for drinking a craft beer and watching sports"}
{"text":"I am new to Scottsdale and live within walking distance of this place. I have eaten here about a dozen times and am quickly becoming a regular. I love the menu, the food, and the beer. Whenever I sit at the tables, the servers are always outstanding, personable, and helpful. The food arrives unbelievably quickly. I don't know how they turn out their food so fast.   I have only experienced two recurring problems here, which is why I am not giving the place five stars. First, the biggest problem with this otherwise amazing place has to do with the hostesses. Most times when I come in, nobody is at the hostess station. They seem to disappear a lot. Lines form and people are waiting even though tables are clearly available. This has happened to me multiple times. I don't know if they need to hire additional hosts/hostesses or re-engineer how they do their work, but having to hang around at the hostess station for 5 or 10 minutes is not cool.  Second, the service quality at the bar is uneven. Sometimes it is amazing, but I've noticed that there are certain bartenders who are much less attentive than others. There were several times where I have finished a beer and have had to wait quite a while for a refill. Or had to wait a long time trying to pay my bill. Let me be clear - some of the bartenders are awesome, but some not so much.   Absent the hostess station issue and the uneven quality of service at the bar, I would have given this place a (rare) 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Cool brewery with good food & beers. We came on Sat around 2pm and it was pretty crowded. We got a beer flight & overall the beers were pretty good, some better than others. We then split the smothered fries with beer cheese & the tots. Both DELICIOUS! I loveeeeeeed the fries so much I had to force myself to stop eating them."}
{"text":"Im being generous with the stars. Parking is in the back and you have to walk around to the front. The indoor/outdoor restaurant is nice and lots of open space. Its cool to see how they make their craft beer.  We decided to sit at the bar thinking we would get good service maybe talk to the bartender. He served our craft beer immediately, the food took some time to come out. We ordered the Mac n cheese and fried pickles.  Ok, so here is where we had our problem. You can tell the fried pickles came out of a jar straight into the deep frier. It wasn't coated, they were just some greesy bland, no flavor pickles. The Mac n cheese was also very bland and looked like it had a puddle of oil sitting on top. It was over priced for the quality. After we ate, usually the bartender would take your plate after you finish, but they stacked up in front of us along with our glasses of beer. The only time the bartender came around was to serve the beer, other than that he didn't acknowledge us sitting there. This other female bartender was too busy flirting with this guy sitting next to us. I'm a craft beer advocate and we thought we would give this place a try. I don't think I would be returning. Make some changes with the food and staff."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the coolest place to enjoy great beer and creative, fun food.  Consistently creative menus and always well executed.  The burger is the best I've had....ever.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Discovered their great brunch deals recently, and have since been twice. At first, they offered bottomless mimosas + entree (from a limited list) for $20. Now the deal is $14 bottomless mimosas, and your food order is separate. That's still a great deal, especially in the Valley, where it's increasingly harder to find bottomless. But once we ordered, they informed us that they limit the mimosas to 9 per person - aka, not actually bottomless. I know that seems like a lot of mimosas (and it definitely gets the job done), but they're pretty small servings and no one in our party was in a position to actually be cut off by the bartender. Just something to know in advance - that $14 will get you 9 mimosas (still a really good deal, just not exactly as advertised).   Food is good but nothing special. The Cannonball Pale is a good beer, and I'm sure their other brews are good too. If you're in the area, it's a good place to stop for a very casual and chill (and never crowded) atmosphere."}
{"text":"Shrimp po boy was good when the shrimp wasn't breaded.  The beer is OK.  The service has always been very good.  The wings are great!"}
{"text":"FIVE-DOLLARS ($5.00)!!! for a glass of ODOULS!  So let's punish my designated driver.  Let's punish non-alcohol drinking companions.  SBC shame on you!  For the safety of the public, and for groups using a designated driver....SBC should be offering FREE or less than $2 NA Beer....if you really care about people and \"honor beer\".  You should also be thinking about a less expensive \"house wine\" offer."}
{"text":"Short and sweet: terrific humus and the best fried pickles I have ever had. Only had 2 of the beers but both good. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Was invited here by a friend who said they have great wings. Usually I don't drive all the way from Gilbert to Scottsdale just for some wings, but I am glad I did. Their wings are triple tossed, fried, and grilled. Sooooo Good! Also the fries with poutine was awesome as well. Whoever thought of gravy on fries deserves a gold medal. For my entree I had Burnt Ends Fried Rice which is basically just a mess on a plate of meat, eggs, veggies, and fried rice. It sounds weird, but it is delicious. To cap it all off the beer is outstanding. I am an IPA fan and they had several on tap, which were all delicious. Overall, great food, beer, and environment. If you like beer and food you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"This is one of my current favorite sports bars! Love their beer on tap and I'm obsessed with their mac and cheese! The female bartenders are friendly and seem to remember us; one male bartender in particular needs to take a better cue from his coworkers... you cost your location a star, pal."}
{"text":"Texas Tea Stout was solid. Their IPAs are also upper echelon. The food was solid. If you're out of town, looking for a local brewery, no reason why you shouldn't try this one."}
{"text":"Saw an ad, then saw walleye so we had to go. Love the walleye and tarter sauce! Did care for the coleslaw (who puts peppers in coleslaw). Wasn't impressed with the fries, but the Onion Soup was top shelf, over the top and the best I have had since Saigon, which was a long long time ago. Next time and there will be a next time, we will share an onion soup and a walleye platter. If you trout lovers want to try a great tasting fish, get over to the Scottsdale Beer Company. I sampled a couple of their low hops beers and all of them were to \"hoppy\" for my taste. Had to ask that the music be turned down.  When will restaurants learn that customers go out for food not loud can't be heard over the music?"}
{"text":"Been here twice now; first when they just opened and again a few weeks ago. Both times I had a great experience with this place. I have been to a lot of breweries in Arizona and they are usually all one of two types: Taproom/Bar or Restaurant, Scottsdale Beer Co is much much more focused on the restaurant, it is much more of a restaurant where you would go for lunch or dinner. It has kind of a Yardhouse like vibe to it, so not overly \"Scottsdale\" by any means. All the food I've had so far has been awesome, particularly the Mac N Cheese with truffle, and you get a giant bowl of it too!  But don't get me wrong, the beers are great too, but like a lot of newer breweries, I think they are focusing on a constantly revolving tap selection rather then having flagship mainstay beers (of the three beers I've had of theirs, none are currently on tap now). This is both good and bad.  Good because you get a variety and if one day you don't like the styles, in a few weeks the selection will be different and you can find your style. The bad tho is if you find your favorite, it may not be there when you come back.  So overall, I don't think this will be a regular hangout spot, but it is definitely on my list of places to check out with family, friends or looking for a casual dinner night out."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. Had several different bartenders and they are always friendly and helpful with the menu.. Good beer, and good vibes. Reason for 4, not 5 stars is food is overpriced and nothing too special."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after work on a Friday night. We came during Happy Hour, which runs 3-7pm, and the place was packed. Fortunately, we were able to grab a booth without much of a wait. Our waiter was quick to bring water and discuss the menu. During HH, several appetizers are discounted, as well as beer/wine/well drinks. I ordered a gin and tonic and my husband ordered a rum and ginger beer. For well drinks, they were good. For our meal, we ordered three appetizers. We ordered the fried pickles, the fried green tomatoes, and the smothered fries. The fried pickles were really good! They were thin like chips and came with a cucumber ranch sauce. I would order these again. The fried green tomatoes were just okay. They were good but the breading was very thick and kept falling off the delicate tomato. If they changed the breading, using the breading they used on the fried pickles, then I'd order again. The pimento cheese sauce that came with the tomatoes was really good and I even dipped some of the fried pickles in it. The smothered fries where basically poutine. These were delicious. The gravy was thick with and nicely covered the fries. The cheese curds on top slowly melted into the gravy as we devoured the dish. No meat in the gravy but you could order sausage in addition. For dessert, we ordered the milk and cookies. YUM! The milk part was an adult milkshake - some coffee liquor in vanilla ice cream. I loved it and would order another one of these. The cookies were warm but nothing special. Overall, it was a fun HH spot and I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good craft beer spot in Scottsdale and even though they've only been open a week, they're hitting the mark.  They tapped their double IPA tonight and it was...awesome.  More to come but until then they have a solid lineup of guest taps and bottles.  Had the Elevation Arête, but they also had Avery double IPA, Santa's Little Helper, one from Lost Abbey and several others.  Go here."}
{"text":"After a disappointing visit to Cold Beer and Burgers, I realized I owed you a review as you are such a great experience. Cool decor. Love your interesting menu and Sunday happy hour and brunch. You are a gift in an area weirdly void of quality options. Good food,drinks,service. Wish you much success!"}
{"text":"Been here before, and very convenient to a favorite theatre we like to attend.  Stopped in for a quick bite before show, and Devon took good care of us!  We had our usual beer flights and they were awesome, and then had a pint of the Ben Nevis Scotch IPA while my wife chose the Centaur Monster Double IPA.  She stuck with the appetizer hummus and chips, while I chose the delicious meat loaf, with potato salad and green beans.  I've had better but filled me up and we still love this place!"}
{"text":"A great place to go on a Sunday morning where your senses are filled with sports of all kinds. The wait people are friendly & hospitable. If you happen to be in the area you gotta try their beers! The menu is definitely above par than your regular pub grub!"}
{"text":"Great beer I however sat waiting for 2 to 3 minutes before noticed that the bar and then a menu was thrown my way and another five minutes past before I was asked for a drink I would've the blonde ale and the bartender laughed and said we just ran out of it.   Disappointed but I ordered the pills or it was great then proceeded to sit with an empty glass for longer than I should and got another great beer. IPA this time.  I walked in just to check it out and realize they have great beer and the food looks good but Service could use a little tweaking I may try again"}
{"text":"Now I know why this place is packed and even on a Wednesday. This place is huge. The server was very pleasant and attentive. I had the Bison Burger with a fried egg and my wife had the Walleye fish and chips.  The fish and chips was amazing. I've heard a lot about this fish and it works just as good as the Cod. The fish was huge, take a look at my picture of it. My hamburger came on a beautiful bun.  When I picked it up to take a bite, the egg exploded and the bun kept sliding off the meat. It was a bit messy. The French fries were cooked perfectly, nice crunch and not limp like other restaurants.  We also had the Wide Mouth Blonde Alert which was very good. Don't forget happy hour from 3-7, Mon-Fri. A good time to try their own Beef Jerky which is a little spicy. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I came here after a round of golf for a burger and a beer. The burger was good, the beer was better. I had the Bandito brown per other Yelpers recommendations. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Convenient location right off 101 and Shea, near the PGA super store. Plenty of parking. I'll come back for a beer sampler."}
{"text":"Great food, great service from Melissa, our server.  Huge space, fun, casual vibe.  Lots of parking because it's in a mall. Well worh the drive from phoenix.  Best fried pickles I've ever had.  Very affordable.  Would definitely rec and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Gotta start with the beer, obviously.  The brewers here KNOW what they're doing and the home drafts are top notch.  And to top it off, the food is surprisingly good for any restaurant, let alone a brewery. Best brew pub in the area hands down."}
{"text":"Had a great experience and was treated like a valuable guest from the moment I walked in. I need WiFi and a plug and they went out of their way to find me a table with a plug, how cool.  My server Elizabeth was really nice and explained all the options and gave me some tasters which was cool!  I ended up ordering the Angus burger (see picture) which was so yummy, hot and more than I expected.  If I had to use one word to describe my burger it would be juicy.  I leave happy and full."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.   Sat at the bar.  Noticed that the bartenders on this visit  weren't as generous with the idea of giving out samples as former bartenders were.  In visits past, bartenders would OFFER samples of everything I'd ask about, as well as suggest I try samples of what they thought I'd enjoy based on what I'd told them.  I was only able to ask for two samples, and I could tell by her body language that she didn't want to.  No suggestions.  Whatever.  I don't have to spend extra for a pint of beer that I most likely won't finish half of anyway.  And forget about the $8 dessert.  I'll just get something to eat and be on my way, thanks.  Tried the Grilled chicken sandwich.  Salad or fries, or upgrade to sweet potato fries for $1.50 extra?  Fries, please.  [I've had their sweet potato fries before, and asked for their special house-made BBQ ketchup (regular corn syrup-based ketchup with their special sauce mixed in) on the side-- the fries came with ketchup all over them.  Would've been OK without the sauce.]  Ten to fifteen minutes later, my sandwich and fries arrived, and the chicken is BLACK with char.  Please re-make?  I munched on the fries as I waited.  Ten minutes later, and a new sandwich and more fries arrived.  Chicken still charred, just slightly-less.  Oh, well.  Olive oil bread was alright.  The dressing on the slaw, which topped the chicken, was too acidic.  Ate a few bites and took the rest home.  Re-heated fries (toaster oven) were very salty.  One or two more visits and then I'm done here."}
{"text":"4 stars based on service, drinks, and appetizers only... Met a couple of girlfriends there for Happy Hour yesterday. Cute, comfortable, not too noisy. Shared Stuffed Tater Tots, Fried Pickles, Street Tacos, and Mac n Cheese. All were yummy! The fried pickles were a little different than I'm used to, they were very finely cut chips that were lightly battered and fried. Not 'different' in a bad way, good different. I usually prefer the spears because of the higher pickle-to-fried ratio, these were quite yummy! Beers available - the list isn't huge but since everything on the list was made there I'm going to say it's a good sized list. I asked our waitress about the non hoppier beers and she did a great job of helping us choose and brought samples sips. Those little samples came in snifter glasses, it was awesome because you could REALLY smell the beer before you took a sip!  Might have to go back for actual food and take the hubs!!!"}
{"text":"Well I've been here a total of 5 times since its been open and I live nearly across town...that should say how good SBC really is. I always try to make a point of stopping by when I'm in the area. We recently tried their fish n chips and they were simply amazing. I still haven't found a beer that I didn't like and all the food has been great. Good job SBC!"}
{"text":"We came on a football Sunday but the place was pretty dead. We were greeted immediately by our server and we ordered the Belgian Pale Ale which was very delicious. We ordered the fried pickles, street tacos, and the smothered fries. The fried pickles are sliced thin and not heavily battered which was very refreshing. Because they were cut so thin they were still crunchy and the dipping sauce was delicious. The street tacos were out of this world. The pulled pork was a little spicy and super flavorful. The orange slice was a nice burst of flavor. The smothered fries were smothered in gravy as advertised and tasted great! Very good experience here as it was our first time and didn't know what to expect. I will say the service was very attentive but not much personality. Nothing terrible about that though. If I lived in the area I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So we've been thinking about trying this place for a while and we finally made it.  Got here a little after 7:00 p.m. on a Friday night.  We immediately found two seats at the bar, sat down and received our menus.  Pretty decent variety of beer and food. Bar staff was not inquisitive as to \"was this our first time?\", \"what do you like in a beer?\" etc.  Never got a smile from anyone.  Did we remind them of someone they'd had a bad experience with?  Ordered our beers, kale and quinoa salad and blackened salmon BLT with fries.  Everything was just mediocre.  Beer sub megiocre.  That being said, we reflected on how it could have been OK (barely) had the service been more pleasant.  Spent dishes stayed until people sat down around us and stuff was in the way.  Won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"I tried Scottsdale Beer Company for the first time last night. I'm sorry I cannot review their beer as I don't don't drink. But everyone else looked to have liked theirs. I was there for a Charity event. They had a Appetizer Buffet and we also ordered off their menu. Everything tasted delish. I especially liked the hand rolled Tater Tots ( Giants ) They bathrooms were nice, big and clean. They staff was AMAZING! It was a good restaurant overall- Give them a try!"}
{"text":"We'll be back for sure! Great atmosphere and great beers. The portion sizes are very large. The tots with truffle aioli is delish!  Hubby got the shepards pie, which we could've shared. Very tasty and stewy. I had the chicken sandwhich, which was fresh and had a sweet flavor to it.   Their beers are good too-very standard and nothing out of the ordinary yet."}
{"text":"Good beer...good food. My wife and I have been here once for lunch and once for dinner. They have some very tasty bar food that is better than the average and a good selection of beers. We loved their Pub Pretzels! I had the grinder and fries the first time, which I really enjoyed. I would not recommend the pulled pork sandwich. It did not taste freshly bbq'ed. It seemed like is was cooked somewhere else, refrigerated, and then reheated. The beers are the true test of a brew pub and theirs don't disappoint. I have had the Scottish Ale and Upshift IPA. Both are good beers that I would have again. I would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Really cool ambiance, very open and active. Our server was great, recommending great beers and food for our undecided guests. The fries were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I literally come here once a week with friends. Super good fresh and fast food and not a bad happy hour deal! We usually always get their pretzel and beer cheese( my fav), their nachos are amazing ( I do order a half size because it feeds 3 people atleast). Their Mac and cheese is pretty good and so are their Brussels sprouts. Atmosphere is cool, we usually sit outside when it's nice out."}
{"text":"My friend had the veggie burger ..seasoning was a but to salty, but the veggie burger itself was was delicious! I had the Bison burger in lettuce wrap...good size, cooked as I requested and delicious! And we both thought the French fries were wonderful, salt and all! Of course, we made great Beer selections...you will find your favorite beer too! Once again we have Straws in water and I wish they did not assume we want a straw. I am on a campaign of less plastic waste, and not using a straw is a small thing to do....less plastic waste ending up in our ocean. A positive note: music blasting by us was lowered. They did turn volume down so we're not blasted out of the place.  Outdoor seating available. Good service."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service!!  The Mac N Cheese is the best I've ever had!  My son loved his chicken fingers and fries!"}
{"text":"This place more likes sports bar. At least 15 screens. Wait staff not hard on the eyes. Neighborhood atmosphere. Quite a few regulars come in, which became obvious.  As far as the beers, of the flight I had nothing below grade 3 of 5. My favorites were the Salsa Saison & the Dubbel. Get the house potatoe chips, they're the biggest chips I've ever seen. Salted and roasty and toasty."}
{"text":"What a great find! Decided to venture out from our hotel and we were certainly glad we did. Our bartender, Valerie, was exceptional. We started our meal with the house jerky..yum. Bloody Mary was probably the best bloody I have ever had (and I've had a few).  Boyfriend was impressed by the quality of the house brewed beers. If we are ever in the area again, we will certainly return! Thank you for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Good bar food for the most part, i did have the worst Sheppard pie ever here. After several visits i have given it a average score. But this is scottsdale and the bar is pretty high."}
{"text":"Oh goodness. Great food. Great service. I'll definitely be coming back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times and we would definitely come here a lot more if we lived closer. The food is stellar. Their brunch burger is perfection. It comes with an over easy egg, melty American cheese, and perfectly crisp bacon with a maple pepper butter on top of a sweet challah bun to give the perfect sweet, savory, salty, cheesy combo. The French fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They have all day $5 margaritas, bloody Mary's, and mimosas all weekend. Their patio is a decent size and is dog friendly which is always a plus. It's a great relaxing atmosphere with a knowledgeable friendly staff. Their beers are consistently phenomenal and they have an awesome variety. There is literally nothing negative I can say about this place, that's how much I like it! If you're in the area, DEFINITELY give this place a try."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and kid friendly even though it's a beer company! Might deserve 5 stars but I'll need to actually order a beer before doing that.  I was there at lunch time and had heard they have Wikki Stix! My niece and nephew love those. I saw they have Kraft mac n cheese but i went with the chef made mac and glad I did cause it was great! And so was the warm peach cobbler with ice cream. Overall I loved the openness of the place, seeing the brewery is cool, wait staff superb. There's a lot of great things on the menu I want to try. Oh yes, we'll be back Scottsdale Beer Company! You got something great going!"}
{"text":"Update 1/2016 - TV sound is HORRIBLE. No speakers anywhere near the bar.  What speakers they do have are hidden in the high ceiling amongst ductwork). Really too bad and wrecks the experience because you can't hear/understand anything.  Need some sound baffling as well - all hard surfaces makes normal conversation hard because it's so loud.   Otherwise, decent space. Beers good depending on when you go (Right now they don't have any standard IPAs just imperial, would be nice I have an IPA).    Awesome bathrooms. Good TVs but TV layout doesn't make sense in either bar or dining rooms.  Problem: food prices. $12.25 for a quinoa salad with no meat.  Happy hour is now 10am-7pm Sat/Sun which is nice.  Food is hit and miss. I feel they're being a bit cheeky with many items having weird ingredients (Brussels with peanuts and honey mustard? Broccoli with corn nuts? Sweet potato wedges with pomegranate seeds?)"}
{"text":"Terrible service, plenty of other great places around this area, I won't waste my time again."}
{"text":"Scottsdale brewing company has mastered the craft of brewing beers to appeal to the local cliental. Their restaurant space appeals to large parties and a couple small booths. It also has a large bar to where you can just stop to have a beer after work. As for its prices, it took a risk and featured a scratch menu which is fresh but you pay for it. With a menu that's basic bar food, it's nothing that's going to turn heads. The beer and atmosphere are awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome menu and tons of great beer! The Jabrobi IPA is outstanding and do NOT miss out on the fried Brussels sprouts, they're incredible! I asked if it was possible to omit the bacon and they were very accommodating. Great staff, awesome service and an overall awesome experience! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"First time in here in last minutes before they closed last night. The place was casual with lots of TV in every turn to watch sport.   I tried beer strawberry cider something...it was light and delicious. I love to go back to try something else. PS: you get a free ice pop near the exit door and sign, \"help your self.\"   FYI, I love their woman's restroom lol..I know! this is the least comment in yelp for toilet but hey, it was a cool toilet. When you enter the door it smells flower and clean, the interior calm and I found a cozy chair in the corner. It doesn't feel like you are in a sport bar restroom...;)."}
{"text":"Oh, yes. Scottsdale Beer Company you are my new favorite. My husband and I came here on his birthday and he got a free pint. Whaaaat?!? I ordered a Hefe which was delicious and not too citrusy, it was more banana-y. The pretzel was good, and the sauce it came with. The roasted beet salad was awesome. I also enjoyed my husband's sandwich. I don't remember what kind it was, but is was good. We are looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"So my fiance doesn't drink and I very rarely drink beer (card-carrying member of the wino club here), so while we've thrown around the idea of heading to SBC for dinner for a while now, we just never got around to it.  Well, 2016 has started off as a special sort of dumpster fire and on Saturday we found ourselves NEEDING to get out of the house after being cooped up in there with about 20 fans blowing on our carpet/baseboards to counteract our water heater flooding all over the place. That's neither here nor there (and I'm sure I'll write some strongly worded Yelps regarding a few contractors...) and we found ourselves STARVING this past Saturday evening. It's just down the street, so why not? We headed down and snagged a table on the twinkle-light-adorned patio and perused the menu.  One thing I'm apt to order about 99% of the time if it's on any menu is any sort of soft pretzels/cheese/mustard situation. We decided on those as an app and they arrived to our table HOT. Awesome! The beer cheese had a very tasty and nuanced beer undertone, and the mustard was grainy and perfectly spicy.   I decided to keep my meal in the theme of health and went for a \"small\" (generous for most non-giants) portion of mac and cheese and a side salad. The mac was a cheesy mess topped with toasty Panko. It was comfort food times a million. My side salad came with, honestly? One of the best Italian dressings I've ever had. I'm stupidly picky about salad dressing and don't love most, but this was herby and dreamy. Fiance went with their special of BBQ chicken drumsticks, potato salad (the mustardy kind), baked beans and a buttermilk roll. He wasn't expecting to find some of the best BBQ chicken he'd ever had at Scottsdale Beer Company, but he did and the few bites I snagged were life-affirming. And the buttermilk roll? Get out of here. This is unfortunately a special and not on their regular menu, but if you see this dish on their specials list...GET IT.   I did decide to peruse their drink menu and got some sort of seasonal pomegranate cider. This was the perfect balance of tart (not too sweet at all!) and refreshing. All in all, SBC has shot itself up to one of our favorite spots in just one trip. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I was there for lunch with my puppy. The restaurant was extremely accommodating and made us feel very welcome. Service was prompt and friendly, and our burgers were delicious. We also ordered the fried pickles, which were lightly breaded and crispy."}
{"text":"Executive chef from Binkleys just started here July 27, 2015. Tried a smoked poblano chili & cheddar sausage with artisan pretzel stuffing, sauerkraut, lime dressed onions, & chili mayo. SO delicious!!!The East End Amber was also amazing. Doug is such a great host too! Wish this place was closer to my casa! LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Came in to try to find a nice place to watch football games for our small group of friends.  While the atmosphere beats a lot of typical sports bars, to our dismay, the food was dismal!    Don't know what has happened since the last time visiting this establishment 4-5 months ago, but the food has gone downhill and prices gone up!   Salad greens looked a good 3 days old, if not older, cole slaw equally aged (and not in a good way)  While the fish was good on the fish and chips, they charged extra for another small cup of tartar sauce.  Extremely small wine pours for the price.  The fried pickles were hardly discernible as pickles...more like some small glob of cornmeal with a dill flavor. Our first server seemed friendly enough, but was replaced by someone who acted like more of a \"manager\".  Unfortunately, she needs to learn some customer service skills.  Grumpy and not apologetic about the globs she presented as fried pickles. Will not be back. So disappointed, @ScottsdaleBeerCompany!  Update: became ill a few hours after the meal.  Either the fish or the slaw was bad."}
{"text":"Yet another great meal at SBC.     Burger, salads and and the sausage and grits.  Everything is well prepared , great ingredients, prepared with care.   Good service too.  Not too attentive and yet present.  Great ambiance too.  Why aren't more places like this?"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  We sat on the patio with misters on a Friday night, dog friendly patio.  You can see the brewers from everywhere in the restaurant and that's neat.  I got a guest brew, cranberry cider, it was sweet and tart, very good.  They have quite a few local brews on tap and the menu tells you what brews are coming next, I like that, keeps ya coming back.  I got sweet potato fries and Cajun dry rub chicken wings, they're triple cooked or something...smoked, fried, and ...I can't remember, anyways they were really delicious! My friend got street tacos and loved them, they looked really fresh.  She also got the fried pickles and they were the best fried pickles I've ever had, sliced really thin.  Homemade ranch and hatch chili aioli were both great too.  I think I'll be back, gotta take my husband to this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  We love the atmosphere, food and service.  The wings, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, sandwiches, salads, everything!  It's a great neighborhood bar/restaurant!  The patio is awesome this time of year as well."}
{"text":"Had dinner here after getting into town late.  Beer and wine was ok.  Their burger was good, but was slightly overcooked of the medium rare that was asked for.  The grilled chicken sandwich was really good and had a unique set of flavor profiles.  Both came with french fries which were cooked well.  I asked for their cucumber ranch that normally comes with one of their appetizers and it paired perfectly with their fries.   This place has a lot of TVs so it would be great for game nights.  It looked like they had good happy hour deals as well."}
{"text":"Met some friends for lunch here today.  I had the SW Turkey Salad which was very unusual with chayote squash (sliced very thinly--beautiful!), freeze dried corn, black beans, sun flower seeds, and a bit of avocado and red onion.  There was (at most) one ounce of shaved deli turkey. It was really good, but a little pricey for the amount of protein.  My friend got the chicken wings appetizer, and her husband got the bison burger which looked really good.  He also had a couple of different brews.  I liked the atmosphere--not too loud either.  My friends and I hadn't seen each other for over five years, so we spent a long time there catching up.  The waiter was cool with that which I appreciated.    Would definitely recommend this brew house!"}
{"text":"Ok I live one minute from this place and have watched it grow into my favorite local eatery! doug and Thomas are wonderful hosts and the staff makes you feel like you are part of the family! From day one the beer has been amazing! So much so that I have taken to enjoying their samplers in a way not experienced since visiting pubs in England!   For the past 2 months the food has matured from English comfort food to a fusion of English standards with Asian and middle eastern flair! The new chef Justin is a keeper! Same level of pride in crafting food as the brewmaster has in crafting beers!   This weekend the special was lamb Kofta Kabab and Blackend Okra with beets and a sriracha-mayo dipping sauce. Awesome!!!! And as my friend. From Birmingham said best lamb in Arizona! Please make it a permanent addition to the menu!"}
{"text":"Great first visit on a Friday night. Surprisingly not busy. Ordered the nachos and found it to be packed with flavor. Ordered a Hendricks Gin & Tonic and it was lacking in the Gin department. Debated sending it back, but thought otherwise. Definitely a great place to grab a beer and hang with the bros.   Recently tried to take the wife and kids and the experience was the complete opposite. For starters the hostess never sat us at our table. Let me say that again... I gave the hostess my name. Hostess proceeded to seat other patrons who all arrived AFTER us with the same party size. 5-mins turns to 10-mins. At 10-min mark I revisit hostess stand. Hostess reassures me I'm next. More patrons walk in. Those patrons are seated immediately... again, same party size. 10-mins turns to 15-min... 15-turns to 20-min. At the 20-min mark, all hope is lost and we walk out."}
{"text":"Two words --- TACO MONDAY'S! I've been a huge fan of this place recently, especially after discovering they have a taco Monday deal. So here it is, a pair of tacos (pork, chicken, fish, carne asada) for $4.00! The tacos are SO delicious and the toppings on them are unique and interesting. Chicken comes with a dry slaw and honey roasted peanut topping, pork comes with a mandarin orange, and the carne asada is bomb also. I'm not sure about the fish cause I'm just not a sea food person.   Besides the tacos, the rest of the menu is also amazing. One of our friends strayed away from the Taco Monday tradition and got a fully loaded Mac and Cheese with an EGG on it and it was absolutely bomb! I posted a picture but seriously... I wanted one too! The whole menu is wholesome, delicious, and I don't think I've ever seen anything on it that didn't have my mouth watering.   Now, about the beer though, Scottsdale Beer Company has a great beer selection to choose from including their own beers, the typical beers, and beers from other local breweries. I'm all about local Arizona brews and this place has them to offer and pair with your meal choice.   The restaurant is also clean and a nice. Once inside you meet the hostess. There are plenty of booths and high tops to choose from along with a large bar centered in the middle with plenty of chairs. With nicer weather you can also enjoy a seat on the patio to soak up the sun!  (Full disclosure: these photos really don't do the food justice - you gotta try it for yourself!)"}
{"text":"Not as good of beer selection as I expected.  Guess porters and stouts aren't popular.  Happy hour was nice, especially having it on a Sunday.  The Brussels sprouts side dish was quite good, though it was advertised with bacon and we never did see or taste any bacon.  The tater tots were also fine.  We had a pulled pork sandwich, a $9 price at Happy Hour.  It was good, but dry somewhat as it had very little BBQ sauce.  We asked for some BBQ sauce.  The bartender went to the cash register and keyed it in.  We had assumed BBQ sauce was going to be in a jar or squeeze bottle, like everywhere else.  Not here.  The bartender walked back tot he kitchen and brought us a small cup of heated BBQ sauce.  On our bill we saw we were charged 50 cents for the sauce.  That was a joke.  Why not charge for ketchup if people order french fries?  Nickel and diming customers is not the way to build loyalty, or even keep them happy.    IF we ever go there again, we will bring our own condiments.  Hopefully, Scottsdale Beer Company will not charge us for bringing them in."}
{"text":"Waited way too long for our food.  Seemed liked the waitress had forgotten to even put our order in.   The food was salty and over cooked.  Definitely unhappy with the experience and won't be returning"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish & chips, which was very good. I had asked our server, that when she brings our lunch so she wouldn't have to go back, to please bring extra lemons and tartar sauce, which she did. Everything was fine..the lunch...the service. Upon receiving our check,  we saw a 50 cent charge for the extra tartar sauce. First of all, never had we ever seen this in any restaurant no matter what the price point was AND the server has a responsibility to the patrons,  to say there will be an additional charge for the sauce and not just put it on the check.  It's only 50 cents, but that says something about the integrity of the establishment. Based on that alone, I probably will never return, which is a shame,  as we live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"They have evolved, and to some extent improved.  There are more beer choices (15 actually), and the ones I sampled were above average.  But the food is still mundane and just ok -- if you are lucky.  My last trip they managed to burn the burger I had ordered medium.  Not just well done, but literally burnt, and yet they allowed it to be served.  Drank my beer, ate my fries, got my meal comped, but this is really not why I went to Scottsdale Beer Company."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio. Autumn made out like a silent bandit. The waitress brought her water and Brad gave belly rubs. The patio was so pleasant to dine on. Our waitress was so nice and the complete crew that worked our table were ... just great people. We started with fried pickles.  Hmm we ordered another of those. I had the Brussel sprouts HOME RUN! Those are mighty tasty and such a huge portion we shared. (Table of four) I had a strange request.... and wahalah.... warm wort taster .... I'd visited heaven. I also had a side of potato salad. All four of us enjoyed our meal, and our visit. We were lucky enough to be there at a time when the wort could be scooped out. And Autumn was offered a treat at the end. I was very appreciative that the young lady asked before giving it. We had to leave the treat as our family beast is very allergic to everything. I just really appreciated everyone's hospitality.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers.  Great interior design.  I've only had the po'boy and it was fine."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. This services is always good. They have several very good beers. The Texas tea porter is unbelievable. The happy hour menu is awesome as well. Our sever Elizabeth was awesome as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to rate this place higher, but I can't find a brew that I immensely enjoy from them. I had the burger and it was just average to me.  However, I really like how big the space inside is and it's a really cool place to sit with friends. I will try to come back when I see a new tapped brew that catches my eye.  I will try an appetizer next time as well."}
{"text":"I drove by earlier today and saw this restaurant had opened...came tonight and can't wait to come back again soon! Our server Jessica was OUTSTANDING...kind, informative, just perfect! Oh, and the food and beer selections were fabulous...especially the Fish and Chips and \"Cheese 'N Mac\"! One of a kind experience...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience.  Awesome food, outstanding service.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  The beer is good, food is good and the service is good.  We came here twice on a recent visit to Scottsdale.  In a town full of burger joints, this place is a cut above.  We had the veggie burger, the regular hamburger and chicken sandwich.  The burger and chicken were done to perfection and the fries are very good.  The veggie burger was particularly good, not just a pale imitation of beef, but a unique burger that was unique and satisfying.  I highly recommend this place.  Don't forget to try the beer.  The IPA's are very good."}
{"text":"We live in Fountain Hills and there is not a lot of great places to eat . We LOVE this place we try something new every time we go.  We love Sam she has has an awesome personality and always makes us feel at home. The food is amazing thank you Chef!! Some times we go twice a week for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This has become a convenient and welcome spot for a drink after work (or as a dining destination, if you are so inclined). The beer selection changes regularly but features the in-house craft beers along with a variety of guest taps. I've backed away from the in-your-face hops-forward styles as I've grown older, and tend to go with ambers or less aggressive session lagers. But this place features a wide enough selection to fit nearly any beer palate.  Let's talk about the food. The wings are quite decent... and especially savory since they are smoked. They feature beef jerky on the menu (strangely, with crème fraiche on the side). Cheddar and bacon tater tots are oddly large, but quite snackable. The other standard pub grub offerings are here, but always with a little twist, for example, the fish and chips plate features walleye.  I have to praise them for their standout menu items. The house-made andouille is fantastic. And their poutine in brown ale gravy is downright mop-uppable. But I am also thankful that amongst the standard fare they include lighter-carb fare such as brussels sprouts and roasted cauliflower.  The service is always friendly and this place seems to have been busy ever since they opened a few years back. Count me amongst the regulars!"}
{"text":"Best beer I have had at a brewery in a long time. Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the food was crazy salty. The cheese sauce has way too much salt and I got the street tacos and they also were doused in salt. Wings are fantastic! Would definitely go back for the beer and wings."}
{"text":"Love this place! It was nice to know that there's a low key, nice bar with great food just down the street from my house.  1. I'm a foodie and the food is awesome! The pretzels are super good, hot, buttery and salty and the burgers are amazing as well!  2. Drinks are great and beer is great as well! I joined their loyalty program and the send me emails of promotional beers they make for holidays, Etc. Pretty cool  3. It's also very low key, it's not insanely busy like some of the restaurants in downtown Scottsdale and u get a good crowd of people from families to first dates, etc.   This place kind of reminds me of yard house but wayyyyyy better. No pretentious people, mom and pop real brewery, food way better than yard house and at a fraction of the price...  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Good beer! Great happy hour! Iffy service. And boring food. I want more locally owned beer joints in Scottsdale, but I also want quality in my service and food options. This place is halfway there. They have beer samplers and flavorful brews. The food is a let down each time I've been there, last visit I had most bland shepard's pie I've ever tried."}
{"text":"Their Dunkelweizen is an amazing beer!! I also love how they give you samples of beer for free for tasting if you are unsure of a beer to go with. None of that Yard House nonsense of charging you a $1 for a taste.  The fried pickles are amazing!! I live for fried pickles and they did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic beer. Some very creative combinations and specialty brews. Half off growlers on Tuesday, killer deal. Atmosphere and Food is great. Most importantly, service is on generally great, maybe a little tough here and there. Would recommend this place to anyone, just don't be surprised when it's packed that the service is sub par."}
{"text":"I have noticed this place a few times while driving on Shea and always tell myself that I need to give it a try. It's an inviting looking venue w/ outdoor seating that opens to indoor dining. My co-workers decided to hold a happy hour here for the first time vs our usual outings at OHSO down the street. I have to admit, I was fairly impressed by their happy hour. They have happy hour 7 days a week and reverse happy hours. To top that, they have lots to choose from on their happy hour meal.   I had the hefeweizen - easy to drink, crisp, and light. Highly recommended! I wasn't in the drinking mood that evening, but I enjoyed the beer through and through and look forward to trying more of their brews. For eats - girlfriend and I split the large mac n cheese. It was $9 happy hour special - talk about deal. We were stuffed from the one bowl - HUGE portions! We also had the charred broccoli for $4 happy hour special. It was quite tasty - just a bit much with the beer cheese sauce. Also had a few sweet potato fries from friend's dish - was yummy, would probably order it again. They offer  a veggie burger - I'm always hesitant to order veggie burgers, but I'm typically unimpressed. The happy hour dishes gave me a little more confidence in trying the veggie burger one day. This place has room for improvement in vegetarian friendly dishes - but meh, you can't have everything. I'd be happy to come here for the happy hour goodness alone.   The atmosphere is fun and upbeat. Love that they have a dog friendly patio. Servers were also very attentive and inviting.   Something that was a bit offputting was the lingering scent of barnyard animals...didn't quite figure out where it came from.   Regardless, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Arizona for over 20 years and I love to eat. This place right here is one of THE best sports bars/restaurants I've been to. The food is great, the waitresses/service is even better and the owners are awesome people. I always get the fish and chips here and they are awesome! Amazing restaurant"}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere, happy hour specials are good, but I got the Caesar salad with chicken and it was way overpriced and extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"There were 3 hostess up front, 2 out of the 3 who which were nice....the third looking really young (youngest out and of them all) which was very rude, long brunette hair pulled back. When we checked in she rudely responded \"WHAT?!\" And a snotty look on her face. We immediately turned around due to her manner. Not the first thing you want to see walking Into and unfamiliar restaurant...she's needs to go. Won't be back. This just happened at 6:50 PM on 1/26."}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant afternoon sampling their many beers and enjoying the food.  Our favorite beer was the East Coast Grove Unfiltered IPA, it was very juicy; and seconded by the Texas Tea Imperial Stout that went down smooth and easy.  The bison burger with tomato jam can't be beat and the tacos were were also tasty with a unique twist of a peanut topping. We also enjoyed the unique flavor of the pickle potato chips.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great beer! Love having a big array of choices. Server gave a great recommendation and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Many restaurants have come and go over the years in this building but I think there's one that will stay for a very, very long time. Scottsdale Beer Company is by far one of the best new restaurants to open up in town. The staff are very friendly and nice and the food and beer is amazing. Whether your going to watch a game, have a few drinks or just trying to find a new place to eat. I definitely recommend SBC. I've been here many times and will always keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place with a convenient location.  We came here for nachos, fried brussel sprouts and a TON of beer.   We tried 6 different beers and loved them all.   Emily was our server and she was great.  Next time I'm in Arizona this is a MUST"}
{"text":"Being a beer geek, the recent boom of craft beer breweries in this area has been a thing of beauty. I have been worried the quality would diminish yet with Scottsdale Beer Company, they are a great addition.  Came here with out of town relatives who also enjoy a tasty pint. We brought 3 kids under 7 with us and we all had a great lunch. When we arrived, we were sat immediately although it was quite busy. We also had immediate service which was great since the adults were quite parched.  We began w/the fried pickle app and the hummus. Our whole party, including the youngsters, loved the fried pickles. The hummus was good ye the pickles stole the show.  Those of age each ordered a different beer from their in-house brewery. The Hefewiezen, in my humble opinion, was one of best Heffies I'v had in a long time! HInt of bubble gum aroma with great drink-ability. Tasted like more and really make you realize how deplorable Blue Moon is.  The Scottish ale and their DIPA was equally fantastic although I thought the DIPA needed a bigger hop kick.  For lunch, I had their lettuce wrap dish which was good yet I would order the dressing on the side next time. Had enough dressing for two dishes. The kiddos each had mac and cheese which is provided by Kraft.   As indicated, the service was very attentive and the beer/food arrived quickly, which is the only way for beer to get to a table.  Can't wait to come back and would love to sit outside next time before it's oven weather."}
{"text":"Frustrated with the service. Came on a Sunday around 1 and no one told me it was happy hour or that they had a brunch menu until I overheard the bartender tell another guest about it. Would have been nice to know both.   So now we all know. Happy hour until 4 on Sunday's and brunch until 3.   They have a big bar with plenty of seating and TVs. During football season, they'll broadcast Arizona Cardinals games, but have all games on the TVs. And they're cleverly marked with the team's flags, so you can know where they are going to show the later games.   Good selection of their own beers on draft (it's ok) and a few guest beers. Plus about a dozen bottles for on-site consumption.  For food, I recommend the fish and chips or the wings.   Clean bathrooms and plenty of partying nearby."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good service. I was there with a group of 6 to watch a game. 2 of us prefer typical michelob or bud light. They do not serve any bottle beers at all. We ate and left for another venue. I think that by not offering bottled beer, they are eliminating a segment of beer drinkers."}
{"text":"I'm a super fan. We have been quite a few times since their opening and have had a great experience each time. I'm no beer snob, so I can only attest that it tastes good and that my friends have no complaints. I typically get the Puppybird  or the Imperial Stout if I do get beer.   Now the food. I have yet to be let down. We have tried and loved the following: Wings (I am a wing snob, and these are amazing - I got the spicy, friend got the BBQ - both great), Mac N Cheese (Truffled Parmesan Crust - need I say more... ), Roasted Cauliflower with pork belly cracklin', Burger (cheese curds), Smothered Fries (topped with Pork Belly), and then the fried pickles. I do believe they have salads too.   Service has been a hoot. Always friendly and great personalities. Specifically Kersten and Brian (bartenders) - but everyone has been pretty great.   Plenty of Tv's. Open patio. USB ports on the outlets that are under the bar - genius!! My phone died and I happened to have the USB cord, but not the power adapter - first time I've seen a usb port available for customer use like this!    My only quarrel, if I could have one - is that there is only one dessert on the menu (and there are otter pops in the cooler by the door!). However, I do not come here for dessert and the name is 'Scottsdale BEER Company' so it's not really a valid expectation!"}
{"text":"Love this brewery. Nice enough size to fit decent amount of people. Super clean. Beers are solid but not overly 'crafty' or crazy unique. But every beer is a perfect example of it's class. Food portions are huge and definitely have attention to detail. Parking kinda sucks. Nice outside patio with misters."}
{"text":"The vegan burger knocked it out of the park! My party also loved the pickle chips and pretzel with dip."}
{"text":"I have never ever written or felt compelled to write a bad review but after our visit I felt I needed too. Beer was good. Fish and chips was horrible! Ruined our experience with fish and chips. It was almost like we had batter with a little bit of fish. Oil tasted like it had not been changed in a very long time. Batter left bitter taste in mouth. Fries were inedible. We honestly left with upset stomachs. Environment and server were great though. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious, so much so that they serve Taco Tuesday on Monday. Beer selections are good. Service is excellent. Love taking my dog to the patio (when it's cool enough) great flavors and good staff make for a fun evening."}
{"text":"Best place Ever! Food is great, beer is great, staff is great! Something for everyone. They get involved with the community with their pour it forward motto. We try to get there once a week to see what's new and visit."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer & food. Staff here is great. The lousy parking is the only reason I gave four stars instead of five."}
{"text":"We came here after baseball because it had a dog friendly patio. The staff we great, friendly and very helpful! The food was tasty with huge portions. I really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts and the sweet potato fries. My husband had the burger and I had the grilled chicken sandwich. My friends had the mac and cheese half portions -- still very filling. They have a very good beer selection and a full bar for those that don't like beer. $5 bloody, margaritas and mimosas on Sat and Sun.   I didnt take any photos of the food because we were too hungry. Plenty of parking as well.   If we lived closers, I think we would be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat. Sat at bar, tried the tacos which were good.  Service was solid and inner decor was nice- plenty of tvs to watch sports.  The prices were a little high. I will try it again to see how it goes. The reviews say I need to try the mac and cheese next."}
{"text":"Scottsdale Beer Company is our go to place since moving to Scottsdale from Chicago.  The staff is super friendly and they have a dog friendly porch!  The food and beer are always on point.  We always feel welcome and that's a great feeling."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good and has great drink deals. We usually do brunch and it is never crowded which amazes me with how good the food is. We need to come more often!! One of our new faves in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this restaurant recently for the first time on a Wednesday night. It was very busy, but not exceptionally loud. There were children dining as well. They have many TVs to view a sporting event. The menu is mostly pub grub with salads, sandwiches, and burgers. I tried the bison burger which was very good. My wife had a salad which she said was excellent. They also have a full bar and an excellent selection of their own beers. Food was not expensive. We will try it again on future trips for casual dining in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday evening and it was relatively open in terms of seating. I've had SBC beer from other places around the valley but I was excited to try something new from them. I had the their Stout and my girlfriend had the double IPA. Both solid beers, so I have yet to have a beer from them that I didn't like. We also got the Mac and cheese which was great! Recommend this place and will be visiting more often. Glad to add SBC to my are arsenal of breweries to go to."}
{"text":"While SBC offers up some pretty good brews, their food really does steal the show.   If you start your day off here (hopefully to enjoy some football), it's a good idea to have one of their well crafted spicy bloody mary's with a breakfast platter that has some of the best & most flavorful seasoned sausage patties.   For lunch or dinner, ya count go wrong with their crispy & flaky Walleye w/Chips, The juicy Bison burger, or Mac & cheese.   Also, having nearly done a county wide tasting survey, I'm pretty confident to say their HOT pub pretzel with beer cheese is the best pretzel in town.   Their East End Amber is usually my go to pint here, but it's always a must to see what guest brews are being tapped. Be warned tho, sometimes irresponsible consumption of brews may result in drunk purchases being made next door at Pier 1 Imports.  Now if only they would bring back that Wonton Chicken Salad..."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!  A simple, clean, burgers, salads & beer place just off the 101 & Shea Blvd.  Great atmosphere, beer, indoor/outdoor, kid friendly (during the day of course) AND.....dog friendly patio!  Thank you God!"}
{"text":"Love the Walleye fish,onion soup and roasted cauliflower. Service has always been very good each time we have eaten here even in a large group. Beer selection is good enjoyed each I have tried.  The only negative we found is the music is to loud and trying to have a nice conversation with dinner partners is difficult. Several times we have gone elsewhere with friends because of this asking them to turn it down does not seem to work."}
{"text":"Maybe my favorite brewery to visit in the Valley. Great atmosphere and very good food selection. And the beer."}
{"text":"It's all about the fried brussel sprouts here. Amazing!! My friends aren't typically Brussel sprouts fans but they loved these!   I've been here a handful of times and have yet to be disappointed. Anything we have tried  has been nothing short of awesome.   Happy hour and reverse happy hour have great food and drink specials. Reverse happy hour is only on Friday and Saturday and drink specials all day on Saturday and Sunday. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Had two wonderful entrees along with some truly excellent brews delivered with good service.  Much improved from early visit."}
{"text":"Fun place, just not extraordinary eats. Happy hour specials are plentiful, beer is cold, and atmosphere is friendly and casual. I didn't love the shrimp tacos at all, they weren't the best even though the waitress recommended them over the street tacos (which are pork). Meh. Good for groups though."}
{"text":"The beer was great. The atmosphere was fun. The onion soup was way too salty. We had a good time. The staff was pleasant.   I would go there again."}
{"text":"I love the Chix Sammie-sweet, spicy and juicy!  I have ordered it with both the side salad and the homemade chips!   The Chips are the bomb-crispy and fresh!  Good deals at their extended Happy Hours."}
{"text":"Its been a while since I have been here, but meet up with a friend to discuss business last night. Wasn't planning on drinking but ended up getting the SBC Hefeweizen which was good. We ended up ordering the Nachos with Carne Asada which to my surprise was really good, I usually dont get Asada because a lot of places screw it up. We also ordered the Triple cooked Chicken Wings with sauces on the side Buffalo and teriyaki. This is why the 3 stars, the wings were so dry and just tasted bad. The Teriyaki wasn't Teriyaki and were informed it would be taken off the bill to make up for the oily sauce it was? Overall for a bar, they failed on the Chicken Wings today. Overall a decent place but Id go elsewhere for wings."}
{"text":"Stopped in to SBC a couple of times on a recent trip to Scottsdale and enjoyed the place each visit.  SBC is a brewpub, though like most brewpubs, they influenced me more with their beer than their food. No knock on the latter, but it's the beer that will keep me coming back. The Texas Tea Stout, NE IPA and American Barleywine were all quite good and I sampled a few other styles that hit the spot as well. Anything from flights to growlers are available to assist with sampling as many, or as a few, beers as you'd like. With over a dozen of their own beers to try, as well as a few guest taps, there shouldn't be a shortage of options for most.  I ordered the tuna tacos on one trip, as well as the ham sandwich on another (which somewhat surprisingly came highly rated by multiple employees) and everything was fine - good bar food to accompany better beer."}
{"text":"So don't go to this place... I had a unexpected gap in my day. Sat at the bar by myself to order a salad.. Asked for a glass of water to start after asking for the menu.. Then was ignored completely the rest of the time. While people on both sides of me sat down after, was asked for drink and food orders, received food n drink orders, and enjoyed food and drink orders. All while still no one acknowledging me and asking if I would like to even place an order or if I had any questions! Seriously disappointed!! It's already not easy going out and dining alone, but then being ignored just makes it worse!! I wanted to order the quinoa chopped salad and a few glasses of wine. At least the bartender got a $1 from me for my glass of water. What she had against me, I do not know. But it wasn't personal, because there were 2 bartenders , and they both ignored me!!! Not going again.. Which is sad, because I take yoga right next door, and am there all the time. Just don't go alone I guess!!"}
{"text":"After coming here more and more, the service, food and beer just keep getting better. I love their IPAs."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere and the food is ridiculous! Literally my favorite wings of all time!! Have not had a single menu item that I didn't like! So glad to have a great place like this in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a little after dinner drink.  Had their Hefeweizen, delicious!  The aroma of this beer was on point as well.  Definately go back to try the food.  The have tacos specials on Monday :)"}
{"text":"Went tonight for my first time. It was really good! Service was great and the food was awesome. The Mac 'n' Cheese was great and the Brussel sprouts were the best I've had. I didn't give it 5 stars only because it was cold in there with all of the garage type doors being wide open. Other than that, I highly recommend this business. Very upbeat and great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot in the greater Phoenix area. As a Northern California craft beer snob, I've been pretty disappointed in the craft beer offerings in Phoenix. Not anymore.   SBC's IPA (I think it's called Dank) could hold its own to any west coast IPA in Northern California or Oregon. Other hits were the Pale Ale (one of the best I've had), Uncle Rico's red and the Black IPA. All outstanding.   And the food is terrific. This place impressed me so much we came back for a second trip during my vacation, so we had a lot of the food. The fried pickles are thin and lightly fried - really good. The smoked/grilled chicken wings were delicious (they inspired me to try this at home). I had the fish and chips and pulled pork sandwich for my entres - both very good (the fries are awesome). And my gf had the grilled meatloaf (amazing!) and a chopped kale salad that she loved.   Great spot, clean, modern but comfortable, lots of TV's, nice staff. I look forward to coming back on my next business trip."}
{"text":"I'm always on the search for a good brewery and especially when in another city. While in the fine city of Scottsdale, Scottsdale Beer Co should be towards the top of your list if you're like me.  SBC is a brewery restaurant with a full, killer food menu and a killer beer menu as well. So for brunch, lunch, dinner or drinks, SBC has you covered. The place is clean, well lit, has a great welcoming atmosphere and overall just a great vibe to it.  As for their beers, I opted for the East Coast Grove New England style IPA since I've been a real fan of those as of late. This one didn't disappoint either, hazy, citrusy, tasty. I liked it so much that I had them fill a crowler of it so that I could take it home with me. The girl working the bar was friendly too which is always a plus and makes transactions go smoothly.  Additionally, if you follow their social media they often announce events and crowler fill specials which definitely sweeten the deal.  I don't live in Scottsdale but you better believe that when I'm in town, SBC is going to be towards the top of my list when I need to grab a bite, a beer or a crowler of something to go...or hell, maybe all three!  The server's name on my receipt was \"Danny Noonan.\"   \"Are you my pal Mr. Scholarship winner?\"   Caddyshack references? Hell yeah. I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Shout out to our hostess Jasmine give this woman a raise!!! I ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf it was A-freakin-mazing!!! The fried brussel sprouts make a great appetizer . People do yourself a favor and go here!!!!!"}
{"text":"This new Brew Pub has just opened in our neighborhood, so we thought we'd give it a try. Friendly knowledgeable staff, great Pale Ale, and good food. Our daughter had the pulled pork sandwich. She said the meat was tender, and it was served with cole slaw in the sandwich (the way it should be). I enjoyed the grilled bacon wrapped meatloaf with mashed potatoes,  green beans and sauteed mushrooms. Delicious! My husband enjoyed his fish n chips, made with Walleye Pike. The chef is from the Midwest, and he suggested the Pike instead of the usual cod. Another hit! It is rare that we try a new place and ALL of us get something we love, but Scottsdale Beer Company  did it. Our waiter talked us into trying a desert of Sticky Toffee-Pumpkin Pudding. OMG. The three of us shared it. Three thumbs up! We will be back often."}
{"text":"Excellent Easy Rye'd pale ale and delicious loaded frys (poutine). Highly recommended - great food, service, location and beer!"}
{"text":"I like the beer and the food selection, but the restaurant itself isn't exactly inviting. In the summer, it can be really warm inside, the TVs can be VERY loud during games (even if no one is watching). The servers seem to be hit or miss as I've been twice and had both great and mediocre service. I do have to say that the pickle chips and white bean hummus are both really good. The fries are not the best though. They look beer battered but don't seem to be very flavorful, and have been small and overcooked at times."}
{"text":"Have returned 2 more times and am hooked!  The manager, Doug, is awesome! He is always working alongside his staff and made sure we were taken care of last visit when the kitchen ran out of the pretzel appetizer we had raved to our friends about.   Haven't tried anything other than the fish'n' chips since I first ordered them. They are amazing.   Still looking forward to trying the key lime ice cream pie someday (hopefully soon)."}
{"text":"Servers were nice & attentive. Beer was great...I had the Sauted Shrimp & my fiance' had the Baked Meatloaf, both were good...We will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"Great new spot in the neighborhood. Great craft beer, great food, friendly attentive service and a fun crowd. Very happy this place finally turned back into something worth going to. Very convenient location right off the 101 and Shea on the north west corner."}
{"text":"Food was freaking amazing! I seriously loved it! I had friend pickles and beef jerky.  YES BEEF JERKY is an appetizer option! Both were fantastic.  I love fried pickles and these were perfectly crispy, there was a good flavor to the breading but the pickle was definitely the star. My only issue was our server was a little out of it but I'm not sure what else might have been going on."}
{"text":"My family & I came here for the first time tonight. We absolutely enjoyed ourselves. Both the food & service was awesome! My husband has good knowledge of his beers, & said the beer was very tasteful & refreshing. Good size proportions of food, & very reasonably priced. It's close to home for us, and we will for sure come back often."}
{"text":"Just opened a new location near me and look forward to coming back and trying new dishes and beers!  First time having their chicken sandwich.  Great tasting but fell apart after a few bites and couldn't really finish it.  Side salad was decent but definitely will need to try some more of their menu.  Service was excellent and always seems to be people there throughout the day with a great outdoor patio feel since they have huge roll up doors."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great restaurant with great beer in Scottsdale, look no further. This place is absolutely amazing to bring your friends and family to. Not only do they brew their own beer, but they also have some of the best Mac and Cheese I have ever had! Their tater tots are to die for. You honestly cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and of course great beer. Service has always been top notch. Dog friendly patio as well. Cant go wrong with a stop here."}
{"text":"Good food. Cool ambiance. Cranky service. The wings were awesome ~ smoky & flavorful! My burger had a yummy mesquite smokiness to it, too. Brussels sprouts were too mustard-y for my liking. My husband said his meatloaf was one of the best he's ever had - he couldn't stop eating it. Homemade chips were excellent - light, crispy, salty & slightly tangy.   Hip, fun atmosphere with lots of TVs for sports watchin'. I thought it was weird that the shiny beer brewing vats were surrounded by sloppy plastic buckets and hoses, though.   Our waitress seemed annoyed when I asked her opinion about different dishes and was less than attentive. She got considerably nicer after the check was delivered and we were considering her tip. It's just one person, though, so I'm hoping she's an anomaly. We will be back for the tasty chow, though!"}
{"text":"New brewery in Scottsdale!  Great location on the NW corner of Shea & the 101, behind Chili's and adjacent to Pier 1.  Nice modern and clean atmosphere with a large, prominent bar that serves up their own crafted beers along with a few guest taps.  Thankfully the menu is diverse (compared to other nearby breweries) with distinct upper scale pub fare that is delicious and pairs perfectly with craft beer.  Some in our group really appreciated the vegetarian options.  Our service was very attentive and pleasant.  House beer choices were limited, but they will have more in the next week or so.  I wish they had more information on the house beers available, perhaps a small printed beer menu with house beer descriptions and such.  I know it is a geeky request but this is a beer focused establishment.  Perhaps those blank chalkboards would be ideal, especially if they included which beers are \"on deck\".    Loved my experience here and will be back soon."}
{"text":"This brewery was pretty close to our hotel. Our server was very sweet and helped us decide a few appetizers to start off with. We ordered the cheese curds and fried pickles. Both were really good.   My sis ordered her flight and I went with a Margarita.  Then we decided on the 1/2 Mac & Cheese with Chile verde, chicken, fries and the asada nachos.  I enjoyed my Mac & cheese.  My sis liked her chicken strips and fries. But, The Hubby's nachos fell short of flavor and MEAT!!! I mean it almost had NO MEAT. It was that bad, I had to mention it to our server. I mean we paid $3-4 extra for it. Pretty bad.   The service & food were prompt our margaritas, beer and appetizers were very good."}
{"text":"Yah, they did it right.  Nice menu, beer selections for the whole group, a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 9:00. There were about 6 groups of people at the bar and at tables. The bartender had that  I don't care if you are here or not attitude that never makes me want to spend much. I told him what I normally like as a reference so he could suggest a brew. He suggested I go to Chili's. I am willing to bet that Chili's may have friendlier service. He did provide me with the samples I asked for and I did find a good beer but the attitude was greater than the helpfulness or friendliness. We ordered poutine and fried pickles which came out fairly quickly. Both tasted good. The menu is brief but covers standard bar food.  Hard to say how this place is when it is busy. Doubt I will try again."}
{"text":"Best friday fish fry in town almost just like back in Wisconsin my wife and I come here all the time cant beat it.  Big fan of a very good revolving beer selection however sometimes they have to many dark and very high liquor beers would like to Sleepy Dog Hefe back also but their original is quite good.   Overall most of the bartenders are nice they introduce themselves like at Four Peaks however the male bartender could definitely be more friendly its almost like your bothering him for a beer."}
{"text":"Great appetizers. Great beers. Decent, attentive servers. Priced right appetizers. Tried the Brussels sprouts and they are a delight. The dill pickle chips are so worth trying.  They are like very thin  housemade potato chips but with ultra-thin-sliced dill pickles inside, served with a dill sauce that is quite amazing and tangy. Enough to share. I would have taken photos but I was at a first-time business meet up and thought it might be a tad tacky, so I didn't."}
