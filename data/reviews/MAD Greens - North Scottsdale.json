{"text":"My salad, The Don Quixote with chicken, was delicious as always!  The difference between 4 and 5 stars is cleanliness. The dining room is littered with empty bowls, cups and dis-shoveled chairs. The fountain drink and silverware counters could use a wiping down."}
{"text":"Great healthy meal.  Everything is good here.  Their hummus is always fresh, they forgot to give us pita bread with one order, but that is the only thing I could say bad about them.  The salads are fresh with good white meat chicken, and plenty of flavors to choose from.  We try to go weekly after a workout.  Haven't tried the smooties, but will soon.  I think the price is great too."}
{"text":"1st time visit and can't wait to come back! I loved the Crazy Ivan salad with spicy pumpkin seeds! I was lucky to sample 4 other delicious meals from my foodie friends. Quick, easy, friendly ambience."}
{"text":"Nice staff, alright salad, just wish they would run that noisy juicer in the back since it's loud and annoying. Prices seem high but salad is decent size. Probably won't return with prices and juicer noises. We'll stick with our salad places in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Just had the Edgar Allen Poe large salad with mushrooms and a drink. Over $17. The ingredients were fresh but it was all just bland. The dressing really didn't add any sweetness. I could barely taste the blue-cheese and other ingredients. Descent salad but overpriced for what it is. I did finish the salad but was not wowed."}
{"text":"So how to start? Let's go with the context of my review, I work in the plaza of this location. At first I was hesitant to try Mad Greens because I worked at a local competitor, Grabbagreen. I am extactic at my decision to start eating here regularly. The food is at a par you should expect for the price you are paying. The staff is made up of super cute chicks and a hand full of down to earth guys. The set up is modern/hipster. Chill hippy music plays throughout, i.e.;jimmy buffet etc. I generally eat the Annie Oakley because I'm always super satisfied after. The fresh pressed juices are on point, I can say this with experience under my belt. In the end I'd recommend this location over all the competitors locally, truly never disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time here and loved it....Had the Crazy Ivan.  It was outstanding.  Will be back...."}
{"text":"Eating healthy is an admirable goal, but Mad Greens thinks it's OK to charge double the $ that you would pay pay elsewhere? $10. for a small salad, that is $5. anywhere else. The Mona Lisa \"panini\" was not a panini - very small pieces of mozza cheese, tiny bits of lettuce, and barely any tomato. It was the skimpiest sammy I have ever seen. $10, for that too.  It was NOT served on panini bread! It was made with WW sandwich bread, and NOT the good hearty kind. It was like the white bread with brown coloring, that you would see in the supermarket. It had those panini-style grill marks on it, so I guess that qualifies it to be called panini? They don't know what a panini is? I can't imagine anyone would go there twice. I told everyone in my office not to go there. I did not have a smoothie, maybe those are good."}
{"text":"I visit this location quite frequently, and have never been disappointed! I've even created this yelp account just to leave a review since tips aren't accepted. If I could, I would give this location and staff a 10!  My go to salad is the Ivan, it's never been a disappointment.   The two girls behind the counter, Ashley, and Tina...They are phenomenal! They are always so quick to help each and every customer with a smile on their face no matter how chaotic it gets during lunch. I will and continue to be a regular customer here."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy options abound. Cold pressed juices (mint cooler) also delicious. Filling and fresh."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3 star place.   It goes without saying that that they have mastered the food portion of fast healthy casual. I typically order a Ty Cobb or an Edgar Allen Poe salad, and have heard their wraps are fantastic. The atmosphere inviting, modern, and chic. The location, despite being in Scottsdale, is remarkably easy to get to and doesn't involve the typical 20 minute drive looking for a spot that is rampant in this part of town.   Two faults: they are understaffed. I got into a line of more than 25 people and it took a good 20 minutes to order. Only three people working that line (two salad makers and one cashier) is no where near enough. It's unfair to both staff and customers to have that going on, especially since people really like the food and want something quick. I will be ordering ahead and pick up next time.   Second complain is a lack of public wifi at this location. I know it isn't something the public should be entitled to, but this place lends itself well to a working lunch and I wish I could work from one of their tables on a short lunch break.   Minor adjustments would make this place great!"}
{"text":"Great place for fresh salads and wraps...fresh squeezed juices have me coming back daily. Friendly service and great food!"}
{"text":"While the taste of the curried  in my Gandhi wrap was good  -  I was really disappointed in how little chicken was actually in it.  Too much romaine & very little chicken.  Didn't look anything like the beautiful wrap on the menu."}
{"text":"It was my fist time eating there and I ordered some food for pick up through the online app. I had a couple questions so I called, and the gentleman that answered was very helpful. Once I picked up my food I was greeted with a hello and friendly faces. The man that grabbed my food was the same (employee ) I spoke to on the phone. He repeated my order back and handed me my drink. ( the Mad Greenie... Very good btw) I had cash out to tip and asked \"do you accept tips\"  he kindly declined and said no. Working in the food and bev industry I was very impressed by the quality of service and enjoyed my healthy refreshing lunch:)"}
{"text":"First time here, I saw it driving by and was in mood for salad. Very clean bright and inviting inside. Great staff very helpful with suggestions as to what I like. Very fresh ingredients. Im for sure coming back again & will recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, and they nail it!  Fresh and delicious ingredients are a brand standard, but good service anywhere varies and can be hard to come by.  The entire team is wonderful regardless of peak vs. off peak hours.  Mike (Asst. Store Mgr) was incredibly gracious, knowledgeable, and engaged.  Thank you for another great visit - see you soon!"}
{"text":"Badass spot if you're into fresh, healthy, high quality food.  Let's face it: the wrap and salad thing has been done a million times. I'm coming from the East Coast where it's everywhere, too.  These guys do it right. Everything tastes super fresh, the service is awesome and I just feel GREAT after eating here. The amount of variety you can choose from (or make your own, that's how I roll) is great.  I'll be here a ton as I live next door."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Everybody was extremely welcoming right when I walk through the front door! Keep it up mad greens"}
{"text":"I had the \"Mark Twain\". Primarily a pasta based salad, but the fresh tasting pimento made it quite good."}
{"text":"Worst customer service.. Gave my food away  Don't even want to eat it.order just sat for 5 minutes with out  a word from the cashier"}
{"text":"So love this place!   Very fresh & yummy, soooooo much choices, so much options, very friendly and helpful staff, clean place.  Leans a little bit on the more expensive side, but I can see the justification given how much yummiest they have to offer.  We always enjoy the salads we've tried as well as the smoothies.  And we feel this is a good / healthy choice.  Recommend that you try here!  It can be a bit overwhelming, but the staff there are so cool, they'll help you out.  *YUM!*"}
{"text":"Food is healthy. Service is a little shotty. Have to ask for silverware. The line moves slowly."}
{"text":"I am MAD hooked on mad greens! If you are looking for a quick, healthy, and affordable meal, this is this spot. Mad greens is a casual, order at the counter style restaurant. But the food quality is beyond impressive! They get the majority of their produce from local farmers daily. What's not to love about that?! They have over 20 different dressing to pick from for those salads such as spicy sriracha Almond Vinaigrette and fat free spicy yogurt (because I like it hot!).   And don't forget about the little ones. They have multiple healthy and likable options on their kids menu. All kids meals come with a fruit cup. But this is not your average packaged fruit cup soaking in sugary syrup like most places. They have tons of fresh fruit available and allow your kiddo to choose 3 different types to fill their cup. Kids love nothing more than to have choices, right?"}
{"text":"Mad Greenie juice was awesome!!!   Natural sodas.  Locally sourced produce.  Pretty great salads."}
{"text":"Just tried this place Food is REALLY good and REALLY fresh! Equally as important, the staff was incredible. The girl that helped me was so well trained and informed on their product, their process and the company history! Great job she did, as well as the person who trained her. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Lots of delicious and healthy options.  You watch the crew make your salad/wrap/panini, so it's easy to tailor your food to any dietary preference.  You can specify exactly what you want, or choose one of their menu items and adjust from there.  They have delicious and low fat, though not low sodium, soup options.  I highly recommend MAD Greens."}
{"text":"Quick delicious salads! Very big portions so you can save have for later. I also get the hummus trio. I'm a fan of all the hummus besides the beat flavored one."}
{"text":"Yo, this Ty Cobb, Tommy Lee Jones salad is THE SHIT. I haven't tried anything else because I just can't pass it up... Be sure to get it spicy, with the mad spice avocado.  Don't fall for the larger size, the regular is definitely enough to fill you up.  There's a lot of \"Scottsdale\" at this location, but so what? Healthy, fast(casual) food... Go figure!"}
{"text":"I have been getting the Tyy Cobb in a wrap with the spicy avocado a few days in a row and can't get enough of it. I also love their wake up juice. So healthy and fresh. Everyone that works there always greets me with a warm 'hello' and always super nice. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience for lunch today at MAD greens North Scottsdale location! My boyfriend and I both ordered the TY Cobb salad with extra MAD spice and blue cheese dressing. They had incredible flavor and for the regular size it really is filling!!! Didn't expect how filling it would be so that was a great surprise. The bacon is delicious that they put on the salads, so crunchy! Their drink selection is great too with a lot of different options, I went for the diet Mexican cola. Definitely recommend if you want a delicious made on the spot salad!"}
{"text":"I work right by here and finally came in. Loved being able to make my own. Lots of fresh choices. A lot of food! Pasta salad yum! Only complaint I've machine was very slow and I let them know but no fix. My iced tea has no ice."}
{"text":"Also attended a yelp event here and can't wait to come back.  Try the Annie Oakley panino if you're in the mood for something warm, tasty but not heavy.  I can't wait to try their salads.  The hibiscus tea is also great.  There are so many cool little facts about this business.  I have tons of respect for the co-owners.  Everything was great here, as an avid helathy eater, there was nothing I wouldnt eat."}
{"text":"The mad Caesar salad was good, but the dressing is VERY heavy on the anchovy flavor.  So I would only recommend that salad if you're into that. Chicken Tortilla soup was very good!"}
{"text":"The GM, Ashley, is great. The staff is friendly and helpful. Food is fresh and yummy. And I have to say, the bathrooms are SO clean."}
{"text":"This food is amazing but the service is so slow I can't even imagine walking in anymore. Order for pick up or nothing at all. It's not so good that I'm going to wait 30 minutes for a salad and half a sandwich..."}
{"text":"I have never had MadGreens before so when it was my super fit + healthy friends birthday I let her pick the spot I was going to buy her lunch from! I ordered food online about 2 hours in advance for 11:45 pick up time. I got there at 11:45 on the dot and skipped the line (as the giant huge sign says to do). I stood there.....stood there.....stood there. There were 3 people working the salad line and another guy juicing some drinks. ALL FOUR OF THESE PEOPLE MADE EYE CONTACT WITH ME. All four of these people didn't say hello, didn't say \"be right with you\", \"are you picking up food\", etc. I understand that I am not the only customer and that waiting for food is what you do...regardless of the the fact you are on time to pick it up. That wasn't the issue. The issue is that SOMEONE...One of these 4 people could have simply said \"we'll be right with you\"instead of literally just ignoring me. I finally spoke up as 2 people were at the register (ignoring me) and got them to help me).   The food was average. Not bad but not good. I got a wrap..very plain but its what I expected being that it's healthy and not covered in melted cheese and butter...My friend really enjoyed her salad!   I may try it again but I will eat THERE."}
{"text":"This is great! High quality food for a good price and big portions. Absolutely delicious. I loved the Edgar Allen Poe salad"}
{"text":"They catered lunch for work earlier this week. I fell in love and had to go back already. Try the blt chicken wrap. It's in your best interest people"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthful vegan fare. However, more of the salad dressings should be vegan (why not, right?), and it's shameful that there is no recycling given the amount of plastic they use."}
{"text":"I feel so good that I could put on an itty bitty bikini and skip down the parking lot of McDonald's or Burger King while all the burger connoisseurs gawk at my tiny waist and wish they would've opted for Mad Greens too!  Drop your burgers. Come to Mad Greens and be proud to wear a bikini. It is after all summertime and we all want room for an extra beer on the river. Mad Greens will help you reach that goal. And they will make your digestive system proud."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy alternative, look no further than Mad Greens.  I had the Siam I Am salad and the ingredients were amazingly fresh and the dressing was outstanding.  The staff was very engaging and friendly.  Will definitely be frequenting this location more often!!  ....the Mad Spice is something you must try!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the TY Cobb today and was extremely excited except there was one problem, I was Jewish and the Cobb had bacon in it. So I asked for it without bacon, problem solved! I am in a rush and I decided to take the salad to go and I pay a whopping 10 dollars for it (a price I thought would be worth for the salad). I get home and I open up the salad and I find a giant wad of bacon and bacon scattered all over it. I specifically asked for it without bacon and the person making the salad even asked me, \"what do you want instead of the bacon?\"  I am extremely disappointed in Mad Greens for putting me in this extremely uncomfortable position because I was starving and I had this gorgeous salad that I couldn't eat directly in front of me. Never again."}
{"text":"Good Ceasar salad on this day. The large size at about $10 can be split between two people pretty easily. The croutons seemed to be the tastiest part of the salad, but the parmesan cheese strips and grilled Southwest chicken were also quite tasty. This location is roomy and well lit and this was a good fairly healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, different that what I was expecting. I was expecting juice and salads, what I didn't expect was the sandwiches and soups."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this new place a try, completely regretting my decision. Granted, I went in on a Sunday late afternoon but I waited in line literally 20 minutes just to get to where you place your order. There were only 3 employees working. One girl taking the orders AND making your salad, one girl working the cashier and one gentleman making sandwiches and delivering to the tables. I thought, well maybe the food will be worth the wait. Nope...ordered a curry chicken salad wrap and it was so stuffed with romaine lettuce there were about 4 pieces of diced chicken. I had ordered a side of hummus and pita bread which took an additional 20 minutes. I had to go back to the register to ask where it was, they hadn't even prepared the plate yet! Great concept, healthy food and made to order. But poor management leaving these poor employees to get slaughtered. I will certainly not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome concept! Glad they're opening more locations... Excellent salads, and even better service! Will definitely continue to be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"I normally love Mad Greens but I typically go to the one on Central. My husband and I ordered salads for pick up today. When he brought them home - my salad had bitter undercooked quinoa in it. I tied to call the Scottsdale location but their message says they don't pick up the phone during peak times. It was outside their designated peak time (11 am - 1 pm). Besides my husband said it was dead when he went in to pick up - only one other customer there. So now... I can't eat my salad and I'm annoyed that no one will answer my call."}
{"text":"So glad that we found this place.  It is great to have quick and healthy options nearby!  Love the Siam I Am and Crazy Ivan salads.  My husband is a fan of the wraps.  And my kids love the grilled cheese with a side of fruit.  All of the food is fresh and tastes wonderful. The staff are always kind and helpful.  We ate here three days in a row the other week, because we couldn't get enough.  Absolutely a staple in our go-to spots in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm so thankful for places like this!!! When I count calories it's so convenient to go in some place fast and get fresh quality food that is precisely measured so I know what the calories say is spot on! Thank you mad greens You got me for life."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mad Greens. This location is my go to lunch spot. I love that you can order in advance and pick up on the fly. The staff is always friendly and helpful despite the lunch rush. Today I was greeted by Ashley who always has a smile on her face. You won't go wrong if you dine here."}
{"text":"I love this place, could eat there everyday. Hummus and wraps good! Salads great! Salad dressings sooo good!  Couple of issues: I wish you didn't have to reach over the garbage \"holes\" to grab plastic-wear and napkins. Sometimes it really smells and it's just a little nasty especially after busy times. Secondly there is one girl in particular that works there that has a serious attitude problem. And sometimes despite the request, they fail to include. Mostly everyone else is super nice. Otherwise for the most part I can agree it can take a while to order if there are just a few people in line. So order online and pick it up. The app should allow to include more text in special request area."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing staff!  My friends and I love everything about this place.  We look forward to making this a regular spot... And, it's incredibly healthy stuff.  Mmmmm, MAD Caesar.. More please!"}
{"text":"Don't go during lunch time and if you do, don't get a panini! There was probably 6-8 people ahead of me in line, and it took me about 12 minutes to get to the front.  If you order a salad they make it with you, while you walk down and tell them what you want.  Panini's, however, which I ordered two of get made in the back and it took 15 minutes! The panini itself was pretty good, although they didn't include the dipping sauce it says it comes with. I *might* go back, if I had a coupon, and it wasn't during lunch time."}
{"text":"Three stars because the staff was helpful and friendly and the location was clean . The salad was disappointing for the price. I ordered was an incredibly bland version of a southwest salad called the Pancho Villa with shrimp pumpkin seeds, quinoa, and corn. The salad was mainly greens and had a minimal scoops of the other ingredients. The salad with a small drink came out to about $20. A lot for a bowl of greens and bland quinoa, corn, and pumpkin seeds."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend I live in California. My family and I decided to try this place since it looked nice on Yelp and there website is on point.   Let me just get to the point, the wraps where nothing spectacular. They basically got the Mad Greek salad and put it on a wrap.   The salad was small not much chicken compared to the premium price..... Its basically like buying a Starbucks salad.  If that's what your into then you might like this place. Not my cup of Tea sorry.   Refer to pictures."}
{"text":"I went on the 2nd day and despite a few bumps to get orders in, the salad and staff are great."}
{"text":"Healthy, fast and reasonably priced food options are always a good thing in my book. Mad Greens brings you all of this, and it's fresh and tastes great too! I've been here twice so far, the first time was right after they opened. They let me know it was one of their first days open and to bear with them, but there was no need for that. Everything went smoothly and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. There's tons of choices here, I can keep coming back and never have the same thing twice. They have a variety of salads, paninis, and soups on the menu, or you can just make your own. I love that everything is customizable and you can get dairy free and vegan options. There's a ton of salad dressings ranging from fat free to higher calorie stuff, they also ask how much dressing you want too. I hate when my salads are drenched in dressing, so it's nice to have the light option. I know I'll return as I've already been here twice already in the first week that they opened. Great addition to the area, I hope they expand even more!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!!  We come here once a week.  The service is always super.  Food is fresh.  Also ordered online - they always have order ready.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendliest staff  Clean Fabulous healthy food  I absolutely live this place! Make your own salads with locally sourced tomatoes & lettuces. Yes, please. I tried the Ty Cobb with the low fat ranch and it was perfect. Citrus grilled chicken (I think), bacon, egg, red onion, tomato, lettuces. I will definitely be making this part of my weekly lunch rotation. If your into freshly squeezed juices, this is the spot too! Price point is on point. Can't wait to enjoy another meal here."}
{"text":"So there's two parts to my review and scoring. They get a 5 for ingredients. Hands down - everything is always fresh and it's probably due to how busy they are that they have constant turnaround with ingredients. The downside? They have a 2 on listening to custom orders. I hate salad dressing but I like it mixed in. Sue me right? I feel like saying \"half a circle\" when their common practice is two circles around the bowl makes sense. \"Light dressing\" or \"really light on the dressing\" always gets me one full circle around which is still drenched. It's SO frustrating bc I'm either asking for it on the side, which I hate, or getting stuck with a salad drenched in dressing, which I hate. Really there's just no win BUT if you don't need anything customized, you're good to go"}
{"text":"Well, this was poised to be a pleasant experience, as the food is healthy and decetly flavored. I promptly received my salad, and has no issue.   However, my friend was standing in line behind me,  and she was somehow skipped over. When the employees realized their mistake, they covered her beverage and offered to bring her order to the table.   I'd have considered this an acceptable consolation until we received the food. As the employee was dropped it off, she said \"we didn't know, because you didn't say anything.\"  And so down to 2 Stars for you, Mad Greens, because while your food was pleasant enough, your customer service was not.   We'll stay clear of this location and the snarky commentary in the future."}
{"text":"I love seeing more places trying to provide healthy food, but this place is a miss, unfortunately.  Everyone in the restaurant biz needs to go to Flower Child before they open their doors!"}
{"text":"Love to eat food that is good for you and tastes good. This place hits the mark on both!"}
{"text":"Very bad service here. We came on a Saturday and we were the only customers in the entire place. It took 20 minutes to get 2 juices and a soup and sandwich. The soup was lukewarm, the sandwich bread was burnt to a crisp, not to mention so dry in the inside it was basically inedible. Couple all of this with high prices and suffice to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Usually love ordering here on my lunch because it's the only healthy option around me. I ordered a Caesar wrap only to get back to work and see that it's half the size it normally is and felt pretty empty.  It had maybe 3 peices of chicken and was mostly wrap. Waste of almost $9."}
{"text":"Mad Greens is my go to lunch spot, just about everyday lol. The folks over there are friendly, quick and always greet me with a smile. The food is quick, fresh and health, not to mention a good value when considering the ingredients used; all fresh and homemade products. Tina took care of me today, and just about every other day I'm in there too. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up for this place, highly recommended for a quality lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The sandwiches are awesome and the salads are huuuuuuge! I can't wait until they open up in Austin!"}
{"text":"I like the variety of ingredients they have for the salad. The portion is a bit small for me even if I don't have a big stomach. Lol."}
{"text":"Hmm. My first time at this location and I won't be back. I ordered online and went to pick up my salad. The online pickup line was short, just one person ahead of me but no one was paying attention. There were a few people in the back, one person taking care of the longer line for those that did not order online, and one other someone confused, slightly snippy person behind the counter. I ordered online to avoid waiting in a long line. My salad was good but the service was lacking. I'll stick to the location on Thompson Peak."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my mad greens experience. The restaurant was clean and the staff was very understanding since I was a first timer. I got the mad Cuban panini and it was great. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh ingredients! I am probably the pickiest girl in the world when it comes to meat, and the grilled citrus chicken there is incredible, so tender and juicy and high quality meat! I made my own salad tonight because it was five minutes to closing and I didn't want to stand there trying to make up my mind-but I can't wait to go try what looks to be very yummy creations. My salad was flavorful and simple with baby greens, chicken, apples, goat cheese onions and egg. The girls were so nice and accommodating so close to closing time (I work in the industry and know how closing time is) you would've thought they just opened with how sweet they were!! Shout out to Alice Britney Braxton Melanie and Mindy - keep up the good work, the food was great- service even better!!! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Mad Greens is a fast casual restaurant that serves salads, paninis, wraps, juices, soups, and children's meals. They offer a menu of many salads and offer a build your own option.   I went with the special edition Doc Holiday Salad. It was filled with mostly fresh baby greens, red grapes, some orange, pumpkin seeds and grilled chicken. I liked that everything in the salad seemed fresh. I got the optional Mad Spice added and I thought it went really well in this salad against the fruit in the salad. The chicken in the salad was pretty good but it seemed like something was missing. Maybe a few crunchy pieces of broccoli would have made the salad more interesting to me. It was an OK salad, nothing bad about it but just ok to me.  My husband had the Edgar Allen Poe Salad and I tasted one piece of beef. It was good beef that was prepared nice but it was cold. Cold beef in a chunk is unappetizing because of the texture of the cold fat in the beef to me.  Next time I'll try the build your own option and see if I do better.  The people working there were nice and helpful.  I liked the cool modern atmosphere that seemed like a produce market.  Worthy of a try when your in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely obsessed with this place!! I come here after work all the time and its always so delicious! The workers are so kind here! nothing bad to say about this place at all! Love the chicken tortilla soup. Begging for an arrowhead location!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff so attentive and kind! Fresh, good and filling amounts. Some of the items are hard to pronounce but I stuck with a Caesar chicken wrap.  This place is so clean! Great job keeping up the appearance of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience. The woman who helped us, Marisa, was lovely. Very friendly and chatty, and made sure we knew everything about all the options. We had a yummy wrap and a delicious Don Quixote salad. A great one. Recommended! Will be coming back for sure! Great value for what you get!"}
{"text":"Salad was good . Fresh . Only one scoop of each tho so if you want extra protein etc . Is extra . Was able to feed four for only around 60 bucks not too bad . I like this place wish there was one in Vegas ."}
{"text":"Refreshing and delicious! Soup and Pita bread were really good. The rice bowl with your choice of numerous ingredients was really fresh and had great flavor. Drinks are made with cane sugar and have good flavor. Root Beer, Cola, and Lemonade are all delicious!"}
{"text":"I got to enjoy MAD Greens when they catered an event that I attended. I had both wraps and a salad with all the fixings. Can't wait for the new restaurant to go in at 7th ave and McDowell."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were wanted a salad and thought we'd try Mad Greens. The food was good. I had a Cobb salad. My daughter had a panini. Although, the food was good they were understaffed. No where to sit because the tables were dirty so we cleared our own table. They had two people working the orders and one person juicing. We were in line for 15 minutes. This was at 2:00 in the afternoon. I ate half my salad by the time the panini came out. I felt bad for the two people trying to take care of everyone. I hope it was just an off day for them."}
{"text":"Good place not too busy. Nice alternative for lunch in the healthy side. Friendly staff who will explain things for the rookie. Had the Mona Lisa Panini. Mozzarella, Pesto, Tomatoes, with a Balsamic reduction. Tasty."}

The Elite Events in which I'm eating are the best I've ever had I find it fun to tell you I find it fun to eat When people making salads it's a very very  MAD Greens MAD Greens MAD Greens MAD Greens   I loves me a good salad and MAD Greens does it right!  To start all the MAD Greens I've been to have been welcoming and the process is generally painless.  Order your salad and add extra toppings if you want.  I always go with the Siam I Am salad; the kale and romaine combo combined with edamame, quinoa, peanuts, and organic chicken is what makes this salad for me!  I need a little crunch to my salads and the quinoa provides and extra protein punch.  Add some MAD Greens spice and you'll get that extra kick and flavor.  I sometimes order their Maine soda which totally rocks since it's sugar free and the flavors of each are just as addicting!   Overall, MAD Greens is a fast and growing company because of the service and the love they have for their ingredients.  House made dressing and fresh products always wins my love! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Mad Greens on a whim while driving through Scottsdale. As someone who follows the paleo diet, I'm always on the hunt for a healthy and customizable lunchtime option. I'm happy to say Mad Greens is exactly that. We walked in at noon to find a relatively busy, but clean restaurant. I decided on a build your own salad after reviewing the menu. The menu provides macros and calories on most of the items. The employee walked me through building my salad. I switched to a large for an additional dollar, which apparently means the only difference is a larger bowl with more base. I created a kale salad with southwest chicken and oil and vinegar on the side. The salad was large and hearty. You could tell the vegetables were fresh. The iced tea was also good.  The one thing I will note is that the price is a bit steep. $10 for a kale salad with chicken, onions, artichoke hearts, cucumbers and kalmata olives is really high, in my opinion. Especially considering this is something I could make at home or even pick-up from the Whole Foods salad bar for just a fraction of the price. BUT sometimes you're not home to make your own salad, so Mad Greens is a great choice for that."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place more stars. I absolutely LOVE the food here and convenience of ordering online. This is my second time doing so. I arrive on time that is provided on the app. This is the second time the food hasn't been done. This is the second time I arrived to pick up the meal I paid for and the staff acts irritated that they have to prepare a meal. The first time everyone was in the back of the restaurant and I had to wait ten minutes before I was even greeted. The only reason I may try Mad Greens in another location is because of the food. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I have eaten here before and had no problems, this time I ordered online in order to save time, requesting a bit wrap with no tomatoe (allergic) and to add buffalo sauce. Of course when I get back to work and take a bite there is no buffalo sauce, not exactly a deal breaker, but then I see that it is brimming with baby tomatoes. I know mistakes can be made but people ask for specifics for a reason, and I feel like the extra money I pay for this healthy food should go towards at least getting my order correct."}
{"text":"I really like this place! We went for their \"Free Salad Day\" to celebrate the opening. Everyone who works here was so friendly and helpful, we had great customer service! I got the Don Quixote, a salad with mango, roasted corn, shrimp, avocado and cheese. They let me sub cotija instead of jack cheese, and add craisins. It was so yummy! I only have two complaints: the mango looked like it came out of a can (ew) and the salad, even without dressing, didn't hold up well as leftovers. I got one to take to lunch the next day and the greens had wilted somewhat. It was still yummy, just not as fresh.   I will definitely go here again though, especially for that salad! The shrimp were so fresh and everything so flavorful, I would just like to see fresh mango. Also, add the Mad Spice to your salad- it gives a great kick and flavor!"}
{"text":"Meh, not that impressed. First time here and I had to mortgage my house to finance a cup of soup. $3.75 for an 8 oz cup of soup is a rip-off, in my opinion. I'd probably have to donate a kidney for a full bowl!   For my entree I ordered the half Panini and side salad. They do give a generous portion of greens, along with nice chunks of avocado, which was nice, considering it was just a side salad. The grape tomatoes were fresh and super sweet. The dressing, while there was plenty of it, I found to be a little on the bland side. I believe it was a vinaigrette, but it could've used more vinegar. It was missing some zing. On to the panini. I got the MAD Cuban. The cashier indicated it was a good choice with his nod of approval. It was just ok. It could have used a little more ham and dijon.   Overall, I'm not sure whether I'll be back or not. I think I could go either way. One thing is for sure: I won't be ordering soup again from here. I'd like to keep my house.    PS -  A note to all Scottsdale lunch eateries: Not everyone who spends time in Scottsdale is wealthy. The prices some of you charge is ridiculous for the amount of food given,  and sometimes even the quality of the food/service. Thank you, and now back to your regularly, scheduled review."}
{"text":"my first time was a great experience! minimal wait, food was great, everything was great.  since then i've had some not as awesome experiences. after my first visit, i decided to try out the online option. i arrived a few minutes early of my designated pickup time. when i was helped by the cashier, turns out they had not started on my order. the place wasn't busy by any means. granted, there could have been a lot of people before i came in, but there wasn't a line clamoring for salads. not a deal breaker, just slightly miffed. my second time using the online ordering was much better, my salad was prepped and waiting for me as i entered the restaurant. my gripe however, was the food quality. dunno if i ordered a not so great combo or what, but somehow it didn't taste as great as the other times. i was hoping this place could have been my go to salad joint, but it seems that it is a little unreliable for me to consistently order from here."}
{"text":"The salad was great and I love that they get local produce. I'd have preferred to have more salad and less soup with that combo, but everything was good. Great place to grab a healthy lunch when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this CO chain has come to AZ! They are exactly what we need. I attended the Yelp event in Scottsdale with my husband, and was very impressed. Excellent service was provided, and the ingredients all seem very fresh. I had one of their seasonal salads -the Mighty Aphrodite- and loved it. (Strawberries, almonds, mozzarella and cucumber) I didn't love the Shallot Tarragon vinaigrette, but they will let you substitute one of their other handmade dressings. (You can sample them first as well.) My only complaint is that the portion size of some of the add-ins seems a bit small.   I also really appreciate the make-your-own salad option.  They have paninis and wraps if you aren't in the mood for salad. Mad Greens introduced themselves to AZ with a Free Salad Day, which I also took advantage of. I think it was a wise and classy move from a business that I hope does well here. Give them a try..."}
{"text":"It was good, but \"HEALTHY\" have any of you reviews actually looked at the fat content in some of those \"HEALTHY\" salads?? 43g down to 24g ??  OMG that is insane."}
{"text":"Normally really great food.  Veggies are usually fresh and great service.  My only complaint is that the chicken tends to be really salty sometimes."}
{"text":"I ordered salads and hummus for my family thru Door Dash and I was very happy with the meals and the price.  I would have given 5 stars but the citrus chicken was a little dry/overdone but still tasted very good.  I had the Caesar and added the Mad Spice which was delicious.  Garlicly with heat and if you like a little spice, I highly recommend.  This salad is loaded with ad-ins.  I finished my lettuce before I finished all the other goodies . . . no complaints here.  The spicy avocado hummus was addictive.  I just would have appreciated more than 1 pita.  We also created a Greek like salad with chicken and it was very, very good.  The port wine vinaigrette was delish.  Almost a 5 star experience.  Also the delivery with Door Dash was within 30 mins.  Impressive.  Very good experience.  This will be on my routine rotation."}
{"text":"Yuck. Burnt bread on my sandwich and no real interest in helping me rectify the situation. Their solution was to hand me more mayo to help with the crunchiness. I guess the black charred bread didn't warrant a replacement. Honestly, I didn't make a fuss, I  just won't return."}
{"text":"Have you ever had someone or something you love disappoint you? Well, I have and it just occurred 20 minutes ago.... I love Mad Greens and I always rave about them to anyone that wants a good salad. My go to is the Don Quixote salad with ginger dressing and shrimp.   An hour or so ago, my hubby and I wanted to order something healthy to pickup and we immediately though of Mad Greens. My hubby placed the order online and picked up while I was at home. When I finally dug into my salad, I bit into something black and hard. I thought it might be part of the avocado so I spit it out and continued eating. Then, I bit into a shrimp and that too was hard. I spit it out and studied the shrimp. The shrimp was burnt to the point that it was all black. The other shrimps in the salad were the same way. Ugh! I decided to throw out most of the salad right after.  I love you Mad Greens, but you disappointed me."}
{"text":"My wife had a salad, and I had a wrap that was really the Annie Oakley Panini and I modified it with cheddar cheese and it was delicious"}
{"text":"This is a amazing place! I will say first I am not much a salad person but this place has me coming back 1 or 2 times a week!!! I will say that it is the chipotle of salads joints! I saw that they have a fresh juice bar however have yet to try them but I do look forward to it! The food is fresh and if they are out of a certain protein they will comp with any option which is amazing. I have been there around dinner time and today was my first time durning lunch. Dinner time is definitely a great time to make it being that they are much quicker to get your meal ready. Lunch time can be a little slow but the way I see it is because it is a new place and people have yet to find the go to meal. Even though it was a little hectic they were still quick to get everything made! This place is for anyone who is looking to change up the normal fast food. I can honestly say that I will be a regular to Mad Greens. I hope to see more of these around the valley! The atmosphere is very welcoming they play great music that isn't too loud and have plenty of seating with seating outside. If your looking to change up your boring day of eating check out Mad Greens!"}
{"text":"My new obsession.  Love healthy eating that actually has yummy choices and creative ingredient combinations.  I love the half Mona Lisa with quinoa superfood side.  Just got the Siam I Am salad tonight and it's also fabulous.  The soups are fresh and interesting.  The food is fresh.  The place is clean and the staff seem to care that you are getting a good experience.  And OH BOY is their ice tea the best I have ever had with choices like Herbal Hibiscus, Fuji Apple, Passion Fruit Mango all lightly sweetened with Stevia or honey.  They also have a juice bar that I had yet to try out.  I work right next to the one downtown and live right next to the Scottsdale location.  I feel bad for all the others who don't live near by. I give this place two massive thumbs up and you will too."}
{"text":"Healthy, fast and delicious. Would like to have some local crusty bread instead of pita offered. 21 different salad dressings made from scratch daily!"}
{"text":"Hours posted say they are open until 8:30pm. I came at 7:50pm and both doors were locked with two workers inside. I stood outside with my two toddlers and  knocked for 10 min while they gave me glances and went back to cleaning. Cleaning up and turning away business 40 min before closing, do I even have to say \"bad business practices\"? And I was so excited to try this place for the first time. Big bummer."}
{"text":"Very friendly, great atmosphere! The digital board had local favorites which is really helpful because everything on the menu looks absolutely amazing.  I had the siam I am and loved it"}
{"text":"So glad my friend introduced me to MAD greens! Their salads are super fresh and super filling. I had the MAD Molly Brown with kale instead of spinach, and I'd definitely recommend! The grilled onions were a great touch to the salad. My friend and I raved about how the tomatoes were sweeter and juicier than most other tomatoes we've had (can't tell if we owe that to them being locally grown).  However, I wasn't a big fan of their Southwestern Chicken. It was rather dry and flavorless, so I'd add a different meat next time. I also was a little confused that a \"BIG\" salad means they add more of the base greens (spinach, kale, mixed greens), but keep the toppings and add-ons the same. If we're paying for a larger salad, I would think they'd add more of everything and not just the lettuces.   Either way, MAD greens has tasty, and fresh, locally-sourced salads. I had the Spicy Sriracha Almond Vinaigrette and it was AMAZING -- so much better than the suggested Sherry Molasses Vinaigrette. Definitely try the Sriracha one!!"}
{"text":"I def love Mad Greens - They have delicious, fresh and creative salads. There is a salad for everyone! Weather your the steak salad type, the quinoa lover, or the vegan! I will admit they are a tad pricey - think around $11.00 for a salad. I am a huge fan of the Siam I am Salad with Shrimp and the Don Quixote Salad is quite delicious as well!  Def a great spot for a quick and healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"Mad Greens is expensive, but their food is tasty and healthy. Sometimes the lines can get long for lunch, so give yourself extra time. I love the Annie Oakley sandwich and the Mad Greens salad."}
{"text":"My hair dresser works at Jo Paris Salon, every time I am there I HAVE to stop into mad greens.  Addicting. Love the Tyy Cobb with light dressing and buffalo! so good'"}
{"text":"They source local whenever possible.  Everything is crazy fresh.  Super filling even though they mostly cater to the salad crowd-get the 'big' salad for only a slight caloric increase.  Ask them to do 'light' dressing to keep the caloric content down too if you roll like that-the salads have so many yummy ingredients you don't need heavy dressing.  This is a quick stop-not a sit down and be served kinda place.  GREAT for weekday lunches. Have been twice and this is going to be a new regular stop for me.  Plan on getting something new every time because the menu has so many amazing things I want to try them all."}
{"text":"I went to MAD Greens on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and got the Siam I Am Salad, the hummus trio, and the prickly pear lemonade. The salad was flavorful, light, and still filling. My favorite part was the Piri Piri tofu.  The hummus trio added a little more weight to my meal and was a nice addition. The lemonade was super sweet so I diluted it a bit with water.  The employee was super helpful in explaining the menu. She asked me if peanuts were fine in my salad (it comes with peanuts) just in case I had an allergy."}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to this place and I'm kind of obsessed. I don't even like salads lol! But somehow all the yummy toppings and dressings and fresh fruit during this hot summer totally have me hooked. I pretty much go back and forth between the Doc Holliday and Mighty Aphrodite. Definitely don't miss the citrus-marinated chicken and the Mad Spice spicy pumpkin seeds!  I want to give a big shoutout to Ashley. She is always so happy and friendly, and super efficient during longer lunch lines. She was also quick to correct an issue with my order with a smile. Thank you Ashley for making every experience a great one! :)"}
{"text":"Mad Greens is a great establishment. The food is fresh and good, the people who work there are friendly and knowledgeable. They even come by to check on you and make sure everything is good and offer getting soda refills for you. The spicy avocado hummus is very spicy. The hummus trio comes with about two pitas which is enough for the three servings of hummus."}
{"text":"Not only great food, but they are always consistent! It's hard to find a place, that when you find something you like, it tastes the same every time you order it. Their most impressive attribute, is their customer service. The workers are great, they all have smiles on their face and they are very helpful. Also, if you have never tried it, you have to try the Mad Spice!"}
{"text":"Portion size is very good- good value for the price..HOWEVER the chicken is cut into tiny cubes- almost non existant in the salads(we had  a \"Mad Molly Brown\" and a \"Crazy Ivan\"). The salad dressing was bland and tasteless( Sherry molasses vinaigrette)They do NOT have enough staff...the same person takes your order..prepares your order...then you pay that person(took FOREVER and they were NOT crowded)....If that place got busy customers would start a revolution(They were SO slow we took our own food to the table)...btw there were 8 people in the restaurant at this time(including us).  A good manager could really help this place(if there was one we sure never noticed 1-31-16)"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Great food and cool alternative fountain drinks.  They also source a lot of their produce/raw materials from local farmers.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of variety. Don't like the options? Build your own salad then. I got the small salad and it was pretty big and had a lot in it! I can't remember the name of the salad I got but it had chicken (which was seasoned and not bland!) cubes of mozzarella, tomatoes and spinach. I subbed balsamic instead of the suggested dressing and opted to go no onions BUT they asked if I wanted to sub something else in instead of the onions - I passed but I like that they had the option. Everything was fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!  Great, fresh salads, made-to-order.  Employees are friendly and very willing to \"customize\" your salad the way you want it. Lots of ingredient choices and a substantial sized salad to boot! Prices are exceptionally reasonable.  Wish they had a store closer to where I live, but I will happily go to this one (or any other) when I'm in the neighborhood!  Very Good Job MAD Greens!!"}
{"text":"Me and a group full of my friends came to Scottsdale for an amazing retreat. Our training went over and we were all SO hungry. We ordered Uber eats to save us time and to have our food at our house when we arrived. Our food arrived (late) and half of our order was missing. We called to ask for the rest of our order and the staff was extremely rude. We spoke to Stephanie who was extremely  rude and unprofessional. She was cocky and made it seem as if it was not their fault. Only to find out that their printer ran out of paper and there was no way they could bring us our food because they were understaffed and expected us to find our own solution. Needless to say, half our guests did not get their food and the juice we ordered was disgusting!"}
{"text":"Stepped in for an early lunch. After browsing the extensive menu I went for the Mad Caesar salad, extra Mad Spice. I had tried some of this salad at the Yelp event at the Hilton Village location and had to have it again! It was prepared to order, and the salad maker was very considerate in making sure I had all the toppings, amount of dressing, and spice that I wanted for the salad. The salad itself had a nice balance of romaine, tomato, crouton, dressing, and cheese. The slow cooked chicken in it was very tender and went well with the salad. As always, I'm loving the Maine Root soda fountain.  The only real negative was that there were a few large chunks of romaine stem in the salad which were very hard and not very edible to me. I ate all of my salad except for those hard chunks.  Definitely a great spot for fresh salad and tasty drinks."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time last month and came back 2 times since. I had a warm welcome from the staff and the place is very open and inviting.   The food there is awesome! I have had a hard time finding a good salad bar until this place. It's fresh, fast and they have a great menu to choose from or you can pick your own ingredients. They make their own dressings in house and they have a natural soda bar. I don't think this place can get better! Well, maybe If they had it all organic I think I would be in major heaven."}
{"text":"My first time at a Mad Greens. Stopped in at the one on N Scottsdale Rd for a quick bite after noticing it next to where we planned to go dinner. The menu had a nice mix; too many things I want to try. I got the Mark Twain (wished I read the tip to get half pasta & half greens). The garlic hummus and pita were very tasty. Overall very pleased with the food which is a good sign.  I must say, one gentleman was really spot on (wish I got his name)-he made a Molly Brown salad for my boyfriend; but he was also the first one to greet us, engage with us, helped clear our table, and had such a great attitude.   I wish I could say the same for his co-workers. The place is well staffed-so much so most of them were clumped around the front. One male has longer hair that spills out of his hat/to his shoulders & every couple of minutes would take off his hat & run his hand through his hair and then would stand in front over the food. No hair net...No washing hands...Ew.    One girl had her hair in a pony tail that reached her mid-back that flipped around when she walked back and forth to the front over the food. Plus, it appeared that she picked something off the line and ate it right in front by the food.   Others at least had hair pulled back & up so it wasn't as blatant; but these two made an impression in a different way.   I'll go back to try other things on the menu; but I'm keeping a close eye out for any hair in my food."}
{"text":"I've been told repeatedly for weeks to try this place. And you know, it was good. Fine. Nothing I haven't made before at home any better than I've made it. I consider myself a decent cook and especially good at throwing together a salad with ingredients I like.  My kids had this bento box they shared for $5 and I wish I wouldn't have chosen the smoked cheddar chunks (because we had tons they wouldn't touch). There were really no winners for them, but they are PICKY.   Not sure I'd go out of my way to return. And the one thing that was an odd turn off was the smell. Perhaps I picked an off day, but it smelled like dirty wash cloths. Hmm. 4 Stars because the food was good and fine but that 5th star absent because didn't send me soaring."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday on Salad Day (free salads) and was pretty impressed. I usually don't crave salads or order them as an entree. I tried the Don Quixote and it was really good. The grilled shrimp was cooked perfectly and I loved the mango pieces in it. The ginger vinaigrette isn't too gingery or strong. I asked for the dressing on the side but they do ask you if you want it light or heavy. They have tons of topping options. You can create your own salad or choose from one of their many salads. They also have paninis, wraps, soups, and fresh juice. They carry Maine Root soda and several flavors of iced tea. I've been wanting to try Maine Root so I tried their black cherry soda. It was a little too sweet for me, so I'll be getting tea next time. If you're going to eat a salad, you probably shouldn't have a soda anyway. I'll definitely be back if I'm craving a salad, which happens occasionaly."}
{"text":"I finally have my go-to place for fresh, healthy salads! I am in love with the Siam I Am. I cannot bear to bring myself to order something different. They all look amazing though, so one day I will need to. The teas are all delicious; I usually don't order a drink with my meal, but I have to here since they are so tasty. I like how everything is so fresh, and you can customize any salad. If you don't want something in yours, they will let you substitute something else at no charge! The seating is a little poor here; not enough inside seats for the summer and a little disjointed with a huge wall in the middle of the floor. But overall, really great."}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  Love the concept but for the price everything should be organic.  We spent almost $30 for 2 people without drinks. They forgot my cheese in the salad. The pears weren't ripe and the experience was just meh.  Bummer."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's quick & healthy with a lot of options on the menu! I ordered their classic hummus with pita bread & it was delicious. The pita bread came out soft & warm & hummus tasted freshly made. I also ordered a chicken Caesar salad wrap made with low fat Caesar & it tasted very good! I will definitely come here again & recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. This place has the best, most fresh, locally grown salads ever. The sodas are all natural and the best I've ever tasted. Glad to have Mad Greens in the Valley."}
{"text":"Salad for days!  If you love a great fresh salad this is your place.  This was my second visit and I had the Albert E's BLT (Slow-Roasted Chicken, Bacon, Romaine, Tomatoes with Ranch Dressing) wrap which was amazing.  Made to order and fresh.  I also ordered a side of there spicy avocado hummus.  I wish the portion they gave was a tad bit bigger for the price, but overall the hummus tasted great.  Service still needs to be tweaked a little.  I know they're new and they had only been open 2 days when I went.  I'm sure they'll get the hand of it in no time.  I'll be eating here more often on weekends to ensure I get a healthy meal."}
{"text":"This place is pricey... but really good. The service here does suck though. Our first time they gave my sandwich to the person behind us that ordered the same thing. They have NO CLUE who's order is for who. They just walk out, look for someone who doesn't have food and ask, \"is this yours?\"  What kind of crap is that? Seriously embarrassing. I feel for the employees, they look very frustrated that this is how they operate.  They have \"natural\" sodas, whatever that means. They taste great though. Not as chemically and fake like \"real\" soda. I mean, I drink Mt. Dew and Coke daily, but if I had this stuff in a can I'd go for it.   The sandwich and salad we got were good, but nothing crazy amazing. Not sure how crazy amazing a sandwich and salad can really be, so that's why I'm 4-staring this place.   Price is high and service is ridiculous. Other than that, good healthy food and more places like this need to exist."}
{"text":"Nice fast food salad places seem to be very popular now and when I'm in the Denver or Scottsdale area Mad Greens is my go to for this category. Their portion sizes are great. A large will fill up a 250 lb guy and their ingredients are very fresh with good salad options. They also offer soup or hummus and pita bread. For drinks they offer the gourmet cane soda sodas and a few tea options."}
{"text":"Sometimes I don't feel like buying all the ingredients I put in my salad! I love that I can cruise by after my workout and grab a quick byo salad ?"}
{"text":"Mad greens is just a great, healthy alternative to the normal fast food fare.  It's fast but healthy.  I can only comment on the Ty Cobb salad because i love it so much, it's the only thing I ever order there.  My daughters like it as well and the only reason for 4-star in that they do not have ketchup.  Now, why would I want ketchup you may ask?   Simple, my younger daughter gets their grilled cheese and likes to dip it in ketchup.  I'd give a 4 1/2  if I could.  This location and the others are all good got service too.  I highly recommend thrm"}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy lunch time option with salads, wraps and grain bowls.. this is your spot.. always fresh ingredients and the line moves fast.  I usually have the shrimp & bacon grain bowl but I'm on a low carb kick so I thought the Ty Cobb would be perfect.. avocado, bacon, eggs, chicken, blue cheese .. this is a big salad.   Ask for the spicy avocado .. they press the avocado half into their mad spice seasoning and then chop it into the salad .. yum! Spices, heat, lots of flavor!!"}
{"text":"Clean good food. Had the Don Q Salad with spicy mad seasoning and shrimp. I had the creamy ginger which was amazing but rich. Wouldn't change a thing other than asking for light on the dressing."}
{"text":"I thought the service was great. I was greeted by two different people when I walked in and everyone behind the counter was smiling. They seemed to genuinely enjoy being there.  Even though there were a number of people in front of and behind me in line, it went pretty quickly -  about 5 minutes - and I had quite a few substitutions and special requests on my wrap. I also liked the vegetable soup and would order it again. My friend enjoyed the Ty Cobb salad and chili. Best of all was the juice bar and organic teas. We will definitely come here often."}
{"text":"Mad Greens has a lot of options for a quick and easy lunch salad. Their pricing is a bit too expensive, and their ingredients are just good, not amazing. \"4 stars\" is still good in my book but there is nothing about them that gives them that wow factor.  I always put things like grapes, strawberries, and apples in my salad because most restaurants do offer these items.   If you're looking for a quick and easy lunch, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"The employees here are super friendly; however, this specific location is SO SLOW. Do not go around lunch time unless you want to spend your entire lunch standing in line. They only had two people working and had about 30 online orders and maybe 20 people in line. The online orders are kind of out of their control which I get, but the past two times I've been to this location I have spent over 30 minutes waiting. Even people picking up online orders were waiting well past their pick up times. I would come back here, but well after the lunch rush. Also, by the time I finally got to the register, they had given me the wrong size (ordered a large and got a small). I didn't want to wait longer or hold anyone else up so I accepted as is and the employee gave me a discount which I appreciated."}
{"text":"I came here for the event last night for friends and family and I had the 1/2 Annie Oakley and 1/2 Mad Caesar and I was very impressed with both of my halves!! The food is so great and you can tell it was made fresh and with care and not for an expensive price either. I came again tonight for the free salad day and I was impressed yet again! I had the Ty Cobb and it was also to die for! I haven't had anything here I don't like and also the juices are amazing! . The strawberry cooler is definitely one to try. Not only is the food great but the employees are so nice and friendly. Their customer service is great I'll definitely be back and I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place in the new vein of healthier fast food.  Done line -style ( think Chipotle )  but all fresh salad options.   The flavor was decent and I liked the mad spice option to give it a kick"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good with fresh salad options. Its like chipotle for salad so you need to be prepared with what you want before walking up to the counter. I ordered the ty cobb with  the almond sriracha dressing and it was really good!"}
{"text":"The hummus trio is the worst thing I've ever eaten. Was trying to force myself to eat it bc it was lunch and gagged too much. Tastes like dirt. Couldn't do more than a bite of the beet or avocado one. Garlic was tolerable. Literally the most disgusting thing I've eaten in a very long time"}
{"text":"First of all, I do not like vegetables. With that said... OMG! I could eat these vegetables like popcorn. They were seriously delicious. The staff even let me try a couple different kinds; got to love free samples.  If my mom had made food like this growing up, I would've eaten my broccoli all the time."}
{"text":"I love this place, the concept and the food BUT the wait times and the understaffing is just beyond frustrating. I don't have time to wait 20 minutes just to place my order and I'm a mom so it usually means my 2 yr old is with me. Try making a 2 yr old wait in line for 20 minutes...it's not fun. By the time I get my salad I am frustrated to no end! So much potential but hire more people!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! Originally went to the 7th ave location and then found they have one by my house in Scottsdale. SCORE! The Siam I Am and Don Quixote with shrimp are soooooo good."}
{"text":"First visit here and very much enjoyed the Crazy Ivan salad with Shallot Tarragon Vinaigrette. Soo yum! Was pleased to be able to customize my base choice with a different dressing and some spice.   Price is a little high (the only thing I would change), but sadly healthier choices usually are.   Definitely full and satisfied after the regular size. Which, in my mind, equates to the perfect balance of veggie-to-satisfying-fat ratio.   Hoping they offer a rewards program soon."}
{"text":"We grabbed salads for lunch and they were delicious! Everyone loved the fresh taste and creative dressings. I was delighted that the prices were reasonable. The salads are generous in size! The only downside was the chaotic way you place your order and they try and pack your to go bag. It was really silly and tithe guy behind us had to grab his salad out of our bag. I hope they sort this out ....delicious!"}
{"text":"I am kind of obsessed with MAD Greens, which is a problem because I work close to this location. I've never encountered a salad-only (give or take their sandwiches) fast-casual restaurant, such a unique concept! The pricing is a little ridiculous, but normally I can get about 2 salads out of a small, especially the Siam I Am. Each salad is jam-packed full of greens for the betterment of ourselves.   I wish they would include a tad more mixings, because the Mad Molly Brown salad I tried today appeared to have a little too much spinach and not enough of the other goodies- great simple dressing though. Normally I get the Siam I Am which has a great mix of greens and goodies, especially because I get an extra scoop of edamame instead of peanuts. The employees I've spoken with there are nothing but sweet and personable, especially when I can't decide what to order! There is never a gloomy day with them and it's much appreciated when I come in ravaging for a sal-had."}
{"text":"Well, I have been disappointed twice now with their online ordering.  It seems difficult for them to get the order correct. Since you can't contact the restaurant and complain,  HELP will have to do. They forgot my avocado in my Don Quixote salad. It makes the salad; I even paid extra  for the shrimp.  They did remember to leave the corn out. I wanted the good day in my salad.  I am a regular customer. I guess I'll  have to open it up in the restaurant next time our order there.  It will be a while before I go back.  I have noticed the last couple of times, the original Mgr hasn't been there. Maybe that's the problem."}
{"text":"First time visit. Genre: made to order fast food salads and sandwiches. Food quality: good, but not excellent. Customer service: good; I don't like a lot of dressing in salad so even the \"lite\" volume of dressing in my Mad Molly Brown ( a salad with onion overkill, imo) was still way too much, so the manager remade it, leaving the dressing on the side. Experience: ok, I felt rushed through the ordering and decision process. Maybe if I became a regular, I'd want the process to be as fast as it was. For a first time customer it was a little confusing."}
{"text":"I eat here about twice a week and have never been disappointed. The place is super clean and the salads are nice and fresh, however some days it can be a slow process. But the quality of the greens and dressings are worth the waits."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding - super fresh ingredients, welcoming atmosphere, friendly staff (loved Tina)...had the large aphrodite salad and it was scrumptious with the creamy shallot tarragon vinaigrette. Very pleased with my experience there and very likely to go back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is fresh fresh fresh! From fresh juices to fresh salads. I just stay there for the first time and I am completely blown away by how delicious and fresh everything is. The staff was very welcoming and very pleasant. If you like eating fresh food, healthy food with a lovely ambience then this is your place. I am completely addicted. I can't wait to bring my three-year-old son in for a fresh squeezed juice and a salad for me"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection and all that. The add ons rack up some serious coin. Im not sure really what's going on here but it must be the location ... its a thing. the food is pretty good for healthy fare .. not mind blowing or anything but convenient. The crowd is mixed and the outdoor dining area is not super functional, but hey. It's healthy-ish food in scottsdale, beggars cant be choosers i guess."}
{"text":"So... I totally \"milked\" the system.  I work near their Tempe location, but live near this Scottsdale location, so on Free Salad Day, 25Jun15, I went to 1 location for lunch, and for dinner I went to this location. It was after 7pm, but there was still a line wrapped around the corner.  There were water misters (my hair wasn't happy about that) blowing on the crowd to keep them cool and they also had flavored water dispensers to keep you hydrated in the heat.  Employees were nice, helpful, and the free-day was a well-organized event.   I ended up getting the same dish that I had at the other location, because I liked it so much. It was a veganized Don Quixote (and if ONE more person mispronounced his name in that line, I was gonna scream!): baby greens, Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu (instead of meat), roasted corn, avocado (with MAD spice), mango, green onions (instead of cheese), and the Roasted Red Pepper Dressing (instead of the non-vegan creamy \"something\" that came with it).   I ended up saving it for lunch the next day, and I agree with the other Yelper about the wilting greens.  It was definitely soupy the next day, but it had been swimming in dressing (plus, I requested a lot of dressing) 16 hours so I won't complain.  Everything was still tasty the next day, and the avocados were still green (you know an avocado will turn on you quickly).    VEGANS: For protein options, they have...  1 - Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu - These are chunks of firm tofu (with a slight squish factor), but the taste is excellent (and I am no tofu fan). I was told that they marinate their organic tofu for 24 hours; this is what gives it such great flavor.  2 - Grilled Portobellos (if mushrooms are your thang).  3 - Warm Quinoa.  There are lots of fruits, veggies, and nuts as well.   Avoid the Paninis! The bread is not vegan (their sourdough bread contains whey).  VEGAN SALAD DRESSINGS - There is a print out by the dressings which shows you which ones are vegan. Note: if it says \"Vegan*\" -WITH an asterisk sign, that means the dressing has honey. Pure vegan dressings will not have the asterisk. I suggest checking out their online interactive \"allergen\" menu; you can click everything that you want to omit and they'll produce a qualifying list of items. You can then click on each to see exactly what ingredients are used. Know before you go! (The Balsamic Vinaigrette, Sherry Molasses Vinaigrette, and Roasted Red Pepper are among the pure vegan options.)  Lastly, keep your eyes on your bowl as they add ingredients.  I told the guy at the cash register that I was vegan so I'd be swapping non-vegan items for vegan items in my salad.  I watched the girl and as soon as I saw her go for the cheese I started waving my hands profusely and saying, \"No, no NO!\" Too late. Cheese in the bowl.  \"I told him vegan...\" I said with a sad face. She was like, \"No worries.\" She tossed that bowl, told cashier-guy what he should add to the ticket for vegans, then she got me a brand new bowl and re-made my salad.  No attitude. No bother.  THAT was refreshing.   I don't always want to eat a salad, but when I do, I'll think of MAD Greens!"}
{"text":"Really yummy salads and a menu with lots of variety! When I got there it was totally empty, so service was quick and the staff was kind. The restaurant is very clean and bright. I ordered a seasonal mediterranean salad. It was delightful! Everything tasted really fresh. Their portions are very generous as well, and they ask how much dressing you want (light, heavy, or medium). I thought that was a really nice touch. Overall really great quick healthy lunch spot! Will be back if I find myself in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I went to the Yelp opening event in Scottsdale as a guest and I was blown away not only by the friendly staff but by the whole concept! Fresh, healthy food under $10 that tastes incredible is hard to come by! The array of salads and salad fixings are good and plenty!!! The dressings are freshly made by \"mixologists\" and the tomatoes are fresh daily...and did I mention they have their own fountain soda made with real sugar that is not as sugary sweet as most? I don't even drink soda, but I do here because it actually tastes good!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Staff was friendly, service was quick. Food was pretty average, I had the Ty Cobb which sounded amazing but I wasn't a fan of the seasoning on the chicken. It tasted like a salad I could have thrown together at home. They were really great about allowing me to substitute out items in the salad I didn't want which was a big plus. I am not saying I wouldn't go back. The staff was nice so I would give it another shot. I would just steer clear of the chicken."}
{"text":"Totally addicted to the Doc Holiday salad. While I was looking up their hours I stumbled onto their website and found that you can order online! Their online ordering system is probably the best and most intuitive online ordering systems I have seen. Placing the order was really easy and my order was ready to go when I arrived. The salad, as always was delicious. They out the dressing on the side, which I thought was really nice. This place is going to become an addiction!"}
{"text":"Ever since we moved from San Diego, we've been searching for an Urban Plates clone, a place where we can get freakin delicious salads.   No luck until we found Mad Greens.   Addicting salads, fresh flavorful ingredients, amazing prices. This is it.   Doc Holliday, Don Quixote, BLT Chicken Wrap have been freakin fresh and delish.  Their salt caramels and salted caramel cookies are so good. I would list the cookie in my top 3 cookies of all time behind:  Specialty's choco cookie Peter Gourmades PB cookie in Irvine"}
{"text":"After a recent visit to Pasadena, my husband decided he wanted to try to eat a vegan diet like my cosmetic surgeon recommended so he can potentially get off of some of his medications one day.  We decided to try Mad Greens which just went into the old coffee shop next to Sauce not too long ago.   The food was good.  The atmosphere was not bad.  We sat out on their spacious patio on a lovely spring day.    My only issue with Mad Greens is that we have eaten there multiple times now and the portion sizes are always SO HUGE!  For a restaurant that is supposedly so health-minded, one would think that they would put a little bit more effort into portion control.  I could honestly make 3 meals out of the amount I am served in one lunch there. Even so, I'm sure we'll continue to come back and continue to bring home leftovers. :-)"}
{"text":"Love it.  MAD Greens is one of the few restaurants where I walk out feeling refreshed and energized instead of thinking that I need to find a dark area where I can take a food coma nap.  The service is friendly, the owners have an awesome genuine mission, and the prices are fair for the quality that you get.  Even the fountain sodas taste bubbly and light.  My favorite salads are the Edgar Allan Poe (steak and blue cheese) and the Don Quixote... oh, the Don Quixote.  I usually am not a fan of chicken in salad, but the chicken here is so tasty.  It's juicy, soft, and obviously slow roasted - there's none of that blobby rubbery fat that fast food restaurant salads have.  Pairing that with avocado, that salad is definitely my favorite.  Definitely recommend stopping by, especially if you want to feel alert and ready to go for a hike after eating instead of groggy."}
{"text":"I have a friend who loves this place, and goes a couple of times a week, but I don't understand the hype.  For the price of a sub-par salad, I could make three salads with all the trimmings without ever sensing the presence of a sneeze guard.  My wife and I both had the Cuban panini, I ordered mine without pickles (which, of course, had the damn pickles on it) and we both were unimpressed with the fillings (though the bread was good).  Later, indigestion was the only sign that we had been there, haunting me through the next morning.  If you want a salad, make a salad, and spare yourself."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I ordered the mad caesar with light dressing and light mad spice. Delicious and great portion for the price. Also got the pomegranate lime green tea which was tasty. Staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It is so hard to travel for business and try to eat healthy. My conference was feeding us well. We had a continental bfast every morning and there idea of continental was HUGE amounts of different in season fruit, different breads, muffins, croissants, pasties etc, water coffee, tea, different juices, milk and water.  Yogurt, cereal, granola. It was a lot!  Lunch was even better. So when it came to dinner I was either not hungry or if I was I wanted something light. I found this location and I figured it would be veggie related. Yeahhhh me!  I park and walk in and check out the menu. The place is empty aside from a few customers.  SOOOOO MANY SALADS to pick from. They all had one thing in common...chicken as a protein and I don't eat meat.   So I went with the Aphrodite salad which was mixed greens, sliced almonds, mozzarella, chicken which I don't eat and tarragon vinaigrette.   I asked for no barn yard pimp aka chicken so the guy said I could add 2 additional veggies.  I asked for shrimp but since that is a protein I was good to go. Yippi.   He made my salad I paid and was out. Back at hotel I dove in Teeth first. Super DELISH and filling.   They have 2 sizes for salads. I got the smaller one. They also do some wraps. Great place with healthy varieties.  Wish I had time to go back."}
{"text":"Always looking for places to eat healthy and saw this from other yelpers.   Situated next to Sauce and a little larger than expected. Very clean and looks like the restaurant is like a chipotle style salad place which also serves sandwiches and wraps.   We ordered the Ceasar Salad and the Cuban Panini along with a soda to try the Maine Root Soda machine .  The Ceasar Salad is placed in a large metal bowl with all the different items and mixed together and then placed in a bowl to be served.   The Cuban Panini came with a side salad which was just okay. As for the sandwich the meat was sparse and the bread was okay.  Price wise the small salad seemed a little pricy and the sandwich was on the high average end.  We arrived around 330 pm and there just a few people there but can imagine a good size crowd for lunch.  Both the salad and sandwich were average at best and if I did not come back it would not change my world."}
