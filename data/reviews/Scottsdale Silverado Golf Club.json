{"text":"This course is on the less expensive end of the scale for Scottsdale which still means fairly pricey (I believe it was around $80-$90 per person in prime season in end of March?). There is no driving range but we went to one of the courses nearby beforehand which wasn't very far away.

Overall though thought the course was pretty solid with a nice layout. Greens in good shape. Course had some challenges but also had an overall layout that seemed to keep the ball findable because everything sloped inward. Got out at 8:45 or so and played pretty quickly. Would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Overall not a bad little course I had a decent time but I was waiting at every tee box due to groups ahead of me. Cart girls are very attentive. Course is in great shape and prices are very reasonable. Course is very forgiving for first time players to the course. Would go here again if I have a chance."}
{"text":"I just finished playing here. This was 7th time ever playing golf. To call my game bad would be a compliment. Having said all that this is a really beautiful course. Some par 5s that were over 500 yards.  Had some challenging par 4s and even the par 3s had sand and water come into play (hole 18).  The fairways were wide open and helped someone like me because I didn't have to worry about not hitting them perfectly straight. The price was great only $19 plus tax for a 18 holes plus cart. 

No driving range which is fine because I just wanted to go out and play. 

I got through 18 in 3 hours. The staff was really friendly and loaded my clubs into the cart and cleaned the clubs. They even gave an ice cold towel after playing, which helped since it was 106 today (moderate for summer in Scottsdale).  Also they have coolers for free and will fill it with ice at the bar. 

If you want a great value and beautiful and maintained course go play here even if you are a beginner like me."}
{"text":"I had never played Silverado before, I booked a three-some and one of my guys couldn't make it at the last minute. So the guy at the register tells me that \"these tee times are so in demand\" that he is going to have to charge me for the no show. And since I set up the tee time, I have to pay. However, what they will do is put my receipt in an envelope and if I ever decide to go back there, they'll give me credit towards my next round. That is if the receipt isn't \"accidentally\" lost after this review, because other than that receipt, there is now way to prove they owe me anything. I have literally played hundreds of courses, and on the off chance one of us can't make it, no other course has ever charged us. Everyone knows stuff happens."}
{"text":"Best golf course I've played on so far,  but ive just started this year. The views were great.  Tee boxes are high which gives you great vision of the course.  Greens had just been reseeded.  Probably be perfect in a couple weeks."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this course gets such a low rating.  This is a fine golf course.  It is in excellent condition.  The front nine is somewhat boring as it is basically straight out and straight back.  The back nine offers a little more challenge and a few more interesting holes.

A warning to walkers:  The front nine is easily walked, but the back nine is tough as there are VERY long stretches from green to tee.

I played it on 11-24-11 in the first group of the day.  The greens were pretty slow, but that was probably because there was a heavy dew that morning and the greens were still pretty wet.  As they dry out during the day, they probably run a little faster, but will still be just moderate speed greens.

It's a straightforward course, with no tricks off the tee.  The 10th hole is a sharp dogleg right with a blind tee shot.  Other than that, you can see the shot you need to hit from every tee box.  The finishing hole is a moderate, downhill Par 3 over water.   Beautiful golf hole."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Friendly staff and Chuck went out of his way to take care of me. I now come here pretty regularly."}
{"text":"I love coming here! Their waitress Jessica is really nice! And my friends and I always have a great time golfing!"}
{"text":"Course is amazing condition for summer time in the Phoenix area. Greens are no joke, the absolute best I've played this summer. Staff was friendly and got me out as a single ahead of a three-some. They have a nice putting and chipping area and there are three bays to hit some practice balls into. Layout is not too challenging but there are a couple holes to test your ability. All in all a very nice track to play. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Booked my tee time here on line with GolfNow.  I have two Junior golfers but GolfNow does not offer that option. However at check in every other course I booked this way has given me the junior rate when lower.  Not Silverado and it was a $30 per player difference.  There was no good reason not to give me the lower rate, so I felt they were basically saying \"screw you\". The guy in the Pro Shop said \"I could have sold it to someone else at the higher rate\"  What???  If I called you would have given me the lower rate, so what is the difference?    It cost me more to book online?  That makes sense...not.  As for the course, nothing special and a rather strange layout with long drives at times between tee boxes.  Very slow pace of play too.  Greens were ok though so I will give them one positive..  After this experience there is no way I will come back here."}
{"text":"The staff was completely disrespectful to us.  They sent us out with a random player and then threatened to kick us off the course on hole 2, with no refund, if we didn't split up our group. The customer service was terrible but I'm biased considering the way they treated my group. The course is decent, wide open fairways but not very challenging. Overall not worth the $50 I spent."}
{"text":"SLOW PLAY- played there twice this week and never saw a ranger. Fridays round took 5 hours and 20 minutes and we only got 17 holes in. Played Sunday and expected a slow round but not another 5 he ordeal. Never saw a ranger and it seems slow play is the norm. Course is fun and open enough to be forgiving"}
{"text":"I am sorry to see so many bad things said about Silverado.  Its one of my favorites.  I golf mostly in the afternoons.  We play at this course about 3 times a month.  Never had a problem.  My foursome even got to take off early.  One time my dad (age 85)  was late getting to the golf course.  When he arrived the staff loaded his clubs and him, up and brought him out to our hole where we were getting ready to tee off.

The course itself is pretty forgiving.  Pretty open in the front 9, little tighter on the back.

I recommend the Friday Night Fish Fry as well.  They have a great dinner and golf special."}
{"text":"Silverado is a great track for a nice, relaxing round of golf.  However, I write this out of appreciation.  I left a pair of expensive shades in a cart on Thursday- they had them on Saturday for me.  Appreciate the entire staff."}
{"text":"We're not golfers, but it was a beautiful day for a nice outdoor lunch with a view.  We were pleasantly surprised by the Silverado Grille.  We sat out on the patio where we had a great view of the golf course and fountain.  The food was great and Chuck was very friendly and accomodating as he took care of our order.  Had a great time with my wife and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great course,love the green grass. Great staff,I am sure that's due to their general manager Mike Elmore."}
{"text":"The condition of the course is pretty consistent, every now and then there seems to be standing water on the course. The greens are pretty good for a short little par 72 course. The pro shop guys are always nice. Pace of play is terrible. Ownership needs to do a much better job of getting people to speed up so you can get in a 4 hour round of golf, not a 5 hour round, that's unacceptable. If a foursome is playing slow the Ranger needs to pull them aside to let a few groups play thru. It's as simple as that. It should be that was on any course your playing, keeping up or get passed up. I would not spend more than $45 during the winter to play the course, there's other good deals out there if you're spending more than that for the overall quality of the course conditions."}
{"text":"Slow!!! This the slowest golf course in the world. I have played there 3 times, all within the last year. I was only able to finish once because of the extremely slow play and that time took 5 1/2 hours. The other time they started me on the back, which was fine because it is the nicer of the two 9's, it took 2 1/2 hours to play. I go to make the turn on to the front and they just let 7 groups of walkers out on the front, even though they new a bunch of people would be making the turn because they started everyone else earlier on the back. Seeing this and then seeing the 5 groups waiting to tee of on 10, I went to the pro shop to kindly ask \"what's up?\", the guy with the creepy side burns and mustache basically told me I was screwed and said there was no chance of a rain check even though he admitted that it would take over 3 more hours to finish my round.

For some stupid reason I went back again this past May. It took 2/12 hours to play the front and then it took 2 1/2 hours TO PLAY THE FIRST FOUR HOLES ON THE BACK!!! When we got to the 14th tee there were, NO KIDDING, 6 groups on the tee. NOT A MARSHALL IN SIGHT!

We decided to quit and drive to the clubhouse, as did two other groups. When we got back to the club house, the bag guys asked how we enjoyed our round... knowing that we did not come from  the 18th. We told them very politely how slow it was and  there only response was \"ya, slow golf sucks\". 

Please find new management because this is a decent course, when you get to play the whole thing!"}
{"text":"Silverado sure doesn't feel like a muni. It's a great, fairly easy course that is a lot of fun and not too penalizing. The front 9 has a more traditional layout, while the back 9 plays a little bit like a desert course. By that I mean that you might have to tee off over some scrub, and off the fairway is semi-scrubular. The tee boxes are spread out from hole-to-hole, which is nice because it separates the groups in front of and behind you. I also love starting the round with a shorter par 5, because you can duff a shot right off the bat and still get away with par."}
{"text":"Silverado GC is great for what you pay. I have golfed 18 holes here several times during peak hours for under $25.The staff is easy-going and resourceful which can be an issue some places. The course itself is well maintained, and well designed, ending with the beautiful 18th tee box. The greens play fast and the desert shrubbery aside the fairway can gobble up a miscalculated shot. This is certainly not Troon North but is also a step above your average public course. You will see jackrabbits, cacti, and desert birds. The pro shop has sweet deals, and a small bar for snacks and drink. Rate of play is ideal. I will be teeing off again at Silverado."}
{"text":"This course is fine to play, however we have experienced two issues that need mentioning.  

First, one of our foursome recently had his first ever hole in one here at Silverado.  After the round, we mentioned the feat in the pro shop - and you could have heard a pin drop.  No fanfare whatsoever.  Other courses generally offer to take the information down for publicity purposes - or at least offer hearty congrats - but not here.  

Second, I recently attempted to make a reservation using a 2-rounds-of-golf certificate I had won at a local golf tournament.  The head pro answered my call to the course, and advised me that the course was closed for two weeks for overseeding.  My certificate expired in one week, so I asked if he could honor it right after the course reopened.  You guessed the answer .  .  . . . . .\"No.\"

So it will be a long thime before my shadow again graces this particular course."}
{"text":"First time here, the location to find this place is horrible! My uber driver even got lost, that's the only knock! The price we paid for this course was well worth it. The staff was very nice and even allowed a free rider, but the marshal will be watching you like a hawk! Definitely play here again!"}
{"text":"It's usually cheap and the layout is ok. It is a short course, par 70 that runs through a wash area. It was always in pretty good shape. There is no driving range. It's nothing special but it's fun. Not sure what else to say about this one really.?."}
{"text":"Good bang for your buck. Some interesting holes with elevated tees and course was in good shape. High handicappers can have fun here and play easily under 4 hours. No range but definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Nice course. Use golfnow for tee times. Have golfed here 3 times. Will return!"}
{"text":"Beautiful course with a reasonable mix of Pars. I only made it to the 15 before it became too dark. Though it was busy, I wouldn't say it was overbooked. 
I would definitely go again. 
This time of year it gets really cold towards sunset on this course, bring a sweater!"}
{"text":"Nice course, price was a little high, would have thought GPS would have been included.  Very kid friendly, and other golfers were friendly to my two boys, ages 5 and 7.  I love to play kid friendly courses and this course actually has kid t boxes!  They thought that was way cool!

Gentleman working the register wasn't as polite as the starters."}
{"text":"I played at this course for the first time this past Saturday with some friends & felt the customer service was very poor. From one of the starters who didn't communicate with the pro shop to know that we were a foursome and wanted to be confrontational and act like we couldn't play together(until he found out he was in the wrong) to the beverage girls who seemed like we were bothering them every time they came around and we wanted to purchase drinks or food. Just overall bad customer service and felt that we were an inconvenience to almost every employee that we came into contact with."}
{"text":"Fun course for a reasonable price.  The course is in pretty good shape in the summer and has a great lounge.  A good place to have fun with friends and family."}
{"text":"I like this course, lots of grass, I don't really care for the typical desert courses found all over the valley. I will warn you this is a very slow course. Our tee time was 9:08 and we didn't even get started until like 9:30, we waited at almost every hole but only for like 5-7 minutes, not absurd but it does add up over 18 holes. It took about 5 1/2 hours to play 18 holes, a bit longer than I like. I only saw a Marshall one time and he just drove by.
    There aren't a lot of hazards on this course which is nice if your are a novice or a crappy golfer like me. However there still are some long & tricky holes if you are a decent golfer."}
{"text":"This course was great! The grass is well manicured, the greens were a bit sandy but they rolled true and quick. Good thing the price includes cart because it's a long drive around in neighborhoods but goes by quick. I played in the middle of the day on Thurs. and didn't have to wait at all! 3 hour round and played one of the best I have ever. Great value and everyone there was nice, bring cash because no ATM. Would def recommend and play there again!"}
{"text":"Silverado should not be classed as a bargain golf course but I was able to score a good price online. Having said that, let's look at this course. 4 star clubhouse and restaurant, beautiful putting green and pitching area.
Unfortunately,  there's no driving range but there is a net for warming up the driver. The area can, especially after a hard rain, become very flooded. So bring mosquito spray with you. 
Silverado is located just south of McCormick Ranch and about 20 minutes from Sky Harbour air port.   
I hope you get a chance to play Silverado. Take a few extra bottles of cold water, look for some specials and enjoy this great desert golf course."}
{"text":"Booked the round online with no mention of the course being plugged. Received an email from the manager saying the greens were airified and if we want to cancel we could. I was fine with it being only the greens except when we teed off we found out it was the entire course. This is a complete waste of a round, holes, mud and sand all over the place.  Next time close the course or fully disclose to every one so no one wastes their money."}
{"text":"Played this course more times than I could count and for some reason I am just now getting to this review. Its a fun track you can score easily on. The advanced golfer may not be challenged as most holes are pretty straight. Its a great summer course because of prices and availability. If you play really early in the morning you can be done with a round in under 4 hours no problem. If you play late in the afternoon there are some really views around the scottsdale area. 18 is really fun par 3."}
{"text":"There are a lot of great reasons to rate this course highly, and then there are a few others that get me a little heated....

Pros:

- Central location in the Scottsdale area
- Grass is typically in great shape, despite getting a lot of play
- Rates are extremely affordable. The best value in Scottsdale for a round of golf throughout the year
- Good mix of challenging and easy holes for all skill levels
- Not a lot of desert to mess around with and virtually no water to worry about either (except for 18)
- Great views off of the tee at #14 and #18
- Cart girls here are usually pretty good
- Staff has always been courteous and good when I've played here

Cons:

- No driving range....
- No driving range.... 
- No driving range....
- Slow pace of play on late afternoons and weekends. They really overload the course and it can get very backed up 
- Marshall's aren't present too often to regulate the pace in my experience

If you're looking for a great value, open fairways, and to have a generally good time with most skill sets, this is your place. Just don't plan on getting in a warm up or playing a quick round."}
{"text":"I'm still new to golf, but I've played this course 3 times. Still experimenting around the valley but found Silverado to be among the better kept courses. My only complaint is no driving range which means I have to go elsewhere to practice long balls. 

Otherwise, the staff has always been friendly to me and the course is beautiful. 
Went to practice putting for an hour or so and the gentleman at the bar gave me a free soda. Plus, who doesn't like complimentary cool wet towels at the end of a round? No issue with speed of play, which you'd think is because I'm still new, but you'd be surprised. (Western Skies, I'm talking to you.)

Definitely will continue to be a frequent course for me. Try it out."}
{"text":"Great Place To Golf  Lounge is Good As Well Food Good Reasonable Priced. Lots of Perks Like the Lounge Great Location"}
{"text":"I don't golf at all but like to ride my bike along the multi-use path from McDonald Drive to Pima.  I watch out for the golfers and occasionally have to duck or at least honker down when I hear \"fore\".  To me the golf course doesn't look too exciting but then again I don't golf.  If I were to golf I would never get past the first hole and take too much time.  Others seem to enjoy it and yell when the ball gets close or into the hole.  For me riding my bike is far more enjoyable and very scenic with great views of Four Peaks and sunsets behind Camelback.

Over the past several years I have collected hundreds of stray golf balls.  I save the uniquely marked ones from other golf courses including Silverado but otherwise box the others up.  I have offered them to my nephews to sell but there was little interest.  I finally found someone who wants them for distribution to a youth organization.  Now I can go out and collect more... plus get more exercise which is my primary objective in the first place."}
{"text":"Good fun course. Back 9 is a if fun, and staff is really friendly and helpful! Course is usually in pretty good condition as well"}
{"text":"Iv accompanied my husband to almost all the golf courses in Phx and since past 1 year have nt been playing due to my fracture  . I have never been charged for just riding in the cart b4 but this place charged us 18 bucks .. What a money making trick!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most fun rounds of golf I've played in a long time. Some challenging features, but plays pretty easy. Fairways were immaculate! Beautiful course, and they wiped down my clubs after my round (never had that happen anywhere else). Most definitely worth the very reasonable green fee, and I'll play here again if I ever find myself in Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"My Daughter brought me here to play for my birthday, had a great time!  The service from the check in, to the starter, and being received at the turn, was handled very well.  The course itself was in good shape, the greens were very fast.  Restrooms are adequately placed, water was available throughout the course, probably the only critique would be the lack of beverage cart on the front nine; can live through it."}
{"text":"The course is well-maintained, and it is also forgiving. Very friendly staff and great views! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Worst round of golf I have ever experienced. Way overbooked. Average of 2 foursomes waiting to tee off on every tee box. Never go back."}
{"text":"The course is just average all around.  Paid $30 using golf now and was happy I did not pay any more.  The front nine has numerous holes running parallel and there were two groups that were swearing and about to fight over one hitting into another.  The back nine is more challenging and weaves around between homes.  The front nine was really soft and the greens were kind of beat up.  With so many other places to play I would look around before coming back.  I can't imagine paying what they get for this place when it is not on summer rates."}
{"text":"Played here today for the first time.  Every single person we encountered was wonderful!   Two of our foursome were a bit late & they adjusted us no problem even though they were sold out until noon.  The staff in the pro shop & bar were wonderful.  The felt immediately comfortable there & had a great round of golf.  The course has is great for amateurs, I only lost one ball."}
{"text":"I just went to eat here, I didn't play golf. I had a restaurant.com coupon and honestly it wasn't bad but wasn't anything special either. I really couldn't even use my coupon b/c it didn't have food expensive enough to spend close to $50 for the coupon. The food was good, but just basic chicken tenders and burgers type of menu. The service was good, not too many ppl in here when I went. It's a tiny little restaurant with a western theme. I don't think I would go back here unless I was in the area."}
{"text":"11:30 tee time, finally hit the first tee at 12:15.  Followed with almost a six hour round of golf.   Not a marshal in site to speed up play.  Our group waited almost half an hour just to tee off on a par three.  I've been to this course quite a few times over the past couple of years.  It is a nice layout and usually in good shape, however after today, never again.  Having a good round of golf is all about establishing a rhythm.  You will never establish that here."}
{"text":"Played here three times this week. My favorite in the Scottsdale area. Book on GolfNow.com. February prices have been around $60 per round of golf"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch or a late breakfast. Reasonable prices and good food. The patio is especially nice when the weather is cool. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a golfer. There. That's how I chose to start this review. So take this for what its' worth ... 

I've played maybe a dozen times, usually public courses in miami/orlando/atlanta. I was in Scottsdale for business and had a day off so I took advantage of this by making a tee time online for 3:15pm on a Friday the night before. 18 holes and cart included was $30. Free tees, and another $25 for rental clubs and I was on my way. 

I got to play by myself (bonus, because I hate slowing people down ... I mean, I shot 110) and enjoyed this 18 more than any other (except for a course I once played in Orlando with my father, for sentimental reasons). 

The course was very well kept, much better than any I've played on in Miami or southern LA. First time playing in Arizona was beautiful and amazing to appreciate the contrast between the red clay and green, green fairways. 

Not much water, but just enough for me to lose 3 balls in it (I lost 9 total, again, I'm not that good). Freeways line the start of the back 9.  A little distracting. I think I hit 3 balls into ongoing traffic. Regardless, it only got better from there. 

Gorgeous 13th and 15th and 16th holes, among the others. Beautiful semi-island par-3 on 18. I played until dark, nailed a 20ft put, almost birdied 3 in a row, and had an awesome time - very memorable - and happy as hell I took the initiative to play 18 on my day off even though its not my sport. 

I would recommend it. This course was beautiful."}
{"text":"Course was in great shape except for hole 1 which was being aerated but you couldn't beat the price.
No driving range, but a very large putting green.
Fairways are forgivable on some holes and target golf on others. Not too many hazards which will keep your ball in play.
Love this course but it's a little far to go from my house."}
{"text":"Oh the joys of playing a value course where customer centric culture was founded by the Madoff school of business.  Ladies and Gents, my review:

Good: 
-Great condition.  Greens and fairways are well kepy.
-Fairly forgiving.  I love playing a desert course made for the average player.

Bad: 
-No driving range
-No gps, but...eh...is a value course
-Hard to find.  Needed to pull out my sundial and compass to triangulate my position.

Ugly:
-Marshall on us 5 times.  Total time: 4:20.  We were somewhat slow due to the fact that we had our other twosome play from the womens tees.  I have nothing against the ladies, but the marshall should know that it takes an average of 90 seconds to get back in your cart and have the other group tee off!
-The caddies that helped clean our tees, which we generously tipped, made remarks Charlie Sheen would be proud of: said we played a 4:30 round (when it was 4:20), argued about the marshall pushing us, and overall was focused on proving some unknown point to a paying customer!

Suggestion: 
-Don't play here!  Rude service with a locals only attitude.  I felt like i was surfing on somebodys turf.  Out of towners beware...you are not welcomed...except for your benjamins!

On to Legends Trail!"}
{"text":"Great course. For a public course it was in great shape. Greens ran true and the fairways were immaculate. Would play here again. Pace of play on a busy Sunday 4:15"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Course was very nice! The coyote crossing the green at the 9th hole was a nice touch! We went to another course the day before and the staff were miserable! Thanks Silverado..can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Have played Scottsdale Silverado four times in the past three weeks.  This is a fun track that has just enough trouble to keep the average golfer honest.  The fairways and rough have all been overseeded, so the visual appeal is there.  There are a few thin spots, but all in the rough - and that's why it's called rough.  It isn't supposed to be pristine and we aren't really supposed to be there.  The back nine is infinitely more interesting than the front nine.  Greens roll true, though they aren't the prettiest I've seen - it looks like more grass is needed in spots, but it doesn't affect the play.  I like the course and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Decent value course but not scenic.  Fairways were okay.  Greens were decent.  Some patches were a little rough but not overly."}
{"text":"I feel like I owe it to Silverado and the Yelp community to update my original review from a few days ago.  After our awful first experience, my husband wrote an email to Silverado's upper management.  We received a very fast (and polite) response apologizing for the cashier's poor judgement in charging us an unnecessary rider's fee.  They are mailing my husband a gift certificate in hopes that he will give Silverado another chance... We really appreciate that."}
{"text":"This is a great course that can be very forgiving. The front 9 is wide open and the back 9 has more of a desert course feel. 

It can get backed up really quick so allow 5+ hours if you go late morning. While it can be a bit slow it is a great course overall."}
{"text":"Great course, great greens. Fairways were in good conditions. The club house did not have a lot of options. The staff was a hoot. Seemed to have some strange city laws due to some holes being on city property."}
{"text":"Nice, easy course but beware: you can reserve a threesome to find out that an old man will be your fourth, and he wants to date you.  He proudly boasts that he only paid $20 when you and your peers paid $65/pp. Yickes!"}
{"text":"Fun layout for the casual golfer. Great greens, fairways and rough in excellent condition, tee boxes well kept. Their staff are quite friendly and helpful. Pace could have been a bit faster...7:08 time played in 4.5 hours, but well marshaled. Water every couple holes. Not too many houses to hit. Lots of gallery on the walking path throughout the course. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"They sell your e-mail address to spammers!

If you reserve your tee time with them online, they will sell your e-mail address to Viagra and penis enhancement spammers. It happened to me. I used a unique e-mail address with them and next thing I know, I start getting spam on that e-mail address. 

I confronted them about it and they denied it and didn't take any action which makes them worse.

The golf facilities are mediocre so don't even bother."}
{"text":"Just visiting from out of town so I decided for an inexpensive course to play. Can't complain on the rate, $40 thru Golfnow.  Course in GREAT condition.....However, not really challenging.  Plays short, even from the tips it's like 6300 yds, little adulation or bunkers. 

Not bad for a beginner and the price"}
