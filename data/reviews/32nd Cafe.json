{"text":"Great Mexican and American classic diner food served in a homey, spotless and unassuming storefront behind a Starbucks on Thomas. You could feel the love and pride. Families are clearly welcome here! The patroness is a handsome woman of a certain age in a crisp white shirt, apron and marcelled (go look it up) jet black hair who hugged and kissed the little kids that came in with their families. B/W pictures from the 50's show her as an attractive and confident young woman striding down city streets. The food is home cooked and delicious and served on long tables or comfortable booths. I went for breakfast. Best huevos ranchero I've ever had in 35+ years. Enchilada sauce made with fresh ingredients not that soulless stuff out of a can. Great big perfectly cooked eggs served over corn tortillas. Great re-fried beans and rice, too and good strong coffee in a bottomless cup and all for around seven bucks. What a great way to start the day and to think the mechanic at Discount Tire steered me to Sonics across the street for a \"decent breakfast\". We gotta support local wonders like this before they disappear and all that's left are the Bells and Sonics of the world."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant with great authentic mexican food. I've had about everything on the menu and it's all very good. Feels as if our moms are cooking in the kitchen. :)"}
{"text":"Exactly the kind of spot I love: small, homey, with good food and owners who are there and care. 

I go here for breakfast once a week or so. The Huevos Rancheros is spectacular. All the egg dishes are good. The breakfasts are typically 3 eggs and cheaper than most places that only give you two. 

For classic Mexican dishes and breakfasts this place can't be beat. 

And if you're in a hurry they are super quick. 

Can be a bit hard to find. Look for the little strip mall behind Starbucks."}
{"text":"I love this spot for breakfast and lunch. It's run by a Mexican family and serves Mexican food, but it's also a great spot for a traditional American breakfast and lunch. I took a family member today who was from out of town and she loved it! We both ordered the French toast breakfast which comes with eggs, bacon or sausage, and chips and salsa. Sounds like a strange combo but I always crave something sweet after eating something salty, so the chips are a great start! After the food came my cousin and I quickly cleared our plates. The French toast is made perfectly here and my bacon was the right amount of crispy. The staff here is very attentive and always made sure we were taken care of. I've been here a few times before and have had some of their Mexican menu items and the cheese burger and all have been very good. This is a great lunch spot if you have multiple people who can't decide on what to eat."}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican food I've ever had, just as good as my mother in law's. My Mexican husband agrees!  Can't believe I've lived in the area all these years and never knew about it. My fave is the huevos rancheros. Delish!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food around! Clean and friendly place. Authentic and meaty for the price. Highly recommend for people who love quality food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"This is near my work and I eat here just about weekly. I love the food, the owner, and the feel of the place. This is somewhere I enjoy bringing friends and family to. The salsa is unbelievably good and food is so fresh and affordable."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!
Rebecca is absolutely DARLING!~  Love the service & the atmosphere   Giving you 10 stars if there were.  Muah!~"}
{"text":"If I have to give a star I guess I will.

I believe you have to try to find at least one positive aspect out of every dining experience.  So lets start on a positive note. The staff at 32nd Cafe are very friendly and accommodating. They truly like to make their guests feel welcomed.  However, I think the server was thrown when she took our plates and there was very little food eaten.

Now for the not so pleseant aspects. The food at 32nd Cafe is very disappointing.  If it was possible to give no stars  I would however, that's not an option, so if  I have to give a star I guess I will give one.

The food at 32nd Cafe is poorly excuted and to be honest just has a bad taste. The salsa tastes like ketchup, and every entrée is smothered in the same bland-tasting sauce and covered in cheese. Covering entrées in cheese does not make the entree taste better. Bad tasting food is worse then food that lacks taste. There's nothing authentic or delicious on the menu.  It just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Bought the, sausage, potatoes and egg burrito.  It was good and very huge! It had a side of tortilla chips & salsa, which was very tasty.  Very good breakfast meal."}
{"text":"So I saw this place when I was out driving around and decided to take a chance on em... I wasn't disappointed! I got the sopes and I enjoyed them thoroughly. The meat was flavored well, the sopes wasn't hard and dried out, the beans and rice that came with it were quite tasty as well.  What really made them stand apart was their service though. Everyone in their was beyond friendly... So much so I was gonna give 4 stars but I had to give em 5! Go check em out!"}
{"text":"A mom and pop spot that attracts locals on the weekend for menudo--
32nd Cafe serves a combination of American and Mexican fare.  It is not the best Mexican food in east Phoenix, but I do recommend the Chorizo.  I haven't tried their burgers or fries, so I'll leave that task to someone else.

I like the feel of the place.  It is old and clean.  When you walk in, there is a definite feeling that the other customers there are regulars, which gives me confidence any time I walk into a bar or restaurant.

While I have not had everything on the menu, I have had their Chorizo burrito, and it is solid.  Every now and then, a man who has drank enough tequila for two men in the prior evening needs chorizo the next day.  This would be a good place to go on that occasion."}
