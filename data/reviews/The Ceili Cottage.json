{"text":"Myself and my boyfriend, along with a couple of friends, decided to check their brunch menu out one Sunday afternoon on a BEAUTIFUL day in Toronto!!

We sat out on the patio, first scoring a table for four out in full view of the sun, but thankfully re-locating to a recently vacated table in the shade. The patio was full so the service wasn't as attentive as in other places, but it was good nonetheless. We ordered pints and the Irish Breakfast ($15).

The layout of the menu was a bit messy and confusing to follow, with the brunch menu stuck near the bottom of the page overpowered by the snack selections printed over top them. 
 
While waiting for our meals, I ventured inside the empty cottage (as everyone was sitting out on the patio). Myself having spent several years living in Ireland and my boyfriend being from there, we felt that it really pulled off the old rustic cottage look and feel to the place very well, very similar to what you would find in the rural parts of Ireland. This was achieved by the thick wooden tables and log cabin ambiance. The bar was massive and from what I could tell, had a fair bit to choose from. The washrooms were also very nice and clean.

Our meals took over 45 minutes to come out. Even though we were reassured by our waitress that it was being plated 20 minutes into waiting, when we asked another waitress at the 30 minute mark how much longer it would be, she revealed to our surprise that the Irish Breakfast always takes a minimum of 20 minutes from the time of ordering to be prepared. Funnily enough, this little tin bit of information was nowhere divulged beside the dish on the menu, or verbally once ordered. Frankly, we had no idea why it took so long, as it was the worst Irish Breakfast we have ever eaten, and we've lived in Ireland!! Oh, and it doesn't come with toast, if you want a side of it, it'll cost you $3! My boyfriend was not impressed hearing this after he asked the waitress for a side.

Where do I begin, the rashers, if you want to call them that, were like min steaks, way too thick and quite chewy. The beans were just that, beans, probably dumped out of tin can. My Irish boyfriend commented that their potato farl were definitely not made fresh as he's had so many back home, he knew the difference. Small portion sizes were also a voiced complaint among us. The black pudding was quite dry and so tasted like sawdust. I found the banger to be a bit too greasy, whereas my boyfriend found it edible, although he found it to be leathery on the outside. The fried egg was good, but really overall, nothing special here. There are better versions out there, trust me!!

Overall, the service was good, the food horrible, however, the beautiful weather and patio seating made up for it. Total bill for the two of us $65. 

My Irish boyfriend refuses to go back!"}
{"text":"We went here for the oysters and were impressed. We ordered Shucker's Best Mixed Plate (12 oysters) and ended up getting 6 more because they were so good. We had a 1 year old and 9 year old and they both got mac and cheese (with bacon), which was delicious (lots of flavour). Our server was great too! Her beer recommendations were solid and she suggested a Shirley Temple for our son, which he loved! We will definitely be back, especially when we want oysters."}
{"text":"We got food poisoning. 

I Went there with a party of 7 this Saturday night. They seemed slammed so the service was just okay. Maybe they could hire more staff on busy nights since the venue is pretty cool.  

The beer was great and we all had a great time. We sat in the back and the food tasted pretty good. 

My bf and I decided to share their BBQ special and it was great! Tasted amazing. 

The reason for my rating is that both of us woke up with stomach aches the next morning. He ate much more of the food than I did and feels sick even 24 hrs later. Please take care to cook your food properly. My bf tells me that he is still vomiting. 

Your venue is good. As is your staff. But please take your time cooking your food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this part Irish bar, part Irish restaurant. There was just the 2 of us on a friday night for dinner and we had to wait for a table, but we were able to wait at the bar and have a drink. The dining area is pretty small. We had some oysters, the house-made terrine, mac n cheese, and the sticky toffee pudding - All was delicious. Good for a casual night out of food and drinks."}
{"text":"Been to the Ceili Cottage a few times now and have never been disappointed.  The service has always been great, as well as the food.  

I have had the Oysters,  Mac & Cheese, Wild Boar Burger, Lamb Curry, Corned Beef, and Roasted Pig.  All delicious.  

They have some great beers on tap and a great patio.

i have noticed some hatred for the waitstaff on many sites, but i just don't get it.  Never had any issues!"}
{"text":"Great smaller Irish pub. The mushrooms on toast was actually not great at all. 4 cups of mushrooms on soggy bread that you need to dig for. I think I'm actually turned off mushrooms for life after sharing that app. Not worth the $16 one bit. The 4 stars are for the oysters. They clearly know what they're doing in that field. Friendly staff as well"}
{"text":"Sticky toffee pudding great!! Service so-so only. Grit in my soup... Was hoping for better. Great atmosphere .... Oysters were... Fine. Great atmos to drink."}
{"text":"Amazing. Food is always top notch. Great atmosphere. Great patio during the summer, and excited they'll be bringing back the \"Yurt\" next winter!"}
{"text":"We have been to Ceili Cottage for many years and the food and drink have been alright, but we have never been for Sunday brunch, what a disappointment. We ordered eggs Florentine, but we were given regular eggs benedict on a bed of assorted greens on the tiniest piece of bread. The few pieces of fruit were fresh, but would it have broken the bank to put each egg on it's own piece of bread?  As well, for the price you charge (not a cheap brunch menu) why can't you add hash browns or some kind of potatoe. FYI, Bread and potatoes are cheap and filling. When we mentioned to the waitress that we did not get what we ordered, (eggs Florentine) she looked lost, she didn't apologize or offer a remedy. This is just bad customer service. We will return for a pint, but pass on the food simply because there are many places in the area that give you your moneys worth and Ceili's Cottage is not one of them."}
{"text":"Guess I'm a \"quasi-regular\" here, having spent time on the patio, at the bar, and in the Yurt (!). Best-poured pint of Guinness in the city. Most delicious Rack of Lamb. Enjoy sitting at the bar most... with a pint of Guinness and Bangers-and-Mash on the way. The patio can be pleasant, but offers little in the way of respite from a hot sunny day. The Yurt's fun. Do it once, then go back to the bar. Service is great at the bar; can be (very) slow on the patio when it's full (but even then the kitchen came through with a great meal worth the wait). Skip the Yorkshire Pudding unless you're prepared to do battle with it. Guinness is an easier way to get your carbs anyway. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Brilliant food and one of the better assortments of beers at a gastro pub in Toronto... Never been disappointed when I have been there... Except for Sat nights when they go to capacity, and I can't get in :-("}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times now. The food is hit and miss. The service is  more miss than hit. 

I hope they find their stride soon because it has the makings of a really good place. Until then I'm still happy with my spot on the patio at the Curzon."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this cozy little pub! The service is always consistently friendly (bartenders are also pretty hilarious) and the food is hearty and delicious. We had our staff party in the yurt and in spite of the large table - drinks and food came out in food time. The vintage record player and tunes were choice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The 4 of us just walked out due to an issue with one of the servers. Ceili Cottage is now under new management, and maybe this is indicative or an isolated incident, I'm not sure. I live down the street and will not be back. When the yurt disappeared I knew it could be a bad omen.  :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed after stopping by Ceili Cottage for lunch today. My friend placed an order for a gin & tonic and burger with salad and I had a pint and ordered a Melton Mowbray Pie.  Five minutes later I was advised the pie wasn't available.  My second choice, Bangers and Mash also not available. So I gave up and ordered the burger and salad, the burger well done please!  The burgers were brought out and after the waitress explained, \"so that you don't get confused\", that the red squeeze bottle is ketchup and the yellow one mustard, off she went and we dived into the burgers.  

Specifically the medium, not well done burgers.  My friend who has a stomach for pink meat kept on eating.  I, on the other hand, get nauseous at the sight of uncooked meat, got up to find the waitress who had disappeared from sight.  Inside the bar there wasn't a single staff member to be found.  After yelling hello for a couple of minutes I went to the kitchen door and finally got the attention of a cook.  I asked if he could get the waitress and he shrugged, looked at the plate and grumbled \"I don't know\".  So, seeing the apron I said \"well I'm just wondering if I can get this cooked some more...I can only eat well done meat\".  He grabs the plate and inserts his full dirty, greasy thumb (seriously, whole thumb) into the burger patty and says \"it is well done\".  To which i say\"I mean like no red, well done\". He sighs in exasperation, turns his back and mutters that he'll throw it back on the grill.  

Without a word I go back outside to the patio and to my friend who is now half done his lunch.  Strangely, the waitress has yet to make an appearance during this entire time.  Well, now after another five minutes, she comes out to the patio and says \"sorry, but the chef won't cook your burger any further and is unwilling to cook you another burger but ...we can offer you something else from the menu\"!  My mouth, fully agape, stutters \"seriously\"? My friend who just finished his last bite, says no, just the bill.  She apologizes but then says,\" well, I looked at the meat and it looked well done\". But, I say, it's still bright pink in the middle to which she says \"well, actually that means it's well done\".  Now losing patience I retort, \"well done means fully cooked\". And what does she say???  \"Well, actually, we don't cook ANY of our meats well done here, not even our sausages\"!!!  To which I replied, perhaps you should have told me that when I ordered a well done burger.  

So one hour after arriving,we leave; me with an empty stomach.  But before we leave the waitress bring the bill and announces, as though she's done us a favour, that they are not charging for the burgers.  Seriously??  You mean for the burger I didn't get.  And the burger my friend had to eat on his own. Thanks a bunch.  

I write this because I can only guess that the owners don't know that their chef is a $&!* and should be replaced and the waitress needs a few tips....like only answer questions you are asked.  Not to be rude, but I have an hour for lunch so I don't feel like the waitress speaking for half of it.  If I wanted to know where the pub sources all of its food from sausages to mushrooms, I would have asked!  And no need to tell me what Melton Mowbray Pie is after I've placed the order (if I hadn't of known, I would have asked before ordering it).  

After having gone there for over four years I won't be going again.  The patio is nice, but that's it now.  Theres are tons of other pubs and patios nearby.  Not to mention, my backyard is nicer, beer cheaper, my burgers don't moo and there is no waitress nearby who likes educate you about the in and outs of condiment bottles and redefine basic common cooking terms."}
{"text":"Regularly solid restaurant year round
Great rotating beers
Perfect patio
Chalkboard interesting specials daily
Appeals to all diets - but has lots of hearty options for meat eaters and seafood lovers
Great oysters
Service could be more consistent and friendly - but it IS generally quite busy. We've never needed a rez tho. 
Try it!"}
{"text":"I live near the Queen and Coxwell area and have walked/driven by The Ceili Cottage several times and was attracted by the patio and what seemed like a majority of locals having a good time, especially when the sun is out.  

Food (4/5): The chalkboard annouces the soup of the day and 2 specials (daily roast + catch of the day).  There is a daily roast item, Friday was steak night.  I ordered and shared kettle chips, a half-dozen Maritime oysters, the cheese plate, the mac & cheese, and a salad.  Given the reputation of the owner, you will be happy to learn that the oysters were the highlight.  They come with 3 delicious sauces: one is chopped shallots marinated in a sparkling wine, another a very hot hot sauce (even hot by ethnic standards), and a nice cocktail sauce - all home made.  The mac & cheese was very good.  Must be a popular item since everyone at the table next to us ordered it (3 ppl).  The menu is simple and fits with the casual feel of Ceili Cottage.  

Drinks (5/5): They had my favorite beer - the McAuslan Apricot Wheat Ale on tap.  Had 10 different beers on tap with a good variety of local brews, seasonal varieties, and major brands.  Good selection of wine and whiskey as well.  Pints were reasonable at $6-7.  For the serious drinkers, there was even a Cask Ale.  

Ambiance (4/5): The patio seats about 60 people.  Mixed crowd, with more locals I would say.  The patio is a good size, so it's not super loud even though all seats were taken.  Only problem is that there seems to be a fair bit of smokers on the patio at any given time, so if that bothers you then there's not much you can do... you can't feel too annoyed b/c the patrons here are quite polite, one smoker even asked if we minded before he puffed away.  The inside had a cottage feel, but I think the patio is the better of the 2 spots to be.  

Service (4/5): We came around 630pm on a beautiful Friday and managed to get one of the last tables for 2.  I don't think reservations are taken so it's nice to know that you don't have to show up at 430pm to get a seat here.  Service was friendly and no fuss.  Just the right amount of trips to our table and we were not rushed. 

Value (4/5): with 2 pints of beer each and 4-5 menu items to share, all inclusive total was $80.  We were stuffed, had enough to drink, and enjoyed the night.  

Definitely a place that I would visit again, but next time I will order more oysters and less of the other food."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place on a Friday night. As we arrived on a cool summer day, the patio was completely full. They however managed to seat us at a cozy table inside.
The waiter was very friendly. The downside was that I felt like having their striploin steak but was informed that they are sold out for the night. We arrived at around 9pm so I guess it was perhaps too late.
We ordered lamb shank and bangers and mash. Each dish was $17-18. The bangers and mash were very fresh and flavorful served in a salty beef broth.  The lamb was not very flavorful and was served with a mixture of fresh carrot and root veggies.
We also ordered a dozen of mixed oysters for $40 however 6 of the 12 were the Canadian oysters which were tiny and flavorless. On the flip side the other two kinds that we received were irish and we're large creamy + full of flavor. 
Since the oysters came after our meal, the waiter apologized and gave us a beer on the house.
Overall the service and ambiance were good . The damage was $91 + tip for a meal for two and one beer. Overall it was a good experience. It's a great date place."}
{"text":"Great patio and chilled vibes. The Irish breakfast was one of the best I've had in Toronto. Girlfriends Mac n Cheese went down very well. Good rotation of Irish and local beers. The inside actually looks like it could be Irish and not like 99% of the other Irish bars in North America that are just terrible rip offs. Great patio"}
{"text":"Very authentic Irish pub.  The environment is what makes this place.  Oh, and the sticky toffee pudding is to die for! The food is okay and the staff are very friendly.

It's the cozy pub environment that wins!! And, in the summer they have a nice patio in front."}
{"text":"Nice patio. Best Macaroni and Cheese I've ever had at a restaurant/pub. Nice and spicy. Almost ordered a second helping. Great selection of Beers. Excellent Service. I will be back multiple times. Rarely do I give a five but this was a great first experience. Great Leslieville restaurant"}
{"text":"Just visited the ceilie cottage for the first time and I am completely in love. I am so thrilled that I live incredibly close to this cozy, friendly little place. And that I've discovered it just in time to enjoy the patio this summer.

A friend and I had went in for a couple of pints and some dinner. Both of us had the roast special (ham today), which was delicious. Served with some kind of mash, root veg, and the most amazing apple sauce either of us has ever tried (apples. mustard? onion? bacon? FTW!) 

Service was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is wonderful - exactly what one would expect of a place called Ceilie Cottage. I can't wait to go back and try some oysters and some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"In reading the petulant, annoyed reviews from patrons who wouldn't eat unless they were in the yurt, I figured it was my turn to write about this wonderful place.

It's more than the yurt, people. It's the food and the atmosphere. If you insist on sitting in a space that's packed when there's room in the main restaurant, I'm not surprised that the servers aren't bending over backwards to get you in there. They run a tight ship, and the way to enjoy the Ceili Cottage is to take a seat wherever there is one, order something and enjoy the food and the ambience. If you can't survive without being in the yurt, pick a quiet night. And be patient. 

I'm gonna back up.

One of the reasons I moved to this neighbourhood was this place. It's quirky and the food is consistently good (if occasionally oversalted, but only occasionally). The soup and bread is almost always just the right thing for dinner in cold weather, the sticky toffee pudding cannot be beat, and there is often something in their specials that I can't pass up. 

Did I mention the bread? Their bread is exemplary, served with rich butter topped with flakes of salt. It's a meal on its own. The side of mushrooms is delicious enough for a main, paired with the bread, and I've had that for dinner more than once. The smoked salmon is light and perfect in summer. Their mash is delicious; friends often have the bangers as a main and I've never had anyone NOT love this place.

I've never been rushed out of the restaurant, and have spent hours in at my table with pleasant service. If you treat the servers well, surprisingly, they're not pissy in return. What a concept, eh?

Regarding the yurt, it's an awesome place for a cozy date in winter. On a quiet night when it's not full of revelers, they play music, check on you frequently to see if you need a drink or something else, and are friendly as hell. 

So there. I've been to this place countless times and have NEVER been rushed or treated rudely. I think you get what you give.

/Git"}
{"text":"So a couple of friends recommended meeting up in this Irish Pub at the edge of Leslieville. Upon arrival there was quite a bit of wait for a table but the owner of the establishment was fairly quick in taking our drink orders and ensured we were able to keep warm inside the bar. The cl*sterf*ck was we were sitting, 4 of us, against some ledge and the owner basically told us we should just stay here for dinner cause this is the best it will get for the night in terms of getting a table. We almost walked out and were tempted to go across the street to Edward Levesque's Kitchen but got lucky and found a spot at the corner of the bar. 

I'm glad we stayed, cause we were able to try the food which was very appealing when looking at the menu. However (yah I know), by the time we were properly seated to order dinner, the bartender informed us that most of the dishes we were going to try were sold out, I personally was looking forward to trying the Mutton Stew but had to settle on the Bangers on Mash. Disappointed but was rejoiced by the dish I did have, the Bangers (sausage) seems to be homemade and had the perfect texture over a warm mountain of mash swimming with gravy at the bottom of the dish, A+ in my books. Great beer selection, our whole party finally settled on their cask beer which was fantastic. I would literally trek to this spot just for this beer and from what the bartender told us, they're one of few places in the city who serve it. 

My advice, it's worth the trek along with a few good friends but be flexible with the menu as it seems they will consistently run out of certain items on some nights. And also be prepared to fight for seats."}
{"text":"The potential was never realized. 

We went in recently and a friend had a skateboard. The server asked us if we wanted some mountain dues. 

The skateboarder is around 30 and makes more in a year than the server will make in his lifetime. 

The time I was in there before, they refused (we asked many different times) to serve us toast (?) with our breakfast. Toast. We asked them to speak with the chef about this and he said that he doesn't like to serve toast with breakfast. It was beneath the meal, apparently. 

Terrible place. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere. They don't enjoy your business and don't deserve it."}
{"text":"Best place to sit is at the bar. I love the beers here. I enjoyed the hard to find Murphy's Stout - (a bit nuttier than Guiness) and the County Durham Hop Addict (if ya drink Molson Canadian or...... get caught photographed with a plastic beer cup labelled as such - don't even try these ya won't like em).  There is a red wine Irish-ly called Hooley Dooley Red. 

Very small space inside so groups greater than 2 will likely not sit together. Great Olde Worlde Decor like a bombed out IRA building with grand ceiling heights. Although they serve full pints, they also serve half pints so you can try a few different beers in one sitting. Oysters with freshly grated horseradish  were extremely popular the night I was there.  Many other items on the menu were interesting and unique..... like Bison Ribs... peanutbutter and jam...
I had no problem with any of the staff during my visit."}
{"text":"Had a great, late-Sunday lunch on the patio. It was a beautiful day and there were just a few people there when we arrived (more came later, but two outside servers seemed to handle everyone just fine). 

Had been meaning to try this place for awhile b/c of Patrick McMurray's great reputation. The food didn't disappoint: simple but well executed all around. We split a soup of the day (vegetable puree), mushrooms on toast and a corned beef on scone, with homemade pickles. They didn't have the cider I picked, but no sweat. We had a cream ale and an iced tea. 

The food at the other tables seemed to go down well -- from the cottage pie and bangers and mash the two Irish guys next to us enjoyed to the oysters and chips another table put away. 

Some might figure the prices as a bit high for this east-end area, but for the quality of the food and the good service we received, I thought it was fair, especially when you consider the below-par food for the same prices at your typical downtown pub. Plus, way nicer bathrooms.

Want to head back on a Sunday for the roast night. 

Definitely a great place for a summer meal on the patio, but the inside looked like it'd be quite cramped if the weather turned for the worse or during wintertime."}
{"text":"I want to love Ceili Cottage. It has a lot of things to recommend it: 
- atmosphere is good, it's a nice conversion from a garage
- good beer on tap
- delicious and fresh pub food, including an excellent sticky toffee pudding
- it's in my neighbourhood

I've been there several times and had fun. Service is often good, and occasionally bad. When it's bad, servers are indifferent, hard to find and even rude. 

A surly waiter isn't enough to turn me off.  I can turn a blind eye and tip less, but they are also very strict about whether you can sit at a table, and that makes me feel unwelcome. 

If you're not eating a meal, they send you to the bar. Once, my husband and I were sent to the bar on a slow Saturday afternoon, with only a handful of customers in the place. The worst experience I had was with a large group of friends. We'd had drinks and a full dinner, when a waiter decided we'd been there long enough and took one of our tables away. While we were still sitting there. Maybe we wanted another drink? Go to the bar! we were told.

I want to love Ceili Cottage. I want it to be my local pub, but it's not relaxed and friendly like a pub. It's more like an uptight restaurant."}
{"text":"What is to be loved about Ceili Cottage is apparent as soon as you walk in the door - exposed brick walls, cozy and cottage-y with a nostalgic cabin fire smell. I liked it right away, it made me feel at home and I instantly devised a list of people to bring back.

The beer selection looks to be formidable, but I don't drink beer and I'm just speculating, so don't listen to me. Ok, let's say that their LIQUOR selection is quite formidable. You can definitely get your drank on and enjoy The Ceili Cottage as a lush.

But as an eater? Maybe not so much. At first glance, the menu is a snacker's dream. I got very excited by all the nibbley options and sampled a pickled egg (ehn) and the oysters (satisfied head nod). Kettle chips with thyme I've been told are decent, and it looks like I'm the only person so far who was quite tickled by the idea of ordering a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. HOWEVER, the menu noted that my beloved PB&J wasn't available that day. Really? The EASIEST thing in the world to make isn't available? Boo to you, menu. 

The meal options weren't great for a non red meat eater like meself. I tried the smoked salmon, which I didn't love. I think I furrowed my brow the entire time I spent eating, which is never a good sign. Otherwise, there's a selection of meaty things for the Irish in you. 

Anyhoods, I'll totally come back to drink and feel cozy - but maybe not for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been a number of times and the food is always excellent.  On my most recent visit I had lamb and lentil soup, with a small cheese board on the side.  The soup was gamey-salty heaven!  I've had the mac-n-cheese, which is also great, and an ostrich burger which I had no expectations for (I'd never eaten an ostrich) but it was very tasty.  

The inside is rustic and interesting, and the patio is great:  they put a yurt on it now (alas, no fermented yak's milk to drink), and in past years have turned it into a skating rink.  

The service has been better the last few times I've been.  In the past, I found it was too cool, and steeped in irony.   Examples:  one of our group ordered a Caesar, and the waiter's response was \"that's a pain in the ass to make.\"   I ordered a Guinness, and then my friend ordered a Guinness too, and the waiter said \"oh, you're original.\"  I realize he was joking and well-intentioned,  but I went there with friends, so they can tell me jokes....and my friends' jokes will be funnier if you just hurry up and get us our drinks.  I don't dine out to be entertained by the staff... but I guess some people do.  That said, everything else about the place is so good that it's worth enduring an aspiring Don Rickles.  And, you get to sit in a YURT!"}
{"text":"HOW does Ceili's not get five stars? 

They have a YURT people. A YURT. It has records and a record player and it is the comfiest place to be in winter. Inside they have irish servers with heavy pours and terrines made of exotic animals. They also have nice wine, and decent folk hanging out and a variety of Oysters. And in the summer the patio is so good you can hardly ever get onto it. What is NOT to love? Seriously, Ceili's is so much fun. Brunch fun, lunch fun, always a good time."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I love it.
The Guinness is lovely- like back home in Ireland.
The food was great too. Plentiful and tasty.
Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.
Will go back ;)"}
{"text":"What's not to like about the cottage? Great oysters. A perfect Queen East patio. And a great atmosphere on a holiday Monday when you're winding down after a long weekend. Ceili cottage is a wee bit of Ireland in Toronto. Slainte."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit this place for a couple of years now, after following them on Twitter, and really enjoying their friendly banter. I also admire their philosophy of local/organic and home made food.

So, tonight (a Sunday), my family of 5 was  heading through the neighbourhood and decided to drop by. We were swayed by the fact that the daily special was roast beef, mashed potatoes with caramelized onions, and fiddleheads. 

We were seated in the patio promptly, our drink order taken. Unfortunately, we detected an unpleasant aroma almost immediately. We peeked through the fence boards and spied the dumpster. We mentioned it to our server, who indicated that tomorrow is garbage day. He moved us to another table right away. 

Our dinner arrived shortly afterward, and although it wasn't terribly hot, it was plated nicely. We tried to catch our servers eye to grab some pepper and horseradish, but it took a while. He informed us that horseradish isn't typically served with roast beef (???), but that he would get us some of the freshly grated stuff. He advised us that it was very hot, but we told him we were okay with that. He brought us a 2oz metal dish of shaved horseradish, but since there were several of us who wanted horseradish, we went through it quickly and asked for another serving. 

That's when things went badly. Our server advised us that fresh horseradish is very expensive, and that it cost $7/pound. He said he might have to charge us for an additional serving. I commented by saying that since he only brought us about 10grams worth, it shouldn't be an issue. He said to me \"are you saying you don't want me to charge you for the horseradish?\". I agreed with that. He said \"why didn't you just say that?\". Really. 

Anyway, service turned quite cold after that. 

I'm sad. I really wanted to like it there. The food was decent, nothing special, but I would have loved it if the server with the charming Irish accent treated us like he valued us. 

I hope others have a better experience."}

I love places where they stick to what they know best. I also love places that have character. That might explain why I don't usually like fusion food because they mix up everything and you don't know where it originated from. The Ceili Cottage is nothing but original with character serving food they know best. 

Even before walking in, my eyes brightened up seeing the actual little cottage! It's a drive out from downtown, but I def did not expect to see a little cottage sitting between buildings. It was just too adorable.

Once I walked in, I already felt so comfortable and fell in love with the atmosphere. It was small but spacious with laid back feel to it and it was screaming 'little cottage'. The Ceili Cottage is separated into 2 sections, one as a dining area and another with a bar. There was live music on the side of the bar which I could hear through this 'window'.

Also check out special of the day on the blackboard. I love the wooden chairs and table as well as the wall...gives the place so much character without trying too hard.

* Served with lemon, horseradish and 3 sauce on the side
* Cocktail sauce, hot sauce and Vinegrette with shallots
* Oysters were fresh and creamy
* I liked mine with cocktail sauce or the vinegrette + horseradish

Ordered: Hashed on Tuesday 4/5

* Double smoked bacon hash with peppers, onions and a fried egg for $10
* It was my first time trying this and it was delicious!
* Very much a comfort food, bacon and onions added much flavor to potatoes
* Kind of reminded me of breakfast but this could be a hearty dinner as well
* Fried egg was just cooked right with runny yolk (beautiful)

Ordered: House Terrine 3/5

* Kagaroo Terrine with Maple Bacon, Sundried cherries served with Crostini and Pickles for $10
* I've never tried kangaroo before in my life!!
* It was a little dry, but the bacon that wrapped the terrine added a bit of fat to it
* It came with some sea salt and grainy mustard on the side which went well with the terrine
* Kagaroo tasted like dry pork 
* Served with beets and pickles, both which complimented the dish
* For $10, it was very much worth it
* Personally, I don't know if I would get it again


Summary: Overall, I really enjoyed my dining experience at The Ceili Cottage. It was relaxing and the service was excellent. Food is solid and I loved the live music. We need more places like this in the city where people can sit down and enjoy their time without having to worry about what they are wearing or what they are eating. Must go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Recently went for dinner at the Ceili Cottage and can't wait to go back. 
As it was a Saturday night the place was packed, luckily we arrived and only had to wait a short time near the bar for a table but others who arrived a little after us were not so lucky (30 to 40 mins).

The ambiance has an \"irish\" feel complete wood beams and whitewashed walls. The staff is friendly and the food and bevies are good. Really enjoyed the music, the beer was fresh but our starter of oysters were terrific - served rusticly with terrific homemade sauces. I tried one of the specials off the black board for dinner (lamb stew) and was not dissappointed - almost a good as my grandmother used to make.  

While my experience was good - they need to get a handle on the crowd control situation - hence the three star thing."}
{"text":"If i could give this place a big fat 0 for customer service i would give it a negative 10,  was just there about and hour ago.  Patio was full with a line-up so we decided we would eat in the dank cellar of a bar/restaurant they have.  There were two tables in the interior with people.  So we sat at the high top that had four chairs. Well F**k you if that's were you would like to sit and spend your money.  A waiter approached us and ask how many would be sitting there DUH there are two of us.

We were told we could sit there but if four people happen to come in we would have to move.  We left.  We were going to have a bottle of wine or two some appetizers and a full dinner.  I guess they don't really care about the business they have just the business they might have later.  Will never go back.

note:  this is an edit after reading my review i thought i sounded a bit like a complainer...if the waiter was nice to us and had approached us more kindly when that \"table for four\" came in and asked us to move  for say a free drink or anything else i would have obliged but to be put us on the spot at the beginning just was a turn off... had to get that off my chest"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place. A girlfriend and I went in at 11pm on a Friday night and couldn't get a seat there were so many people. We managed to snag a corner at the bar and a couple drinks. It cleared out a bit, and we got to chat with the bartender, who was very friendly and entertaining. The setup of the tables and chairs was a bit awkward, but it looks like it's a great spot during patio season. Can't wait to go back and check it out and try some eats."}
{"text":"I invited some friends here for Sunday brunch as I was in the mood for a \"Full Irish Breakfast\" and had never been to the Ceili Cottage. We were all hungry and ordered quickly. For some reason, our three breakfasts (all exactly the same dish) took 25-30 minutes to arrive which seems far too long for a simple breakfast that you could cook at home in 10 minutes flat.

When it did arrive, the food was average at best. The mushrooms were overcooked, the beans tasted like they had been sitting in a pot for quite some time and the sausages really didn't taste that good at all. The bacon had shrivelled up and the whole dish just tasted a bit bland and stale, like we were eating leftovers from the breakfast rush.

We also found the service a bit lacking and the waiter a bit arrogant for want of a better word. Maybe we caught them on an 'off' day but I doubt we will be back any time soon to give the place another try."}
{"text":"Very authentic Irish feel in the pub. The designs, music, and food was all consistent with the Irish cultural theme. For those who aren't use to it, the food is very plain though this is very consistent with the Irish culture. Food isn't heavily seasoned, use of sauces were limited. However, the environment is very lively. It's also very popular, I always see tons of people at the patio in the summer. It's a really nice place to hang out not only on the weekends but on most days of the week."}
{"text":"Went to Ceili Cottage on Friday night... wasn't too sure what to expect with a name like Ceili Cottage, but was very pleasantly surprised to find a cozy, Irish watering hole. Apparently during the summer months they have an extensive patio (which I can see there is tons of room for), but now that it's very cool and almost wintery outside, the only seating available is indoors, making it a very crowded little place. I would say that every table was occupied. 

I did not eat their food as I'd already eaten dinner, but noticed some really interesting selections up on the chalk board... I'll definitely have to check that out another time. 

They didn't have my favourite cider (Strongbow) so I had a pint of Harp to start (which is a light beer, but a smidge hoppy for my taste) and a pint of Magner's (generally not my favourite to start, but not so bad as pint #2). 

It seems to me that they are very deliberate about their offerings, keeping things to the \"road less travelled by\" types of things... for example, they do not have a fully stocked bar, so when we wanted to do shots (we were celebrating a friend's successful completion of her PhD), they only thing available was Jagger (fine with me, but not a popular choice over all). Also, when my friends wanted rye and cokes, they do not have standard soda offerings like Coke or Pepsi... they had some really small, imported brand, which was apparently tasty. I just thought it was interesting that they stay away from the big brand, regular stock kind of stuff and keep to the imports and local items only.

Our server was hilarious and attentive, making it overall a very enjoyable night."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, knowledgeable servers.  The oysters are amazing, the cheese board is excellent. The patio is really nice in the summer if you can get a table there. In the winter it always feels like space is a bit of a pinch."}
{"text":"Thumbs up for their huge patio! Not enough staff to check on patrons, but they were friendly when they made their way around to you. The clam chowder was just alright which was a disappointment seeing as it was highly rated on their menu and priced at $12 a bowl. At least it's ocean friendly. The macaroni and cheese portion was huge and I hear the stew was quite filling. We also had the humus and vegetable plate; the humus portion was generous, not quite enough crackers or vegetables to dip. 

I'd come back for the patio and just get some brews. If you're here for fries, they don't have a deep frier but they do have chips."}
{"text":"Friends of ours treated us to a $50 gift certificate to this place since it's a stone's throw away from our house. I've been here a few times for a pint or two on the patio. I haven't had the opportunity to sit inside yet. Bathrooms are pretty nice. Service is decent. 
We tried the food for the first time yesterday. I ordered the mac n' cheese and my man ordered the salmon. My mac n cheese was way too salty. I adore salt so for me to say it was way too salty says a lot. According to some other reviews and the table next to us, they give glowing reviews of the mac n' cheese so maybe there was an accident in the kitchen yesterday and a box of salt dropped into the mac n' cheese. 
I always feel like a jerk sending food back to the kitchen but I couldn't even eat it. The waitress didn't seem impressed that I was sending it back and she didn't let me know if they were going to take it off the bill or not (they did). They must've used up all the salt for my dish because the salmon was very bland. 
Unfortunately, we had to use the entire $50 certificate. They couldn't let us go with the remainder so they gave us two desserts to take away. One was sticky toffee pudding and the other was the chocolate & bailey's tart. The sticky toffee pudding was a bit too rubbery in texture but had a pleasant enough flavour. The chocolate & bailey's tart was very rich and sweet. 
Despite our bad experience with the food, I give this place 4 stars because I really like their patio and I like it as a convenient drinking place close to home."}
{"text":"I live far from there but when I'm in the easy end I go to Ceili. It's the most authentic Irish pub in the city! Amazing drinks and food and great staff. If you haven't experienced a St. Paddys Day there then you better mark your calendar for next year :)"}
{"text":"Great at the bar, with the Leafs game playing.  Bartenders were friendly and efficient.  
Mussels, pate, and green salad (surprisingly) were all good.

But...

BEST OYSTERS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  Plump, fresh, salty, well shucked, great additions on the side if you needed to add anything to them (which I didn't). 

Cannot say enough, especially following the foul oyster experience I had at Bestellen recently."}
{"text":"The Ceili Cottage is a simple little place with great service, great oysters and a very good whiskey selection.  I've been here with friends, with my teen boys and on my own after a late night at work for a quick meal and I've never been disappointed.  If I lived a little closer I'd call it my \"local\".

Love the bar, love the service, love the brunch."}
{"text":"I really liked Ceili Cottage both times i went. 
The first time was just for drinks and chats with a friend. A glass of house red sitting at the bar was awesome! I loved the atmosphere, so cozy inside with exposed brick and vaulted ceilings, books and neat trinkets on little shelves, and a HUGE wall o' whiskey. We chatted away until closing time without even noticing the place was emptying out. The bartender was really nice, not rushing us at all. \"You can stay if you don't mind us cleanin' up a bit!\" Sure thing.
The second time I returned was for a bite to eat. I had heard the mac & cheese was somethin' special so i thought i'd try it. I did enjoy it, but i think i'd give it a 3 star. I prefer my macaroni and cheese saucy. But again the service and atmosphere was awesome. I can't wait to come back and have a few drinks on the patio in the spring.
p.s. free wifi! Just ask the server for the password."}
{"text":"To date, this is my favourite pub in Toronto. I've been meaning to stop in for ages and whilst on a hearty bike ride from the east end to the west end, my friend and I spotted this homey little place with it's unassuming white picketed patio.There weren't any spaces in the shade, so we opted for indoors since my Ginger pal isn't much of a sun bunny.

6 oysters were pricey at $20, but Irish oysters are among my faves so I sprung for them. My fave are Galway Flats, but they were featuring some other Irish ones that were almost as delicious-- especially when washed down with a Guinness. The brackish scent of fresh oysters, beer and whiskey was heavy in the air and I hadn't felt so close to Ireland since hopping the pubs in Galway five years ago.

My friend had the Mushrooms on Toast, which was three times the size that we were expecting. We were overcome by the delicious button, shitake and oyster mushrooms on top of crusty multigrain soda bread and crowned with Caschel Blue Cheese. This is pub snacking at it's finest!

Service was spot on and as soon as our drinks got low, we were offered another.

Embarrassingly, I loved this place so much that my boyfriend and I popped in for Irish Brekky on the patio today. Another pint of Guinness was washed down with an alarmingly non greasy and perfect plate consisting of two bangers, two strips of bacon, white and black pudding (proper and delish) with home simmered beans, roasted tomato and a fried egg. For $15 this is absolute breakfast perfection. The service was, again, spot on, with a couple of servers looking after us and never a long wait for anything but no rushed feeling either.

This little gem of a pub is not cheap, but it's a whole lot cheaper than Ireland-- with almost all of the flavour. A great bet for a night on the piss with your mates, or a brunch on the patio with your beloved.

I'd say that I'll be back, but I've already covered that base."}
{"text":"Where to start?!

They have homemade bread, different batch recipes weekly. That in itself is awesome.
Their specials change daily so it's always interesting. I went on a Sunday and had the lamb shoulder roast, which was cooked to perfection. No matter what you choose from the menu you wont be disappointed. 
The atmosphere is SO COZY and intimate. Every experience I have had there has been just amazing and I have been raving about it to anyone that will listen. If you want a guaranteed good time, it's the place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of fresh pints, oysters, and the lamb was awesome."}
{"text":"This is a great local, fun casual atmosphere. Had the mushrooms on toast as an ap... delish! It was so tasty! Love Yorkshire pudding and was excited to this on the menu with mashed potatoes but was disappointed with when I tasted this... Potatoes and gravy extremely salty (I love salt and found this salty!!) and the Yorkie was very dense, not light and fluffy. 

Since the atmosphere was great, I would go back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"2nd Update: I'm subtracting yet another star for being out of my first three beer choices.  

1st Update: I'm subtracting two stars from my earlier Ceili rating.  I was there again last night and experienced some of the surly and inflexible service that others mention in their reviews.  We were one person too many for the table we had gatherer around, and the staff seemed to determined to ensure that we would remain short one chair.  A piano bench sat empty and within arms reach, but we were admonished when we tried to claim it for our use - because someone may want to play piano.  

I tried to explain that  we could swap a chair for the stool so that the piano would remain playable, but they were determined to ignore that logic.  Within a few minutes, someone else was sitting at the piano and using it only as a beer rest.  

I give the food a four, the bar a five and the overall experience a three.  It's funny how one moment of bad service is all it takes to cause a reviewer to subtract two stars and entirely delete their earlier, unabashedly  glowing review."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio in Leslieville. My boyfriend and I went today to have a bite and our experience was a little mixed. The patio (picture attached) is absolutely inviting which is why we stopped at the pub. The staff however, were not that friendly and looked a bit unorganized. 

We were planning to eat there but since we visited on a Sunday, the pub only serves brunch menu (although, oysters and a minor selection of salads)until 4pm and 5pm onwards hosts the Sunday roast. We did not eat anything as we did not want any brunch food so chose not to eat. 

That being said, I would like to go back on a weekday to try out items from their regular menu."}
{"text":"Read about the yurt in a magazine and went that evening to check it out.  Whether or not the yurt is open seems to be dependent on many factors - thankfully we chose a Friday night and it was.

Like: Well, first of all, the yurt.  What a cool, and definitely unique, concept.  A great way to spend a cold winter evening - in a cool environment with good music.  Our food was pretty good and the beer selection has some different draft options than the typical offerings around town. The ambiance of the main building is pretty cool too - it's absolutely a cozy neighborhood pub.

Dislike: Right at the top - the service.  The woman seemed put off that we wanted to wait for the yurt instead of dining indoors.  After 30 minutes when we asked if a spot had freed up yet (we were #1 on the list), she told us to wait because she couldn't do everything at once like talk to us and check as well (yikes).  Steak night was also a little overpriced at $28 when everything on the menu seemed way cheaper than that.

This place gets four stars on the yurt alone.  If that didn't exist, I would give it three for shoddy service and off-pricing.  Not sure I'd go back unless it was to bring company to check out the uniqueness as well."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this place - the beer selection is fantastic, and they get points in my book for the sheer originality of their pub grub. The servers are really friendly, and I love the atmosphere. 

The aesthetic of the place is wonderful, and while it is a bit dark, it adds to the charm. You absolutely feel you're in Ireland when you walk in the door. The beer selection is extensive and ever-changing, and if you're feeling daring, try out their cask ales. 

There are two definite downsides, however: the first is that it isn't cheap, the prices are a bit high for the area (esp. the food). The other, and this may be a dealbreaker for many, is how hard it can be to get in sometimes, never mind getting a table. The place is just too small for the amount of people who want to go here; on the positive side, they're so busy because they are such a leap up from the other bars and pubs in the area. But due to the crowds, occasionally the servers get distinctly harried. But to their credit, they handle it well."}
{"text":"I tried to like this place, but the poor service and management style has forced me to personally boycott it.  
Also, I found it's a mediocre beer selection and the food only average and overrated. Too bad, this could've been a fav."}
{"text":"Quant and cozy are two words that come to mind when one steps into the Ceili Cottage.

Owned by the same folks at Starfish, the Ceili Cottage aims to win over a different crowd with it's industrial-rustic decor, modestly priced menu and it's diverse selection of draft beers. Whereas Starfish can be considered  fancy high end dining, Ceili Cottage is more for the folks who want a comforting meal at their local watering hole. 

The menu features many items that are locally sourced and there are several modestly priced snacks for those looking for some sustenance with their booze. I've tried the kettle chips (crispy), oysters (fresh and earthy) and the peat salmon. All were well flavoured and nothing is a lick above $20 on the menu. Looking forward to future visits perhaps when this pub really gets a rockin."}
{"text":"Oysters galore, and they're so good at what they do. My go-to in the east end for oysters and a great Irish feel. The patio is grand in the summer time."}
{"text":"My favorite bar/restaurant in Toronto. Despite how hard it is to get a table"}
{"text":"Asked for recommendations on a bourbon with a little spice, and was told by the bartender that they didn't know much about the spirit.  I was referred to another staff member who recommended a bourbon because it had a \"...cool bottle...\", and got him \"...really messed up one time...\"  I don't think I'll be making a return visit."}
{"text":"Outstanding. !!! 

We've been meaning to come here for over two years - there's always a line when we go by but  this week we decided for sure we're going !! I am so glad we did ..........and were going to have to go back at least 10 more times just to make sure it's okay ! 

We started with a dozen Irish Oysters and they were AMAZING. The freshness was incredible and they've paired it with three sauces plus freshly grated horseradish ! Dozen oysters $43 worth every penny. 

Two of us had Bangers & Mash - creamy mashed potatoes with two homemade sausages that were just incredible soft & delicate very nice - topped with an onion sauce - superb

Two of my other dinning companions had Corn Beef with mustard herb sauce, mashed potatoes with spinach and heirloom carrots. They really enjoyed it and the corn beef was unlike any other corn beef I've seen or tasted just so delicate and fell apart it was so soft, melt in you mouth yummy. 

It was a beautiful dinner - unlike any other Irish pub dinner I've ever had.....and I've been to a couple of pubs here and there. I'd heard rave views about many of the menu items and really can't wait to go back and try a few more. 

We did order bread-and-butter  which was freshly baked, served warm and just  outstanding. 

To top the meal off, my three friends shared the dark chocolate Brownie.  They devoured it in no time with fighting spoons and lots of hmmmms & yummmmms. They said one of the best brownies they've ever tasted !!!!

Now we regret not taking photos of the food, it smelt so good when it arrived at the table we just started to eat and before I knew it I forgot to take a picture. 

Next visit will be brunch I can't wait :-)"}
{"text":"This is just a great place with a nice atmosphere in the neighbourhood to grab a drink, a few snacks, and just hang out with some friends.  No wonder why I keep coming back time and time again.

I still crave their take on the caesar here so when patio season warrants it, I will have to order one to welcome spring back to the city.

Also, I got my YEA (Yelp Elite Assistant) hooked on their sticky toffee pudding.  Hehehe."}
{"text":"Loads of personality. Hearty, comfortable food. Plenty of good beverages. You'll really feel you are in the emerald isle"}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese worth killing for.  Bread served with half a pound of butter (or almost).  Short but crafty beer list. Amazing patio. Dry humoured service."}
{"text":"Our go-to local with best patio in Leslieville hands down.

Not your typical pub grub, so if you're looking for nachos and wings this is not the place to go. Good beer - always a rotating cask and tasty Irish food - mussels, mac & cheese, bangers & mash, fish cakes, etc. Great specials every night with burgers, pot pies, terrines and deserts - that being said, Oysters are also their speciality so you can never go wrong there.

While some people would complain the service is rude, clearly they don't have too much of a sense of humour. All the servers are very dry, and as you become locals, you get to experience it at a new level (in a good way!)"}
{"text":"Get here early for a table on the patio.  Oysters are good. Service is excellent.  Staff are fun.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I was delighted by the Ceili Cottage. There's all this hype about the yurt. I don't understand the yurt. Couldn't get into the damn thing and there was a private party going on the other time I tried. So, I'm reviewing it independently of its famed tent. 

I went to Ceili Cottage twice during the coldest weekend of the year. The dining area is tiny but very, very cozy. The bar is great. Flat screen television, huge selection of spirits, wonderful fresh Guinness and a lovely array of local draft beers. Friendly bartenders and staff, many from Ireland. The menu focuses on oysters and Irish fare. I really appreciated the passion about the selection and shucking and presentation of the oysters -- it reminded me of similar thatched roof pubs near Galway in Ireland with similar focuses. The food was quite good - we opted for one of the roasts. My only complain was that the Yorkshire puddings were overdone and rock hard. We unfortunately were too cowardly to complain about this. Everything else was pretty ace...from the atmosphere, to the Guinness, to the crowd. Felt at home and will be going back! A good but crowded place to meet up and watch a football match."}
{"text":"When entering this establishment, you see the grand patio out front and of course on a gorgeous sunny day, who doesn't want to be outside. Well, listen up, while there are many tables and umbrellas to sit under there simply are not enough chairs to sit. Why do you ask? Well that's because they are only licensed for 40 people...seriously? Why is there enough tables to seat 60+ then? Our party had to be split up and then we had to wait for others to leave and then steal a chair and bring out the rest.

I ordered the special of the day which was some sort of curry concoction. Let me tell you something, this was nothing remotely close to curry. I think they sprinkled some curry powder on top of the sauce and served. The taste was bland and definitely not worth $10. I saw others had ordered the mac and cheese and when it arrived it came in the tiniest little ramekin. Yes, it was a ramekin not a bowl. 

They are a new establishment so I'll give them a little credit as they were overwhelmed but seriously, the owner is not new to the restaurant business (he's also the owner of Starfish), but it was difficult to flag down any server, never mind our own, and the service was slow slow slow. 

The oysters apparently are the piece de resistance here as their empty shells decorate the floor of the patio. But boy, if you're selling oysters, get more than ONE guy shucking 'em cuz well, you'll be waiting for your order for at least 20-30 minutes. 

Notable mentions, the decor inside was very cool. Dark wood and rustic with barrels and of course the bathrooms were top notch. I have a thing with bathrooms and this one was nice, although it was very new. A few of the servers were wonderful, one of them acted like a veteran and was nice and friendly and cheerful and even though she was not our server, she gladly took and filled orders. 

Honestly don't think I'll be coming back here and probably wouldn't have ever considered to come here if it wasn't for yelp but hey, I now know and have an informed decision."}
{"text":"One of the best pubs in the city. Great food and drink selection. Arrive early, can be difficult to get in. Dining / drinking in the Yurt during the colder months is a pretty cool experience but find has a manure smell in it. Overall a must try."}
{"text":"This place has all the ingredients for a five star rating. It looks good, it smells good ( the peat), the food is solid and the patio is lovely. But it doesn't have any heart. Servers seem indifferent and impatient,  and the bartenders, who should possess at least one star's worth of  charm, aren't much more lively than the staff at the fake pubs in the airport. Customers want to feel like they're welcome, not just another mouth to feed.

Also, why not  offer some bread when serving the  mussels.  Or at the very least,  mention that the overpriced bivalves are served without bread, so the customer won't have to wait another 15 minutes  for something with which they can enjoy the sauce.

Someone wrote that the Cottage is 'Bipolar' , which is extremely apt. 
I've had a good brunch there, but there were nights where I wished that I was somewhere else. The macaroni and cheese is indeed excellent, but then there was a night in the bar when an angry waitress almost pushed us of our stools. I will go back of course, but only if we're strolling by in need of a drink, or if one of my West end friends insists on seeing for themselves why Ceili Cottage gets so much hype."}
{"text":"Have been here time and time again since the first review and I have to say it's never let me down. I'm not getting the hate. 

Cask ale that is hand pumped and incredible. Oysters expertly shucked. Bread that is outta this world. 5 mins from home?  Ceili, for ye I award an extra star!"}
{"text":"Wicked spot for a patio.  Had the camel terrine and cod cakes...delicious.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This review is really a review mourning the passage of an era. Found out tonight that the chef at this restaurant left last week. How has that changed the menu? Glad you asked. Recently I was at The Four Seasons and I thought to myself \"Gee this meal is twice the price and half as good as Ceili Cottage\"  Unfortunately tonight instead of a plump Cornish hen stuffed with fruit dressing - to die for - the new chef substituted a skinny chicken leg for the exact same price and I am told the Cornish hen will no longer be on the menu. If the old chef reads this review, and I hope he does ... You worked culinary magic and will be missed. I suspect the new mandate is to bring down food costs and increase profit whereas the old philosophy seemed to be to wow the guests with exceptional value and quality. We have loved this restaurant and hope the new chef will reconsider some of the menu choices."}
{"text":"The Ceili Cottage is the kind of place I want to love. Unfortunately there is also a lot not to love about it as well. I was thrilled to hear that there was finally someone shucking oysters in Leslieville because to the best of my knowledge there is no one offering them up on the eastern side of Queen Street. I was so looking forward to checking out this quaint, charming new alcove for libations. They've only been open 14 days and the hiccups and the road bumps are showing big time. 

I arrived only to discover that I couldn't sit out on the patio since it was only licensed for 40 even though the patio can accommodate much more than that. So I sat inside waiting until someone left the patio before I could join the Yelpers outside. That is where I got a first hand look at the chaos that is plaguing this brand new establishment. The owner, Paddy, who cut his chops shucking oysters over at Rodney's and is also the owner of Starfish, is the only person shucking which means that oyster orders are backed up big time. I sat at the bar near him to watch him do his thing but moved after I'd had enough oyster water sprayed at me. 

Moving to the other end of the bar I sat next to a really lovely couple who complained about the curry mutton of the day which literally had two small pieces of mutton in it. She said they should have called it \"Hint 'o Mutton\" curry stew. It was primarily chick peas with curry and rice. She dolloped out a sample on to her bread plate for me and it was bland with a capital B. As well they tried the Mushrooms & Blue Cheese on toast and said it was ok, lots of bread, little cheese and fewer mushrooms. Servers were wandering around trying to find out where food orders belonged and at one point Paddy just yelled out \"who ordered bread and butter!\" Most of the staff are inexperienced and it showed. Many were the girls from the Irish Dance School next door. 

I found the menu to be chaotic. Is this pub food? Is this snack food? Is this comfort food? Hard boiled egg with salt or an order of bread and butter? A PB&J at a pub?  What the hell is up with that. This is actually listed on the menu. The mains in my opinion don't come close to being mains at all. The mac & cheese looked really disappointing. I didn't taste it at all but it sure looked dull and average. 

By the way, my oysters which finally did show up were ok.  But my first comment after sucking back the first oyster was \"oh, this tastes fishy\", that is never good with fresh oysters. A couple oysters were just downright gritty and I just plain old hate that. Three sauces accompanying the oysters were all average and one of them was so acidic that they just made the back of my throat burn. Paddy should do himself and the bar a favour and hire another shucker and that'll free him up to actually run the establishment properly. 

I tried the house drink, the Ceili Cottage Punch. It was some red liquor concoction with some sparking wine served in a flute glass. That took me 20 minutes of sitting at the bar to get. I ordered a half dozen oysters and some pub chips (homemade kettle chips with roasted rosemary on them) while sitting there. Neither showed up before I finally got moved to the patio, the bill, however did show up. It billed me for the food that I hadn't been served yet. That order took another half hour to show up after my long awaited seat on the patio became available. 

That being said my kind words about the Ceili Cottage are this. The setting, both inside and out, is charming. The bare brick and exposed patina walls inside create a very special atmosphere. It is so minimal yet there is something so authentic about it. They have a great taps menu so if you like to drink beer this is your kind of place. I think if they slim down their menu it'll simplify the kitchen chaos. They need to give their chef a big kick in the pants to get his cooking Mojo going and put some flavour into the food. Paddy needs to leave the match making to the Zaidy's get another shucker showman much like himself and the Caili Cottage will become a benchmark spot in Leslieville for oysters and beer. That'll be its saving grace."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out the Ceili Cottage for a while and made plans with friends, who have been there before, to attend on a Friday evening. They put their names on the yurt waiting list (seeing as how we all wanted to experience the supposed magic of the yurt), but we somehow never made it far enough on the list. We were also never told where we were on the list, despite very specific requests.

I had the steak special, which was $28 and a perfectly cooked tenderloin. The sides were fine, if a little sparse... but the meal itself was fairly bland. For $28 I would expect the steak to have some seasoning to it. There wasn't even salt and pepper on the table in case you wanted to add more flavour.

Much like others have commented, the server was aggressive about turning the table. We had two friends come after we ate our steaks, and had yet to order dessert and the server was already asking us to move to the bar if we wanted to have another drink. We asked where we were on the yurt list, and whether giving up the table would move us to the top of the yurt list, but she just shook her head before flouncing off. She seemed annoyed that our friends were standing at our table (it was a high top), even though they were out of the way and were spending money. They likely would have spent more, or ordered some snacks, had they not felt so rushed. We put our dessert order in, as our friends really wanted the sticky toffee pudding, finished our drinks and settled up the bill.

There was a group performing some short highland dancing to raise awareness of Robbie Burns and it was fun to watch - I just wish our server had waited until between numbers (the songs were about 30 seconds to a minute long and there were four in total) or after the performance to take our order. 

I love that there's a reasonably priced (~$6.20/pint) cask program here and would probably return just for a quick drink before eating elsewhere in Leslieville. There are far too many restaurants in Toronto to explore before returning to one so mediocre."}
{"text":"Irish enough to smell like peat, city enough to have some of the classiest food in the T-dot.  Patrick McMurray (Starfish) is behind this place so don't be afraid to dig in to the Oysters which are always fresh and served with freshly shaved horseradish.  Dining there feels like you have wandered into a Muskoka hangout.  The large patio is great, but you can't escape the city on a streetcar route despite the fire pit.  Tucked in the back you will find a bar with not a lot of wiggle room so don't be afraid to lean in and chat up the locals."}
{"text":"The Ceili Cottage could be really cool. It has great potential. The location is ideal for an upcoming wealthy market. The general theme is creative and interesting, but it just doesn't reach the finish line.

I have experienced this place now in the summer, and in the spring. The summer was somewhat of a disappointment, however, we waived it off slightly as they had only opened recently, and we took that into some consideration. The second time around hasn't really changed my opinion. 

First, it was very busy, which is great. The place must be doing alright since it`s opening. I do, however, believe that part of its success is due to a lack of great competitors within quick walking distance.

Upon arrival, I headed straight to the bar this time. I am not a fan of the dining room at all. The lighting is poor, and it lacks an atmosphere that I think they are striving for. I decided not to indulge in the menu this time round. I stuck to the pints. The draught list is ok. They have been out of some draught now both times I have been here, which is disappointing.  They sell the 4 Irish standards, plus I like how they have added Murphy's on tap, too.  It`s great to see an alternative to Guinness if you want it, but Guinness beats any other stout hands down every time, really.

The bartenders were fine. Nothing memorable, which is a shame as I really think the bar area of the Ceili Cottage is great, but lacks only a damn good bartender or two. A few characters to really bring the room together. They came across very busy, and in the weeds. I realise they are shucking too, but the place is small, and the bar is more than capable of being maintained with some personality.  I truly believe this place would be a much better as a P.E.I., or Nova Scotian style bar, than as an Irish one. 

'Personality goes a long way' is how I will leave this review. The Ceili Cottage has its moments - the smell of turf is great, the music is good, the bar is cozy, and the prices are fine.  There is just still something missing...."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great vibe!  In summer, the patio is the best.  Often, there is live music.  The portions of food are good and filling and always done to perfection.  One of my favourite places to go!"}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite, go-to places in the east end. Cozy atmosphere goes really well with delicious food. 
Highlights: The \"Yurt\" (goes up every fall) and their Oyster platter ($35 for 3 types of oysters)

P.S the \"C\" I'm Ceili is pronounced as \"K\""}
{"text":"Too bad you can't give a bipolar rating, since the Ceili Cottage is decidely bipolar.   While it presumes to be an \"Irish\" bar, it certainly isn't representative of any over there.   That said, it's a great spot to grab a few pints, and the staff behind the bar are terrific.   Great oysters, too.

However, they fall down on the food.   We have had several (about 10) so-so dinners at the cottage.  What really sealed the deal was the joke that they passed off as a full Irish breakfast.   Two strips of bacon literally smaller than a pinkie finger, one egg, no bread, mealy black pudding, and a tablespoon of beans for the bargain price of $15.   
The dinner menu is hit-and-miss, with usually the hash as the best bet.  Charging for the non-Irish style bread when ordering cheese or other dishes is just cheap, and we usually find that they're out of half of the items they're selling.   A new manager and a chef that cares could help reinvent the cottage as an authentic eastern Canada pub, but it's certainly not going to be Irish."}
{"text":"Love this place! Seafood is so fresh. It's close to the beach so I come here after playing volleyball. I've had their mussels and oysters and they're really tasty and fresh. My friends also really like their bangers and mash."}
{"text":"Went here today. It was a beautiful afternoon and we happened to be in the East end of town. The patio was in the sun and I've been wanting to try out Ceili for awhile! I was sure my boyfriend would love it- bangers and mash and beer are right up his ally. 

Service was good. 

Food was disappointing. I thought the mussels sounded good, and ordered some of their homemade bread and butter to sop up the broth. The bread was very dry and did not seem fresh at all. The mussels didn't taste the freshest and the broth was waaaay too salty. I only ate about half of my meal (very rare for me). Even my boyfriend- who is very easy to please generally, thought it was sub par (although the mashed potatoes were tasty!) the banger was too chewy and tough. All this and one Guinness set me back $54 (tip included). Will not return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - you feel like you're Travelling in Europe"}
{"text":"Top notch watering hole for its large, inviting patio and excellent selection of taps. Nice atmosphere, but points are lost for food and service.

The Lamb burger special with fruit salad topping was tasty, but I wasn't asked for a cooking preference. The burger ended up coming out done a little over medium, though I always prefer it cooked medium-rare.

Potato chips weren't fried properly, soggy and stuck together. I suggest they just use Miss Vickie's if they aren't going to take the proper care and attention for such a simple dish.

Similarly to other yelpers, our service was too focused on managing the tables. So whether or not it's just the status quo, or if it's that our waitress was greedy, but they forced three of us to sit at a two seater table, even though it wasn't very busy and tables all around us were empty. 

We didn't have enough room for all the plates and the food runner stumbled to find a place to put things down... so we just pulled the table over next to us. Then to top it off
my plate was cleared a bit too quickly, while there was more appetizer left and the other people were still eating. I guess she really wanted that next table...

I do think it could of been 4-star, but maybe another day...."}
{"text":"Another not so impressive place.  For $12 you get a small bowl of macaroni and cheese with half a sausage.  The sausage was dry and the pasta was something I could have made at home.  But I wouldn't make it at home because it was so flavourless.  I'm not sure what the saw dust was either that they had baked on top of it.

Our waitress was on the ball.  She smiled and was friendly all evening.  The interior is very quaint and really hold true to their name with a cottage decor.

The uber downer tonight was that we couldn't have the whole Yelp group on the patio to start.  They were being really strict that they're only licensed for 40 people to be on the patio.  So we had to wait for people to leave in order to get more chairs.

Being new, they obviously need to work out some kinks.  Maybe I'll come back in a few months once they've gotten things down.  But probably not."}
{"text":"Nice drinks, poor service. Took 30 minutes to bring one bill for a table for 2 - only 3 drinks on the bill. Had to ask 4 times to two different servers."}
{"text":"Went there with an Irish born colleague. He was delighted with the beers.
I had bangers (Irish sausages) for the first time then pudding. Pretty good.
Would have expected more choice for course but it's mainly a bar.
Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Popped in here while bar floating around Leslieville and it was bar far the coolest bar in the area. Authentic Irish vibe. Tons of whiskey's and pretty sweet beer selection on tap. Kinda place you can drink with no one noticing you or bothering you.

Didn't look at a menu and it was too cold for what looked like a sick patio. Kind of a spooky night but that's when I like to go out. Bartenders seemed like badasses who don't care if you live or die and I like that. Oysters seem to a thing they do well.

I'm a ghost and I haunt this place now."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd favourite bar in the whole world. My first favourite bar is in Northern Ireland and they only serve Guiness. They have 4 stools. The Guiness is kinda warm. It was Irish as fuck.

The Ceili Cottage is as close to that fine 'Irish local' as I've ever seen. It's not one of those Firkin bullshit chains that serves a world of beer, potato skins, wings and Thai salads. This is a real bar. The staff are friendly, the food is good (no, not great) and the whole place smells like Ireland (they've got a peat burning stove/fish smoker on the bar.)

Spirits:
They've got all the good Irish whisky, some good scotch and I think a few bourbons. You're going to pay prices on par with the other 'Irish' bars around town, but sure as shit they won't feel like this one.

Beer:
They serve the four Irish taps, and around 10 other Ontario craft brews as well as some excellent Unibroue (like Chambly Noir) offerings. I've had some severe hangovers due to what I would associate with dirty taps, but we were assure the taps were clean and sure enough the next time I felt ok (but I did stick to Guiness.) Perhaps we just can't stomach the cask ales. Who knows.

Oysters:
Served with some excellent saucing options in tiny mason jars these puppies are stellar. They serve all kinds (seasonally) and the common ones year round. 'Shucker Paddy' as he calls himself, also owns Starfish and knows his stuff. I've yet to get the chance to speak to him directly, but I admire him for his attention to detail and love of his work. The luminary of Leslieville? Maybe.

Food:
Lamb shank in Guiness w/mash. Very good.
Peanuts (good luck getting your hands on these!) Very good.
Potato chips. Hit and miss. Last time they were excellent.
Lamb burger. Good.
Pickled egg. Try one at least once in your life. It's the place to do it.
Cheeses & Bread. Excellent.

Staff:
Aces. You won't be disappointed.

And it's busy. So, so busy. Maybe I should have given it a shit review..."}
{"text":"Soooooo neat (do the kids still use that word?).  A hidden old old cottage with a quirky bar that feels like you are in a comfortable bunker on a secret mission.  In this case the mission is to feel totally at home, have good whiskeys and beer, and fantastic food. My friend and I had oysters which were so incredibly fresh and the sauces were fantastic. I don't usually have sauces as I'm from the East Coast and like them plain but these really did add a lovely zest.  We also had the seafood chowder and the mushrooms on toast with blue cheese as well as their great homemade bread with a little cup of lardons: double smoked fried pork bits. Took our time grazing and drinking and felt no rush from the attentive staff. I also noted how clean and well-kept the washrooms were which you don't often get with popular places downtown. It is a small place so best to go during non-prime time and stake out a seat. Don't tell other people about this place - keep this gem between you and me!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Irish Pub, then this is the place for you. Great food, great pints, great whiskey and in the winter months, they have a Yurt! :D

The place has a nice vibe that is distinctly different from other bars around Toronto. It almost feels like ... well ... a Cottage. 

There aren't all that many tables inside, so you might want to check ahead whether there's space. The patio is quite spacious through, so when it's warm, find yourself a spot and kick back a few pints."}
{"text":"Really cool pub with an awesome patio. Selection and beer is OK and the food is absolutely amazing. Music is awesome and service is great. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great patio. Solid staff. Buck a shuck on mondays. Sunday roast. Awesome appy platers. My only regret has been wanting everything coming out of the kitchen including in addition to my order."}
{"text":"The food is quite quite good and they have a yurt on their front patio in the winter. 

How can you argue with that?

It's best put as an \"Irish bar for grown ups\".  The kind of place that they probably never have to check anyone's ID at the door.   Which is totally cool, because if you wanted younger people you'd venture farther west on Queen.   It feels wooden and organic in a warm and comforting way.   More timber, less Tinder.  

The vibe is great.   Arguably the heart of this part of the neighborhood.    

I had duck confit and waffles.   God bless."}
{"text":"Great patio and the service was much better than expected (some of the reviews here set the bar so low).  The food is ok - it is what it is - pretty good irish pub fare.  

Better than going to a chain pub but there isn't anything  I would recommend.  Tried the ostrich burger (pretty good), smooked salmon (pretty good), bangers and mash (pretty good), mac and cheese (ok), chips and peanuts (no thing special at all).  

maybe it is the oysters where this place shines?"}
{"text":"A favourite unless I (or we) experienced grief. Great food, great atmosphere but service (though some have been there a long time) can be very spotty and not responsive and then the next day they are great. 

Was there for a wedding reception and they rocked it and a week later service was iffy at best. 

Patio in the summer is awesome!"}
{"text":"A cool space with really friendly staff (who appear to all be authentically Irish). Good space to go for a drink with one friend or many friends. When we got there around 7pm on a Saturday they were already sold out of a few things food wise. And by the time we ordered they were out of even more stuff. They were out of things like chips even. Cauliflower. I tried to order the mussels but they just sold their last order. So I got the veggie curry. It was pretty heavy on the potato, maybe because they were out of cauliflower... Also they didn't have potatoes to make chips but you could getmashed potatoes... So I wondered if they were instant or how far advance do they just make a huge pot of mashed potatoes. The food that did come was fine, but nothing worth recommending. I wouldn't go for a meal again here, but a drink sure!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Toronto's East end.  Feels like a home away from home. A Lil taste of The green isle, britanny and pei all wrapped in a snug blanket. Great selection of fresh oysters, amazing freshly baked bread and the eggs benny is nice and buttery but not overly heavy. 5/5 for sure. You need to go here at least once in your life."}
{"text":"Okay this is absurd... not enough people are talking about the yurt in a parking lot on a pretty small street in Toronto, Ontario. It's a yurt, full tilt, and full tilt enough to piss the staff off because of the upkeep. I mean... I could've listed the fifty five things I'd want to see and experience in Toronto, let alone the world, and I couldn't have drummed up: sit in a yurt in the early evening across from the beautiful gal, where we're next to the circular bar in the middle of the yurt, and the door is so short she had to duck too, so, really, watch out. 

The yurt was taken down the day after we were there in early May, and usually stays up through the winter months. Inside is just as quaint as glass doors open up to a small house-style bar. 

Not even San Francisco has the nerve to put a yurt up somewhere in the city and serve food & drink from it. In fact, does anywhere else other than this unassuming Irish bar next to a auto body mechanic shop situation? All it takes is one person to say, \"yeah, let's take our yurt and it put it up during the winter,\" and the other person to say, \"damn straight,\" to change the entire conversation about what a business can do to set itself apart from anywhere else I've been."}
{"text":"Gord and I went to the Céilí Cottage tonight.  It's been a while since we've been there.

We sat inside for a while but it was jammed so we moved to the patio.  It was really warm out, especially on the enclosed patio. 

Because it's St. Patrick's Day week, an Irish band called O.M.F.G. was playing ... they were good!"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. I'm a little sad that the beer selection is limited - they seem to take pride in a few rarer selections but I'd prefer some options. It's not a cheap spot but you definitely get what you pay for. My only complaint would be the seating. If the table can seat 4, they will not seat a table of 3 even if there are no other tables."}
{"text":"An amazing little winter watering hole. True Irish pub, complete with accented bartenders who might give russel peters a run for his money. 
Made for a hilarious night. 
Kitchen was closed when i got there, so didn't get to eat, but appreciated the traditional roasted peanuts as a barsnack. 
Good selection of beers, scotches, bourbons, etc. 
My most memorable part of the place though is the smell. Really makes it feel like a cottage with the smoker aroma lingering throughout the place."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars 
VIBE 
Ah, the Ceili. A great place to enjoy the craic and one of the most authentic Irish pubs in Toronto that I've been to (I've been all over Ireland to compare). Unfortunately, there's not a lot of space in the bar and it can get crowded FAST. In the winter, the owners have made space of their patio. This year, they turned it into a YURT. Talk about innovative! 

I ATE/DRANK
Their mac n cheese is delicious! I recommend but I haven't had it in a while. Of course, you can't go wrong with a pint of Guinness. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Top O' The Night! A nice Leslieville local."}
{"text":"Cozy, amazing pub! They have really great beers. We tasted the burger with cheese and was incredible! the meat was made in the house, it tasted great and it was a big piece. great for meat lovers! the atmosphere in the pub is very pleasant. So nice and helpful service."}
{"text":"Why is this place so busy?

I'm going to cut straight to the chase with this review.

The good:
- Our Waitress was stellar.  She moved us to a bigger table as soon as it opened up, even shoo'ing newly arriving patrons away as it emptied.  She was super friendly, brought me great surprise beers and was a solid 5 star waitress.
- They have a lot of good beers on tap.  A lot.  And they're good.  And fresh.
- I like the ambiance/decor.
- Very reasonably priced pints - most are $6.05 and there are no shitty beers here.

The bad:
- There is nothing on the extremely limited menu that I wanted to eat and they were out of the chips, which is what I really wanted. I pretty much hate their menu.  This is mostly seafood and 'stupid junk' like a 2$ hard boiled egg.
- It's always fricking packed. There were way too many people here yesterday.  And everyday.  It's so cramped you have to go outside and walk around to the other doors to get to the restrooms (seriously).
- It's hard to tell which door to go into.  

The summary is that I had a lot of fun, mostly because of good company in Greg C & his buddies and Kat F, and I would meet them again there anytime.  I would eat somewhere else first and enjoy the beer & the company at Ceili Cottage.  If it were my turn to pick where we went, I wouldn't pick this place.  But there is limited selection in this area.  The restrooms and clean and nice."}
{"text":"With a fresh, thick blanket of snow covering up all the decorative curling paraphernalia out front, The Ceili Cottage was temporarily disguised as The Ceili Cabin on this wintery night. At the least, entering the warmly lit and bustling bar invoked the fuzzy feelings of apres ski.

A packed midweek room seemed a promising sign. In one corner, a trio of unassuming musicians plucked merrily away to provide a soundtrack for the clusters of revelers. The narrow, bar featured an impressively tall liquor display while a brighter back room is set up with larger tables and chalkboards listing daily food and draft specials.

To accompany our tall pints of Irish drafts, we ordered nibbles with quite opposing flavours. The tracing paper thin kettle chips ($2) were unbearably salty and unfinishable while the sticky toffee pudding ($6) was perfectly sweetened and incredibly moist. The bangers and mash that were simultaneously ordered by several surrounding tables looked simply tasty.

The service from our very knowledgeable server was most efficient and friendly. Despite the full room, it didn't seem like anyone's glasses were left empty too long. 

Until we are graced with the wonderfully warm weather of summer again when we can laze out on the patio, the smokey smell inviting us to come inside will ensure that things are kept lively throughout the year in this quaint little nook."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This is one of my favourite places in the city. You can pretty much stop reading now. 

Well, if you insist on reading more then I can definitely rave a little bit. First of all, the patio. It is large, it is spacious, and there are plenty of tables with umbrellas for those sweltering hot days. The service-folk are always just attentive enough that you get what you want when you want, without feeling pressured and hawked over. 

They have a great variety of beers on tap, with some very unique rotating taps. Coming from Edmonton it is a real change compared to most places back home. In fact, I even had a first here on my last visit: I managed to have the last pint on a seasonal tap and it had already been switched to a different beer by the time I was done. THE HORROR! Naturally, the second one was just as good, or even better. 

As for food, my knowledge is pretty limited. Why? Because I have found the three best things on the menu (for my tastes at least). First up: Oysters. Ceili's always has a great variety from all different regions, and they offer a great \"Shucker's Choice\" platter featuring a variety. If you want the freshest of the fresh, delivery day for Canadian oysters is Monday, and Irish arrive on Tuesday. Second item: Kettle chips. Yes, you read that correctly, in this universe of foodies this punk just recommended kettle chips. Fact is, they are homemade on site, tossed with olive oil and salted JUST enough. Between three people we can easily polish off 3 or 4 bowls as an appetizer. SO GOOD. The third must-try is their special dessert, which is always changing. I always get it and no matter what it is, it is amazing. 

Long story short, TL;DR, GO HERE. LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE. EAT OYSTERS."}
{"text":"Loved the Shucker's Best Mixed Plate of oysters! Bread, salad & beer were all good as well. It would have been a very satisfying lunch had it not been for the non existent service.

It took 10 minutes before they even offered us a menu and then continued right up until the bill which took forever to get and the nasty attitude when I left a small tip. 3 different servers, 2 of whom were absolutely horrible and the 3rd who seemed nice and competent but who was mainly focused on the other side of the patio."}
{"text":"Great patio, limited beer selection, so-so drinks, fairly mediocre food.  I can't speak for the entire menu, but I ordered a burger and it was dry and virtually flavourless until I drowned it in ketchup. My friends ordered the mushroom toast. I didn't try it, but the \"toast\" looked quite soggy."}
{"text":"There is something charming about the venue that keeps me coming back. A quaint neighborhood spot. Food is good and reasonably priced. Limited seating... The atmosphere at the bar is fun! Can be chilly by the entrance directly into the bar which is where the three tables are. Worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  Great ambiance.  A real gastro pub.  Excellent food.  Super friendly staff.  Plus a Yurt in the front yard.  That's right, a Yurt!. You can't ask for anything else."}
{"text":"This place was largely part of the appeal of buying a house  in leslieville in a somewhat industrial pocket before the area blew up into a Brooklyn style cool vibe on queen St east. This place was one of a kind when it popped up and in many ways still is.
Years ago In the winter before they put up the yurt for extra seating (that they definitely need) you could see their cute mini skating rink on the cement slab out front and smell the wood-burning stove ---truly incredible
You felt transported to Ireland and really happy to be in Canada in the coldest months at the cutest best hidden secret bar!
It is still awesome now but I don't recommend sitting in the yurt, personally I find it hard to breathe, no oxygen flow in there. But just make your way to the bar or table.
In the summer their patio is one of the very best in the city
Non-pretentious even though it's pretty hipster now 
great staff awesome oysters great scotch, beer and wine.
Food is all fresh have the land last week it blew my mind I'm usually too cheap to get a full meal because it is expensive when I can cook myself but their food is so high grade it's always well worth the money
This is an amazing spot to go for St Patty's especially if you don't want drunk 20-year-olds all over you
Usually have a great Irish bands and Irish dancers on that weekend
I've also seen some tours come through looking like they're having the best time and never want to leave Kealy on their bar hop
Favorite dishes that pop up as daily specials include the Collie flower soup spicy salmon soup muscles are always good the lamb as mentioned below and any house fresh made burger but they always run out because it's too popular lol
Very pleased to have this spot in the hood"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Quality Irish breakfast venue with a nice patio.  Will be back to try their other offerings.

Cost:
-$22 for brunch (tax and tip included)

Atmosphere/Decor:
-Small, narrow bar area, high ceilings with accompanying piano and local photos of Ireland - I imagine it would get uncomfortably crowded with only 30 people.
-Open sky patio is about twice the size of the bar, which is fantastic, but seemingly a poor use of space given there's no obvious signs as to how it could be converted for winter use.
-Live folksy music with guitars, banjos, violins made for great atmosphere.

Ordered:
-Just came here for brunch a bit past noon on a Sunday and the place was virtually empty.  Had a limited experience of everything, but I like that they had Murphy's on tap!

1. The Full Irish - the complete Irish breakfast!
-Banger: A very tasty sausage!
-Rasher: A hearty broiled slice of bacon.  'Nuff said.
-Blood pudding: Highlight of the meal. Blood sausages made authentically with a crumbly texture and light flavours.
-Beans and mushrooms: As per the description.
-Grilled tomato: Surprisingly good with the right amount of sweetness and nicely grilled.
-Potato farl: A thin potato pancake.
-Fried egg: As per the description.

2. Guinness with Carver champagne: A bubbly with the head and look of a Guiness coupled with sweet taste of champagne was a delight.

Service:
-A lot of reviewers have reported negative and near-hostile service, but I had a pretty neutral experience.
-Mind you, the place was nearly empty, and the service was moderately slow, but staff were polite and responsive.

Conclusion:
-A great brunch place made better without the line even though we got there after noon."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the ruff. Don't let the appearance fool you.  I was very skeptical. The food was much better than I anticipated and the presentation was spectacular. If you are walking by do not pass it up. This is a must eat your place."}
{"text":"I've been to the Ceili cottage twice with different groups of people and each time was a disappointment.
 
The first visit was for dinner and we found the food to be subpar at best.  Mac 'n' cheese was obviously burnt and extremely dry.  The other dishes were bland and surprisingly cold for just arriving at the table.  The second visit was for the 'full Irish' breakfast and it was anything but.  The rashers were pale and looked like they barely touched a frying pan.  There was no white pudding on the plate as the menu said there would be.  1 egg that was over cooked and suppose they ran out of potato farl as I got a sliver of it on my plate. Not surprised to receive cold coffee as it seems to be one of most challenging things for any restaurant to get right.  We asked for toast and were advised they do not have a toaster.  No, they weren't kidding.  Some form of ale bread was brought to our table with rock hard butter. 
 
The wait staff were attentive but management were out right rude.  When our concerns were raised to both the manager and owner we were told \"You can't please everyone, we aren't running a amusement park\" among other unprofessional comments.  The owner was sure to point out he's been in the business for 26 years.  It's shocking how little someone knows about customer service for being at it that length of time.  Reading the reviews on various sites leads me to believe he probably gets a lot of complaints and is also probably bitter.
 
All of the above plus a tea brought us to $70 with tip - not worth it at all and none of us will be returning.
 
If you're hoping to visit and experience some traditional Irish fare as the Ceili Cottage claims to serve, don't bother.  The people at the bar looked content.  Stick to visiting this place for drinking but eat elsewhere.."}
{"text":"The Ceili Cottage is just so low key, I drove by this stretch of Queen East quite often and never realize its existence. 

But I am glad that I finally got to drop by for a drink: Beer!

I just could not take my eyes off from that Yurt! What a brilliant idea to utilized the patio area during the cold season for extra seating and even book the whole yurt for a private event and celebrations!

The outside looked quiet and dead on a Tuesday night, but inside the bar was packed!! I really want to have a drink at the bar, but just could not even find any standing room! There were though some empty tables...

There are a few selection of imports and local craft beers which is quite nice. And of course whiskey and scotch, if you want a pick me up. 

All beers are $6.20 for an English pint. Our McAuslan Red Ale and Denison's Dunkel were both enjoyable.

Just love the deco and vibe: classy and cozy.. And yes they have Oysters!! 

Beer and Oysters? That's my kind of Cottage Life! 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to head to the east side for a nice dinner since we had a car for the day. We ended up heading here on friends recommendation. 

When we arrived around 8ish on a saturday night, we were able to grab a seat inside because it was a little too cool for us on the giant patio. We both ordered a bear (she-harp's, me-barley). It was nice to see a different selection of beer than we were used to. 

Next we ordered the small cheese plate which was really good! Lots of people recommended it and it delivered! Rather filling for 2 people as well. Would recommend sharing it with 3.

As my main, I ordered the Braised lamb shank with champ and seasonal vegetables (which was asparagus) and my girlfriend ordered the Peat smoked organic Irish salmon, sour cream, lemon, pickled onions. While mine was out of this world good, her's was way too smokey tasting for mine and her palette. Extremely intense and either I or her could finish it. I would suggest staying away from that option. If you're looking for a good Lamb Shank, this place has it!

Great service overall. Not sure if the girlfriend would come back though."}
{"text":"I know I'll be back to The Ceili Cottage many, many times (after all, I'll shortly be sharing a postal code with it) but I can only rightfully award it three stars at the moment. They're clearly suffering from new business growing pains and don't know what to do with their sudden-found popularity.

At 6pm the patio was at capacity - three members of our party were forced to hover over our table like a less glamourous version of a hummingbird because there weren't enough chairs. They finally got fed up and enjoyed most of the rest of the night indoors at the bar. Annoying, to say the least.

Service was good but I was rather unimpressed when a request for a \"Sex On The Beach\" was met with \"We don't have that button on our machine.\" Button?? Um, it's vodka, peach schnapps and juice. Dump 'em in a glass, stir a bit and you're done. No button to press.

The menu was creative and interesting, with options like \"boiled egg with sea salt\" and \"peanut butter and jam\", and roast beef made a different way every day of the week. Plus the \"matchmaking services of Paddy\", which I didn't even get to ask about because he was too busy in the back shucking oysters at a feverish pace.

Despite the creativity of the food, my mac & cheese ($8) was terribly bland. I wouldn't order it again. There was hardly any flavour to it at all and it wasn't even half as cheesy as I would have expected. The portion size was good and it was baked with breadcrumbs on top, but with barely any cheese to speak of there was nothing holding it together and it merely crumbled off to the side. Honestly, I've had better Lipton Sidekicks and those are $1.09 at No Frills. 

The english sticky toffee pudding ($6), on the other hand, was decadent and delicious. I would return to The Ceili Cottage just for the pudding. My slice was a huge square, moist, delicate and dripping with toffee and caramel sauce. It was perfectly spiced with ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon. 

Decor is beautiful, inside and out. Out on the front patio there are white lacquered patio furniture with umbrellas (though not enough to shade all patio dwellers from the sun's harmful rays - yes, I said harmful) and whole seashells etched into the concrete flooring. The interior is made up of two rooms, both with a rustic cabin feel, exposed beams and wood and really \"cozy\"."}
{"text":"Tried The Ceili Cottage tonight after a bit of hype and wanting to experience this new giant patio in Leslieville.

Arrived with a group of 8, to a pretty packed patio.  It appears their liquor license only allows them 40 seats on the patio, even though the tables can hold more.  Therefore, even if the patio doesn't look full (with a few empty tables), it can be at capacity.

We were told we could wait, drink inside, or sit on another part of the patio that isn't licensed.  A bit odd, but I guess the LLBO works in weird ways.

Next up, we ordered drinks and food.  Had their Caesar which was delicious and very spicy.  Could have done without the fish-tasting flakes rimming the glass, but I guess it's part of their unique spin on a classic Canadian cocktail.

The \"homemade\" burger special (on Wednesdays) turned out to be a lamb burger, which was fine with me, but a non starter for a few in my group.  Would have been nice if they specified this.

Food arrived promptly, but one of the mains had been missed, admittedly by an oversight from our server who offered up (delicious) greasy, homemade kettle chips while we waited for the missing entree.

Someone had the salad, which was pretty plain jane, another had the Mac and Cheese and wasn't too enthused (he was originally hoping for a beef burger...)

I enjoyed the lamb burger, and the Mutton Stew (recommended by the server as her favourite dish) was apparently delicious.

It's clear they are still working some of the kinks out.  The interior decor is pretty rustic and cozy, but a bit inconsistent with the look and feel they are going for with the place.  Also, why have a novelty item like Peanut Butter and Jam on the menu and then list it as not available?  Is there only one 'chef' who can make it?

I'd say half of our group would definitely return to give it another try, while the other half wouldn't.

A welcome addition to Leslieville, hopefully quality and consistency improves and it sticks around."}
{"text":"I might have spent the last five years being all about the west, but I still have a soft spot for The Ceili Cottage. The years have passed, my orders have changed, but I still love this little pub.

I came in this past weekend between meal rushes with my husband, another couple and our two silly babies. We had oysters, shrimp cocktails, mac and cheese, pate and some pork pies. Yes, we ate like the Kings, Queens and royal babies we are. It was a heart-warming, belly-filling, lovely afternoon."}
{"text":"I do not know why it took me so long to come here! Especially because I have worked in the East End before for over a year and a half!

Anyways, a friend of mine and I met here for dinner. I was excited to have a pint of Guinness, fresh draught. Most places serve by the can! NOT. THE. SAME. We split the kettle chips. DIVINE. We both ordered the Mac and Cheese and DIED. It was so delicious. Probably one of the best I've had.

The main part of the restaurant was tiny and crowed. A totally surreal and energetic vibe. The yurt built outside on their patio was way more intimate but adorable. I need to go back. 

I'LL BE BACK FOR MORE GREAT BEER, DELICIOUS FOODS AND GOOD TIMES!"}
{"text":"Cute and unassuming in Leslieville.  We visited here on a beautiful afternoon and sat on the patio.   

I liked that there were oyster shells in the pavement, and that all the beers were Irish.

I had a Magner's cider and my husband and I shared a plate of oysters.  They were shucked well and came with some really delicious sauces.

Overall, we enjoyed our short visit there."}
