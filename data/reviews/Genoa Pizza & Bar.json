{"text":"This place has gone way down hill. I ordered the steak hoagie and my friend ordered the buffalo chicken hoagie and both hoagies barely had any meat on them. I told the waitress about it and she brought over the manager who told me there was nothing he could do about it and that the meat is proportioned out beforehand.  They also charged my friend $3 to add lettuce and tomato to the large hoagie ($1.49 +tax a topping).  Unless you want to eat a bread sandwich and overpay for toppings, I would try a more reasonable hoagie place."}
{"text":"Nothing out of this world spectacular, but they have lots of good specials, they deliver and their prices are really reasonable.   After perusing a downtown hotels room service menu (which was astronomically expensive and weak) we decided to surf the net for some decent pizza, and found Genoa's. For $10 we got a good sized medium pizza delivered to our hotel within 30 minutes.   Saved our night!!   I would give five stars, but the delivery driver wouldn't come up to our room for some reason. He made me meet him in the lobby. Stupid. Other than that though, it was just what I wanted."}
{"text":"AWFUL. I ordered a Cesar wrap, no tomatoes and with ranch. Tomatoes are all up in this wrap and I got Cesar dressing. I ordered cheese fries with bacon- these are the most pitiful, disgusting fries I've ever had. There is hardly any cheese and NO BACON. The cheese that is present is clearly from the end of the container and gelatinous. The fries are disgusting and sweaty. The portion was underwhelming and super small (two of us were going to eat these based on price). We couldn't eat them, they were promptly tossed. There are too many similar places like this in Pittsburgh, I recommend you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I won't even give them a star. We've been ordering from them once a week for years. Tonight the pizza showed up like the delivery man had carried them in sideways. When I called the restaurant the manage was rude and suggested we try another pizza shop. Never again.Besides, the pizza isn't that good and the size of the slices are a joke. I didn't want to give them even one star but the system makes you."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Gyros Bread was too soft and seemed old and chicken seemed to be  defrosted in oven and served in our gyro...  The table was extremely dirty and I wonder how they can ask customers to eat in tables like that"}
{"text":"Will not deliver pizza up to my apartment even though all the other food delivery guys will. I have a broken leg!  Hence my ordering in!  They would not do good in New York, that's for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place because the prices were very good, they have a lot of options, and we wanted to try a place we haven't had before.  Delivery arrived on time and ordering was easy.  The pizza, however, had some disgusting crab meat on it.  I did not order crab meat and thankfully I'm not allergic!!  It smelled like rotting crab and tasted the same.  Gross!  Aside from that, the pizza was pretty average; nothing special, but good.  Probably will try other places..."}
{"text":"This place is absolute trash.  The bartender, Kimmie, is totally rude and unprofessional. She allowed a customer who I assume to be a friend of hers, to become extremely drunk and belligerent and start harassing customers. And when I decided to say something to her about it, she cut me off as if I was the problem. Like I said trash. It was dirty and I did order food but threw it out because I didn't trust it after complaining and receiving the reaction I did.  Never, have I ever been treated with such disrespect in a restaurant and I'm black lol. I will never go back to that establishment and will recommend AGAINST them every chance I get.  And to Kimmie if you see this, you suck at your job so yes I will tell you how to do it."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. I liked everything about it. We got the Hawaiian Pie. Garlic jumbo wings were cooked right and big and meaty but not really garlicky. Just a kind of butter sauce that was kind of bland. Still a decent pick though, just wish I'd picked a different sauce. The steak quesadilla we ordered was AMAZING. Highly recommend it. Thin sliced steak, almost like lamb with a delicious sauce, cheesy, and awesome tortilla. Delivery was right on time as promised 40-45 mins and up to the hotel room no problems. Pleasant service on phone and by delivery man. Ok pricing for what you get. No napkins, spices or cutlery included but I didn't ask for it. Slightly disappointed in that, but overall we were happy."}
{"text":"Must must must haves! What a delicious pizza..  Amazing service...  Original flavor  kudos to the chef."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this location today- large pepperoni pizza. The pizza arrived in a timely manner (about 45 minutes). The crust was nice and chewy, but lacked flavor. They were generous with the cheese. Overall, the pizza I received was average (not bad, but not great). As someone who is new to the area, I will likely try other pizza places in the future."}
{"text":"The office ordered several hoagies and a stromboli. Everything got here fast, hot and fresh. The prices are average, half hoagies for about 6 bucks. Whole hoagies for 10 bucks.  The bread was great. All the bread in Pittsburgh is great (or at least most of it). Large, crispy, crunchy, fragile, toasty bread. The only complaint was it was corn dusted on the bottom. This makes for messy fingertips and a messy desk.  I got a steak hoagie. Four thick slices of steak and tons of browned, bubbly cheese. Very tasty. Unfortunately, they do serve their steaks Pittsburgh style....covered in lettuce and tomatoes. No biggy, I got mine without. The onions were crisp, fresh red onions. I would have prefered sauteed onions on a steak but its no big deal. They did charge me a buck for the bannana peppers, even though I left the more expensive tomatoes of my hoagie. And it appeared that they let Peter North put the mayonnaise on it, it was pretty much coated in the stuff.  Tasty hoagie though. If they would have limited the mayonnaise to a reasonable level, it would have been perfect.  Everyone else was more than pleased with their food. Fast delivery, too, even for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheeseburger hoagie, fries and a soda to be delivered to my hotel.  They told me on the phone that it would be 45 minutes and and my food arrived 5 minutes shy of the estimate.      Everything was hot and fresh.   The hoagie roll was one of the best I have had and the hamburgers were much better quality than I usually find on a hoagie.  The fries were also very good and the order was big enough for two people.    I'll order from them again the next time I visit Pittsburgh. ."}
{"text":"I come in constantly, kimmie is an amazing bartender and genoa is lucky to have her, shes the only bartender I will by a drink from because of poor service from the other two ladies I see there. My colleagues and I will not go to genoa any longer unless its kimmie serving us, we gave genoa many tries but bottom line, friendly and consistent service is what matters."}
{"text":"Delivery was very fast, food is here in 20 minutes, and the italian deluxe sub, omg, best sub i've EVER had, and i'm a foodie! Delicious!! as far as delivery and sub goes, doesn't get better than this!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza option in downtown. Great for lunch or take out on a rainy Friday night after work if you live in the city. Friendly staff, quick service, quality ingredients and that awesome cheesy goodness that only a local pizza joint can provide."}
{"text":"I waited an hour for a pizza for them to say there was a mixup with the delivery. They said they would send me a fresh one asap only to take 40 mins. One hour and 40 minutes for a pizza and I asked the delivery driver to ask his boss for it to be on them. Boss said no. Terrible customer service. Pizza looked good but didn't get to taste it."}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni pizza and a dozen wings with the dry rub and both were excellent. Didn't have high hopes when I walked but everything was great and well priced. The place was good for what it was. Will go back again next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This was awful! We walked in and the tables were piled with garbage. We were not greeted by a waitress. We sat at a table that was still dirty. The two waitresses focused more on the gentleman guests. Both waitresses blew all four of us off twice. We were told that it would be a while as we watched the waitress joke with another table. After 20 minutes of not even having our drink order taken we left! This place was dirty and the staff was not friendly."}
{"text":"A good hole the wall bar to frequent with nice people and the food is decent. I would recommend the calzones to new people, pasta is good, pizza is alright. Drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Genoa is amazing!!! I've been in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks for work. I've gone to Genoa just about every one of toes nights. Great food no matter what you order, and an awesome full bar as well. Amanda and Ashley are awesome bartenders. If you're in the area, this is a MUST STOP. Seems like a great place to watch football, GO CHARGERS, or the Penguins game!   Thank you Amanda, Ashely, and Billy for making me feel at home out here in Pittsburgh!!!!!!!!!!! I'll miss you 3."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Ever!    I will admit I was skeptical about ordering bit in the end, hunger won out over skepticism.  I bit the bullet and ordered a small thick crust.  Best pizza I have ever eaten in Pittsburgh and I have eaten quite a lot of pizza.    Definitely ordering again."}
{"text":"Grading the pizza here. Average. Good, but nothing special. A little overdone and cool when it arrived. Can't blame them temp on them tho, I ordered and had delivered by Grubhub."}
{"text":"A decent lunch spot. Service is friendly though a tad slow even if the place isn't busy.  The pizza is average at best. It comes out hot, the crust isn't that crisp and as another reviewer said, it lacks flavor. I've also had the fish sandwich which was good; a decent-sized piece of fish that's not greasy. The french fries are pretty good."}
{"text":"Wed. 10/7/15 4-5:30pm I walk into this unremarkable hole-in-the-wall pizza joint, I order a single slice with a few extra toppings, it comes out to $5.31. I hand the cashier my trusty debit card and after a couple times running it, she informs me it doesn't work. \"Oh, that's odd. Shoot, I didn't bring my wallet on my bike. Okay. Well, thanks.\" I take a step back and make a call to my bank, with all the traveling I do, occasionally security will red flag the card, but a quick phone call will unlock it. Unfortunately, \"due to a massive information leak, a lot of cards have been cancelled for security reasons\". After an extremely tedious round of \"brief holds\" and being disconnected twice, I'm finally able to make a one-time transaction at the ATM. Success! Cash! That's the last time I leave the hotel with just my ID and one card! It's been nearly an hour. I'm spent. And really hungry. And now late for my massage appointment. But at least I can finally get this delicious pizza my friend talked about. I go to the counter and reorder my slice. I notice that now it is happy hour and one of the specials reads \"free appetizer with $5 purchase.\" Pleased that some good has come out of wasting a hour on the phone, I ask about adding that happy hour deal to my order. The goateed cashier says, \"if you want to order a beer you have to go to the bar.\" \"Oh, no beer, thank you, just the appetizer.\" He repeats himself, I repeat myself, and accepting we must be experiencing a language barrier, I go to the bar anyway. I try to order my slice of pizza and an appetizer. The bartender says, \"You can't have ordered at the counter already to get the appetizer here. You have to order over five dollars at the bar.\" I look back toward the counter, confused. \"No, I didn't order over there, I was told to come here.\" \"You ordered earlier.\" (I come to realize it's the same girl who ran my card before.) \"Oh. Yes, I tried. But my card wouldn't go through so I called my bank. I have cash now. I'd like to order with the bar so I can get the appetizer for happy hour.\" Her tone is escalating in rudeness, \"Yeah, well, you'll have to pay for that pizza from before and then order over five dollars from the bar.\" She walks away to another customer at the bar.  The gentleman next to me offers to let me order an appetizer on his tab since he has spent well over five dollars at the bar. Gratefully, I accept and we let the bartender know our plan. Again with the rude tone and a roll of her eyes, to boot, \"no. We can't do that.\" I'm so frustrated. I give up. I've had it. Forget the damn pizza. \"Okay, you know what, I don't want anything. Thanks.\"  I pick up my twenty from the bar and start to leave. The bartender apparently can't help herself from viciously spewing, \"Well if you can't afford it, maybe you shouldn't be here.\"  I'm stunned. \"What a rude, bitchy thing to say.\" \"Hey, the truth hurts.\" Then she ran away to the kitchen before I could respond. Of course you think of everything you would like to have said later... It would have gone something like... \"Broke? You work at a fucking pizza place, Bitch.\" Shocked, frustrated, humiliated, I asked for the manager at the counter. A tall, thin, Indian-looking man stretching pizza dough in the back stays rooted to the spot and hollers, \"I'm the manager, what's the problem?\"  \"Could you come over here, please?\"  He sighs and begrudgingly approaches the counter. I take a breath to calm my irritation so I can communicate effectively. At the end of my account, he looks at me blankly, unsympathetically, and says, \"what do you want me to do?\" I can't believe it. \"What do I want you to do?!\" With attitude he says, \"We are busy right now. We don't have time for this. You want a piece of pizza?! I'll make you a piece of pizza!\" (Busy is not what I would call the place. The large first room of tables is completely empty. On the counter side, there is a table of six, a table of four, maybe six people at the bar, and no line to order. Five guys making pizza and two serving girls.)  I'm disgusted with this place and appalled with the alarming opposite of customer service, \"No, I don't want your pizza.\" \"Well, what do you want me to do? I can't fire her right now because we are very busy.\" \"No, I don't want you to fire her.\" \"Well, what do you want me to do? I can't fire her right now because we are very busy.\" \"No, I don't want you to fire her.\" \"Well, what do you want me to do?!\" \"Nothing. Forget it.\"  That was it. I left. Wow. My day really went down hill with the decision to go to Genoa.  As I rode back to the hotel, I was frustrated with myself for letting some snotty, trashy, pudgy, $8-an-hour-plus-tips bar tender get to me. I've done my time in customer service and food service. I was great at it. Then I moved on and built a career. Now my work pays me to travel all over North America and Europe doing what I love. Who's broke now, Bit"}
{"text":"I would have loved to have eaten here but the only item the worker would let us order was a personal dish pizza. This was not an issue, but after paying and waiting for the pizza the employee gave my meal away to someone else. When I questioned this, she simply told me she already served me my food. Absolutely terrible way of doing business. I will not be back."}
{"text":"What can I say, this was the best Pizza and wings I've had in the city (downtown).  Delivery was fast and everything was HOT!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Typically I order from Ephesus Pizza (they are amazing!) but this time I gave Genoa a shot. It unfortunately was bad. I'm giving it 2 stars, as I think a 1 star review is reserved for those who find sanitary issues (bugs, hair, etc) or something pretty heinous. I'll give you a play by play:  1) Delivery driver gets here. He calls as they typically do, and I walk outside. He is sitting in his car in the middle of the street and continues to sit there. I literally had to walk barefoot to his drivers side door to get my food.  2) I ordered fries, 2x gyros and a large pizza. I open up the fries and they are soggy as all hell. Now, fries are tricky. Most restaurants poke holes in the box to let the steam escape so they don't get super gross. This restaurant did not.  3) I open the gyros up and they are sooooo soggy from the grease off the gyro meat. It's wet and slimy and pretty gross feeling. I pull out the tzatziki and it's fully separated. This means it was made (lord knows when), portioned off in portion cups and thrown in the fridge. Then the waters separate from the dairy fats. It's not bad, it just looks bad. What was bad though, was the lettuce on the gyro. It was soggy (probably from mixing with the hot grease from the gyro meat) and it was brown and tasted awful.  4) I open the pizza, hoping that it would redeem the poor quality of the meal, and it's lukewarm at best. This is within 5 minutes of it being dropped off. I was so disappointed. Flavor was ok (it was chicken and bacon), but the crust is that generic crappy dough that you find at any hotel delivery pizza place like Pizza Mia, Pizza Palermo, Pizza Parma, Pizza Perfectta....you get the idea.   Never am I going to order from here again. Issues across the board, so I highly doubt it was a one time situation. I'm definitely going back to Ephesus as my go-to. They are fantastic with many many more wonderful options. Can you say \"dry plum chicken pizza\"? Because it's the best."}
{"text":"Always get the cheese pizza, breadsticks and mozz sticks. Always good. The breadsticks might be my favorite in the city when they're seasoned properly. It's a hit or miss but for what it is and the price, gets the job done!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is slightly better than average,  but the subs and salads are the best in this section of the city.  The steak salad is pretty good.  Lots of fresh greens, tomatoes and a big pile of fresh pizza mozzarella.   Their homemade ranch dressing tops it off well.   This is a negative for me,  but the steak is more of a jiffy steak.   Some folks love it,  but I prefer a real steak,  rare.  The subs and burgers definitely beat my expectations for a corner pizza joint.  The burgers are large and definitely a good quality,  if not handmade.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich is AWESOME, with their yummy Buffalo 'fries'  on top.   I get it with their ranch on top.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get there,  but definitely worth a try if you work downtown."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my hotel tonight.  Not sure why they didn't give me plates for my pizza.  Anyway the seafood pizza was decently tasty (not very hot when delivered and unfortunately I don't have a microwave in my hotel room).  No complaints with the seafood salad too.  For $9 I received a decent sized salad with shrimp and imitation crab. Took about 40 minutes for delivery which is totally acceptable.    They should try using non-generic pizza boxes to promote their name."}
{"text":"Man, I don't get how so many people down this place. I've never had anything but great experiences, whether ordering for delivery or going in.  Their pies are the best that I have tasted in Pittsburgh (so far). So many other joints I have tried mess up the crust, which once you've screwed up the base you've got nothing else. But their pizza crust is thick and chewy, just the way I like it.  I love how they load their pizzas up with toppings (another thing that some pizza places skimp on, which makes for an angry Quay!). Everything tastes fresh and incredibly flavorful.  We ordered in from Genoa's on the nights where we really don't feel like cooking. They were a godsend when we were in the process of moving. We've always managed to get our food delivered well before the quoted time, piping hot, and the delivery guys and the guys who take our order are always pleasant."}
{"text":"The food is here OK, nothing spectacular that would WOW you, basically just good bar food. The customer service is TERRBILE. I ordered a fish sandwich, which was supposed to come with cheese but it DID NOT. Most of the ingredients that the sandwich was suppose to come with where left off, and when I questioned the waitress she replied \"I have no idea what's suppose to come on it\". I had a horrible experience here and wont go back."}
{"text":"Great bar inside. Real cheap and the atmosphere is that of a nice dive. The pizza and the rest of the food is highly underrated. If working nearby I always order when pizza is brought up. Great location."}
{"text":"Wow what a stupid service. First it was supposed to take 45min which we could wait, after 1h30 the online service said it was delivered even if it wasn't... On the phone they told us they \"assumed\" it was on the way... 30min later, we called again, passed to the UTLRA rude manager that basically just hung up on us.. WTF! The food arrived after 2h30 completely cold! Wow! It would be hard to give a service that bad even if I tried!"}
{"text":"The pizza was decent but the appetizers and service left a lot to be desired. The server's attitude bordered on downright rude. Next time I'll skip the trip and get delivery! Better yet, try out a different local pizza place."}
{"text":"When I travel, I try to hit up a place once so I can try other  places, but this was dinner twice and leftover breakfast twice.  The pizza is fantastic."}
{"text":"Never did I think you could get this sick from pizza and mozzarella sticks! Haven't had anything else since I have been fasting for a medical appointment. After I stopped in for some mozz sticks and a few slices of cheese and pepperoni pizza. I have been stuck over the toilet on and off for 7 hours at this point. So now I have to see a dr after just leaving the doctor. I called the owner and he was very rude and told me that unless I could prove it was the food I ate he could not help me. Even after I explained my situation he was incessantly rude. Would not recommend to anyone but the Better business bureau"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ordered a late night pizza and told 45 minutes. Driver calls close to 90 minutes later with lame excuse about getting sent the other direction and still 7-8 minutes away. Called the restaurant to request 50% off and no deal. Then, after asking who the owner is so I can lodge a complaint I'm told by someone with an accent that they don't know, call back tomorrow and after asking several times I was hung up on, twice. I was assertive, and angry, but no cursing or yelling. Terrible, terrible, terrible!!! Hopefully with my Hilton status I can have them removed from the hotel's recommended listing. I would not give this place any business if your counting on them, unreliable to a fault."}
{"text":"First time ordering: the delivery guy couldn't figure out how to ring my very ordinary buzzer, the beverage order was wrong, and though the dish was called eggplant Parmesan--it was hard to find any eggplant. Just soggy breading. I won't be ordering again from these folks."}
{"text":"By far the most mediocre pizza I've ever had. Not worth the calories. Crust was flavorless and had a dry, stale texture. Sauce was cheap jar quality and the cheese was bland. I would have done better heating up a grocery store frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Haven't gotten to spend that much time downtown, but, this will be my go-to pizza place from now on! Good prices, friendly staff and delicious food make it an obvious pick. I ordered cheese pizza and cheesy garlic bread and I was very very happy with what I received. Perfect sauce to cheese ratio on the pizza, and the garlic bread was out of this world (drooling just thinking about it). 10/10"}
{"text":"My family lives on the South SIde of Pittsburgh so we find ourselves ordering out quite often.  You know I've come to not really expect much from these pizza joints.  Like warm food and maybe 3/4 of my order correct.  However we've ordered from this place about 5 times so far over the past 6 months.   Their customer service on the phone is 100%.  They are always so polite to me when I call.  And trust me sometimes I have a fussy newborn and/or a 7 year old who changes what she wants a few times when I am ordering.  But each time they are so patient and they even suggest things to me.  We are now hooked on their Spinach and Feta Pie.  This time we ordered that Pie and a Six Cheese Pie.  Oh and we cant forget the Steak Deluxe Hoagie.  Everything is just so yummy!  The ingredients they use are fresh.  And each item has so many flavors not just your bland tasting pizza.  The pizza came to my door in under an hour!  Also the pizza guy was extemely nice when he got here too.  He was a cute one too ladies! hahah ;)  So my experience with them as usual is awesome.  I probably should call them and tell them how much I appreciate their food and customer service.    I guess the only negative thing I can think of is their pricing.  Gourmet Pizza sm. $10.99, med. $14.99, large $17.99, ex Large $19.99.  But honestly I dont care to pay more if the quality is there too!  YUMMMMMMMMMMMY"}
{"text":"Pizza was left outside, delivery driver never. Called. The worst place ever when I called grub hub to get a refund they told me they would have to speak to this place. Has to throw the food away, never never again, let's hope they  make this right"}
{"text":"Wings on point! Traditional pizzas A-MAZING! Had the chicken & feta and an array of wings. Paige was our server/bartender and was GREAT!! Very attentive, sociable."}
{"text":"Delivery was earlier than expected. Pizza was decent but slightly cold. Chicken and broccoli alfredo was disgusting. I asked for extra Alfredo and it's pretty much dry. The chicken doesn't even have a taste and the texture is basically rubber. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I've never eaten in the actual place because I always get takeout.  But, they have the best pizza.  There isn't a inch thick layer of rubbery cheese.  Its melty and delicious!  The crust also isn't soggy.  Its not greasy either.  It's my favorite pizza place downtown!  I never had a problem with them!"}
