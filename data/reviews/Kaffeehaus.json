{"text":"What can I say? The owner, Tammy is infectiously positive. She serves a great cup of joe and her specialty drinks are delicious. She is a neighbor as well, dwelling in my neighborhood just up the hill. That said I always enjoy supporting local business especially the closer to home is. She has her own parking lot off Street which is wonderful! She always smiles and laughs which makes for pleasant visit always. I can honestly say I've been there over a dozen times and never had bad experience. I usually go for a good cup of drip, or a triple small cappuccino. She does not charge extra for milk alternatives, or syrup believing that at all balance out in the end. This I commend her for and it does bring me back because of my love for almond milk as well as my partners love for milk Alternatives as well. I wholeheartedly support this place and wish you the best in the future one cup of the time for me and everybody else!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. Good coffee and tea. They've got nitro versions of both. Delicious sandwiches. Soup changes weekly and is always awesome. Free wifi and prices are right."}
{"text":"What a delightful little coffee shop
It's in a interesting and changing neighborhood that's worth taking a drive over
They have their own parking lot
Head on in a big case filled with yummy looking baked goods 
Lemon loaf and banana nut breads and cookies 
A lovely looking assortment of biscotti 
Lunch items on a chalkboard 
There is coffee and lattes on the board menu
Plus chai tea in vanilla or spicy I opted for the spicy it wasn't so spicy but it was very nice and sweet
Had it with a plain croissant it wasn't the best croissant but it was good 
There is seating for about 15 
A cool round table a tiny counter facing the street and two tables for two
Friendly service you can sit relax and sip no one will chase you out too soon
There is even a little library with a few books and magazines to enjoy
Its nice to see a place like this"}
{"text":"Cutest spot for catching up with friends over a cup of tea or coffee. It's a cozy and friendly atmosphere. My friend and I came here and stayed a bit after close but we didn't realize it because the owner let us talk while she cleaned up. So nice!!!!
The yummy pastries and cakes are home made me looked amazing. I'll be back to try them."}
{"text":"Friendly and their coffee is delicious! I like to grab and go and love that they have parking!"}
