{"text":"I went here with my friends not too long ago and it was great!

We ordered the baked fillet in white sauce rice dish, and Cantonese fried noodles, as well as fried dumplings to eat. The portions were huge (and we all had to pack it home cause we couldn't finish) and it was very good."}
{"text":"One star mostly because I spent some time unblissfully on the toilet in the aftermath.  Ugh.  Seriously, don't come here.  Your tummy will thank you.  There are so many options around the area, this Cantonese cafe style eatery simply isn't worth it.  

We had the crispy chicken with pepper sauce on rice and the Portuguese baked chicken, both of which are on their 'special menu' which pretty much means that you also get a non-special drink - lemon tea, coffee, milk tea, etc Don't let the drink suck you in to the special menu because the a la carte items can be cheaper, look more appetizing and sometimes also comes with vegetables.  Neither of our dishes which were $5.99 each came with a shred of greenery.  The veggie dishes on the printed menus start at $6.99 for the green beans and up to $9.99 for other veggies.  We cheaped out on the veg because the whole point for us trying this place was for cheap meal.  The chicken on both dishes seemed like the same chicken, just drenched with a different sauce.

The service was OK, though I didn't appreciate how loud the tv volume was turned up for Wayne's aforementioned Chinese show.  Parking can be a titzy in this plaza due to the small parking lot and numerous eateries.  There is an underground parking lot that closes at 9:45pm. 

For the tummy ache, the icky food and everything else... go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Kenly's Noodle?  I didn't spell it wrong, this is NOT Kenny's Noodle but it has that similar concept however it still adopts the previous business's concept of Cantonese Fast Food/Cafe/Restaurant and you'll even notice the Desserts they offer are the same as the Restaurant in this same spot before.  I guess what I'm really saying is that little has changed here.   2.5 *Star*

The space has incorporate a few more TINY booth seating but it simply looks awkward and it'll probably make it less convenient for everyone if this place ever gets busy.  Yup, as I watched Fairchild TV 8 pm show, I decided on either the Clam cooked in Wine with Noodle Soup($6.99) or the House Special Kenly's Big Bowl Noodle Soup($5.99).

Big Bowl Noodle Soup came with a complimentary Hot Drink.  This dish is essentially the Hong Kong Cart Noodle served in a Large Bowl.  Crispy Fish Skin, Tendon, Beef, Pig Feet, Beef Ball, Fish Ball, Wonton, Shrimp Dumpling, and Greens served on Egg Noodles in a Wonton/Beef Stock.

The Noodles are fine and the Broth was actually good as the Beef side of things gave it a sweetness to the typical Wonton salty Stock.  Most ingredients are the A-OK scale however the Pig Feet wasn't tender enough which means I won't be coming back for Pig Feet with Guilin Noodles.

By 8:30 pm, the Kitchen staff were out here joining me in watching Television and eating their Dinner.  It's always funny how most of us will ask for the Bill when 9:00 pm comes around exactly when the TV show ends."}
