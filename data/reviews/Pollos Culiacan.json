{"text":"The chicken at this place is delicious. It's very well seasoned and you can tell they marinate it for a while because the flavors permeate throughout the meat. The chicken was not dry but it wasn't super juicy it was just right and the skin was nicely browned and very flavorful. You can taste the smokiness coming through from the way they prepare it over coals. We ordered our chicken to go and it came in a Styrofoam container with a roll of hot corn tortillas. They have a salsa bar that you help yourself to which included a mild pico de gallo and a very spicy red salsa which was my favorite and you also should try the pickled red onions which are also very spicy. The place is a small catering truck/food truck that is parked right in front of a Mexican seafood restaurant. There is only outside seating right in front of the truck. If you're looking for a really great  grilled chicken that's grilled over hot coals you've gotta try this place.. It's fantastic!! Bring cash because they don't take debit or credit."}
{"text":"I loveeddddd their Culichi style roasted chicken! The salsas and side dishes were tasty and really highlighted the different style of cooking in Sinaloa. Sinaloa is known for their seafood dishes, but they should also be known for their fire roasted chicken and family meals.

They give you a buzzer to let you know your order as the prepare your meal to go . It's nice enjoying the view and sitting looking at the palm trees and hearing the norteno music from Sinaloa playing gave an authentic feeling sitting along the side of the road and smelling the delicious scent of your chicken being prepared . 

If you are ever on the Las Vegas Strip, I mean the northern part in North Las Vegas and want some great food, stop in for a second and enjoy the experience, everyone was so kind. Puro Culichi!!

There is a restaurant next to it too, with Sinaloa style cuisine but we didn't have time to check it out ."}

{"text":"This is the best chicken I've tried in Las Vegas. We buy the $15 dollar combo and it is well worth the price. You get one whole chicken, macaroni salad, beans, and tortillas. The salsa bar is well organized and the salsa tastes great. They have a covered patio where you can sit down and eat, however if you are not use to a rough neighborhood I would recommend you get it to go. This food truck is definitely recommended by The Fambam!"}
{"text":"Súper ricos los pollos 
Muy recomendables...
Están lejos de donde yo vivo, que si estuvieran más cerca los compraría todos los días."}
{"text":"$7 for a half Chicken!! And it was absolute delicious. 
The salsa bar is on point. Pickled red onion with habanero. Green avocado salsa. Chunky tomato. Fire roasted Chile de árbol. All so damn good!!
