{"text":"Solid food, good sized portions and leaves you wanting to come back for more. It's a very good atmosphere with great service and very retro. Can't complain one bit."}
{"text":"We tried out Bearden's lunch/dinner options yesterday and their breakfast this morning. We've lived in Rocky River almost a year now, and only just discovered this wonderful little diner. The atmosphere is great, the staff is wonderful and kind, and the food.....SO YUMMY!

Here's what we tried:

Peanut Burger- we had this without the pickles(although I want to try it with the pickes next time) and it was yummy!! I was shocked at how good a peanut butter burger could be. 

Bearden Triple-this is your classic triple burger, but so much yummier. something about the meat they use makes this thing even better with every bite you take.

Clamtastic Basket-SO had this, and he loved the clams. The fries were cooked so well, crunchy on the outside and so soft on the inside and SO MUCH yummier than any fast food fries out there! Coleslaw was good too. 

Onion Rings-SO GOOD! and huge! they don't disappoint with the size of these puppies and they are amazing. 

Breakfast:

We went simple and got a couple of breakfast burgers and hash-browns. My fiance got a Reese's puffs milkshake and it was SO GOOD i regretted not getting one myself. 

Breakfast burgers are SO filling and yummy. you get eggs, bacon, cheese on the steak-burger and it's spectacular. 

Hash browns were perfect and cheap! We're talking McDonald's dollar menu cheap, only you're putting your money back into your community! 



Bearden's will officially become a regular place for us. It's just so close and so yummy with no corporation-guilt. Cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Consistently good burgers and fries, and awesome fresh onion rings!"}
{"text":"My family has lived in this area for decades and Bearden's has also been around for decades (mostly) so we have eaten in several incarnations of this place.  I remember the Bearden's of my childhood in the late 60s/ early 70s as a dark and slightly dingy place with bears on the sign and napkins, little trains running around the ceiling (if they were working that day) and uneven quality of both food and service.  

The current rejuvenated edition of Beardens is, in my opinion, a vast improvement.  It's bright, light and shiny white, like a modernized version of a retro 50s diner.  Lots of booths in addition to some tables. You order at the counter, which reduces the risk of bad table service, and they've kept all the bears and little trains.(By the way, as a little girl and a big girl, I LOVED THE TRAINS.)    Your food comes in a plastic basket similar to old-time drive-ins.  

Personally, I'm impressed that they kept this place going since its neighborhood is not a hot area for restaurants and is wealthy enough that maintaining this location is probably expensive.  I imagine that nostalgic loyalty is part of the draw, but also the burgers and fries are great if you like that kind of burger and fries - I do!  The burgers are on the thin and greasy side.  I love 'em.  If you prefer the thick, rare-in-the-middle, mile-high, topped-with-fresh-veggies burgers, perhaps on some fancy brioche or pretzel bun o' the moment, go somewhere else, but please understand that not all of us like 'em that way. Me for the nice, wide, flat  burger, on a traditional burger bun, with pickle and a side of crispy (not limp) fries.  The milkshakes are on the retro thin side here too which made my mom happy because she does not like thick milkshakes and cannot get them up her straw.  Onion rings are crispy and battered and do not taste like they came from a bag or a microwave. 

There are many creative toppings offered for burgers here but as you may have guessed I'm a very basic burger person.  A cheeseburger or a peanut-butter-topped burger with pickles (the traditional specialty of the house here) does me just fine.  Overall I leave quite happy with my meal and with the fact that I did not have to drive to some trendy foodie bar area or go to an overhyped overpriced chain like 5 Guys for a burger, especially since Bearden's has its own fairly spacious parking lot so no need to finagle with traffic congestion, street parking or meters.  

Some of the older people I know who remember the old Bearden's have complained that they don't like having to order at the counter or not having table service (although a waitress did bring over some of our food and also checked up on us to make sure we had all needed condiments, etc.  during our last visit - I'd note that this was during a time when restaurant was not very busy).  This is not a problem if you take at least one able-bodied person to make runs to the counter.  I don't know if I would want to bring little kids here though.  People do, but it's not really a \"kiddie\" kind of place, since the prices are higher than your typical McDonalds and also the dining room is small and kids hollering or running in the aisles are going to be in everyone's hair.  In short, I like the place and give 4 stars for food and another star for effort and persistence in keeping a local business on the map."}
{"text":"Wow.  $7 for a cajun chicken sandwich.  Mcdonalds uses higher quality ingredients then this place. One of the worst things I've ever eaten.  Frozen, pre-cooked chicken, and the cheapest bun you can buy."}
{"text":"This is your classic greasy spoon diner. Service is OK, environment is OK, but the food is pretty good. They definitely have the best onion rings around."}
{"text":"Have read about Bearden's in the past. Today I decided to visit Bearden's for the first time. Thought I would get a discounted price being Wednesday. Actually, the price specials are discounted only on Wednesdays during Spring months. OK! Still wanted to try this 1948 rather famous restaurant. The workers were very friendly which is the what I like restaurants to be...I felt very welcome!
The decor is 50's. Rather interesting as I grew up in the 50's...
Being a 73 year old white haired senior citizen I was happy receiving a
discount! Ordered a double steak burger with lettuce, tomato, onion,and
mayo with the beef done medium. Also, ordered an order of fries.
Was pleased that the double steak burger was hot and tasty...the way I love my food. The fries were hot and tasty as well!
The portions were a good size! I was not hungry leaving this place! Will be back at another time for another great eating experience!

Thank you Bearden's.        George P.   Cleveland"}
{"text":"Nice little old diner keeping the old days alive. Excellent steakburgers and amazing onion rings and shakes."}
{"text":"NASTY. They are expensive, messed up our whole order and what we did get we didn't eat because it was so gross."}
{"text":"The onion rings here are Devine and fresh but the burgers are over cooked. They are well done and large but not juicy or flavorful. The skinny fries are good and so are the shakes. The 50s atmosphere is also cute. It's a nice place to take kids but I wish they didn't cook the burgers for so long."}
{"text":"The hamburgers are awesome! This place is great. They give you plenty of food, the food is tasty. The atmosphere is nice, and they don't charge you an arm & a leg like every other burger joint in River!"}
{"text":"We had to check it out now that it has been remodeled (looks great by the way) and back open for business. Felt it was expensive, well not expensive but for what we got and the way they charge. They have a price for the burger and if you want cheese $0.50 and $0.10 to add lettuce & tomato each...just add that cost to the price of the burger instead of the additional charge. Five Guy's you pay one price and can add 10 toppings for no extra charge. The onion rings were really good and the burgers were really good too. It was a nice change of scenary and I am sure we will return in the future."}
{"text":"Bearden's has very good burgers they also have very good milkshakes. There service is also very good. You will get your food in 5 mins. You should try it. It's the only on so if your visiting or live in rocky river you should stop by."}
{"text":"Northeast Ohio is fortunate to have many great burger locations.  Swenson's, Flipside, B-Spot, Skyway, The Rail, are just a few examples.  This is not one of them.  

I was in the area on a Saturday afternoon and craved a burger.  I walked in, and the place was nearly empty (bad sign for lunchtime on a weekend).  I proceeded to order a double cheeseburger and onion rings.  The total was over $11 (I ordered a water).  They charge $.40 for grilled onions on the burger...

I took in a seat in a booth and soon received my food.  The burger was wrapped tightly in paper, which was odd because this was not \"to go.\"  Anyway, the bottom bun was completely soaked in grease.  I regretfully ate anyway.  The burger patties had zero flavor.  Also, for an $11 meal, I expected more than THREE onion rings.  The batter was way too thick and overpowered the measly onions inside.  

On top of this disappointment, the staff consisted of high school kids who were on their phones and ignoring the few customers that were present while I was there.  This is the worst burger experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"I have been going to Bearden's since 1948 in fact longer, when it was Jackson's.  This owner
has cheapened it.  It's initial service.  No waitresses.  The only thing left is the hamburger
which has gotten thinner.  I go on rare occasions now.   Ohh for the good old days"}
{"text":"Good hamburgers.  Try a peanutburger.  It is delicious.  The best onion rings I've ever had.  Great place to take kids!"}
{"text":"Old fashioned burger stand, looks like it came straight out of the 50's!

Daughter and I are burger lovers, and love to sample all the local places.  Had yet to make a trip here, so when Mom was out of town we snuck up to River to give it a go!

Cheeseburgers, fries, onion rings and we split a vanilla milkshake.

Burgers were hearty but not fancy...served with the typical veggie trimmings (if you choose), american cheese all sandwiched between a buttered / grilled bun.  Tasty, greasy, just what you'd expect.

Fries were totally rock star!  They were pillowy in texture, served piping hot and stayed that way throughout the meal.  Onion rings were a bit disappointing...more on the chewy side (big and thick) than crispy which we really did not care for.

Lastly was the vanilla milkshake...served thick and so, so creamy.  Had a wonderful (but not overpowering) vanilla taste and really hit the spot.

Overall Id say (for what it is) the prices are on the high side, but so glad we finally got a chance to sample Bearden's and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Really disappointing! I took my kids for a train and good milkshakes but....milkshake machine was not working and the train was broken! Food was not the best fries were cold, burger was meh. I was told by other patrons its not usually bad. But based on first impression, I would not go back. I was there at peak lunch time 12:30 - 1 pm and nothing seemed fresh. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and we were really disappointed. We waited an hour for our food. The milkshakes came out 45 minutes before our food. I still don't see why it took an hour to get fast food. Now to the good part, the only hot dish we ordered came out cold. The rest of us had BLT's.  When we brought it to their attention they offered nothing but a refund which showed no regard to the fact that we waited an hour for food that came out cold and we were starving."}
{"text":"I won't choose to go here.  After waiting 30 minutes for a to go order, that they still got wrong, the food was getting cold and soggy.  They had the food ready before the shakes, then put the shakes in a glass, had to redo then and then they were ready to go.  Meanwhile the onion rings were mushy.  The fries were really good. But I asked for ketchup from two different people, and no one got me any, they just pointed to an empty bin on the counter.  The place was not that busy, and I'd hate to see what happens if they had a large crowd.  While waiting, I had ample time to look around. Its decked out in retro teal booths with a train running over head.  You order and pay at a counter and then they take you your food.  Another family was waiting really long for their food and when they tried to get at least the portion that was ready, the employee insisted on taking that to the table.  My burger was good, the soup was blah, I have it sitting in my fridge and just hate wasting food by throwing it out.  The malt was horrible, it had huge lumps of malt powder in it, I think it was malt powder, it wasn't very malty either.  My companion had her burger messed up.  She ordered a double and got a single. In a way it worked out cause she did not like it at all. She would not go back at all.  If I'm with someone who really wants to go to Bearden's, then I'll go back, but it will NEVER be my choice.  Its diffenatly not as good as it was when I was a kid, eating here at least once a month."}
{"text":"I brought my mom here because I knew she would love the train that went around the ceiling. For some reason, they think that only children would get all giddy and clap their hands when they see the train working so they usually only run it for kids. Well, my mom showed them. 

They serve Dr. Pepper. 

They are closed Sundays."}
{"text":"I always say that 5 stars is hard to get, and usually takes two trips. 

The second time I came back to Bearden's, I suggested it for a lunch meeting with an associate of mine. These meetings usually take hours, and my nostalgia had me wanting to also relish in the good ol' days of leading high schoolers in their first jobs to keep a place clean, keep the food good, all that.

The new day manager was doing just that, and doing better and keeping the train running for the kids, the tables bussed, and the staff active. 

Sorry for the lateness, but the meeting was October 12th, and Yelp JUST reminded me I never finished this review. Anyway, Bearden's- Good. I will return again and again!"}
{"text":"The peanut butter burger was great!  (I wasn't sure what to expect.)  Wife also enjoyed the hot dog.  Delicious fries and deep fried pickles.  Very fast service!"}
{"text":"An oldies diner theme.  Burgers, fries and shakes.  I have to say, it was damn good.  The burgers are better than Five Guys (plus it is locally owned so I will always give the nod to that over a chain).  Fries are underwhelming...I should have ordered the onion rings.  Did I just give myself a reason to come back?  I think so.  Charming atmosphere with a crowd ranging from kids to seniors."}
{"text":"it's been over 15 years since i'd last been to Bearden's. i remembered it being good but nothing specific. 

all these years later i really wanted to go back and check it out. Danielle and i went this last Saturday and, to be honest, we were a little underwhelmed. in fact, Danielle didn't like hers at all. she ordered fish and chips and the fish was still cold/frozen in the middle. she took it back and they remade it but the new plate was greasy. in fact everything that was fried was way too greasy. they need to check the temp of the fryers because their probably set too low, or they're trying to fry too much at one time. i had onion rings that were soggy from sitting in grease.
when i paid at the counter i tipped expecting some sort of service and really got nothing. one girl dragged herself away from the Cavs game for a single minute to walk our food out to us. no one stopped to ask how the food was or anything. 
i'd ordered a hot dog (got 2 for some reason) and a Peanutburger. the hot dogs were nothing special - not real good, in fact. however, the Peanutburger was incredible. it's the sole reason for the 3 stars. had i just gotten this sandwich (to go) we'd have a 5-star review. the burger was delicious and i've been thinking of it since we left.

normally i'd not care too much about getting back to a place after a visit like this but to be honest, i'm gonna go back for another burger. no doubt."}
{"text":"Great burgers (especially with grilled onions). Old time family eatery (with a great model train that little kiddies and big adults love to watch.)
Try it at least once."}
{"text":"Vegie burger and beef burger are good and big.  Their web site is not up to date, no avocado!  The toppings add up & don't add too much to the burger, they're great w/out all the extras.  The blue cheese topping was barley there, the cheddar was a good amount.  The French fries & onion rings (which they're \"known for\") weren't necessary.  Shake was good.  3 burgers, 1 shake, 1 French fry/onion ring split = $20 +.  Next time I'm going on kids eat free night, getting a vegie burger w/ lettuce, tomato, extra dill pickles, maybe sauté onions & that's it.  Free 60's Juke box, Toy train circles the ceiling.  The vegie burger was even excellent the next day re-heated in a toaster oven."}
{"text":"Love the food, really brings you back to good quality diner food, and the shakes are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best burger in Cleveland, don't come here if you don't want old-style, greasy-spoon dining.  But if you don't mind delicious, fatty burgers in wax paper, served by waitresses with mild attitude, then this is where you want to go.  

It's a small menu.  Everything's pretty much fried.  Try the mushrooms, they're good."}
{"text":"The set up- once you walk in you are directed towards the front counter, which is where you order. If you choose to dine in feel free to grab a seat after you place your order and a food runner will bring out your meal. 

I've been reading reviews of this place for years and finally decided to try it out today. I ordered the double steak burger meal with fries and a drink, my girlfriend ordered the same but without a drink. The food came out about 5-10 mins after we ordered and everything was cooked to perfection. The burger patties are on the smaller side but the fry portion was larger than expected so I left without any residual feelings of hunger! Overall the burger was pretty good--not the best burger I've had around here but certainly not the worst. My issue (and the reason I gave it 3 stars) was the price. Our meal came out to $19 dollars and my girlfriend didn't even get a drink (and we skimped on the \"add-on's\". I figured a meal like this, at a place like this would be $10 or $15 max but I ended up paying B Spot prices for a Steak n Shake burger. The burger wasn't anything special for the price they charge so I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since I was a kid - but I'm sure glad I came back! The experience was better than I remembered! The inside has been remodeled and looks fantastic. Done in a diner style I thought it was really clean and cute inside. I swear the food is better than I remembered too. It was a great cheap & quick place to grab dinner with my toddler son and grandma. Also, the young gentlemen that helped me at the counter was so kind and helpful. I really appreciated his amazing service! Single burger was enough food with some fries. Perfect easy meal!"}
{"text":"We used to eat at the old Bearden's a lot and were always satisfied. They were closed during the Lake road construction, and are now remodeled and open under new ownership. We were driving by one day to see if they were open and they were not but were training to open. The new owner invited us in gave us a tour and offered us a burger for free. We have been back and have always been satisfied. Great burgers onion rings. Try the peanut burger. Sounds strange but is great!"}
{"text":"Peanut butter milkshake. Check. Mushroom & onion cheeseburger. Check. Slim Jim fries. Check. First time here and I loved everything about this place. The food was simple, cheap and above all else...GOOD!!! We were greeted with a smile when we walked in and throughout our visit. In my opinion, folks complaining about having to place the order at the counter...I say COME ON, really? The prices are sooo low, I truly didn't mind placing my order and have them bring it to my table. When we are back in the area this is sure to be on our list of stops before heading to the lake."}
{"text":"I've been hesitant to try because of some of the reviews. First of all, I'm not certain how other reviewers didn't understand \"what to do\" here. It was pretty obvious when we walked in. Ahem. I digress.

I had the Beardenburger and a side of clam strips. Both were tasty and attractive to the eye.  My fiance had a salad that looked fresh. He seemed happy with it. (He can't eat starchy things, so salad is his thing when we do actually eat out.) My buddy had a burger and vanilla shake.  He was happy with both items.

Decor reminded me of Chicago burger joints from when I was a kid. Fun. Well lit,  clean, pleasant atmosphere. 

We will return. (Apparently, I'm channeling Patton tonight.) :-)"}
{"text":"I hate to write such a bad review for such a local place. I came to Bearden's expecting a great smashed burger and friendly environment. When we first came in on a Saturday afternoon we were greeted by staff member stating there would be  a 15 minute just to place the order. While waiting I saw an older lady ask a staff member when the coffee would be back out and he said he did not know as they are still making it. Well the whole hour we were there the coffee never came out. The restaurant was disgusting spilled soda on a table all over the floor and the staff just kept walking over it, The ketchup bottle had ketchup all over the outside. The tables were all messy with garbage and scattered chairs. The basket bins where over flowing. I also had to point  a table out to the worker who was unable to read table numbers cards. This certain staff member even said under his breath \"I have no Idea what I am doing' Our food finally came and all of our toppings were switched between our sandwiches but still did taste good. The fries were tasty at least. I really wanted to like this place and contemplated writing a bad review but the lack of management and quality of work that day was the worst I have experienced ever. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Bearden's is one of the few vestiges of the family eateries that have been both a part of my father's childhood and my own, as well.  I only hope the same will be for my own children when they visit their grandparents in Cleveland.  Because Bearden's is a very special place to my family, as I am sure it has been for many other West Siders, as well.  

The menu is a reliable greasy spoon variety.  Soup of the day, grilled cheese, hamburgers, fries.  You cannot go wrong with these old stand-bys, and despite the low carb craze, Bearden's continues to deliver heart attacks on a plate, with ketchup on top.  The onion rings are colossal and the milkshakes are just thick enough to turn your lips a light blue.  I imagine these aspects have remained the same since the '50s when fathers brought their daughters here after a trip to downtown...as they still do...and, fortunately, they still pay.  

Not that a meal here is going to break the bank.  The prices are fair, the waitstaff are friendly, and the toy train that rides the rails around the ceiling of the main dining room signals that children have always been welcome here, no matter how old."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a good flattop burger, string cut fries with a fountain drink to wash it down. Sunday lunch at Bearden's hit the spot for a good old fashion lunch. We ordered 2 burgers each with grilled onions & mushrooms with the addition of cheese on the wife's order. A small order of fries, some fried pickles and Coke from the self serve fountain rounded out the order for a total just shy of $25. 

Short wait gave us the time to look over the Decor that is straight out of the 50's. Nice and clean dinning area with a free juke box and train set on a elevated track around the dinning room. 

The burgers were good with a thin patty and plenty of mushrooms and onions. Bearden's runs counter to the trend of monster oversized burgers that's the current rage. The fries and pickles the right complement to the meal. 

Bearden's is the place to go when you want to step back from what's trending and just enjoy a decent burger."}
{"text":"Always fantastic! I love the burgers and the fried pickles. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes burgers. Very cool and clean interior."}
{"text":"Family friendly. Great burgers. And kids loved the chicken and french fries. Awesome lunch with my beautiful family at a very nice place ."}
{"text":"This place is my kid's favorite restaurant. Food is consistent and it's great that you can mostly get in and out on your own time-a big plus with little ones. You can walk up to the counter, order and pay. Food comes out to your table quickly, then you can eat and leave at your own pace. Quaint inside and the food is decent. Kids eat free on Tuesday. It's a charmer..."}
{"text":"Before I even start this review, 5 GUYS, BROWN BAG BURGER, OR EVEN MCDONALD'S IS BETTER THEN BEARDEN'S!

SIDE NOTE: MY PICTURES MAKE THIS PLACE LOOK WAAAAAY BETTER THEN IT REALLY IS! I WAS SO EXCITED AS SOON AS I SAW MY FOOD, THEN THE FIRST BITE, ALL DOWNHILL FROM THERE! LOOKS GOOD, TASTES BAD!


Okay, it's time for an honest review of this place. I'm really puzzled by the 4 and 5 star reviews this place has.  Lets start with walking in the door, shall we? Your expected to know that you grab a menu off the left hand wall (as soon as you walk undecided what you want and place your order 20 feet ahead. I grabbed a menu, and of course had to ask what next? There's no signs posted or anything explaining this strange process.  My first impression since the place is full of tables and booths was, sit and order. Anyway, we sat down, decided what we wanted, walked back up to the register, placed the order, got our drinks, sat back down and waited. The girl at the register was less then helpful. Since it was my first time at Bearden's, I had no clue what any of their sauces were and god forbid I ask!

 Our order consisted of a triple burger with bacon, mushroom, onion, American cheese, egg and mayo, a double burger with the same toppings, except they forgot the egg. For our sides we tried the onion rings and regular fries, not the skinny ones. He had a PB milk shake and I hate a fountain drink. $30 later, I could have cried over how horrible it was. I'm not just saying it was horrible because I'm a food snob and can't handle a greasy burger, I have been known to eat White Castle on occasion! My burger was 100% tasteless, no joke. I tasted nothing that resembled a burger or any of the toppings I ordered. I know it sounds weird, but honest, it had no taste. The fries were the best part of the meal and those were just OK. Onion rings, blah! Super thick breading with no taste other then beer batter. If you blind folded me I'd have no idea there was onion in it. The milkshake was nothing fantastic and I could have made it at home, probably would have tasted better. Fountain pop was, whatever it's fountain pop. While we were eating my bf asked \"what do you think?\" I said \"I honestly can't even tell you, it doesn't taste like anything\" So how can something that tastes like nothing be horrible, right? Well, if your in the mood for grease all over your face, hands, clothes and anything else around you then you'd love Bearden's. If you like thick battered onion rings with no onion flavor, you'd love Bearden's. If you like a burger with no flavor and don't mind spending $30, then you'd love Bearden's. I was super bummed after finishing less then 1/2 of my overpriced meal. I really wanted this place to be good, considering I spent an hour reading reviews. 

As far as the decor, boring! I guess the train is neat, but I wouldn't go there just to watch a train go around a ceiling. There's absolutely nothing for kids to do, except watch a train, and if you have little girls like I do, then forget about them being amused by a train.  I'm not sure what everyone thinks is so \"neat\" about this place? It's pretty boring, I think. 

So at the end of the Bearden's adventure, I wasted $30 and ended up throwing 1/2 of the food away. If your in the mood for tasteless burgers, go for it! Don't say I didn't warn you!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried pickles I've ever had and I'm a huge fried pickle fan! They also have great burgers. Very pleasantly surprised with how great everything we've ordered from there is. The prices aren't bad at all either."}
{"text":"Bearden's restaurant is an overall pretty good restaurant however it does not compare to the old family owned recipes milkshakes and overall food of the original Beardens"}
{"text":"Hoping to find a Swensons-esque burger place actually in the 216 area code, I went to Beardens once (one time too many). Gross.

The burger literally disintegrated under the sheer weight of its grease; the shoddy bun didn't help either. The place in general looked like it had last been cleaned prior to my birth.

Not getting food poisoning was a serious concern at the time, although in Bearden's defense I did not actually receive that gift.

It sure was cheap though!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my wife and 13-month old son. Very comfortable, family-friendly environment. The burgers live up to the hype, food is reasonably priced, and the wait staff is prompt and friendly. Splurge and get the onion rings, they are very good. Love the selection of Great Lakes beers, too. That was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"The Bearden burger is wonderfully juicy! The clam chowder is very good."}
{"text":"Went to Bearden's today with a friend. It was probably the first time i had been here in over 6 years or so. As some of you may know this whole part of Lake Rd. was completely screwed by slow construction for what seemed like a number of years. Times must have been rough for business seeing as it was almost completely inaccessible for the most part. Bearden's seemed to take a hit and even closed down for a while. I can confirm that it is open and it's also been remodeled. 

As you pull in you will notice the fully revamped Bearden's illuminated sign. The old one was iconic and classic looking - a zone that had been tested by time and succeeded. The new sign has the same classic boldness with a bit more color and sports a sharp appearance. The parking lot seemed a little bigger as well. As you approach the entrance, you will notice a Ford Mustang cemented into the wall. It looks pretty cool actually.

You enter down a small hallway and roll right up to the counter. You will notice some menu's posted along the wall with letters from Bearden's fans.  A dedicated tribe indeed. You now order at the counter and take a number. A cup for a beverage is provided and you can have at the fountain all you want. The menu is standard if you know how Bearden's is set up; classic steakburgers, milkshakes, fries, onion rings etc etc. It's basically like a mom and pop styled Steak N' Shake with a style all it's own. I ordered a Bearden's Double Steakburger and an order of fries. With a drink out the door we're talking $11.99. It's steep. 

I sat down with my pal at a booth and checked out the scene. Everything is a bright white color with sea foam green interior. It's much, much different than the old 70's styled Bearden's we all remember and love. The same train I think they always used to have was on and circling the perimeter. Classic style! It was sad to be in there when it got dumpy to see the old train even broken down. Maybe it was a sign of their situation. 

Our food was delivered and it was EXACTLY the same as it always was. I consider this to be a good thing. A lot of people don't like when places like this change. If the food takes a twist (re: Sweet Melissa's, which will never live up to Max's Deli, just down the road) there is a good chance you will offend your loyal following for life. The fries were pretty good, not incredible. The burger was actually better than i remember it being. 

If you're going to Bearden's and you're a vegetarian or something, you might be in a bit of a bind. This is the fried food zone to the max, not much in the way of healthy eating here. But for the most part, Bearden's is a local staple people have come to love and enjoy - there is an element of nostalgia that is directly tied to the atmosphere of the restaurant. If you didn't rock Bearden's as a kid and you're just passing through town and stop here, it might be easy to misunderstand what this place is all about. 

I was thinking of giving it a 3 star review, just because of the bitterness of the renovation and the intense aqua overdose in the decor, but those are personal feelings that don't make sense in the larger picture of running a business and the upkeep that comes with it. It's the nostalgia and the effort to keep things classic at the end of the day that I appreciated. They had these cool bear shaped ketchup and mustard bottles that will surely stick in the mind of a new youngster for years to come. That's the vibe that Bearden's seems to have always rocked well. Besides that, the food was as good as ever. You're coming in for a steakburger and fries, how bad can it really get??

It's a diner in a small town, if you come here expecting gourmet food, hang back. If you haven't had Bearden's in a while, come by and check it out because it's worth the time."}
{"text":"I've been eating so many burgers this past month that I am going to start looking like a round burger patty myself if I don't include a salad now and then, but there are just too many places to try! This time around I stopped in at Bearden's for a double cheeseburger and the chili cheese fries. 

Firstly, this place has really pulled off their 1950's diner theme without coming across too kitschy.  I like the atmosphere and think it's perfect for what they serve up, which is basically just burgers, shakes, and some fried sides like french fries and tater tots. The staff of teenagers also seems appropriate and reminds me of my summer jobs in high school. Speaking on the staff, they were all pleasant, patient, and helpful when I asked questions about the menu. 

Now for the food! Make sure you come in on a Wednesday because that is half price burger night even if you get the burger to-go. I started off with a basic double hamburger for $2.98 ($5.96 full price) and added cheddar cheese .55¢, lettuce .15¢, and since condiments are free my double burger came to $3.68. The burger is a pretty nice size so this is definitely a good deal. My small side of chili cheese fries came in at $5.05, but there was nothing small about this; could definitely feed two people unless you like putting yourself in a food coma. The chili is mildly spicy with chunks of meat (hamburger patties?), onions and green peppers. The cheese is your standard melted nacho cheese. So my bill in total was $8.73, very affordable! 

This place is definitely a solid 3 stars and I would recommend it over a chain fast food joint (support local!). The food was good, but I did not think it was something mouth watering that I would crave to have again. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the burger was not overly greasy, but it did not seem seasoned and I only got one slice of cheese for my two patties. The fries are thin frozen ones which I feel meh about no matter what, but they did the job. All in all I think Bearden's does well for what they are and you can't compare them to places with gourmet burgers or even a fast food chain because you're coming here for a taste of simple old school diner food and memories of yesteryear. 

I'd come back for another burger, just maybe mix up the toppings and condiments. I'd also go for the homemade onion rings and a milkshake, yeah... that sounds good."}
{"text":"A surprise suggestion from my sons on \"Dinner with Dad\" night brought me back to Bearden's. I had been a \"regular\" at Bearden's prior to their closing in 2010, and returned only once after it's reopening in 2011. It just wasn't the same. 

Committed, however, to the \"wherever you want to go\" rule, after stating my trepidations, I accepted the kids' recommendation and headed to the once beloved Bearden's. 

We arrived at a vacant restaurant, staffed by a couple of highschool girls. No manager, or staff member over 18 in sight. Lack of supervision aside, they were pleasant enough, and the restaurant quite clean, albeit empty. 

My oldest son and I each ordered a single burger with fries and a fountain drink (it's not Coke or Pepsi, it's called Craft'62 made with Pure Cane Sugar), while my youngest just got fries and a fountain drink. Apparently I didn't give him enough time to review the menu, but I digress. 

Bearden's advertises fresh not frozen burger patties, and I have no reason to believe otherwise. A generous flat patty on a fresh oversized bun, with fresh ingredients. There is an upcharge for many ingredients though, and it can add up quickly. I think I paid $27 (plus tip) for the order explained above. That's $9 per person, and one didn't even get a burger... 

As for the food itself, the burger really didn't have a whole lot of flavor. It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't particularly GOOD either. A little salt and pepper would have gone a long way I think. Unlike their patties, their fries are definitely of the frozen variety. I seem to recall their fries being really good before their initial closing. Whatever they've changed; change back! Fries can make or break a burger joint. 

Will I return? The general consensus actually was \"Yes.\" I'm sure my kids will ask to go back and I wouldn't complain. Notwithstanding, Bearden's is a long way off from what it once was. Hopefully the passion will return to the owner/staff and they will once again reclaim their crown as one of the best independently-owned burger stops Cleveland has to offer."}
{"text":"So, I have tried this place more than a handful of times and I don't get the hype. I went in with the kiddos for a quick and cheap dinner, and while I will give them quick, cheap is not the case. Two burgers with cheese and condiments, 2 tiny shakes and a side of fries came to $23, and then I left a tip, which I now regret. When the food came, my eldest got his burger and dug in. The little and I shared as he wont eat his own, so why waste the money? He made a face, and I figured out why after I tried it. Instead of ketchup it had mustard, a lot of mustard. Perhaps some eat burgers that way, but never me. So I walk up to the counter and after FINALLY getting cashiers attention, I explained I didn't order it this way. She proceeded to insist I did. I am not arguing with a 17 year old, so I just ask them to remake it. She agreed, but still insisted I asked for mustard. I left annoyed, underwhelmed and wishing I went to Jammy Buggers as I would have spent less there and left happy. Next time I will allow my 7 year old to have steak and shake as he wanted where I will expect no more than a mediocre dinner."}
{"text":"Bearden's has been around for quite awhile and it still delivers.  Located in Rocky River is a cool retro style burger joint with a toy train running around the ceiling.  You order up front and they deliver the food fresh to your table.  Check out the free jukebox which has a great selection of classic rock, pop and Motown.

the menu provides for burgers, fries, onion rings and other favorites, but I go for the fried clams.  The fried clams here are large and made to order, crispy on the outside with a moist and slightly chewy clam inside, these are the best fried clams I have found in Cleveland.  The fries are good traditional thin potato strips, well fried.  Onion Rings are huge slices of sweet onions with a crisp thicker shell.

Looking for a place to get some good traditional burger joint food, then checkout Bearden's."}
{"text":"I was hungry for a hamburger and my husband suggested Bearden's.  YUCK !  The clam chowder soup was lukewarm at best.  The onion rings were greasy,tasteless and had to much batter on them.  Steakburger? - seriously, the meat was paper thin and had absolutly no taste .  Milkshakes were OK.  We eat out at least once a week and granted some places are better than others but this Bearden's was not worth the $30.00 we spent."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite burger in Ohio. They renovated and it looks like a cute 50's diner but took away the waitresses. And changed the food. Doubt I'll come back to spend $28 on two burgers and drinks. Food was ok. Place looked clean as we were the only customers at 5:30pm."}
{"text":"I tried this place one time about ten years ago and I was not overly impressed with what I got then, but all you hear is Beardens this Beardens that I felt I would be fair to give them another shot post remodel. I went in on a Monday evening I got a cheeseburger with some traditional toppings and a milkshake. The cheeseburger was indeed as greasy as I remember the first time. Not to mention completely tasteless. I have to say for all the hype I have heard about this place it is truly one of the most disappointing burgers I have ever had, and if I am experienced in anything it is how a burger should taste. The Milkshake was handed over to me and was already starting to go \"runny\" by the time I took my first sip. I have to say I was completely unimpressed with the milkshake and my experience overall. 

I long to live the experience people seem to have with this place. I always root for local businesses to do well, but I have to say from my standpoint Beardens has run out of chances."}
{"text":"This is arguably one of the best places to get a burger on the west side. They can be tailored to every taste with each ingredient priced separately on the menu.  The fries are great but the sweet tooth nut in me gravitates toward a more super important recommendation: chocolate peanut butter shakes. Ridiculously tasty.

The only thing i would forego are the Mac and cheese bites. Nothing special about them and they're a bit bland."}
{"text":"Please- the next customer who asks for a root beer float with chocolate ice cream; let them know you don't have any chocolate ice cream before you make it., not afterwards and act like it doesn't matter. When you make it with vanilla ice cream and pour chocolate syrup in it they will always be disappointed, out $4.00, pissed they didn't go to Mitchell's around the corner and mad at themselves  that they gave this \"used to be great place\", another chance."}
{"text":"I tried Bearden's at the beginning of March because I was really curious about the remodel after reading an article about them in the Cleveland Magazine. Now I was a big fan of the old Bearden's, but this was just awesome! I loved coming here at a kid and I can't wait to go back!!

I love the blue-ish/turquiose theme. I feel like there is more seating and the windows make it much more open. Such a cute theme and ambiance.

I like going up to the counter to order, but that's me. I had the amazing Bearden burger which my mouth is watering as I type this. Just absolutely great. Nothing comes close, not even Five Guys. Bearden's is by far the best burger joint around! 
I love the slim jim fries, and of course their famous milkshakes. I can't even have milk but I gave in for a Bearden's shake. 

I also went when they opened around 11am but they still can people coming in even that early. 

Beware: it is a family restaurant, if you are like me, and prefer the not to enjoy the presence of little devils, this is not the place to hangout on a regular basis. The choo choo train could play a major role in that, but even I liked watching it go around as a kid. 

Overall I am SO happy to see Bearden's is BACK and better than ever!"}
{"text":"Bearden's was closed during the rebuild of Lake Road, and the owners took advantage of that time to redecorate and revise the restaurant. The refreshed look is bright and airy, and very pleasant.

Service has changed from regular table service to ordering at the counter and then selecting a table. Some people in line were less than thrilled with this change, but I didn't mind it.

The menu hasn't changed much, which is terrific in my opinion. The Bearden's steak burger is quite delicious, and while a peanut butter burger sounds kind of insane, it's actually delicious - particularly with bacon. My only ding on the menu was that the honey mustard sauce for the deep-fried mushrooms. It was some kind of industrial sauce in a little plastic box and was the most hideous sauce I've ever tasted. Almost spectacularly so. 

Come in, have a burger, enjoy the music, and have a step back into nostalgia."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Very much just like the old time diners with a moving train.  The food was good also.  Had a blt sandwich that hit the spot."}
{"text":"Caught up with Bearden's on a sunny afternoon in November. A fine fresh double and very big onion rings were delivered to my table in under 10 minutes. Quaint and bright dining room. Very clean and family friendly spot. Would love to try a shake next time. Much better than average burger. A little pricey, but they are offering half price Wednesday burgers for a limited time. Look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"We were driving around Lakewood enjoying the old houses and we ended up in Rocky River. Decided to pull in to Bearden's - I love diners, it has a Mustang sticking out of the wall, and I wanted a cheeseburger. We ordered a double bacon cheeseburger, single cheeseburger, large fries, pop, and small chocolate shake for $25. Cute interior with oldies music playing. We ate outside and the burger hit the spot perfectly! Definitely not a healthy place to eat but yummy burgers that will fill you up!"}
{"text":"Delicious hamburgers - Super filling, with almost any topping you could imagine."}
{"text":"I first went to Bearden's in 1962 when I played on their team in the Rocky River Little League.   It was fantastic, and it seems like I've been there a jillion times ever since.  Even after I left the Cleveland area for warmer climes, I always, always would stop by Bearden's when visiting my parents, still living in River.  When I heard Bearden's was shutting down I was devastated, but thrilled when I learned it was to be reopened.  Since then I've been back to town twice, making my traditional visit to the place each time.  

It's natural and inevitable that I compare the old Bearden's to the new Bearden's, and the latter comes up short, unfortunately.  The new method of ordering at the counter creates a fast food vibe, big time.  The waitresses, over the years, always had a lot of character and brought a lot of charm to the restaurant.  That's gone. (And so much for creating jobs.) The Beardenburger still uses the same great cut of meat, and is value priced, but I they no longer put a pat of butter atop the burger, and the buns aren't lightly toasted, as they used to be.  The famous onion rings are still great but the portion size was a bit chintzy.   The menu has expanded notably.  Perogies were put on the menu to pay homage to Cleveland's large population of folks of Slovak or Polish descent, I suppose, but this was a giant mistake, as their perogies, deep fried, were absolutely terrible.  Eating one of these was the first time in fifty years of Bearden's dining that I has something that was bad.   Check that, call it embarrassingly horrible.   One great thing about the menu expansion was the addition of Birch Beer.  Now that's a home run.  

The new turquoise upholstery is fine, but again lends to the fast food chain ambiance.  Serving food in plastic baskets doesn't help the experience.

Alas, it seems an institution since 1948 is now just another burger joint."}
{"text":"My dad has lived in Rocky River for all his life, and I lived there up until I graduated from college. Beardens remained the same for all of those years until they did a small remodel a few years ago. If you're a peanut butter fan-I definitely suggest getting the peanut butter burger. So, so good."}
{"text":"Fried clam sandwich was great -- totally loaded with giant deliciously fried pieces of clams. I haven't seen fried clams on the menu anywhere in a while. Looked like they had some good specials and some cheap beer ($1.50 Guiness 16 oz?...). Otherwise the place looked like it was from the middle of Wisconsin..."}
{"text":"It has been about a year since we visited Beardens.  I actually thought it had closed.  We always have the peanut butter burger which is yummy.  And I do crave it.  However the service always seems less than pleasing."}
{"text":"Drove past this place last week on a detour because of traffic. And I remembered a few years back when people were up in arms about it closing. So I was with my son and his friend shopping and decided to give this place a try. I love how old fashioned the dining room is. The booths are comfortable, fluffy people friendly and very clean. The staff was awesome very friendly. I paid $34 for 3 burgers, 3 small drinks, 2 fries and an onion ring. The burgers reminded me of Wendy's pattys. Very thin. The food came out great and we're made perfect. The buns however got soggy from the grease. My son's burger fell apart so he had to eat it with a fork. The onion rings were 3 big rings. 3! I the fries were thin like McD's but they were good. They don't salt them so you can salt them so that was nice. They staff doesn't come and check on you or anything while you're eating. It's not like an actual restaurant. It's like a fast food restaurant. An expensive fast food restaurant. The only saving grace about this place was the old fashioned feel, cleanliness and the staff was nice. Not worth $34 for 3 people that's for sure."}
{"text":"OMG .. OMG .. OMG .. when this placed closed for a couple years it was like losing a best friend .. so happy to have my best friend back again .. this is by far my most favorite restaurant .. is it the best burger? .. well no . .but it is damn close .. there is just something so comforting about going to Bearden's .. been going there for 43 years .. as long as I have been alive .. as much as the decor has changed (although not too many times) the food has always been consistant .. do have to say the milkshakes are not as thick as they used to be but their burgers + onion rings + slim Jim fries are what I seek the most .. so glad to have them open again .. my how I missed it!"}
{"text":"First off I'm a burger snob, wipe it's nose, smack it's ass and bring it to my table. I like very little added to my burger so that I can honor the bovine that gave it's life for me.

That to say the burger was super good, great flavor to the beef just enough grease and fresh bread. 

Cool diner, didn't partake of the shake but I did have a Beardens Root Beer and it was tasty 

The shoestring fries were good but the double burger filled me up so I didn't get too deep in those. 

Music is cool, TV with cartoons is a nice touch, will be back. 

I will say a little over ten bucks for burger fry and soda is getting on the high side but worth it."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have Bearden's open again.  It was a great place for a fast lunch, served by nice people and the kids ate too.  

Now, the food is still great, but the self serve part is a put-off.  It would be ok if the staff didn't seem so scared of interacting with the customer.  I thought it was because it was a newish place, but there has been no change in the vibe.  The elderly love this place, but it is very difficult for them to enjoy when they have to serve themselves.  I really miss the wait staff and I think it added to the diner experience to have them.  

I don't mind the plastic cups if you could just bring the wait staff back.  We miss them."}
{"text":"Wow Bearden's. I'm granting two stars because my kids loved their meals. The staff is responsible for the rest of the stars being docked.
Saturday, 515pm. One other table of two along with us. There were four of us. We walked in and the employees were talking amongst themselves. Pet peeve: no greeting. It's a simple, fast food counter type ordering system. Take my order and I will be out of your business. We had to wait for the employees to finish, ordered, and took our seats. 
Food arrives. Milk shakes are tasty, we got chocolate and vanilla. We were short a burger. Four people, three meals. Weird. Why would we do that? Unfortunately for them, they forgot the burger of the yelper. 
Fries are different. It's been a while since I've been in, but the old ones were dinery. These are those frozen fries with lots of breading. Not bad, but not what I was expecting.
I may try it again, but it will be a while. It's too pricy to have such poor service."}
{"text":"First thing to note: Wednesday after 4 pm is half priced burgers, wish I had known that before I came here! I'm always searching for a deal

I ordered a double with cheddar, bacon, and bbq sauce, along with onion rings and a chocolate shake. The burger was great. The bacon is nice and thick and the barbeque sauce was a nice mix of sweet and tangy. The order of onion rings gives you three large rings which were good. 

I didn't stay long, but the inside of the diner is nice. It definitely has that old school feel with the colors and the decor. They have a toy train running along the tracks of the ceiling and the jukebox is free, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland on a \"sentimental journey\" to visit friends and places where I grew up. I was thrilled to discover Beardens is stll there and the burgers are still the best!  My family and I came here every Sunday with a group of friends, so it holds very special memories for me.  The train is still there (not running) and service was friendly.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Way over priced! $50.00 for two kids and two adult hamburger meals. It's joke!! I would not come here!!"}
{"text":"When I was a kid, I was taken to Bearden's a number of times, and despite it being associated with a number of good memories, it's been years since I have been there. 

So, today we stopped in for lunch, and really enjoyed it.  I remember the decor as being a little more homey and a little less generic family restaurant, but the food was still as good as it used to be.

The menu is generally standard diner/greasy spoon fare, but it's well prepared and tasty.  The one thing that stands out, and is a must have is the Peanut Burger.   Yes, a burger with peanut butter on it.  I grew up with these, and know them to be delicious.  Get over yourself and try it, and you'll love it too.  Be sure to add bacon to it too. 

The prices are fair, and so are the portions.  You won't leave with leftovers, but you on;t leave hungry either."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Burgers, shakes, fries: it all rocks."}
{"text":"There are many childhood memories in which I remember and cherish, Beardens is one of them.  I was upset when they closed their doors (though I had not ate there in over 8-10 years) you never like to see local spots with good food and a loyal clientel shut its doors.  Well I was back in C-Town visiting family this weekend and I was told that Beardens re-opened, I was pumped!

Atmosphere:

  I am not a fan of what they did to the inside, I enjoyed the old, dark, dingly look Beardens used to have.  Don't get me wrong, it is very nice inside, but not the place I remember.  They did keep the train running, which is good because I would have flipped shit if they took that out of the equation.

Service:

  Not much to speak of because they got rid of wait service, but its cool and functions well.

Food:

  I had the peanutbutter burger, and it tasted good, but the burger was so tiny!  It seems like they took meatball sized scoops of beef and flattened them out.  I was actuall very disapointed with how tiny the burger was, almost seemed they were trying to save money by being cheap.  The fries were very good, they tasted like french fries.

It was cool to go back for the first time in a long time and it be my one year old nieces first vist, she pointed at the train and yelled doggie at it (everything is a doggie to her) and smiled when she tasted her first Beardens burger!

Nostalgia gives it four stars, food would have got three."}
{"text":"I love this place and LOVED coming here as a kid and watching the train move around on the ceiling tracks. I travelled here many times with my grandparents who are local to the area and really had a lot of fun times here. Unfortunately, my grandfather has passed on, but that's beside the point. 

After a recent remodel, and having a meeting in the area, I decided I would revisit my old \"stomping ground.\"  It really has changed and for the better. It looks old timey inside, almost like you're in a 60s restaurant. There is even a Mustang BUILT into the side of the establishment. How cool!! 

Customer service as always was great and the food was superb. A+ I would recommend this place to everyone! If you want a good burger at a place that is the best around, come here!"}
{"text":"I love Beardens SO much but they recently changed their menu and took the chicken Caesar salad off of the menu. They have the best chicken Caesar I've ever had and that's the only reason my boyfriend and I ever go there. BRINGGGG BACK THE CAESAR"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on our way home from vacation. My husband grew up on Cleveland so wanted to take me here. The food  was good. We really wanted malts which I read they are known for. How disappointing to be told At 8pm that we couldn't get one. We were told that they close at 9pm and it takes awhile to clean the machine. There were two other groups of people seated who shared with us that they wanted shakes and were told the same thing. You close at 9 and take orders til 9. How do you remove a signature item from the menu at 8? Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Beardens is a great spot to grab a burger, fries (the skinny ones are my favorite) and a shake!  I like to call in an order and pick it up to go for lunch. Simple, classic and delicious !"}
