{"text":"Le plus beau local de toutes les succursales Juliette & Chocolat! Plafonds hauts, beau décor, tables et divan, lumineux.   Le 30 décembre, l'endroit était plein malgré que nous étions un mardi soir en fin de soirée. À ma sortie du resto, une file attendait pour avoir une place.   Le menu toujours aussi bon, cette fois-ci, je me suis laissée tenter par une gaufre de Liège avec chocolat chaud traditionnel. Délicieux! Ma cousine a choisi la crêpe écureuil avec crème glacée au chocolat chaud aussi.   Seul bémol: le lait au chocolat nous a été servi tiède...Nous aurions aimé qu'il soit plus chaud, voire brûlant, pour le déguster tranquillement sans qu'il devienne froid après 10 minutes. Un point à améliorer.   J'ai souvent été déçue du service chez Juliette et Chocolat, généralement assez lent et le personnel un peu distant. Cette fois-ci, à ma première visite à Laval le service était meilleur, la serveuse très présente pour les clients et le temps d'attente acceptable. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Le service n'est pas toujours chalereux. Une fois j'ai eu une vrai conne mais l'autre fois j'ai eu un serveur vraiment adorable. La nourriture est overrated, je préfère aller à cacao 70 plutôt wue Juliette et Chocolat. Le plus gros turn off de ce restaurant, c'est les drosophiles, il y en a juste trop. faite quelque chose."}
{"text":"Not worth the $$$$$  So expensive and the portions are so small   We ordered waffles with chocolate topping  And we got a small let go my eggo kinda waffle lol  Didn't taste fresh so I assume that it was frozen and toasted and it took for ever to get the order, it's not like they made anything fresh   Not recommended"}
{"text":"A great place for any chocolate lover, however I do have mixed feelings about this place.  The place is a bit overpriced and the service seems quite slow even when it is not busy.  I have ordered their hot chocolate drinks twice and both times they were cold. Even with my recent trip back there, I had asked the waitress if she could make sure the drink was hot, and yet still it was cold.  I also tried the raspberry lemon trifle and it was very sour, only go for it if you are a lemon lover. The chocolate waffle plate was too much for me and I didn't even finish the rest of my waffle because it was dry and hard as a rock! Cheesecake brownie trifle is very good as well as the fleur de sel brownie."}
{"text":"Terrasse très agréable en été ce qui fait de ce lieu un excellent choix pour se détendre en regardant la fontaine du centropolis. L'hiver la file d'attente le soir pour prendre un dessert ou une boisson chaude est vraiment trop longue et faut être motivé."}
{"text":"White chocolate,milk chocolate, dark chocolate, crepes,brownies, ice cream, candy,milkshakes and more! How could you go wrong! Oh, they also had savory crepes,sandwiches and salads but who cares! The sweets were perfect! It is located in a plaza called centropolis  with other restaurants and stores."}
{"text":"Initially we were placed by a nice girl to our table. This is the smallest Juliette et Chocolat branch I ever seen. It's cute though. The menu is super extensive.   Next, this is where I had to remove the stars. Service by Audrey was very abrasive. We were speechless. I am not even sure what was the problem? I guess she wanted us to just order with questioning anything. I asked for café au lait. My parents asked for regular coffee. My sister asked for ice coffee which comes with ice cream on top, and she didn't want the ice cream. Audrey, the waitress, is arguing with her with tons of attitude that it will be the same price so take the ice cream. So my dad told her, can you put the ice cream on the side in bowl then. She rolled her eyes and she said whatever. She brought our drinks; she gives my drink over my dad, and tells here is your latte. I tell her that I asked for café au lait. She rolls her eyes again, and tells me it's the same thing. I wanted to scream at her, but didn't because our food haven't arrived yet, and you know ... what if she does something to our food. My mom and dad didn't get the milk for their coffees, so we asked another waitress for milk. Her name is Melodie, thank god she was nice, and thank god, afterwards she took over. We haven't seen Audrey afterwards.   Then we shared a mix of fruits and delights with fondue. We got Juliette et Chocolat fondue. It   is a mix of bananas, strawberries, waffles, marshmallows and brownies with three different (dark, milk and white) chocolate fondue.   Despite the rocky start, our drinks and our food were delicious."}
{"text":"Cakes were excellent like every J&C. Waitress was nice, but restaurant was understaffed. Main courses were so-so. Have your main course somewhere else, and come only for the desserts."}
{"text":"The chocolate was delicious, but our wait to be seated and for our orders was long!! I was in a group of 6, so if you're with a larger group- be prepared to wait, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"I understand folks enjoy their chocolate but I left Juliette et Chocolat feeling really unimpressed. What got to me is seeing people waiting an hour to get in with a lineup that stretched outside the door (and in the dead of winter too!) .. this left me bewildered.  We went with their \"Arriva\" hot chocolate (which came highly recommended by our server) which consisted of a half filled wine glass (???) of very bitter chocolate. We immediately regretted not going with their normal chocolate. We weren't asked how we enjoyed them until the very end of our meal to which we were told that we could ask for milk to make it less bitter.... ummm no...  it'll only be bitter instead of not very bitter....also the point of hot chocolate is being... HOT. Serving it in a wine glass that conserves no heat is kind of counterproductive, is it not? Either way, the hot chocolate was served mild. Yey!  We went with their tasting tray of brownies and desserts and we didn't find anything overly appealing except for maybe 1 brownie. Perhaps we should have went with their crepes instead... they sure looked nice (...but so did the tasting plates)... perhaps they were more enjoyable!  Service was OK but we sure waited a looooong time before we could order and when we wanted to pay to leave. With a line-up stretching outside, you'd see why that happens.  Place is very pretty though, as are most Centropolis buildings... sadly doesn't deliver the quality when it matters most, IN MY MOUTH!!!  The price-tag adds up very quickly, it cost us about $40, for two half glasses of hot chocolate and a pair of tasting plates.... not a lot of value here folks.  Juliette et Chocolat is overrated, maybe it once was amazing in its original location but it franchised itself and let's be honest, the basic principals of what they need to provide me wasn't met. Even if the hot chocolate was good, (which is wasn't)... the amount of hot chocolate simply isn't enough and in fact both our \"glasses\" could have counted for 1 mug of hot chocolate.   And that's unacceptable for me."}
{"text":"I have never gaven a 1 star to any places, but the service today was really bad. We were a group of 8 and the place did not seem that busy. It took us about 15 minutes to get placed and 2 groups of 4 passed before us. Like couldve you guys not clean the table and place us? Especially it was not rushing. Once we got placed, the waitress never came to say hi or are you guys ready to order? No, we had to waive our hand and ask can we order now after 20 minutes of wait. This is not acceptable. Keep in mind that we did not came here to eat a 3-4 service meal, only dessert. It does not take this long to pick which dessert to eat. Sheesh come on guys.  Update: when the time came to pay, waiter just handed all the bills to a single person... We had to give our own proper bill to the correct person..."}
{"text":"A place with variety of chocolate delicacies for every chocolate lover and a friendly staff! (Although the wait might be long, but it is worth it)! The chocolate waffle is a delight! a homemade waffle topped with some delicious chocolate ice-cream and the warm chocolate ganache. Yummers!"}
{"text":"fondue and molten lava cake... what more is there to say?! many options for chocolate fondue (white, 33% 50% 66%), fresh fruit and a deep, rich chocolate cake. The cake was a little too dense for me and the chocolate to fruit ratio was a little off (had to secretly dip some strawberries from the market across the street to use up the chocolate!)   Prices were a little on the expensive side ($9 for lava cake and $14 for the fondue set)."}
{"text":"Went with my visiting family members to have brunch.   I got the blueberry cheesecake waffles.   The waffle was a little over cooked but the topping was tasty.  I also had the mango sun to drink which  was really tasty.   I had the fleur de sel brownie which was the right amount of moist.  Everyone else enjoyed their dishes."}
{"text":"Les desserts et surtout le chocolat, c'est un de mes plus grands plaisirs... En tant que belge, je suis assez exigeante sur la qualité du chocolat. Mais avant de parler du sucré, cette petite chaine de resto propose une petite carte de plats salés. J'ai goûté la crêpe savoyarde et franchement mes papilles étaient vraiment rendues en savoie ! Excellent choix et bien copieux. Dur dur de caser un dessert après cela. J'ai pris le petit pot fleur de sel, un régal.  Lorsque je suis retournée, je me suis régalée avec la brochette de brownies. Ils sont excellents, fondants, moelleux, gouteux, bref un régal. Le seul petit bémol a été le chocolat chaud 33%. Pas spécialement convaincue. Je conseille cette place pour passer un bon moment entre amis devant une douceur ou pour un petit repas crêpe rapide et gouteux ! À ne pas rater, bon ap !"}
{"text":"Cold hot chocolate Bruised apples and pears in the fondu  Really subpar food preparation. Whats up with all the restos in centropolis being the worst from all their other locations?"}
{"text":"Great food and drink. Lots of great options but the service wasn't great. Very cozy inside though, and great outdoor seating. It is a great place for a snack or a drink or a quick snack after the farmers market!"}
{"text":"Service satisfaisant et prix corrects. Je ne suis pas une fan de chocolat, mais leur crêpes bretonnes sont supers. Niveau rapport qualité/prix on est pas trop mal. Le seul hic, ce sont les moucherons et moustiques à l'intérieur, pour moi c'est limite."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Juliette et Chocolat for years now but since am from Laval I never went to their store on St-Laurent in Montreal. So when I heard they had opened a new location at Centrepolis I was overjoyed. But every time I would pass by there was a huge lineup and I have to patience for that. So finally last night I decided to threat my parents to desert for their anniversary and ended going to Juliette et chocolate. If you love chocolate, this place is heaven on earth. Their menu is so vast, and if its your first time in can be overwhelming. So I suggest getting a platter of mini deserts. I got les dégustation de Juliettes et Chocolat which was a mini sundae, a mini profiterole, a mini crepe with strawberry and chocolate, a mini fondu, and a mini brownie.  I also got a traditional hot chocolate, which they bring in a mini pitcher and a bowl, so Parisian!!!! It was really good and now I know what i want next time. The waiter was super nice asked us if we had any questions and gave some suggestions. The store is nice and bright, the ambiance is light and cozy. Great place for dessert!"}
{"text":"Je connais bien Juliette et Chocolat, mais je  ne suis aller à cette succursale qu'une seule fois par hasard, un jour de pluie au Marché Jean-Talon. Leur menu est assez grand et il y en a pour tout les goûts, le service était très agréable et le restaurant n'était pas trop bruillant. Nous avons pris une gaufre banane/dulce de lèche qui était à tomber par terre, une fraisinette qui est une crêpe avec des fraises et du chocolat blanc qui était correct mais avait rien de spécial, une fondu au chocolat qui est accompagné de chamallow, brownie, fruit et autres c'était la parfait quantité et pour essayer la petite nouveauté, nous avons pris également la crème glacé au spéculos trempé dans du Chocolat au lait avec des paillettes alimentaire. Je dois dire que la crème glacé était assez petite mais tout était bon et les quatités correcte, nous étions quatre et en avons eu pour 55$."}
{"text":"Slow service.  It seems the very young staff who do their best are almost always understaffed. Shame coz the chocolate is lovely"}
{"text":"Late night Saturday desert. Long waiting line but seating was relatively fast. Place is clean , nice decor , tables are relatively well organized.  Stuff are welcoming . What disappointed me  was the quality to price ratio. A big menu with alot of appetizing photos however that was not representative of what we got. I took the squirrel basecly a nutella crep with ice cream toping. Barely any chocolate inside. Ice cream wasnt spectacular. The mango drink was good . I am not sure i will go back."}
{"text":"Un bel endroit calme pour déguster un bon dessert! J'ai adoré cette place. Le personnel est très gentil. La première fois que j'ai été, l'attente avait été très longue. Cependant notre serveur nous a offert un brevage de notre choix gratuit (nous étions 4) pour ce désagrément. J'ai donc particulièrement aimé cette attention qui n'était pas obligatoire. Les fondues sont très bonnes, la quantité pour une fondue de deux personnes est très bien et le prix est raisonnable. Les crêpes minces sont aussi délicieuses."}
{"text":"My first time at Juliette et Chocolat did not disappoint!  I came here with some friends looking for a sweet post-exam snack. I ordered the Viennois hot chocolate with a tuxedo crepe. The hot chocolate is one of the best I've ever had - rich and creamy and very chocolatey. Although the crepe isn't the most photogenic thing on the menu, what it lacks in looks it makes up for in taste. It was topped with a cheesecake flavoured drizzle, brownie bits and chocolate pebbles.  On top of that, the service was great, they had a nice holiday-themed decor and cozy atmosphere. Only downside is that it's a bit pricy. However I will definitely be back to try one of their delicious looking brownies!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place. Shared a combo with my daughter (one savoury and one sweet crepe). For an extra few bucks, we upgraded the chocolate crepe with loads of marshmallows and whipped cream - yum!!! Price was very reasonable, service was extremely friendly, and - most importantly - the food was good. Nice place to relax in on a Sunday morning visit to the Jean Talon - especially when your kid isn't feeling adventurous on the food front!"}
