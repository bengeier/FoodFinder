{"text":"Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich combo and the ribs combo - both with Masala Fries. Everything was delicious! especially LOVED the sandwich and the spicy fries. We ordered over the phone (with the owner) and the customer service was fabulous-he even called back to inform us that the order was ready for pickup. Although the food was takeout, it still tasted fresh and was hot by the time we got home."}
{"text":"Food is really, really good. Great selection. Good value. Chicken poussin and veal mishkaki are out of this world. There homemade Masala (spicy) french fries are amazing and very addictive. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"After having a near by meeting go long I was famished and unwilling to travel more than a couple of blocks to fill my hunger gap! Located right next door to the Richmond Hill Performing Arts Centre, Yelpers guided my gurgling stomach around the corner to this Klassic BBQ joint! 

It's a small sit down/ take away spot that resembles a 1950's coke shop. Operated by an Indian family who hails from East Africa (Tanzania to be specific), they've got a welcoming vibe and an extensive menu to make your mouth water.

The biggest surprise about Klassic is that they serve 100% Halal prepared meat. Now folks this was my first foray into halal cuisine and I was in stunned shock by both the Kwality and the taste! Amazing!

Never having eaten here before I asked the shop owner for his recommendation, which he automatically responded the Klassic Philly and.... wow! A healthy portion of meat, cheese, sauteed peppers and onions, all cooked down and served melted and ooey gooey in a toasty bun. Damn! Not a traditional Philly, but it gives the originals a run for their money - so good!

The combo is ONLY $10 TOTAL for the Philly sandwich, a pop, and fries. $10 taxes IN! Awesome!

OH! OH YA!!! Side note, fries were standard... I mean they are fries, right? WRONG. On each table they have tiny shakers of ground Indian chilli peppers and they are to die for! I think you could pepper your fries (or anything) with them. Whooooooooo. Spicy!

I cannot wait to try more Halal! I'm a fan!!!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Went there with my family for dinner, the food was really good. I had the philly cheese sandwich with masala fries. My kids both had a hamburger that they really enjoyed. 
The atmosphere is relaxing and the owner that serves us was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is OK with some unique flavors. I did like the spicy fries. BUT the service is terrible. The man who served me was preoccupied and made a mistake with my order, then proceeded to blame me for ordering wrong and demanded full payment. Customer service is so very important especially for small independent stores."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal here with the family. Perhaps the highlight was the owner's personality and welcoming manner. The restaurant was quite busy as a festival was happening at the terrific Richmond Hill Centre For The Performing Arts right next door. The restaurant was short staffed, so the owner was hopping - he adroitly handled the counter where you order and pay, he waited tables, and helped out in the kitchen. The restaurant was cute and clean. The menu eclectic. Standard burger fries poutine type stuff combined with a pretty eclectic cuisine I believe is African / Indian themed. We relied on the owner to guide our choices and were quite pleased. The kids said the food tasted like \"home cooking\", and they said they wanted to come back.  We found the bill to be quite reasonable. We will  be back for more."}
