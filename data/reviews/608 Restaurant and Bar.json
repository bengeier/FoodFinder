{"text":"We were looking for a simple, light, summer dinner on State Street on a Tuesday evening.  Both my husband I ordered salads.  The grain salad was a delightful mixture of Israeli couscous, arugula, pine nuts, feta, grilled zucchini and mushrooms, and tomatoes.  I ordered it with grilled shrimp and it was very tasty and the serving was quite generous.  My husband's Caesar salad (with grilled chicken) was also very satisfying.  The service was excellent."}
{"text":"When: A Thursday evening around 5:30

Good: Veggie panini and sweet potato fries were surprisingly delicious.

Bad: The happy hour staff was irritatingly inexperienced and straight out of high school. The two girls working didn't even know the happy hour specials. They were shouting well across the room discussing what they thought the specials may or may not be. My mixed drink was terrible and ungarnished. The default music playing to the nearly empty room was Shakira...I couldn't wait to leave.

Overall: If you enjoy bars that try to be cool and fail miserably, you've found it."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere sitting outside. Trio of fries was delicious. Wings were average. Nice spot for beers and appetizers. Would go again."}
{"text":"Poor service.... We sat down and ordered within minutes.  About 30 minutes later, we inquired about our food, and the wait staff at the bar said the order was never entered.  Because we were under a time constraint, we decided to leave.  No offer was made to entice us to stay, and right their wrong."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped in at 608 on two recent visits to the State St. area. Very good cocktails - super friendly bartender that aims to please. Generous wine pours. 

Chicken and watercress Panini was a solid choice - I appreciate the gluten free bread option! Salads were tasty and fresh. We both enjoyed the French fry trio. 

While we don't usually order dessert, the salted caramel sauced won-tons with ice cream proved too tempting to resist. Quirky but good! Perfect for sharing. 

All in all, a good choice for an easy, lighter dinner. Service is friendly, place has a nice vibe, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for something fun, new and exciting.  Enter 608.  I wondered what or if anything had taken over the former Paul's club and bam! 608 had. So  being adventurous and daring(whooooo cue music) we enetered.  Even though they were busy, we were seated almost immediately.  They have a robust beer and wine menu so we each ordered something along with an appetixer.  It all came out fast and hot-except the drinks which should be cold....I would highly recommend this spot to anyone and you can feel safe doing it,  my wife and I will  be back many times."}
{"text":"Here at 608 right now. My friend has killed 4 flies in 20 minutes and they skipped my song on the jukebox. Pass."}
{"text":"Garbage, limited menu same as ever where else.  really strong smell, loud, and bad service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I went to this location for Brunch and would not recommend this location.  I ordered an omelet with a side of ham, potatoes, and fruit, as well as a coffee.  The coffee had not been brewed and I had to wait for them to make a pot of coffee.  The coffee was watered down, tasted bad, and was a waste of $2.  The omelet itself was ok, nothing exciting, but the $2 upgrade for a side of ham was little more than a slice of deli meat cut in half and served as a side.

The location gets two stars, rather than one, because the Bloody Mary was good and the lunch-type items that the others at the table ordered looked pretty good.  This may be a good place to get drinks and maybe lunch or dinner, but I would not recommend ordering breakfast at this establishment.  But if you do get breakfast, bring your own coffee."}
{"text":"We got to this restaurant around 6:30pm on a Saturday night.   It was a 45 min wait for a table so we chose to sit and eat at the bar. The staff was very nice, especially the owner. They were accommodating to my paleo diet request and my sister loved her garlic spicy chicken wings. They were really good! The only downfall was not being able to see multiple football games.  We wanted to see FSU but he only had the capability to play one game and the majority picked the badgers; other than that, great food, mojitos and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for late lunch over the weekend.  We were able to snag a table outdoors which was really nice since it looked dark and uninviting inside.  
I got a fish sandwich with fries and husband got a BYO burger with fries.  We each got a beer to go along with it as well.  It was good food; I especially enjoyed the seasoning on the fries and tartar sauce for my sandwich.  However, the bread on the sandwich was huge and the lettuce was wilty and slimy.  I ended up pulling all the lettuce off.
With just 2 beers and 2 sandwiches ordered (fries were free sides), I was surprised the bill was over $30.  I'd lower the food prices there a bit if I were in charge there.  Foods good, but not that great."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening for dinner - it wasn't busy and we got a table outside. The servers were very attentive, and since it was a hot day, it was helpful to have plenty of water and beer.

The general consensus on the appetizer of cheese curds was that they were just different. Also, the fries that came with both of our meals were very, very salty. We'll probably go with the side salad next time.

But, the grilled cheese with tomato was absolutely delicious with perfect seasoning. Their Friday fish fry was more than enough food and had plenty of the common staples included (coleslaw, tartar sauce, etc).

All in all, it wasn't the best experience, but we're excited to go back again and try something new. Plenty of potential."}
{"text":"Warning - I didn't actually eat or drink anything here. Normally I wouldn't write a review like this but my experience last night was so surprisingly bad that I felt compelled to.

Friend and I decided to stop here for dinner before a show at the Overture. We walked in and found nobody at the hostess stand - okay that's fine. It's a bar so it wasn't that weird at first. However 5 minutes later we were still standing there with no hostess or waitress. There was 1 waitress that looked extremely busy serving all of the tables in the place. But we received no acknowledgement from her. 5 more minutes later, we're still standing there. Now, there's at least 1 bartender and another worker there besides the waitress. None of them even attempt to greet us or seat us at a table. We were completely ignored the entire time and it honestly felt super awkward. 

Needless to say after waiting for at least 10 minutes without even 1 greeting, we left for another restaurant. I will not be back any time soon. 

Note: I gave it 2 stars as I've been here before about a year ago and had a decent experience sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. We went here at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. I ordered the pulled pork panini with sweet potato fries. It wasn't a panini, more like a sloppy joe on an extremely stale ciabatta. This was accompanied by approximately 15 of the floppiest, room temp sweet potato fries. 
The service was average and the music was super loud EDM. I know it's a bar on state street but I should still be able to have a convo with the person sitting next to me at 8:00pm without shouting. Bummer."}
{"text":"During my recent visit I had the 608 burger.  I ordered it medium rare and with a side of grilled seasonal vegetables. The burger was perfectly cooked, but the sunny side up egg that sat on top was not cooked enough for my liking. I absolutely love a runny yolk, but I do no like gooey translucent egg whites still on my egg. I went along by scraping off the gooey egg whites off  and proceeded with the burger. I didn't want to bother with ordering another egg because the bartender was busy putting Christmas decorations. The highlight of the dish were the grilled vegetables. There were green beans, zucchini, mushrooms, and carrots. They were delicious! Veggies had great seasoning and seemed to have some sort of sauce, but that may have been the natural juices of the vegetables. I do plan on stopping by again for the grilled veggies. If I do get an egg, I will make sure to specify over medium!"}
{"text":"Clean your dishes and you could be good.

608 has fine food, good drinks, and good beer. I'm tired of going to this restaurant and getting wine glasses with lipstick from the previous drinker and food with hair in it. Get more kitchen staff and clean up your act. You could be good."}
{"text":"My wife and I were downtown for a show. By pure habit our feet took us to the door of Paul's Club. . . only thing is that they moved up a few doors and we found ourselves at the 608 Restaurant. Looking for dinner we decided to check it out. 

Things were up and down as far as number of stars. I'll try to rate things along the way to give you an idea what I mean.

The staff was very friendly  (5 stars) - we got a nice greeting at the door and were seated at a table across from the bar. Our waitress was quick to come by with water and asked if wanted drinks. We did and both ordered beers (one tap one bottle). These took an awful long time to make it to us (3 stars), not sure why. 

My wife ordered a burger with BBQ and sweet potato fries. I got the Fish Fry that you could order off the menu or all-you-can-eat for a few dollars more. Food came out pretty quick and looked good and had decent portions (4 stars). My fish fry was pretty good. The breading had good flavor and was not too greasy. Slaw was fresh and tasty as were the fries. Tarter was in this tiny tin pitcher thingy - which was difficult to use, but ok. (4 stars). My wife's burger was big, had a real nice bun - but she didn't care for the taste. She kept saying it tasted like a \"Lipton Soup burger\" you make at home. (3 stars). Their was some wild garlic, spicy sauce too that came with her burger (or fries) that she didn't care for but I thought I was excellent. Just didn't go with either of our meals. 

Weirdest thing was the music when we were there. I think this was just default music that played up until someone picked songs on the Jukebox. Maybe the idea was to play such awful music that it would urge people to put money into it. . . .I don't know - but we both were blown away by the super cheesy 80s love songs coming out of it. Very bad (2 stars). Guess we should have played something...

Atmosphere and prices were OK. Tough one to rate really. Wasn't thrilled, but I think I would go back again and try a panni. I think the chef was pretty good and I'd like a 2nd impression. Hopefully we'll get back again soon."}
{"text":"608, like the area code, you see? 


booze! FRiendly staff. Control the juke box with your phone. 

Open until 2 am-ish, except for Sundays."}
{"text":"While on a run up State St. with my better half, we passed the spot that was previously occupied by Paul's Club and were surprised that a new restaurant had opened up.  Always up to try new thing (us being absolutely ravenous also didn't hurt), we showered up and returned that evening to try it out.
The owners did a nice job with renovating the space post-Paul's tree.  The bar is on your right when you walk in and tables line up against exposed brick left wall.  The menu is heavy on the sandwich options (burgers and paninis) with some appetizers, salads, and main entrees sprinkled in.
We started out with the sweet potato skins stuffed with cheese, chorizo, and green onions.  While the spiciness of the chorizo played well with the sweetness of the sweet potato, the sour cream based dip was fairly bland and did nothing to complement the dish.  For our main course, I went with the nacho burger while Katie tried her luck with the grilled cheese.  Both sandwiches come with your choice of side or soup.  Advertised with jalapenos, a lime avocado sauce, crispy strips of tortillas (among other things), I was expecting the burger to pack a punch of flavor.  It was more like a limp handed slap when I bit into it.  Just nothing exciting about it.  The same could be said about the green beans.  Sauteed in garlic butter, the green beans were just OK.  Something I could easily duplicate at home.
The grilled cheese (served on Madison Sourdough bread) came with cheddar and gruyere but neither cheese really stood out.  The cheddar was extremely mild and tasted more like American cheese than a true cheddar.  Again, something we could easily duplicate (and improve on it) at home.
I struggle with giving negative reviews when a restaurant first open but with the high density of restaurants and the heavy competition that comes with it, I feel a restaurant has only once chance to impress a diner. Its critical they get it right. This didn't happen with us and unless I read differently from other Yelpers, don't think we will be stopping back in."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better. I was aiming for a light lunch while out with a friend, so I got the Four Crostini appetizer as my meal...so worth it. All the cheeses and fruit were fresh, and there are some great classic combinations involved: apple + brie, goat cheese + cherries, and blue cheese + fig. Super filling; on special (I think?) for $6.08, of course; and super tasty. I am super happy."}
{"text":"We heard that the new restaurant 608 on State street was a place to go for good food.
We did not find the food to be anything special except it was expensive.  The presentation of the food is a little better than average.
The cheapest hamburger sandwich is $11, maybe because it had watercress and a sunny side up fried egg, the price was high.
One visit was enough, we will not return."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really love this place. They just got a new chef who is really great! Last time we were there fiancé got the beef tacos and he liked the pickled veggies that came with it. I got the Mac and cheese of the day which had chicken, tomatoes, and broccoli. You could tell the broccoli was grilled- it was  delicious. We have also tried all of their appetizers and I would say the cheese curds are my favorite."}
{"text":"You know I'm a connoisseur for a good Bloody Mary on a Saturday, and the bartender here made it clear he was not.  Never the less, the Bloody was pretty good and before I was finished about 6 other people were enjoying them around me too.  
The cheese curds were clearly house made and pretty tasty.  Unique in flavor and texture with an enjoyable side of aioli. 
If given the option, I would give 608 3.5 stars, but on this one I had to round down instead of up.  I wish some of the Madison photos they had on the bar and around the room looked like they weren't printed out on the office printer..."}
{"text":"Stopped by 608 for dinner, everything was delicious and service was great. I am surprised to see anyone has left a bad review. It's definitely is worth more stars than it has.


This is one of my favorite places to drink downtown because it's not crowded and you can drink without having to yell to have  a conversation. We found a buy one get one entree coupon in the Bucky Book, so we went to try the food. Everything was delicious. We both got the 608* burger and a round of cheese curds. I must say, one of my favorite burgers in Madison, and the Curds are on the top of the list as well!!

Without doubt, we'll be back..."}
