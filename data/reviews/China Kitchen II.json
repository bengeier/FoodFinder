{"text":"Absolutely delicious and humongous portions. Only downfalls are they don't deliver and only accept cash."}
{"text":"This is the worst food I've had. The rice was very dry and the chicken was over cooked. I threw the food out because it was too hard to eat. I will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"I've tried many Chinese food restaurants, but I always come back here because it's so amazing.

You get a massive amount of food for such a low price. Most combo meals are around $7 in price, and the portions are so big that you can easily eat one combo for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

My favorite is the Sweet and Sour Chicken, but there are many good choices like Pepper Steak, Chinese Vegetables, and many others. I'm actually not afraid to try different meals here because they are usually so amazing.

As for the employees, Ken and his sister Brandy are both great. They will always greet you with a smile, and if you've been going there for as long as I have, they will already know what you're getting, and will have it done for you really fast. And they don't make you feel out of place like you do at some Chinese restaurants. Seriously, they're amazing!

And as a final endorsement, I have had my friend try out their food (who is Chinese and his family owns a restaurant), and he even admitted that the food at China Kitchen II was better than the food at his family's restaurant! And his family's restaurant is quite popular, so that's quite an endorsement!

Seriously, everyone should at least try China Kitchen II at least once and you'll find out why customers keep coming back.

Just keep in mind, they only take cash, which may be off-setting to those of you who like credit. This place is worth it though!"}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine for years! It's nothing fancy at all. I don't care. They are consistently fast and delicious. The place is quite dumpy but, I don't care. It's a take out joint. One of the few Chinese places that I can find really great Wor Su Gai. Why don't more places make that dish?"}
{"text":"This place is down right, nasty since the new management took over, I got my favorite dish that I have been getting for yrs ( beef w/broccoli), they changed the beef or something it was totally inedible didn't taste like or had the texture of beef, it was gummy mushy I threw the whole dinner away after 3 bites! I will never ever go to china kitchen 2 again, why not leave well enough alone this place was fantastic!!HOW sad they really don't deserve the one star that I gave."}
{"text":"You get SSOOOO much for your money. Not as large a menu as some other Chinese places, but they have the basics and they do them very well. Large portions, fast service. Several times when I have picked up, I have seen them cleaning which is really good to know! I have really liked everything i have gotten from here. No complaints yet!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for 20+ years even when I moved away first stop when I visited. S&S chicken are huge tenderloins not just the regular nugget style. Amazing food that everyone craves after I order for them."}
{"text":"Cannot believe there are not rave reviews for China Kitchen II...we drive 30 miles to get it. The food is always awesome, and the portions are big enough for two people, plus very inexpensive. What more can you ask from Chinese takeout?  

One thing--- be sure to bring cash, as they do not take credit cards."}
{"text":"The food is okay, it's the same old Chinese food. I ordered the generals chicken and the outside crust of each piece fell off. It was soggy, and it wasn't tossed in the sauce. Just placed on top of it. The chicken was great but the lack of effort to put it together messed the whole dish up. I will only order fried rice from now on."}
