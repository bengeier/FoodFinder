{"text":"La Selva offers an amazing 6 course tasting menu on Sunday nights for $28.00.  Each plate was more wonderful than the last during a leisurely two hour meal.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Petit resto sur la plateau, à un coin de rue tranquille et plutôt résidentiel (si on ne sait pas que c'est là, on peut facilement le louper en passant devant!)
Bouffe mexicaine faite maison, très bonne!
Les entrées (soupes, guacamole, etc..) étaient délicieuses.
Les tacos étaient bons mais j'étais un peu déçue par la taille (tout petits tacos et pas beaucoup de fèves ni de riz... il pourrait au moins y avoir + de fèves et de riz, car pour un plat ce n'était pas assez).
Tous les plats avaient l'air excellents (poisson, cote de porc, boeuf).
Le flan au caramel en dessert était très bon aussi.
Service excellent et staff très agréable. Très bon rapport qualité/prix et c'est un apportez votre vin, ce qui est intéressant!
Vous pouvez réserver pour un anniversaire par exemple.
A essayer!"}
{"text":"Yay! I finally got to check it out - and I love it!
This little restaurant with large glass windows intrigued my imagination for a few months now.  It's elegant simplicity of decor as well as dishes is quite the find!
It's not anything extravagant, yet you get a fantastic dining experience for a small price - just what you look for in a typical neighbourhood restaurant. 
The food is mildly spicy, not hot at all, and the staff seems to take pride in what comes under their hands. 
We had a wonderful three course meal that included the soup of the day, a Tacos dish, and dessert (Flan).
It didn't look like a big meal, but I actually left very satisfied!
The soup was very interesting - every bite had different bits and pieces that wonderfully complemented the tomato and chicken broth based soup - avocado, coriander, tortilla bits - every bite uncovered new tastes and textures. 
Each of the tacos dishes included four tacos and small bowls of rice and beans. Our initial response was that it looks like very little rice and beans - but we realised that these go in the tacos, and you really don't need much. A squeeze of lime on top and wow! Tasty! I really liked the pickled onion that was on top of my steak tacos.
The flan was OK. I probably would not order it if it wasn't already included in the table d'hôte (but I finished mine all the same!).
Service was reasonably quick and very attentive. We got all the answers to our questions about the menu with a smile. 
The vegetarian selection is highly limited, and my partner feels like she has exhausted it, but I would be happy to return and sample some more dishes.
It's a bring-your-own-wine. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the perfect mix of casual, affordable dining with great service and ambiance. The combination of Mexican and Peruvian cuisine was great and you can enjoy the night without thinking about the final bill. Defiantly one to make your new local eatery in the plateau!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place as he's been here a few times and so we decided to check this place out together; it's a byob which I'm always happy about and also offers a tasting menus at an incredibly low prices. My first reaction was: what's the catch?? 

This Mexican restaurant is small with simple decor and minimal kitch, and is nestled in a corner of the plateau near an SAQ: how convenient!  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and our waitress was quick to serve and friendly.

We opted for the 6 course tasting menu and everything was pleasantly delicious; from the poblano soup to the ceviche and tacos, each course was tastier than the last, beautifully presented and perfectly prepared. My dinning partner surprised me with a seventh dish of cricket taco?!! Ambivalent at first, I would say it was my favourite dish of all, and nothing like I expected. The tangy and chewy crickets, soft avocado, pickled onions and slightly sweetened salsa on a perfect corn tortilla made for a perfect pocket of pure pleasure..;) I especially liked that the waitress took taking the time to explain every one of the dishes prepared by the very talented chef Ali. 

I would return for a great meal at a low cost once the menu changes up, which it does so seasonally. I think this restaurant has the potential of being more, if they add a little class to the table and maybe a fresh paint of colour on the walls to liven it up from it's drab interior but overall, I really enjoyed this space, the food and the service."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant péruvien, de gestion familiale (les parents aux fourneaux et la fille aux tables) où l'on apporte son vin et où on mange pour 15$ un repas complet (excluant taxes et service), ça vous dit ?

L'endroit est petit et vite archi-plein et peut accueillir une trentaine de personne.  Réservez à l'avance.  Aux heures d'affluence, le service peut devenir considérablement lent, (ce qui est normal quand on songe qu'il n'y a que deux personnes à s'affairer dans la cuisine...).

Le menu est limité, peut-être 8-9 choix de plats, et manque certainement un peu d'originalité: Après tout, pourquoi se déplacer dans un restaurant si c'est pour se faire servir un poisson grillé ou un steak dans son plus simple appareil ?  Tous les plats sont accompagnés des classiques haricots (délicieux) et de salade (ok).  
Nous avons opté pour le poulet sauce à l'arachide, dont la sauce s'est avérée un peu décevante et le poulet plus ou moins grillé, et pour la brochette de coeur de boeuf mariné, dont la marinade était des plus ordinaire, mais dont la cuisson était parfaite.  En somme, pas de quoi se plaindre mais pas non plus de quoi se réjouir...

Une chose cependant a rendu notre repas mémorable, et c'est justement le genre de chose pour laquelle on décide d'aller manger péruvien un soir: le ceviche!  Contrairement à ce qui arrive parfois, celui-ci n'était pas préparé à l'avance, avec de tout petits morceaux de poisson sur-marinés.  Que non!  On nous l'a préparé sur demande, (comptez une quinzaine de minutes) avec de beaux gros morceaux de poisson (du tilapia ce soir-là), que le citron n'avait cuit qu'à l'extérieur, laissant l'intérieur cru, comme il se doit!  Servi avec des oignons marinés, le tout était à la fois délicat et savoureux, et en plus, servi dans un format gargantuesque.  Vaut définitivement le détour!  Un fait à noter: le ceviche n'est servi qu'en entrée, à 7$, et ne fait pas partie de la table d'hôte.  

En somme, ça reste un resto sympathique, sans prétention.  Le menu est un peu décevant, mais le ceviche, ainsi que le prix, rachètent bien des imperfections.  Aussi, comme d'autres entrées avaient l'air délicieuses, je recommanderais probablement aux intéressés de tout simplement laisser tomber les plats principaux et de s'en tenir à 2 entrées, dont l'incontournable ceviche, bien entendu..."}
{"text":"I've discovered this BYOB place recently and I'm their new fan. The decor is casual but cute, the ambiance is relaxing, the service is great and their prices are extremely affordable. The food is great, I really like their take on ceviche and its presentation. My carne asada was juicy and delicious. It's a great place to have a dinner with friends or family and I'll definitely will be coming back there again!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this meal since I had heard so much about this restaurant.  I was so disappointed.   Two friends and I had a reservation on the coldest night of the year (-38) with the windchill.  We arrived 20 minutes before our 8:30 reservation and we were not allowed in even though the restaurant was practically empty.  There were 2 patrons left from the first service.  We had to wait outside in the frigid cold. This is inhumane.  Once we finally sat down it didn't get any better.  We were very tightly squeezed together, uncomfortably so.  We had a 6 course meal.  The soup was really good but then it went downhill. The portions were tiny. When one of us asked for some hot sauce we were told that they don't have anything that will mask the taste of the food. No bread available either.  The dessert, creme brule with fois gras was inedible. We all left hungry and took a cab to a hotdog joint a few blocks away.  I do not recommend this pretentious restaurant."}
{"text":"A very nice experience, the TABLE D'HÔTE was great! The guacamole was delicious and steak tacos too. We were a group of 9 and everyone enjoyed their meal. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"busy little place

34 seats
on the night we went there were two cooks in the tiny kitchen and one server

we opted for the tasting menu which as it has been mentioned was 6 courses for 28 dollars
there is also a 4 course option but i forget the price

you dont get to choose what you get but let me tell you that even though by the second one i was stuffed i could not stop eating because each was better than the one before

we had
tomato soup
tilapia ceviche
tuna tartar
cochinita taco
pato pibíl
grill octopus

just typing these names is oversimplifying the amazingness of it all but i do want to get an idea of what you are getting

service is great
particularly in light of having one server
if she got a bit bogged down then the kitchen would step in and help

truly a great experience"}
