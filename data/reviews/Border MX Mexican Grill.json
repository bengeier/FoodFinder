{"text":"Great, freshly prepared food.  We had the crevice, the fish tacos, tampiquena and the alambre, all delicious. We also had the churros, very fresh also. Wonderful service, friendly staff.  We will go again."}
{"text":"Was waiting for some work to be done and dropped in to try the place...i like Mexican food. Just had something light and fast. Pazole...but wow! Really authentic home cooked stew that was spiced just perfect. Rare to find that level of competence cause it can easily go wrong.  Just had that and a cold cerveza on the patio...yeah this review is from the summer...but will return to try the rest. Stay tuned"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the meal I had.   Tacos Norteño. Stuffing is shredded chicken with mashed red beans. Tortilla was a bit too thick. Drizzled with sour cream and ground beef. On the side, a small portion of tortilla soup. The portion is large and can be shared with another person.   I also ordered the horchata. Semi sweet and sprinkled with cinnamon. It was good.  Customer service was great. The waitresses were attentive. The place is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"First timer tonight, and being half Hispanic I was a bit skeptical coming and trying this place. I got the Pastor wet burrito, and my fiancé got the nachos and our friend for the green chili enchiladas. Overall I was surprised by how good it was. The burrito was just as good as back home in Los Angeles. The wait time was a bit long but worth it in the end I suppose. The nachos looked good and so did the green chili enchiladas. Definitely will be coming back whenever I am in town and looking for an authentic Mexican place. Also the atmosphere there is awesome, the staff and bartender and chefs are really awesome. Can be a bit crowded but that's the least of the worries. :)"}
{"text":"Messed up our order, sent the wrong item. The slowest service I have ever received. This place used to be Mexican Cantina, which had terrible reviews, now they did a re brand but nothing else changed. I normally do not write negative reviews but I hope management sees this and hires the correct wait staff. It took multiple tries to get our bills correct, there was 4 of us and we wanted separate receipts. She got every item and divided it by 4. Overall, the food was bland, there was no tequila that could be tasted in the margaritas and overall it was not the best experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service here! Try the Fajitas and Churros. The owners are friendly and engaging."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. If you want Mexican, you are better off going to Taco Bell. They couldn't even get our order right. Never again."}
{"text":"Border MX is located on the east side of Queen Street between Old Pine and Church street which is between Britannia and Eglinton in Streetsville.  Oh this place has been a Mexican restaurant for quite a while.  Before it was Border MX it used to be La Cantina years ago.  The inside doesn't look like it's changed much from the old days and there's a small patio with about 8 tables or so outside.  There's a parking lot directly behind the restaurant which also sort of spills out to another parking lot that connects to the back street (Church) as well as having limited street parking.  Since I remember coming to La Cantina years ago I was surprised and rather delighted that it was now Border MX.  My first experience with Border MX was at their former Hurontario and Dundas location which is no longer but on the bright side, Streetsville is not all that far to go.    It was my dinner for my friend's birthday which was last month so we had some catching up to do and she always leaves it up to me to pick the places to eat.  My previous experience with Border MX was the other location though so I assumed that the food would be the same as the one at that location.  The menu was the same and the staff as well.  I remember being served by Jorge and he also remembered me.  We decided to sit outside as it was still early and not that chilly.  After having a good look at the menu we had pretty much decided what we'd want from drinks to dinner and we knew we were going to leave some room for the churros as well.  My wife and friend split a liter of red sangria.  I had asked for a mojito but the other server came back and said they didn't have any.  I guess that means they were missing something that makes it up so I just ended up getting a beer.  For starters we decided to go with the chips and guacamole as well as the corn.  The corn was perfect because it came in 3 servings and there were 3 of us.  The corn is one corn on the cob broken into 3 with seasoning and queso fresco.  The chips are not regular chips.  They are actual fried corn tortilla, crunchy and salted.  The guacamole is ok but doesn't stand out as great.  For the mains my wife ordered the Taco Norteno, my friend ordered a mix of tacos and I had asked for a chorizo chimichanga along with an order of fish tacos we could share.  I had a chance to try the Taco Norteno from my wife and wow was it ever good.  It was a large crispy fried tortilla made with chicken and beans and it came with a side of soup.  The chorizo chimichanga was packed with meat and it was so tasty.  The tortilla although fried, wasn't as crunchy as the Taco Norteno probably because it was so thick?  Either way it was very savory and such a great flavor.  The fish tacos were also crunchy as the pieces were battered crispy with the added crunch texture of the fresh veggies.  The dishes come with a small side of rice and refried beans.  For hot sauce they offer a spicier one and a green, milder one.  The churros are really good and since they're made to order, there's a bit of a wait but they come hot out of the fryer and are the perfect complement to a nice dinner.  Between seating, waiting to order and waiting for drinks and food it seems that the place was a bit busy.  We did have to wait a while for drinks and even the appetizers.  It seemed for the place there were only 2 servers and there were more people sitting outside than inside.  There was a bit of a wait for everything it seemed and I suppose it just had to do with being busy.  Besides the wait the service is more than friendly.  Jorge is a kind and friendly host.  I really enjoy the food at Border MX.  It is one of the better places to get Mexican in the GTA that I can think of really.  I like the fact that they make their own chips, hot sauce, and have things that are not your everyday type of Mexican but a wider variety of dishes.  This time around the wait seemed a bit longer than expected but overall the service is good."}
{"text":"We were starving and looking for a quick bite to eat in Streetsville and found Border MX through Yelp. Perfect cuisine choice on Cinco de Mayo!  We sat outside on their little patio and enjoyed a couple of cervazas in the sun while waiting for our food. Have to agree with the other reviewers - service is very very relaxed and it did take quite a while for our food to arrive. Just something to consider if you try to visit while in a hurry.  We each ordered a wet burrito for our meals - I selected veggie while bae went with the pork carnitas. I chose rice and salad for my sides and bae went with their bean/bacon soup and rice.   Food was delicious and super satisfying. I do wish my burrito was a bit spicier but I guess that's why they offer hot sauces/salsas on the side.  Would return again if in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Mexican place in the GTA. The food here is always fresh  and the staff always helpful. Everything is made from scratch and the sauces are to die for. I recommend the burritos! Flautas and the fish tacos! Just everything basically!   Enjoy!  I would love to see a lunch menu!!!! Maybe 2 tacos instead of 3 and just a burrito no sides? Would be easier on the wallet :)"}
{"text":"First time here today. Love this place. It was rocking busy, which is a great sign. Service was friendly and prompt. Good absolutely out of this world amazing!!   I love Mexican food and this place quickly went to the very top of my favorite places in the GTA!! Definitely recommending this place to anyone!!! I do recommend to make a reservation."}
{"text":"This was a perfect lunch experience!  I highly recommend this place, especially the fish tacos.  Service was fast and the outdoor patio a really nice place to enjoy this sunny day.  I will visit this place again the next time I am in this area."}
{"text":"One of the best ceviche dishes I've had (and I've had plenty) in forever. The prices/service/atmosphere are all perfect.  I har become a weekly regular to this place and the servers have quickly  learned my order!"}
{"text":"So happy they opened another location, and near the business park. I tried their first location a long time ago on the opposite side of Mississauga, and loved it. This new place is in a much better location in Streetsville, with parking, and the food is still very authentic, and super friendly staff. They always have awesome music playing too. Make sure to get their special churros as well for dessert. They make them the authentic Mexican way and they are sooooo good."}
{"text":"Definitely BETTER than the Hurontario location - at least in service and overall cleanliness!  They did a nice job of painting the exterior, including the mural, but the interior remains the same as when Cantina Mexicana was there.  Eventually, it could use some sprucing up on the interior OR at least newer tables and chairs.  We ordered Baja Fish Tacos & a Chicken Tinga Wet Burrito.  Not sure if they just have regular burritos.  My Fish Tacos were really good - 4-4.5/5.  I tasted a bit of the Chicken Tinga and my dining partner said that he'd prefer Burrito Boyz/Chipotle in taste/price.  The sides are VERY small, like a wee tea cup of rice and a spoonful of refried beans.  So although it's adequate in portion, in comparison to other Mexican places, Border MX scrimps on the sides.  I tasted both the Mexican & Cilantro rice and I didn't care for them.  They both lacked in flavour, especially the Cilantro rice.  I only had a coupla forks of the rice, really below average.  Refried beans were good tho!  Overall, decent place, certainly not cheap (esp with their small sides), but they need to fix their rice recipe - that's for sure!  As per another review, I would have to agree that they would benefit from a Lunch Menu.  I would *love* the tacos...sans sides and pay a coupla dollars less.  :)"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food and 5 star service. Our server George was amazingly friendly and very helpful with recommendations.  This is a must for all foodies!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars... love the owners and staff here.   They're great and easily 4 stars.  I think it's great they want to share the food of their homeland.   I love meeting restaurant owners who have a passion for their food of their home country and want to share it with Toronto.  There's something about these people that make believe in the goodness of food and the act of wanting to nourish someone else.  The owners here come from Mexico and it was interesting hear him talk about the menu.  The menu reads like any normal Tex Mex but the recipes are not.  He explained how the recipes reflect a different region of Mexico because when you're away from home, the thing you miss the most (aside from family) is the food.    The restaurant is in the heart of Streetsville and in it's own tiny building with a patio!  I wasn't expecting the patio.. though it's fully enclosed from the street and between buildings.  The spot is clean but has a very very rustic feel to it.  It reminds me of an old tavern from the 80s and never left that decade.  Lots of dark woods ... terra cotta colours... texture popcorn ceiling and walls.  You get the idea.  The windows to bring in a lot of light though... so it's not a dark spot.  I do have to call out the mural outside... quite beautiful and unusual for Mississauga.  Frida Kahlo looks great.    The menu has your typical apps of chips and guacamole, burritos, tacos, and a few special mains.  We wanted more of a mix of tacos but their menu is structure in a way you can only mix and match tacos from half the menu only.  Oh well.  We chose the reigning Mississauga favourite taco, fish taco (3 of them), and a mix of 3 tacos (veggie, chorizo, and carnitas).  One take away before I get into the food... I think their dish washer might be broken.  In two of the utencils we were given, we found dried food.  Yuck.  Obviously if they spot it ... i would think they would rewash but just be careful of what you're using.    Though some tacos are better than others, I do want to mention that they single wrap and that's a bit of an issue.  Also, they do provide a choice of 2 sides (rice or bean soup).  They're quite small but I guess they just add enough to fill you up more.  Veggie Taco - This was chopped up vegetables of carrots, peppers, zucchini, and corn and topped with shredded lettuce.  I would say this needs the hot sauce to bring up the flavour.  It was quite mild.  Though I think it would have been fine served fresh... I think this interior was pre-made and attempted to reheat before serving.  It was mostly lukewarm with some vegetables being moderately hot. 3/5  Chorizo Taco - Quite soft and unfortunately I think this and the Carnitas tacos was made ahead of the freshly made Fish Taco.  So these sat on the single corn shell... it was a mess to eat as the taco shell instantly dissolved.  Similar to the veggie taco, the filling must have been premade and attempted to reheat... it at least cooked too quickly.  It was just warm.  This also needed the hot sauce to perk up the flavour.  3/5   Carnitas Taco - tender and juicy is great ... but when sitting on a single taco shell, it's bad news.  We couldn't even lift this off the plate.  It feel apart immediately and was not possible to even salvage the shell.  This one was tender but mild in flavour.  We used up the last bit of the hot sauce on it.  3/5  Fish Taco - freshly made, these arrived crispy and hot to the table.  Crust was light and not too thick in the fish.  Fish wasn't dried out.  The toppings were bland so it really needed the hot sauce to bring it to life.  We did like the fact it's fresh.  3.5/5  Churros - these were great because we had a history lesson come with it.  They're pink for a reason ... it's from Strawberries and it's a tradition from specially Mexico City.  Outside the churches, men would sell tons of these lightly pink churros as a snack.  These were crispy and super hot ... just nicely coated with enough cinnamon sugar to keep licking your fingers.  4/5  I think this spot is one of the better options in Streetsville for food.  They family that runs is just great.  The food could be a bit more flavourful and served hot.  I wish them much success!"}
{"text":"Okay - I have to bump this place up a star after my second time here because these people are crazy nice, and the food is super solid! When I first came I got the crispy cauliflower tacos (which I wouldn't get again, personally, since they were kinda dry) BUT this time I got the veggie burrito and I was in love! The waitress was also the nicest human ever - constantly laughing and pretending to find my dad and his dad jokes funny - I'll definitely be coming back here in the summer, especially to try out their patio too!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The fish tacos are actually the best I've ever had. Also the Mexican bulldog was great"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican restaurant in charming Streetsville. Went there with a group for a birthday outing. My 2nd visit. Food is delicious, with fresh ingredients and true Mexican menu. Everyone's meals were cooked well and very tasty. Call outs were the Fish Tacos (awarded best in Mississauga) and the combo platter with the skirt steak (I forget the name). Mexican corn is a must too.  The one negative is the service. The staff and owners are super friendly and engaging but the waitresses were young and inexperienced and our drink refills were non existent, the food too too long to get to us and we literally had to corner the waitress to pay our bill. That has to improve.  But if you're not in a hurry, the place is a gem and the little outdoor patio makes you feel like your in Mexico having a local meal."}
