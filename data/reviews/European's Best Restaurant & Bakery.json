{"text":"Get breakfast here all the time and always make sure to grab some bakery on the way out. Everything taste very homemade. Place is cash only. Coffee could use a little help but still a great place to grab a meal!"}
{"text":"Great food that's out of the box for the neighborhood. It's something unique and no matter what you try it's good so you can feel safe enough to order something different."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pancakes around.  The staff was friendly and thoughtful.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Felt like going to Grandmas but only better.  The food was incredible. Best mushroom soup I ever had. So good I bought some to go!  The servers were delightful.  They were as if your aunties were bringing you lunch. Will definitely be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"Went out here after reading a glowing review in the PD and was very disappointed. I would have given it one star but the owner and staff seemed like nice folk. My wife and I had the chicken paprikash for lunch for $10 a plate. Spaetzels were fresh, but the gravy lacked the richness, zest and flavor of a traditional paprikash. The biggest disappointment was the chicken in this recipe. We each rec'd a dry leg and what appeared to be a part of a thigh... Very small portion and very dry (I speculated the meat was left over after the whole chicken was cooked for stock, but that's a guess on my part.) Neither of us cared for the included soup 'though the Chicken Liver Dumpling soup may (perhaps) have been exactly how that kind of item was supposed to taste. I had the vegetable soup that tasted like a bowl of boiled vegetables. But, the homemade bread in the basket was excellant! Coffee was OK, but for the life of me, I couldn't get a refill. Be warned...they only accept cash or a personal check. No credit cards. Place closes at 3pm."}
{"text":"I want to love this place... I'd never been here but I arrived just before noon on a Sunday to buy a pie to take to someone's house for Sunday dinner. There were only 2...an apple with a dented crust and a cherry that looked like it'd seen better days. I asked for a moment to decide what to get and the cashier gave a snotty response of, \"I was just trying to help.\" We end up getting six items. We also got 2 more to have with coffee right then. We went over to the bar area and there were clean plates that still looked somewhat dirty stacked up in front of my husband. We were then told to move to a booth but we hate sitting in booths. My husband wasn't a fan of his black and white cookie but I loved my chocolate delight. The coffee was also good. One thing that drove me nuts was that a doorbell goes off anytime someone enters or leaves the restaurant. It was highly annoying and distracting."}
{"text":"What a great spot for breakfast! Breakfast is no-frills, but the food is tasty and fresh and the portions are generous.   My husband + I went in the middle of the week for breakfast. There was only one server, Sherry, but she busted her butt and took care of everyone. We didn't have to wait too long for anything: we were greeted within a few minutes (you seat yourself as soon as you walk in), and our orders were taken shortly after we had time to look over the menus. The food did not take long at all.   Coffee was very good and refills came often. Our cups did not go less than half full. We ordered the corned beef omelet and the veggie omelet. The eggs were light + fluffy, not heavy + greasy like at many breakfast diners. Toast + hash browns were fine. I tried a potato pancake for the 1st time. (It's a lot like a McDonald's hash brown, but crispier. We were given applesauce + sour cream to try with the potato pancake. They were a nice, cool touch to the warm pancake.)  Our server Sherry was terrific. She was busy taking care of all the tables but she did a super job: she's a dynamo! She was also friendly + patient + took the time to answer our questions.   Our meal for two cost about $20 for 2 entrees + 2 coffees. This restaurant takes only cash or checks: no credit cards.   This place is also a bakery. We didn't buy any pastries this time around but everything looked fresh. We will definitely try the bakery at another time.   Europe's Best Restaurant is in a shopping plaza with Rego's supermarket, Asia Gardens + a few other businesses. There is plenty of parking. It's kind of hard to see the name of the business as their sign is hanging on the window. From far away, all you see is the word \"RESTAURANT\"  We will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places!! Always my go to when meeting up with a friend. The food is always great and the staff is always super nice and friendly. This is a nice little place that I will always love. The breakfast specials can't be beat and all of their other food tastes amazing. The dessert is very good as well. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! Love the fish fry on Friday nights!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible, I can't say enough how much I truly love the amazing food that they serve here. The Friday Fish Fry offers fried fish, potato & cheese pirogies, mashed potatoes, cabbage & noodles, macaroni & cheese, potato pancakes, cole slaw, stuffed cabbage and sheet cake all for $13.99 for all-you-can-eat! A deal that can't be beat for that quality of food!  This place is a must if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"**UPDATED**  Last time I was here the food quality went down tremendously.  The potato pancakes didn't taste anything like they used to and they messed up the take out order and we had to drive back 20 minutes to pick up something they forgot.  It used to be better than what it is now.  Don't really have any plans in returning."}
{"text":"A Lenten fish fry Friday had the place busy, but luckily no waiting. Dinner would be served buffet-style. $12 per adult was a reasonable price for dinner. The $2.19 charge per pop order is both industry standard and unreasonable.   The fish was well-prepared: hot, breadcrumb crusted perch that was perfectly moist. Pierogis were potato and cheese-filled filled and fried with onions. Fluffy goodness. Next was a treat for me: haluski - noodles, cabbage and onion fried together in butter. My gnome enjoyed the stuffed cabbage and its sweet sauce despite ordinarily being indifferent to them. I'm generally not a stuffed cabbage guy, and I wasn't converted on this night, but she loved them. Cole slaw, mashed potatoes, potato pancakes and mac & cheese were present and generally acceptable. However I was using buffet logic of \"Sides are for suckers,\" so I steered clear of such diversions. I also passed on soup, salad and cake. I was here for fish first and pirogies second. Based on that criteria the meal was a success.   A few words on the service. Everyone was friendly. The young bus boy was very helpful. He quickly cleared our table before we sat down and took our drink order when the waitress was taking too long. Very nice. Not being able to get her attention for our entire dine -  well, not so much. Yes they were busy, but with some empty seats later on I'd like to see my server getting us drinks and not rolling forks and knives into napkins for tomorrow. Solid food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Prove me wrong. You can't. I've done all my homework. Europeans best has the best fish fry buffet in NE Ohio. There. I said it. Seriously. Perch, pierogies, cabbage and noodles, potato pancakes, macaroni and cheese, cole slaw, soup and much more. You'll be satisfied and stuffed when you leave. The very friendly staff will see to that. But remember, it's cash or check only at this place."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good cheap and fast. I'm looking forward to going back to try the chicken paprikash"}
{"text":"Good ethnic eats, great Hungarian sausage you can buy to take with, and the bakery is very good.  Fish fry is my favorite, but also like the schnitzel.  Good value and always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week.  My friend and I arrived about 1:45pm were seated and browsed the menu.  My friend asked the waitress (on her third stop at our table in five minutes) what the specials were) and the waitress promptly turned on her heels and went to the door to turn the specials board around.  First I thought this was pretty rude.  Second, we couldn't read the poor writing and the board was about 20 feet away.  Lastly there was no one else in the place-why couldn't she tell us the specials-that is her job, isn't it? We ordered lunch- my friend enjoyed her cheeseburger wrap and I navigated my way through a Reuben made with what looked like old meat. I ordered desert-a giant turnover served warm. Pastry is their forte-competent service is not.  I always appreciate servers and threw down five bucks(all my ready cash) for a tip and went to pay the check.  As I handed my card to the waitress she handed it back saying they do not take credit cards!  Who does  not take plastic today?  Embarrassed, my friend picked up the check.   Listen up folks-don't rush your customers, use fresh meat and start taking credit cards.  You might get a few more customers.  Also, a little courtesy will go a long way."}
{"text":"not the best food but certainly not the worst I have ever had .. probably will not rush back for it but it was edible .. went to Sunday brunch on 6-5-16 .. scrambled eggs/bacon/French toast/home fries were the breakfast offerings (we arrived near lunch time so we skipped those) .. meatloaf (odd color & flavor .. almost like it contained no beef at all .. not to mention cold in the middle) + city chicken (tasty .. had not had that dish in ages) .. red cabbage (excellent) .. mashed potatoes (tasty) .. spaetzel (delicious) .. gravy (near tasteless) .. some baked chicken chopped in small bone-in pieces (kinda dry) .. + a few other things we opted to not try .. bread offered was fresh .. the cake offered for dessert was a large sheet cake that was stale from sitting out & nearly under heat lamps over other food .. fresh fruit was a better dessert choice form the buffet .. service was friendly & attentive but neither service or food would make me rave about the place or entice me to rush back .. would perhaps if in the area but we drove from the East Side to give it a try .."}
{"text":"Fantastic old country breakfast. Pork Schnitzel, potatoe pancakes and eggs. Fast and friendly service. Restaurant offers lots of choices from bakery to ethnic eats. You will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Want to like this place but have to say the service wasn't good. We had a large group but they were not busy so I couldn't understand why our waitress never came back until our food came and when our food came she gave us our bill right away. Had to asked another waitress for water, napkins and plate and she basically looked at my sister and never came back also but passed our table several times. Finally we asked the hostess and she was helpful. Food is ok. Scrambled eggs cooked and then microwave cause too tough. Again has potential but wasn't a great experience."}
{"text":"This place isn't anything fancy.  It has plastic table cloths on the tables.  The decor is old.  Tables, chairs, well, everything here is old.  That's about all I can say to knock the place.  The food here reminds of going to grandma's house when I was a kid and getting those European heavy meals for dinner.  Chicken paprikash over spaetzles, Hungarian or Italian sausage, pork schnitzel, cabbage and noodles, baked Italian chicken, stuffed cabbage, mashed potatoes, etc.  You get the idea.  Everything here is homemade and it shows.  Everything is delicious.   I've been eating here for years.  We rented out the place for my parents anniversary as a surprise several years ago.  I still have family members talk about how great the food is here.  I've been to the Sunday brunch that has a nice mix of everything I listed above.  I've done the Friday Fish fry and its also very good.  I've seen a lot of the same people working here for years as well.  Owner my understanding is the cook.  His parents are working there, too.  Waiting tables and keeping the buffet filled.  They are also a bakery.  I usually stop by the bakery counter on the way out with my kids and let them pick out or a kalacky or two.  Again, nothing here is fancy.  Just down to earth honest to goodness home style cooking.  My 10 year old daughter commented this morning that my kids were the only kids in the room.  That everyone there was old.  I looked around the room.  Sure enough.  It's mostly older folks.  That's good.  They know where the good places to eat are at and at a good value."}
