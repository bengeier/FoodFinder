{"text":"The  food is great for the buck, but portions can be quite small -don't be afraid to ask for more - it's close to a 10$ meal - you deserve more than 2 chicken cubes ans a 1/2 teaspoon of salad!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a take-out spot and the prices are right! I haven't had a bad dish in the months we've been eating food from there and I've had a number of dishes; their freshly made naan that you can watch them bake in the tandoor is awesome. I also like their samosa, samosa chaat, butter chicken, vegetable biryani, and their chicken tikka sandwich (not really traditional but yummy none-the-less). This isn't fancy food, this is made for the student budget. I appreciate that they take care in packaging their items as well, so if you need to travel a bit it generally arrives with everything in tact. While I wouldn't call it a destination spot, but if you're in the area and hungry, you should give it a shot."}
{"text":"The menu includes wide variety of choices but the quantity is questionable. Once I ordered Chicken Sandwich but it was not cooked properly so I returned it, but the owner almost yelled at me for having it consumed more than he expected (How else I'm supposed to know It's not well cooked, without tasting it?).  Should definitely recommend any veg. dish though I was utterly disappointed by the Chicken Biryani. Place is also not very clean. Accepts only Debit/Cash."}
{"text":"This new addition to the underground world, at the bottom of the escalators into the Guy-Concordia metro station, is fast food's answer to your curry craving.  Despite the fact that I've actually seen a cockroach drop from the ceiling, down in the metro section of this location, I still find myself eating the thali plates at Restaurant Biryani, juuuuust up the stairs from said cockroach sighting.  I suspect that the various sauce-based choices you can get with your rice and naan likely come out of a bulk bag, but they're still tasty enough to tempt. Actually, quite tasty.  I dunno - quick curry fix during lunch - there are worse ways to spend $8!  The service is detached and efficient, there are several tables if you fancy an on-the-spot food inhale, or grab to go and run upstairs to a sunny spot in the EV lobby (even further from cockroaches). Right? Right."}
{"text":"I've visited here two times with my boyfriend. First time we was just on our way down the metro and was craving some indian food. We ordered the thali plates, with butter chicken and curry chicken. It was really good so we had to come back on this trip to montreal as well. Can't really speak of the other dishes, since we had the same thali plates both times but at least we can assure you that those were really good."}
{"text":"This is one of best Indian Pakistani resturant I go there often with my family the food is Fresh, High Quality, Inexpensive I never write reviews but for this one I have to because I'm very picky about food and their food is soooo tasty and the quantity is more than enough and very clean."}
{"text":"Biryani's in the name of the restaurant, so that's exactly what I had to try on my first visit.   I'm still revisiting the list of spices and ingredients they must use to make their high quality, excellent tasting and made right-to-order veggie Biryani. Though pan fried, and not steamed like the Chicken version, it was tasty with a capital \"T\".   More on this saffron infused, long grain basmati meal to come. I'm still full and only $6 T.I."}
