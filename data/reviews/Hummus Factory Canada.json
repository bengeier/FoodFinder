{"text":"The place is like a roadside eatery(poor maintenance) and prices are at par with much better kosher restuarants around the place. (ME VA Me)  The Humus was nothing so great neither falafel and on top they serve reheated pita, which were toasted hard (not fresh at all. people who were taking orders and server were friendly.  No wonder place was almost empty. The pictures of food displayed are much better than actual served food. would not be going back soon. good luck"}
{"text":"Even better as time goes on.  Back for more and the new items are even better.  Fish, eggs and so many new items coming out.   Love this place."}
{"text":"One of the best hummus restaurants I have ever crossed in Toronto. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place great atmosphere like home . The hummus was fresh and tasted like Tel aviv. Nati does the best shakshuka in Canada . Very recommended and hope those guys will open more locations in the north"}
{"text":"Just an amazing place! You feel like in Israel, and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a higher rating, but the price for hummus was outrageous. $30 for two small plates of hummus is more than I would consider fair value. Although the taste of the hummus was great, and service was great, I don't see myself coming back here in the near future if the prices remain the same."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal from here! I was surprised with how delicious it was considering I had never heard of it before. I will definitely come back! The service was also great, super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wonderful find. Smells like Israel. Friendly service, killer shakshuka,great hummus.  Everything was super fresh. Our new fav spot. Love the music too. Thanks for the falafel samples!"}
