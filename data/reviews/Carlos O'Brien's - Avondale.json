{"text":"Chips, salsa, and beer were about all that was good at this restaurant. It was my first time here with my husband and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the chips and salsa it gave me high hopes for the rest of the meal. We got our chili con queso and the cheese was grainy and way too thick. Then I got my carintas tacos with rice and beans. The beans seriously lacked salt and the rice tasted old and crispy. The tacos were the worst of all. The meat was harder than beef jerk and soggy in the rest of it. I am sadly disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic awesome tacos! Decent deals for happy hour/lunch specials and I would highly recommend the $2 tacos on Tuesdays (2 tacos would satisfy all but the hungriest of eaters). Very quiet for our two lunch visits although it's not exactly a bustling location in general. Service was fast and the other food entrees that we've tried have been good - chimichanga, pollo fundito, etc all were as expected."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I heard they were making a Carlos O'Brien's near me! We go at least once a week, especially for their happy hour $3.50 margaritas. The waitress and owner recognize us and give us great service every time we go in. We typically order the #1 (beef taco and cheese enchilada plate) every time we go and we are satisfied every time. I love how they give you cups of water when you first arrive too. Most restaurants don't do that anymore. Their chips and salsa are really good! I love theirs beans because most restaurants completely taste like canned beans and most of all, I love how much cheese they put on everything! I'm a big fan of Popo's Fiesta Del Sol Restaurant and in my opinion, Carlos' ranks right up there with them."}
{"text":"I was pleased to walk in and see some familiar faces working here from the Phoenix location!  I ordered some dinners to go and they brought out a box packed up really well.  The food is always excellent and the service was great.  This is one of the few if only Mexican restaurants that still puts shredded cheese and tomatoes on your plate.  The decor is a bit modern, but the same good food."}
{"text":"My wife found this restaurant and we give it 5 stars!!!!! The service and food were excellent... We were served chips and salsa right away and the chips were never ending... Our drinks were never empty... The food came out real quick... We ordered the taco salads and they were awesome... The restaurant is very clean... We were very pleased with this restaurant and highly recommend it...!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here two days ago. I've eaten here many times. This was my sisters favorite place to eat so we ate here a lot. The service was just fine. I was a little disappointed in the food. I don't know why it was different from the many other times I've eaten here but the food was just blah. I got a cheese crisp to start which was really burnt around the edges. Plus it was a little skimp on the cheese. I got the bowl of green chile with the flour tortilla on the side. It just had no flavor. Even their salsa was a little blah. I would still recommend someone to try their food. It was my first bad experience after numerous trips here.  I will go back and eat there again and hopefully this one bad experience was just an accident."}
{"text":"Loved the Phx location and figured this one would be just as good. Bland food and  bad service was all we found here. Agree it felt like an elementary cafeteria. Loud and sound echoed. Even the chips and salsa failed. Skip it. Either Phx location or up to Carolina's. won't be back here."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  I use to go the Phoenix location as a kid with my parents. I remember having a great time, great food, and great atmosphere.  We stumbled upon the Avondale location and I was excited to eat at Carlos O'briens again after many years.  My initial thought when I walked into the door, why does it look like a school cafeteria?  The atmosphere was just off!  The server was slow.  Our food came out before our drinks did.  The food was awful!  The only reason I ate my food was because I couldn't bear to spend 12.95 and not eat it. I'm not one to complain, but the couple I was with did and received a comp on their bill for one meal. Unfortunately, all good memories I had of this place were just replaced with utter disappointment!  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's been our favorite place for years.  Both this location and the one on Northern and 12th st.  This one is closer to us now and we were so happy they opened it up!  It's a different style inside than the Northern one.  But the service and food has always been good for us!  My favorite is the salsa and chips.  I don't like super spicy salsa just flavorful and I always get it here.  This is our go to place.  Not super expensive , you always leave full."}
{"text":"The shine is off this apple. After several satisfying visits (shortly after its opening) we've been back on occasion to find the food and especially the service on the decline. Perhaps the ownership has lost focus or they brought in their \"A-team\" for the opening?  The wait staff is no longer attentive to drinks, chips, etc.  I've witnessed one of them openly complaining about mediocre tips.  This place needs to turn it around or it will hemorrhage cash and be closed in a matter of months."}
{"text":"Married 25 years.. This has ALWAYS been our favorite mexican food place.. Period.  Nothing bad .. ever.  Salsa is fantastic, chips are great. Taco's are out of this world, Chimi's are great.. and huge.  Would rather get my fundito here than anywhere else.  If I had just not eaten out and invested my money instead of going here.. I would be filthy wealthy by now.  which means I come here alot."}
{"text":"Food was visually unappetizing and taste horrible. Drinks were even worse.... Drinks on happy hour are nasty.. Environment is basic and uninviting.  (Tiles in bar area, same color (puke green) as tiles leading into the bathroom. Very commercial.  Not good for date or fun happy hour."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in thise place.  We live in Buckeye, and passed up Arriba's to try O'briens. Not again.  The food was bland. I asked for extra onions with my cheese enchilada, but couldn't find a single onion at all.  We won't be going back to Carlos' house."}
{"text":"Feels more like a Denny's inside than a Mexican restaurant.  Chips and salsa were okay, food was average - seemed like both of our meals were left under the heat lamp for a long time though..."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about the one on 12st and Northern, decided to go for my first time today at the their newest location. I was definitely disappointed with the service as soon as we walked in.  We waited for 10 minutes until what it appeared to be the manager saying that have some tables but they're dirty.  Um okay.  Finally we were seated and 10 minutes go by and no menus.  Well finally the manager noticed we didn't have menus and he finally got us some.  I don't even want to finish the review on the service.  The service was horrible! But the food was good.  I got the chicken burrito with green sauce.  A little stingy on the sauce, otherwise pretty good. I will never come back to this location.  Kinda sad it was my first and definitely my last."}
{"text":"Have eaten everything on the menu appetizer guacamole is Muy Bueno.   Pollo fundido is #1."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed the Phoenix location but the Avondale location is terrible. I went there today and got fajitas, Chile con queso, and a soda to go. They brought my soda and it literally tasted like it had insect spray in it....so did the guacamole. Maybe it was the foam cups, I'm not sure, but I have been sick to my stomach ever since, headache, and feeling horrible. I do not recommend eating here. Something is wrong with the food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Their chips and salsa are amazing. I always get the chimichanga with the chili con queso, I think it's the #15. My husband always gets the carnitas dinner and asks for the \"not spicy\" version because we're both whimps when it comes to spice. Both dishes are absolutely delicious. Kevin was our server yesterday, and he was outstanding. He was very personable and attentive. Drinks were brought to us promptly without us having to wait with empty glasses. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have had way better. The chips are boring. The regular salsa tastes like it was out of a jar or possibly just not seasoned very well. The hot salsa tastes like spicy ketchup got mixed into some salsa. The refried beans are probably canned (just judging by the way they curdle on the plate almost immediately) and the rice is nothing to write home about. I had the green chili burro enchilada style with green sauce. I'm not sure what in that was seasoned weird (possibly the sauce, but it may have been the green chili pork) and it just did NOT taste like Mexican food. I didn't really care for it at all and left 2/3 of my burrito untouched. 

My mom goes there regularly and gets a burrito filled with veggies covered in red sauce. The red sauce is much better than the green sauce. The veggies taste awesome - especially the carrots - and she really like it. My step-dad gets a spinach enchilada which he really likes.

I am not really keen on going here again. Everything but the veggies in my mom's burrito was so... bland.It did not taste like \"real\" Mexican food to me. Not even Amercanized Mexican food. I am sure I will go again because my mom likes it, but I will be sharing her veggie burrito and staying far away from the green chili pork."}
{"text":"They always take care of me. Food is always good. It isn't overpriced either. Nothing but the best!"}
{"text":"My beef enchilada & cheese enchilada were VERY yummy!!! Loved it! Definitely will be going back again! 
The guy who took the phone order struggled with English I guess as he only ended up having 1 order packed. 
My husband's 2 beef enchiladas were completely missing."}
{"text":"If I could put 1/2 star I would just because our server gave us water like 50 time while we waited about an hour and a half for our order to come out. 
We came to dinner we sat down waited 5 min to give the drink order. Then we waited 20 min for our our server to come back so we can order our food then we place the order at 10:07 we after multiple times asking about our food we finally get it at 1051 then they bring us hot plates with cold food. The guacamole was old it had black spots in it. The food was definitely sub sub par it was like we were served fancy microwave meals without the cheap plastic plates. Like they nuked it then plated it then brought it to us. 
We all kind of picked at our food barley ate it paid the outrageous bill the Mgr did help us out a lil because of the wait he gave us 20 % off which turned out 79 dollar bill to 68 dollar bill but I guess it's okay it just mean the sooner we can leave. I will not be returning to this place nor will I refer any one here by any means. Total disappointment across the board!! 0.001 stars."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is just ok.  I have had better Mexican food at other places. The server was nice but very hard to understand & I felt like he was rushing us out the door.   They were not busy when we went.   Back to the food,  I ate a chicken enchilada that $12, I got 1!  The sauce on the top was not good at all,  rice&beans were burnt.  The chips & hot sauce were good, just had to add some salt.   Over all,  I MIGHT go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. The dinning room did remind me of a school cafeteria but it's the food you came for. The chimi was good but could of used a little more green sauce. It was lots better once you dump a bunch of salsa on it.
Good deal for the money on the lunch menu. Real good deal if you find the 50% off ad in the local paper."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed folks. I had the beef tacos, green chili burro, bean tostadas. No flavor, no seasoning, no Mexican flavors. They took the MEX out of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. I got the beef tacos for me and the mini chicken taco for my son. My tacos were ok. I needed to add the salsa from the chips and salsa they had in the table to moisten them up. The rice was ok but the beans looked dried out and not appealing. Would probably not go again"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the original location for 20+ years & was so grateful when we got a location on the West Side. We cruised in for a lunch. The server was quick, quick & the food warm & on par with what I remember. My only complaint would be the beer had a funky taste on the back end like the lines need an old fashioned cleaning. Other than that oddity it was a great local lunch find."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here isn't what you would expect from a Mexican restaurant; there are chairs you might find in an office and it feels a bit characterless. However, I would eat the pollo fundido every day! Grab it with a happy hour margarita and it is all good."}
{"text":"I am so sorry to have to give Carlos Obrien a poor review but, the meal I had which was pollo fundido (a chicken burrito) was lacking in flavor, quantity and quality. I was really excited when I heard we had a location out here in Goodyear but much to my disappointment everything we ordered from the kids menu to the sampler platter had something wrong with it from burned to bland. What do you say \"Can you please remake my entire tables food?\" So sad Mr. Obrien. You might want to hire another chef."}
{"text":"Its unfortunat that this place is hidden, more people should know about this place. Great food, welcomine and clesn environment, and great customer service. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is flavorless and service was poor. They give you iced tea in a little tiny (12oz maybe?) glass and then don't keep it full. We spent 90% of our meal with empty glasses.

Salsa was very runny and tasted like store bought. The refried beans were spicy and not the standard refried beans that I prefer.

Definitely won't go back to this place."}
{"text":"Love this place and our server Carlos G was awesome. Excellence service and very polite and very attentive. Ask for Carlos G and you will have the best service..oh food was great too."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely horrible. My wife and I went there thinking it would be good, we were wrong. I ordered a chimichanga but did not receive that. They had to remake the food. When I received it the taste was bland and had no flavor. I will not return there."}
{"text":"Carlos O'Brien is a Mexican food chain here in Arizona. It is one of the more popular mexican food places in the Valley. Like most Mexican food places chips and salsa is brought out to the table. Both are fresh. Our server was good. Took all our drink orders and out of the 10 of us only missed one drink. Honest mistake and he apologized promptly. Our food was brought out fast and hot. My wife and I were sharing the pollo fundito and the server brought it out already split with a full serving of beans and rice on each plate. The chick was bland and dried out and a little greesy. My son ordered beef fajitas which had good flavor but also dry.  My sister had the shrimp fajitas with vegetables which looked great but also was over cooked. Carlos O'Briens is great on effort but needs to work on the food."}
{"text":"Best taco Tuesday in town!! 
Great staff always ready and able to handle all you request.
Food is hot and fresh!! No Macayos warmed over stuff here!!
Great servers and chefs, come try it you will be glad you did!
Avondale blvd and south of the I-10.  
Tell your friends, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Worse food ever.  Northern location is far better.  I called for take out.  After at least 12 rings on the phone, it was finally answered.  I placed my order and was told 10 minutes.  I asked him to wait as it would take me at least that long to get there.  I arrived and food was ready. The person helping me claimed to be the bartender, cook and cashier.  I was not able to sign the receipt as the pen did not work and the gentleman had walked away.  I reviewed the receipt when I got home and though the online menu read $13.95 for my order, I was charged $14.90.  I received cold food and yesterdays chips.  The hot sauce is something that I would not even receive at a fast food chain.  My tostado shell was not cooked so I was not able to pick it up to eat it.  I figured ordering earlier in the day, I just might get better food.  This is not my first visit to this location but is my last."}
{"text":"Tried the new Avondale location, food was pretty good (really did like the chips & salsa (especially the hot), but the decor.... wow, that was really disappointing and not my style.  It's another solid selection in the area, but not something I will go way out of my way to go to."}
{"text":"Certainly room for improvement. I did however enjoy my fiesta salad without the dressing. The salsa was a bit bland. I believe I had the best meal from others in our party. I base this assertion from their comments about the food."}
{"text":"I think their food is improved from my previous visits.  I will come back sooner than the last visit."}
{"text":"I'm really bummed that I have to do this update. However, the last two times I've gone here my food has been horrible.
I got sick from a bean and cheese burrito. Had stomach problems for days. But I decided to give them one more chance and went there for St Patrick's Day. 
I ordered the \"CARLOS CHOPPED SALAD:
Iceberg and Romaine lettuce, Black Beans, Roasted Corn, Tomato, and Avocado Topped with Crunchy Tortilla Strips and Cilantro Ranch dressing.\"
Sounds pretty good right?
NOT!
The lettuce was warm and floppy, the black beans were literally a can of black beans poured onto the lettuce. They didn't even bother to drain the beans! YUCK! 
And the \"roasted corn\" was just canned corn. The tomato was unripe, and the tortilla strips were stale.
And to top it all off, they forgot the \"Cilantro Ranch Dressing\" which, when they finally brought it, was a very small amount of warm, store-bought ranch dressing with some chopped cilantro pieces not very well mixed in. 
Not good.
Unfortunately for Carlos O'Briens,
I'm going to have to remove them from my Book of Deliciousness. 
Very sad. Very sad day."}
{"text":"The best overall Mexican food in the West Valley! Even the regular house margaritas stand out, as well as traditional dishes like machaca burros and carnitas. Try the Macho Street Tacos or the Chicken Queso Enchilada - or add a guacamole tostada - for something different. We love the people who work here, the heaping portions of salsa, and the bar area especially."}
{"text":"It's just ok. It's not horrible but it's not terrific. Just edible food that's a little over priced. Service is ok too. Not great not bad. Just like eh, either way."}
{"text":"Did not realize I had not wrote a review before now, we have come here for lunch quite a few times. But not been here for quite awhile we came today. I always have the chicken fundido. The white chicken breast inside is always good. The prices have went up since our last visit. The salad on plate is now non-existent, and only one black olive. Not a big deal unless you love salad and black olives which I do. I must say the food came out sizzling hot, which I like and can wait a few minutes for it to cool while I enjoy the chips and salsa. I do like the salsa not to hot and lots of tomatoes, peppers etc. The waiter was attentive and very nice, kept my water glass full. They do have a lunch menu, which I always look for in restaurants because smaller prices usually go with it. And there is plenty on plate even if you have a large appetite. So many Mexican food restaurants in area, but this one is on our list we have come back too."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, the service is a little slow, though. They have a lot of combos to choose from and their a la carte menu is decent. The location is great, though. Being right next door to the Avondale Sports Complex is very convenient. You can grab a bite to eat while your kids are at practice or a drink to celebrate after the game."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. 
 Was just off the 10E, easy to find. Signs out on Avondale are convenient.
 Chips and salsa were good. The service was great and extremely helpful. 
 The chimi's my wife and I had were both on point.
We will definitely be eating here again when we visit."}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa = good
Margarita = very good
Service = very good
Carne Asada plate = not that great.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This review is only for Carlos O'Briens Spinach Dip.The spinach dip is hands down one of the best in the valley. Every time we come here we only get the Spinach dip so if you are a lover of spinach dips you have to try this one. My husband and his family have gone to the Northern location for many years and the Spinach dip is always the same and extremely consistant. We sit in the bar and always get served quickly and efficiently. Give it a try....you will not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and every time it has been great! The food is always out quick and taste amazing. My glass has never once been empty. I can't imagine anyone having a bad experience at this restaurant. I love eating here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way home a few days ago. Didn't feel like cooking but I did feel like some good Mexican grub. Was not the time for Taco Bell (OK for a fast bite) but wanted something more substantial. I have passed by Carlos' thousands of time, so I figure, this was the time. A nice space, plenty of room and clean. Looked at the menu and at what others around me were eating.....all this was good. I chose the Chicken Fajitas and was very glad I did, they were great. Service was good, did not have to wait long. I would say on a 1-10 scale they would be a solid 8.9 or 9. I liked the menu and believe I will return to sample some of the other interesting looking items. If they are as good as the Fajitas, Carlos may gain that final star in my review."}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed with the ambience - or lack thereof at Carlos O'briens. The decor is more \"Cafeteria-Style\". On our visit it was not busy so we were seated immediately and a large basket of chips and two kinds of salsa were promptly delivered to our table. I have had better salsa however, my lunch companion thought the salsa was good.

I ordered the chicken fundido as did my lunch companion. In what seemed like an impossibly short time our orders were placed in front of us. I have to say that the entrees served at Carlos O'briens are of very generous portions.  In fact,  there was enough there for two to share.  You definitely get your money's worth.  However, I really didn't care for the taste of the chicken fundido.  The chicken was very dry and the sauce didn't have much flavor.

On a positive note our server, was very attentive and wanted to make sure everything was to our liking. 

."}
{"text":"This place makes Macayos taste authentic.  In a city full of incredible Mexican food, how do places like this stay in business?  Salsa is from either a can or jar.  C'mon guys, even this fat white boy from MN can make killer salsa in 10 mins.  Chicken chimi covered in chili con queso sauce had no spice or flavor.  Beans tasted a week old.  Rice was good.  The only thing Mexican in here is my waiter and I'm sure he doesn't eat this slop.  Skip this place and head to Raul and Theresa's!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this location and the experience was just ok. Was greeted horribly when we walked in. After a table was ready for our party, they would not seat us because all of our party was not there. 
Then the service was decent at best. The server kept apologizing about the delays because it was cinco de mayo and they were not expecting the crowd. Lack of planning on the managements part. Food, well subpar. I've had better at a food truck. The dinner was cold and I was not about to send it back due to the long wait to get it. 
Hope my next experience is better. I give places two try's to impress me."}
{"text":"We ordered to go and will not make that mistake again. They forgot part of our order and it's too far for us to go back. Food wasn't very good. I think the fish and chips was probably the best thing which is sad because this is supposed to be a Mexican food place. I ordered extra chips and salasa and YUCK. Just not tasty at all. Very sad that this place has gotten so many bad reviews and yet no improvements seem to be made."}
{"text":"I love how you can place your order online and then go to pickup. Their website menu lists all prices and options when ordering, huge convenience! We ordered shrimp fajitas with rice and beans, chimichanga con queso with rice/beans and two kids meals with mini chicken chimis. The website said it would take 40 minutes but the restaurant called me and said it would be ready in 15 min! There was a slight wait when we arrived but the cashier was very nice and helpful. We even got complimentary chips and salsa included on the to-go order and these days, that is hard to come by. Everything was well made and tasted excellent! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad. There isn't too much spice in their salsas. And the food is ok. The same for the margaritas. Definitely good prices though if you go on happy hour. I'll return out of convenience not so much taste."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long wait and food that will make you grateful for having filled up on chips and salsa. The salsa is very obviously made with canned stewed tomatoes and have massive chunks that are sure to turn off the 'mater hater in your family. The chile con queso dip is a crime against cheese (unless you are living in a college dorm and limited to only a microwave). Service while friendly was very slow. The restaurant is very loud, maybe we can blame that on why my order was wrong twice in our visit. I asked for water with lemon, got tea ($2.25 for a drink I did not order). Asked for no beans and not only got the beans but a thick layer of beans under the rice. The tomatillo enchilada is hot for the sake of being hot. You can almost not taste your food which in some cases could be helpful as we did not taste anything worth coming back for. The chicken in the enchilada was not seasoned at all. Neither of us finished our meals because it just was not worth eating. No one stopped to ask if the food was okay, no one stopped long enough that I could tell them I did not ask for tea. Not a great customer experience, will not be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Bartender was wiping his nose before making drinks without washing his hands. Bean dip is delicious but I don't think so when you add boogers to it."}
{"text":"I watched server scratch her head then wipe sweat off her forehead then went to deliver food. Sweat & hair juice in the food m! No thanks."}
{"text":"Wanted to have a couple of Margaritas in honor of the National Holiday ;-)

Margaritas were decent...for pre-prepared stuff. Salsa...not so much.  It was tomato juice with some chopped up jalapenos...if that. 

The service is what lacked. A lot.  They had the bartender tending bar and taking care of all of the customers.  You could tell he was a bit overwhelmed and was annoyed when asked for anything.  Everything took forever.  Once he finally brought out our checks, we waited another 15-20 for him to pick them up and run them.  I know it wasn't his fault, however, management should have taken note and had someone help him run food and such.  He was doing everything and there were quite a few people in the bar as it was happy hour.  

One last suggestion, many of us go to happy hour to unwind and enjoy a beverage or two.  Allowing children in the bar is a touchy subject, but one that I think needs to be taken into consideration.  There is plenty of seating in the restaurant area.  Just sayin..."}
{"text":"Go to Manny's on Ind Sch & El Mirage! Soooo much better food & drinx"}
{"text":"Friendly staff every time! Had the joy of Kevin's company this time for waiter. Food was great. Everything came out at appropriate times and was no rush from staff. Drinks were good, reasonable happy hour. Great experience, thanks!"}
{"text":"There was quite a wait for the food. They were busy, so somewhat understandable. Our server was friendly. The food, well, I'm just not a super fan of Carlos O'Brien's. It's okay. I would likely have given them 4 stars, but the service was really, really slow."}
{"text":"Should be 3.5 stars.  

Been here a lot because it's right next to where we play soccer.  Many weeks we walk next door to have a drink and some food.  The salsa and chips are complimentary and sufficient.  They serve a chunky and a hot sauce style.  The chips are thin and made in house.

We often sit in the bar and the service is great.  The manager has gotten to know us so he greets us every time we go.  The beer is cold and they have a decent selection.  The place is always clean and the atmosphere is good.  They have a large room in the back for huge groups and a large patio for when the weather cools off.  

The food is standard Mexican fare; adequate but nothing spectacular.  I love the cheese crisp extra crispy topped with their shredded beef.  I have found the shredded beef has better flavor than the machaca.  The mini chimis with the jalapeño cream chese are good and so are the mini tacos.  

Like I said this review is a strong 3.5 stars just not quite 4.  I will be going back often.  It is convinient, friendly, clean and quick."}
{"text":"I loved the Carlos O'Brien in Phx.  I thought it would be the same.  NOT!  The place is nice and new.  Service was ok.  Food was just flat not good.  Got combo #15, chicken chimy with queso, rice & beans.  Bland, bland, bland...  

My hubby got their one of their specials (2) corn beef taco.  OMG, the total for 2 tacos was $18.04 (no price was posted on their special list on the table).  Since it is a St. Patrick's Day special, we thought $5 to $6.  He said he did not like them at all.  The shells had a weird taste and the corn beef was not flavorful at all.  

Lesson learned:  Always ask for pricing if not listed!"}
{"text":"Well, I grew up eating at the Carlos O'Briens in central Phoenix and it was always a family favorite.  There is now one out in Avondale so we have gone a couple times. What I am finding now is.. meh?  The salsa is great, chips are good.  I would say the salsa is the best part of this place. It has the right amount of heat and I could eat it all day.  

The downside I find is that the meat really lacks any flavor.  I got the pollo fundido but swapped for shredded beef instead of chicken.  This is a deep fried chimi basically split into 3 sections with melted cheese and a very yummy cream cheese sauce on top.  I've always loved this dish.  But I found myself not blown away by the flavor like I am other places.  Again, I do believe it is all in the lack of flavor in the meat.  If they stepped this up, it would be better. Every time I have gone this is the same issue I come across.

I have not been when it was crowded at this location so it was relaxing to just walk right in.  Our server was great and took care of us.  I wouldn't say don't go here.. I'd just say don't expect to be blown away because you won't."}
{"text":"I love Carlos O'Briens, so happy to have a location on the west Side of town.  It was hard to find, the google map was confusing, I had to call to find out it was located in the sports complex.  However, the food was Excellent.  Atmosphere not very cozy like a restaurant, I expected a more traditional Mexican food setting, it is more modern and very basic.  The food is great, the service was good, I will go back, after all it's all about the food..."}
{"text":"This had to be worst service and food we ever had!!!

 We have been loyal customers of Carlos O'Brien for over 10 years (12th St.  &Northern) ......when we moved to Avondale, I was so excited to know that there was one up the street.... Wow!!!!  What a huge disappointment,  the service,  quality of the food and the decor was AWFUL!!!!  NEVER going back to the Avondale location,  will have take the drive and go back to the one we know and love..."}
{"text":"We loved it! We like the bar side. I agree the other side looks a little cafeteria like. I think they decorated like that to match the complex. We went for happy hr. their regular margaritas are great and they are only like three bucks. The food was delicious and fresh. We plan to go back many more times. The salsa is addicting!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't guess by the name but they have great Mexican food. Large portions. Great prices. My fave is chicken fundido. Chimichangas, fajitas, tacos..... it's all good. 
Service is always great and food fresh. 
If your looking for mariachi band and brightly painted Mexican decor you wont find it here, just good food for a good value"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Carlos O'Brien on Northern for decades, so I was excited to discover this one which was on my way home from a meeting. 

The décor is fairly generic, but there's plenty of seating and we didn't have to wait for a table (there's always a wait at the original location).

I had 2 cheese enchiladas, a beef taco, rice and beans. My companions had beef burritos and tacos. The salsa was excellent, my favorite being the spicy one.

The enchilada sauce was excellent and the taco was large and tasty. Had I not been travelling, I would definitely tried some margaritas, as the happy hour prices were good.

4 solid stars and recommended."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough. I come here often with customers and we have really enjoyed the food. Always trying something new and yet to be disappointed. Great Chicken Fajitas and you can't beat the staff who are always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I met a local friend here for drinks and appetizers before a concert, mostly due to the restaurant's location and loads of free parking. He tried to warn me that the food wasn't that good, and he was right. The drinks weren't even that good either. The atmosphere is like a chain restaurant dining hall. Service was terrible. It's the kind of place where you had to stand up in your chair and flail your arms about just to get your check. We probably could've walked out and nobody would've noticed. The Phoenix area is jam packed with authentic and delicious Mexican restaurants. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Great food! I ordered the Carlos carnitas, and there was so much food! It looked like I didn't eat anything when I was done because the portions are so large. Share a meal! My boyfriend ordered the polling fundido and he loved it too. Our waiter served us quickly, food came out super fast! The entire restaurant was quiet and not very busy."}
{"text":"Overpriced bland mexican food. Atmosphere doesn't fit the place and feels awkward. I was really surprised to find that even during happy hour my girlfriend and I had a $49 tab for 2 meals and 3 drinks. I would avoid this place at all costs. I mean you are on the westside of the valley where you are not more than a stones throw in most any direction for really good mexican food. It's akin to going to somewhere like Kansas and having mexican food where the average patron has no idea what traditional mexican food tastes like. No bueno."}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed with this place. 

When my friend and I walked in on a wed evening, the place was just about empty. We sat at the bar, and something just felt off about the place. It could have been cause the presidential debate was on...I dunno. Anyhow, service could def be better. The bartender greeted us and asked for our drinks. As we were going to give the selection, another worker (possible manager) started talking to her. So we just sat there, waiting for him to finish before we could order.  She brought chips and salsa. The chips were warm, but the salsa left a lot to be desired.  The manager dude kept talking to her, so we had to wait for drinks. 
Again...there really wasn't anyone in there, and we had to wait. 
So finally we get to order food. I got the taco salad, he got a quesadilla. Food comes out, and we don't have silverware which she acknowledges. She went to get it, but again the manager dude starts talking, so again were waiting. 5 min later, and after asking another waiter for it, she finally delivers. 
Taco salad was bland. Meat barely had any flavor, and the taco shell was somewhat stale. Prices weren't all that great either, and both meals were not worth what we paid for. 

Will not be going back and I don't recommend you even waste your time here."}
{"text":"Been going to Carlos since I was a kid and my entire family loves it . Awesome service and food! The rice and pinto beans are the best!"}
{"text":"Checked it out during happy hour and I was totally happy with the result. They have a good kids menu too! The margaritas were great, the queso dip was amazing, and the jalapeno cream cheese is fabulous! There was a mistake with our order and they fixed it immediately. Totally will be back!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place for 30 years!  Some of the best Mexican food in the State!  This new location certainly doesn't disappoint. Long happy hours. Lunch specials until 5pm. Incredible food with extremely generous portions. You have to try the Green Chili Burro Enchilada Style. The little bit of everything combo is good too.  

The place is located in the new Sports complex just south of the freeway and north of Van Buren on Avondale Ave.  It was a bit difficult to find the first visit. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the decor is pretty plain Jane, but the food and service are as good as you will find anywhere."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS. Horrible service, horrible atmosphere. Mediocre food. Chili con queso was a curdled mess with a thick layer of grease on top."}
{"text":"Ordered pollo  fundido. They must prep their chicken the night before? Because I hate the taste of old chicken and my entree was filled with it.  For the money, I'll  go somewhere else.  
The staff were friendly."}
{"text":"I live in LA and am SO EXCITED that \"Carlos\" has opened a new location that I can stop off in on my way to visit family in Phoenix.  Their food is one of the things I look forward to most when I get back to Arizona, even if it's only a few times a year - I can't visit without getting a #13 combination to go."}
{"text":"Very very very very disappointed.  I'm a big fan of Carlos O'Brien's and was excited to see them come out here.  We finally made a visit last week, and I wish I hadn't.  

First we should have left when we walked in, the atmosphere feels more like a school cafeteria then a restaurant.  Chips were alright, salsa was straight from the Pace Picante jar.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas which I was told came with black beans (arrived with refried beans that were overcooked around the edges from sitting under a heat lamp.  Not that I planned to eat them anyway, I wanted the black beans but the sight was disgusting. It was enough to distract me momentary from the dirty plate though.  And about the enchilada, I couldn't actually locate them on my plate there was a large pile of what appeared to be spinach queso but no tortillas (a key part of enchiladas for those unclear).   The rest of my party had chimichangas, one chicken fajita and one green chili, I was told both were \"alright\" neither were finished. 

I complained to the waitress about mine, the manager was sent over and barely spoke English and seemed to have no idea how to handle an unhappy customer (something I think he should get used to) the item was removed. As it should be since it wasn't eaten.  

We won't go back, between bad service,bad food, and bad ambiance it's lucky it gets the star."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. I know others have had different experiences, but we live nearby and frequent this place and love the food and the staff. Also, make sure to have a Mollyrita!"}
{"text":"Yum! Try the Pollo fundido! Quick service and clean restaurant. This is the best mexican restaurant that we have found in the west valley."}
{"text":"Good food, servers need a bit of training!  There were two that worked the rest seemed lost."}
{"text":"My husband and I went today to Carlos O'Brien's in Avondale. Normally we would go to the 12th St & Northern Ave location, however this was one was closer to us so we thought Yahhh... We got 2 lunch specials. I got #C  -- Chicken Chimi with red sauce. My husband got a burrito w/ red sauce. Okay service was good, place was bright, clean and nice deco....However the food fell a little flat, not what we were exactly expecting. The salsa was watery and no punch, bland. My food had no spices and no punch to it. My husband says his was okay but not great like he is used to. In fact we agreed on the food bring more suited for white people (no offence - by the way my husband is white and I am Latina).. It was very bland, no flavor. The Northern Carlos's food is better, it has flavor you can actually taste. We may try it again, but then again maybe not."}
{"text":"This place has great food, great drinks and pretty good chips and salsa. If your looking for a good place to stop in for a meal or drinks with friends the margaritas are awesome!"}
{"text":"The tacos are not the best. Not recommended. Fish tacos are fried fish. Steer tacos looked plain and dry. Everyone raves about the carnitas. The shrimp and chicken fajitas were also good. The service was also good. Chips and salsa was okay also."}
{"text":"Visited again and things have improved.  

Service is quicker.  The food we had tasted better.  And they seem to be making some small decorative improvements.  Adding back a star..."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Mexican food I've had since we moved to Phoenix Arizona. The food was very bland and the service was not very good either. We will not be back."}
{"text":"about my 4th or 5th time here.....service is great....food has been great everytime.

had the lunch combo  taco, enchilada beans n rice $8.95  tastes great  wish it was cheaper for lunch but that is nothing more than sign of the times.  good salsa  mild and hot  chips are good, but could be warm.

they are in a 'tough' location  but well worth a visit,  have not been disappointed 

will post pic."}
{"text":"Large portions and sometimes fast service.  All depends on the day.  The decor could be nicer.   Certainly not my favorite mexican restaurant, but it's close to my house.  Surprisingly, their burger is really good.  It's the only thing I get there now."}
{"text":"Great service everytime !!!! Doesn't matter who's on staff, the food is great and we never once ran out of drinks !!!!"}
{"text":"You must order online....except that it won't let you and then they ask you to call a 1-800 number and that's not what you'd like to do when you're trying to order delivery. Just not worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely not the same as the one on Northern! This place has a bad sewer smell as soon as we walked in. The waiter seems pissed he has to be here.  Bad service. The burrito was cold and watery."}
{"text":"Decided to give them another try. Once again I ordered the Polo Fundido. It was over cooked and had almost no chicken in it. The salsa was so bland, good thing they have salt and pepper on the table. Has been a long time since we went here, we used to come every week . It will be a long time before we go back!"}
{"text":"Perfection. We went in for the first time tonight and will be back for sure. Food was ordered to go and EVERYTHING was really delicious, and fresh. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I really want to Ike this place as it's next to our grandsons soccer.  I've been here about 10 times.  Feel it's not as good as it once was. The margaritas are terrible, don't waste your money. The portions are huge and a few things are pretty good. The service has been horrible the last couple of times we went"}
{"text":"One of my favorite authentic Mexican joints in the valley. I have never been disappointed with the food and I have to say, they have the best chips and salsa. Service is always spectacular and the staff is always happy. The fajitas are off the chain and it can serve about three people, however the  quesadillas, burritos, and tacos are just as good. The menu is packed with so many food choices it's hard to make a decision, which of course delays my order time.
They have plenty of TVs if you want to catch a sports game in the bar area and the happy hour is not too shabby either. PS they pour heavy....."}
{"text":"Serves was great food was good one sever on duty and she has 5 tables and she was right on top of things we will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great overall experience! As soon as we got in our server was very attentive and very professional. Even though it seemed pretty busy, he never bent under pressure. The food was superb! I love the home made tortilla chips and salsa, very original. I also ordered the Carlos Cartinas dinner, and it was awesome! I'm very pleased with the overall experience, so I give it a rocking 5 stars! Cheers to Carlos O'Brien restaurant the Best Irish/ Mexican Cuisine in the valley!"}
{"text":"I was hungry for Mexican food so I had Carlos O'Briens delivered by door -. Delivery was great polite young man 20 minutes early. Food was horrible I threw most of it away the chips were stale the refried beans under cooked and the pork Carnitas an edible the only good part about the meal was the cheese crisp even the hot sauce was lousy. Hadn't eaten at Carlos O'Briens in years and now I remember why"}
{"text":"Got to say food is very good staff is checking if you need anything I'll be back for sure here on business and being next door at the hotel around the corner highly recommend. 
Came back still consistent great service ice cold beer carnitas is a must and yes five stars"}
{"text":"I met my wife and friends here on July 23 as I was driving from Tempe and by the time I got there the rest of the party had gotten their food.  I sat there for maybe 15-20 minutes for the server to come back to the table so I could order food but he never did.  I had to ask the busser for a glass of water and a menu and then waited another 10 or so minutes and the server never came back so I left and we to Cafe Rio on McDowell (excellent steak tacos by the way) instead while the rest of my party finished their meal.  My wife told me later the server never offered to refill their drinks or bring more chips and salsa so didn't leave much of a tip when the bill finally came.  The service here is a joke and I hope the server gets fired.  I can get better service at a fast food restaurant and in fact I did, although that isn't saying much.  The ambiance was severely lacking as well, it wasn't much better than a typical Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Bland. If you enjoy chain restaurants with watered down Mexican flavor, then this is the spot for you. Ordered a chix chimi, which had a small amount of chix which was barely seasoned; the verde chille sauce was watered down. The sopapillas, save your money & calories. The plus - convenient location off freeway, outdoor patio, a \"sports\" bar and the food was fresh."}
{"text":"This reminded me of why I don't like eating at chain Mexican restaurants.  That being said the margarita was good."}
