{"text":"Great location and easy to get to. Karaoke and great drinks and food. This place is new but you have to give it a shot. It's beautiful inside with pool tables, darts and TVs. Ask for Arlie or Sally.   My second time in here and it's super friendly. This will be our go to place after ASU football games for sure!"}
{"text":"A perfect place to grab some food and a drink.  Friendly environment with a great atmosphere. Great place to watch a game, play some pool, darts and cornhole!  Shuffleboard and Golden Tee are coming soon they say!"}
{"text":"New place,just opened.  Very nice and great staff.  Food is very good. Lots of TVS, pool tables and darts."}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink, lots of local brews, awesome bloody marrys, the wings are mouth watering. Great staff that makes you feel like family."}
{"text":"Love Arlies. Old school tavern. Arlie is great and a nice laid back attitude. Fun place to be at. Going back on Friday"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to check out this new spot. It's been a couple places before.  The owner and manager are both from Wickenburg and did a soft opening this week. They are so friendly.  The drinks were great, the remodel looks great! The menu is limited but they are adding to it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great place to have breakfast and a Bloody Mary!!! Love these little hole in the walls. Gonna defiantly have to swing by on a Friday karokee night or live band Saturday show... Thanks Will for the great service!!! Well be back!!!"}
{"text":"I come here Tuesdays for the free Texas hold 'em poker tournament and I always have fun. The service is a little lacking, but their drinks and food are good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came here late at night because they said their kitchen was open.  I felt like the bartender wanted me out.  Without asking my check was dropped off and I was ushered out quickly"}
{"text":"This place gets popin i be there all the time nothing but good vibes and good people and great specials"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon. It appeared to be more of a bar than a grill. Most of the patrons were sitting around the bar or on the bar side of the restaurant. They may have been regulars and knew the drill. We sat more on the restaurant side which was almost empty.  First, the service suuuuccccckkkkked!! It appears that the gentleman that served us was also tending bar. Initially, he brought us menus rather promptly for this joint, but it was downhill from there. The only reason why we came here was because we had an entertainment.com coupon otherwise, we would have walked out like another patron who felt the wait was unreasonably long.   Maybe ten minutes later, the bartender/ waiter came back to get our beverage order. He returned with the beverages five minutes later and then took our meal order. (note: our beverages were never refilled).  I ordered the Reuben sandwich and my wife ordered the Patty melt. Considering how long our wait had been thus far, I also ordered desert. I ordered the deep-fried Oreo cookies which turned out to be an appetizer, because it came out before the entre. We received this about twenty minutes later and it was actually pretty tasty or we were just very hungry.  Finally, after another twenty minutes, we received our sandwiches. My wife and I split our sandwiches. Much to our surprise, the sandwiches were very good. My wife ordered her Patty melt on Texas toast which I never had before. The Reuben sandwich was just as tasty.   We agreed that if the service measured up to the food, I could easily give this restaurant 5 stars. To make matters worse, the waiter never told us why it took so long to get our food nor did he apologize for the slow service. I went up to the bar to pay for our food. After paying, I returned to the table. My wife asked, \"How much of tip are going to leave.\" I told her, \"After that service, absolutely nothing.\"   However, I do have a tip for Arlie's Bar and Grill, either focus on just being a bar without serving food or focus on the grill without serving drinks. Your food is great, but your service suuuuuccccckkkkkks!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I come here every Friday night and it's become our go to spot. The owners are super sweet and the staff is always great, haven't eaten anything I didn't love. The guy talking about the people next to him ordering pitchers so they didn't have to wait was myself and my coworkers and he had the story wrong. We ordered pitchers so that we didn't have to bother the bartenders on such a busy night, he was sitting next to us and we never even noticed he needed a drink. I still recommend this bar to everyone."}
{"text":"Great food, good price, terrible music.  Sorry but country is dead, at least stick the station on classic rock which is a bit more of a genre for all.  Really liked the wings when I came, and not bad on the bloody marys."}
{"text":"Ordered the wings and they were excellent.  Great Tempe bar with something for everyone. Shuffleboard, darts, pool, corn-hole and poker! Clean venue with great staff! Love bars like this."}
{"text":"This place has delicious burgers a great draft beer selection along with a dog friendly patio. They have lots of tvs, two dart boards and two pool tables. The servers were attentive and kept my beer full. If you live nearby its worth heading over and getting a burger and possibly down a few beers"}
{"text":"Don't call your place a bar and Grill if you're going to kick families out with children because the children are not 21. Somebody needs to post signs and know the law. Started dealing poker here or year ago won't be back into you make things right"}
{"text":"This place is horrible,  the bartender charged me for drinks handed me water and the security told me i had to leave,  i only had 2 drinks ordered my 3 and thats when i got ripped off,  asked for my money for the drinks she didnt give me,  they said i had to leave or they would call the cops,  btw the bartender looked like she was on drugs and she also was taking shots while serving,  so i got ripped off then kicked out,  wrote the manger the next day he was rude as hell,  so dont even bother with this place it sucks, i live in the area thought it would be nice to visit a local bar, i definitely miss club red/ red owl being in that spot,  but red owl/ club red moved to mesa with better entertainment and better service with friendly people unlike this joke of a bar and grill"}
{"text":"Our server was ditsy with no knowledge of the beer served on tap she didn't write down our order so naturally my food came out wrong, I'm a picky eater and I always apologize in advance for it. The music on a Saturday was loud Mexican music when we requested a song we were given a dirty look and told maybe after we PAID to get in. But the chef himself brought our food out and once I mentioned my item being incorrect he apologized profusely and made it amazing. He is the reason I will be returning! You could tell he really loves what he does! Don't go on saturdays!"}
{"text":"This is a great new bar to hang out in...very nice clean new place. Will have bands soon."}
{"text":"Service here is quite possibly the worst I have experienced in the valley. I waited at the bar for 10 minutes to get served, which is not that bad. Then when done with my drink it took over 40 minutes to even get acknowledged. The people next to me waited for 30 minutes to get served and decided to get a pitcher so they would not have to deal with waiting again.   I would not recommend this place to anyone. And I will make sure everyone I know heard of this experience."}
{"text":"Guess I should have listened to the bad reviews !!  Terrible service from the time we walked in, waited 15 mins before we went up and had to asked for menu. 10 mins later we got a waitress who brought us water down drinks, I ordered a ginger ale and vodka and got club soda and vodka. There were 2 bars open which had 4-5 bar tenders who were drinking behind the bar. Took our order 20 mins later and didn't get the order correctly. 45 mins later after we complained about our food we got told the pizza itself takes 30 mins. Don't order the personal pizza!! They came out and the chef was really understanding. He asked the manager to take 50% off the food. He told us normally people don't order food this late ....than close down ur kitchen early !!????   I went to close out my tab and ordered a shot of Jamison, they left the water in the shot that they were chiling!!  Dont ask for a chilled shot!!!. My tab was over 100 dollars and I asked for am itemized receipt which they said they don't give???? Seriously?????? So how do I know I got 50% off my food? He began to tell me that they don't charge for food behind the bar...Yeah BS!!!!  Bar tender breathing hard and telling his other customers that we are being difficult?? Really???  If u want watered down drinks, horrible service, bar that smells like rancid beer, and not knowing what your paying for .....this is your bar!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the game. Good beer prices, good was pretty good as well. Friendly service, could be a little faster but not enough to warrant less than 5 stars. New local place in the rotation for me."}
{"text":"Warm clean atmosphere..great happy hour specials.. lots of tvs and also pool, darts, and shuffle board!! If your looking for a great new place to hang out or celebrate a birthday this is the spot!! Karaoke Friday nights and live bands on Saturdays!! Give them a like on Facebook to support a great new sports bar!!"}
{"text":"We went there on the first night and things were running really smoothly for a newly opened place. The staff was very friendly and the drinks they made were delicious. It looks like a place for everyone with pool tables, darts, karaoke and live music. The live band they had, Northern House, sounded awesome. It was their first show and I think they were a hit. Overall everything was clean, the patio was nice, and the drinks were tasty and reasonably priced.   Very convenient for a party crowd, we closed down the bar and headed right across the parking lot to the Waffle House.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This bar is very new, so it is still very clean. I came out tonight to watch the band, and had to trust my GPS in order to find it. Unless they get lighted signage out on the road, they need to own up to and advertise that they're right behind the Waffle House.   I had beer and a chicken finger salad. The salad was served in an aluminum pie plate with one small condiment-sized dressing on the side.  A nice touch was putting the onions and black olives on he side, too.  The ranch dressing was very watery, so I suspect they are trying to save costs by watering it down a little bit. But when I asked for a second dressing, it was delivered without fuss. The ingredients were fresh, but the liner / garnish of large lead lettuce was a bit much    The crowd was sparse. If you are looking for a relatively quiet place to go (crowd-wise) this is a good place to go. The service was friendly, and prompt my first hour there, then died off a bit. It was slow enough that it was easy to get the bartender's attention, though.  I was tempted at first to rate this place as 3 stars, but decided that was unkind. This is a nice place.  It just needs peeps in the seats. Come on out and make up your own mind."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got 4 stars, maybe 2 at best. Ordered Chicago hot dog, has anybody working at this place ever had a true Chicago hot dog? Management, do yourself a favor and make a trip to Portillos in Mesa and find out how a Chicago hot dog should be made and served.."}
{"text":"Great spot to come to and enjoy. Wasn't a big fan of the wait since it sometimes gets packed!"}
