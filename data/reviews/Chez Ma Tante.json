{"text":"Best Steamies and fries in the city.  If your in the east end, no reason not to drop in."}
{"text":"This place is good. Cheep food and awesome old school hotdogs. Poutine was ok. I would not recommend it. The main reason is that the fries are wayyyyyy tooooo greasy. They have lots and lots of oil in them. But over all they are not cheap neither on  chess nor on sauce. Please keep in mind this when you go there. If you like greasy fries you will be in heaven otherwise it's just another fast food place."}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs! All they have on the menu is hot dogs and fries (poutine by default) and I love it. It's classic and old school, super friendly and incredibly fast service. The dogs are tasty! The poutine is average."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was 6 years old. There are so many memories that I think back to when I think of Chez Ma Tante. It's not the type of food I eat today but I still indulge in it from time to time. If you want a hot dog and some oily fries after a couple of drinks, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Délicieux. Meilleure place dans le quartier pour des roteux et une graisseuse."}
{"text":"Not much more I can add to what all the other reviewers have mentioned already. I love the old school diner feel. Steamed hot-dogs with yummy coleslaw, tasty hot fries & basic mouth watering poutine is all they offer which all they really need to offer. You can stand by the window to eat there or do take-out. 2-3 picnic tables are by the diner in their parking lot or preferably in the summer months order take out & walk west on Fleury one or two blocks to the nearby park & dine on a nice sunny day."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for the worlds best steamed hot dogs. No exaggeration. Brb. Eating."}
{"text":"Nothing special, other than a genuine throwback to the origins of a casse-croute. Only steames not toastes....Bit of let down. Greasy fries like Lafleur's. The dogs are slaw dogs, and generally more meaty (longer) than most hotdog places. Two all-dressed, a fry, and fountain drink (no ice) for 10 buck. Not worth going out of your way, but OK if it's on your way."}
{"text":"Pas de place pour s assoir. Comptoir old fashioned genre orange julep. Toilettes à l'extérieur  lieux propres. Personnel motive et gentils. Bonne bouffe. Pas de hamburger."}
{"text":"J'y ai mangé les plus mauvaises frites de toute ma vie. Molles, avec plus d'huile que de patate et un goût de moisi. Et tout ça sans sourire..."}
{"text":"I could have written in French but I've decided to do it in English for tourism (if tourists read this).  Duuuuuuude I normally don't write great reviews on \"5-Star Ratings\" restaurants as I've called many of them \"overrated\"... (I'm only active on TripAdvisor though). But I just can't give \"Chez Ma Tante\" any lower than 5 stars for fast foods... First of all, I expected the place to not have any table to eat (thanks to other reviewers) so I was not disappointed. It is how it's supposed to be. As I arrived there, I saw two old men behind the counter, with absolutely no TV, no music, no radio, NOTHING. LOL! It was plain silence. I wasn't sure if those two would be able to serve great foods with such a dead depressive atmosphere. Either way, I should not be there to judge the kitchen and the employees (unless I'm pissed at their service). Their service was warm and welcoming. They remember your orders as they keep repeating them (they may be old but they still have good brains!). The menus are simple as hell. I don't think there's any combo... You just make your own combos with such simple menu. I did not see any Interac or Credit Card machine so thank goodness I brought cash. It closes everyday at 1AM... WOW... Perfect! I know where to go now late at night since it's close to home! Anyway, back to the taste of the foods. I ordered some hot dogs and poutine (obviously take outs). I went back home and they're all still HOT! Poutine still hot enough to burn my mouth! NICE! I don't remember the last time I ate such a delicious steamed hot dogs! I guess this place is really the best for their HOT DOGS! And then there's the poutine... It's a very good poutine! Maybe not the best in Québec province but I could personally put it among the top 10 in Montreal city! The part that amazed me the most was not really the cheese curds nor the sauce (though they're pretty good and classic to how real poutines should traditionally be)... but the FRIES... The FRIES stood up the most among those three if you are the type to love home made fries. If the poutine had the best cheese curds and best sauce, this poutine would be my number 1 in PROVINCE (and in THE WORLD, obviously). Still, I love what I just discovered. It's a well deserved 5 stars."}
{"text":"Petit comptoir style dinner sans place assise... Mais vous y mangerez les meilleurs hog dogs en ville! Bonne frites et tres bonne poutine! Pas de flafla sur le menu, mais c'est un vrai régal!!! À ne pas manquer"}
{"text":"The hot dog is indeed different. Longer sausage, same texture as a Lafleur but saltier and tastes more like beef jerkey than the conventional wiener. Comparable in taste to Costco's all-beef hot dog and the one at Tousignant. The all-dressed is smothered with mustard, along with relish and chopped choux. The mustard and already very salty sausauge make it a salt-saturated cannot-taste-anything hot dot. One steamie here goes for a whopping $2 which is higher than expected in this neighborhood. Cash only."}
{"text":"Un menu simple. Hot-Dog, Poutine et frites. Pas de place pour s'assoir. Sauf à l'extérieur où il y a des tables à pique-nique dans un parking, entre les ruelles de St-michel et vous aurez une super belle vue de la brasserie sketch d'en face. Sinon vous pouvez manger debout, il y a des comptoirs haur.  Attention les filles, attendez-vous à être servi par des monsieur \"cochon\", mais sympatique et qui garnissent bien ton bon hot-dog de choux. En plus, les frites sont génereuses. Bref, je ne sais pas c'est quoi leur secret, mais le goût du roteux est superbement bon. Le goût reste dans ta bouche pendant des heures.  Je vous le recommande si vous êtes dans le hood St-Michel."}
{"text":"C'est une place à hot-dog comme il ne s'en fait plus. Simple de même. L'endroit est une institution. Notre rituel était d'y aller surtout pour les frites grand format qu'on se partageait."}
{"text":"i cannot say enough about this place.  the best hot dogs in town. and that's better than decarie, montreal pool room, cosmos, lafleur or whatever other place you want to throw at me. i will live and die with ma tantes.   the ultimate in processed meat stuffed between a perfectly steamed bun with coleslaw that has not declined in quality since i first started coming here 20 something years ago. yes it's just a damn hot dog but it is THE hot dog to be had in this city. the fries are generally very good as well although they are less consistent than the dogs and i've been told that the poutine resembles what the best road side shacks in rural quebec pump out. there you go you've had a description of the three things they have on the menu, and no there's no place to sit, stand and be silent as you fall into hot dog induced nirvana.   it doesn't have the rep it deserves because it's tucked away on the border of humble st-michel and montreal north places barely frequented by most montrealers, let alone tourists. frankly, that's fine by me, because i can just laugh every time \"the best steamie\" conversation comes up as people rattle off the usual suspects.   if you're into this stuff, come check it out. they've been here forever, and i'm thankful i grew up close enough to go here regularly."}
{"text":"Great little hole. Good hotdogs, always packed with people and closes super late.  Fries are good. Hotdogs are good.  But unfortunately selection is limited to those two items. No hamburgers."}
{"text":"Vintage place that only serves up Hotdogs, fries and poutines. The hot dogs are different than all these other greasy spoons out there. They taste better and are longer. As for the poutine, it's just your average standard you can expect from a place like this. No place to sit, you can stand at the counter and eat but this place is designed for take-out or eat-in-car. Price is a little high for what it is."}
{"text":"If you are craving anything other than a hot dog or french fry then don't come here. If you are craving what is arguably the best hot dogs in town and one of the best greasy fries then you should definitely come here.   This place has been here forever and has not changed one bit in the 25 plus years I've been coming here. The place is small, no seating and always clean. I highly recommend it. It's cash only and all prices include tax."}
{"text":"Been around for close to a century, providing its rabid fanbase with the absolute best steamers in Montreal and the world and the absolute best French Fries in Montreal and in the world as well. And that's all they serve in this standing room only dive... An absolute must for Hot Dog stand fans :D"}
{"text":"Ne cherchez plus. Le Valhalla du Hot-Dog se trouve sur la rue Fleury Est à Montréal. Puisque Valhalla signifie \" paradis \" dans le langage viking, vous devez donc en déduire que les meilleurs Hot-Dogs du Québec se trouvent ici, dans ce petit comptoir plutôt moche que l'on nomme Chez Ma Tante.  Avant d'en dire plus, je tiens à préciser une chose : j'accorde rarement une note de 5 étoiles à ce type d'endroit qui offre de la restauration rapide. Vous comprendrez alors que pour moi, Chez Ma Tante se mérite pleinement ses chevrons.   Ceci étant dit, revenons à nos moutons. Lorsqu'on entre Chez Ma Tante, la première chose qui déstabilise est l'ambiance terne, pour ne pas dire déprimante de l'endroit. Des néons blafards éclairaient un comptoir tenu par deux vieux messieurs à l'accent difficile. Pas de TV, ni de radio, encore moins de musique pour jeter un peu d'ambiance sur l'endroit. Non. Chez Ma Tante, on vend des Hot-Dogs, c'est tout. On ne donne ici pas dans le divertissement de masse genre Cage aux Sport, ce qui permet de concentrer ses papilles gustatives sur le Hot-dog qu'on est venu déguster. D'ailleurs, le menu est à l'image de cet esprit de simplicité. Il ne contient que 4 items à manger : Hot-Dog, Poutine, Frites et frites sauce. N'espérez pas manger ici un pogo, une rondelle d'oignons ou encore un michigan. Non, au risque de me répéter, on vient Chez Ma Tante pour manger un hot-dog dont le goût extraordinaire.   D'ailleurs, parlons-en de ce chien chaud. Est-ce à cause de la saucisse Shopsy's et/ou de la généreuse garniture de chou qu'il est si bon ? Difficile à dire, mais j'ai réellement trouvé ici celui qui vous laisse sur l'envi de revenir.  Comme j'aime bien dire dans d'autres critiques, ce n'est pas ici que j'amène ma copine pour un rendez-vous romantique. Mais dans le genre, j'adore et je recommande."}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap lunch or snack.  They serve delicious poutine and hotdogs. With few bucks you can fill up your stomach for rest of your day.   Highly recommended. If you pass by on Fleury Street. Take a look.   This place is mostly for take out. Only summer time you can sit outside tables. That's the only bad side of this place."}
{"text":"Best steamed hotdogs in Montreal! This place is a real institution. They been around for ages.You gotta try one to understand! Menu consists of nothing but hotdogs, fries and poutine."}
