{"text":"Very good hand rolls and sushi! The service has been quick every time I have been. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This has very quickly become my new favourite sushi place! The sushi is fresh and the presentation is really nice. I highly recommend the spicy crispy crab, spring rolls, cheese wontons and seaweed salad. The service is very fast and extremely polite, it is always a pleasure eating there!"}
{"text":"I was craving some sushi so I searched for a good AYCE place and found this. I had high expectations looking at the reviews but after visiting there for lunch, I was not very impressed. It is a pretty average AYCE place.  The plus:  Most rolls are quite good and as mentioned, they don't put a lot of rice in them. The waiters are very attentive and the service is fast.  The downsides: There wasn't a lot of selection for sushi, and we were surprised to see that they didn't have tuna sushi on the lunch menu. The sushi rice-to-fish ratio is pretty high; it looks like a small wad of rice with the fish, but the fish is sliced really thinly so you're still getting a lot of rice for that amount of fish. Furthermore, the rice falls apart really easily. The salmon that came in the crispy spicy salmon roll didn't look too fresh and was excessively fishy. The salmon in other rolls and sushi was fresh. Kinda makes me wonder how long that particular roll sat there before being served to us.  Don't think I want to come back again for the sushi. Maybe I will try the hibachi another time."}
{"text":"Excellent AYCE sushi place. Been there for lunch and dinner. Food is awesome and price is very decent. The last time we where 17 of us for lunch and the service was fast and again the food was excellent. I will recommend this place to anyone who love sushi."}
{"text":"I came here after reading a couple yelp reviews and I'm glad I've finally checked this place out.   Service was attentive and friendly. The sashimi wasn't the best I've had, but the rolls and sushi were much better than I expected. For an AYCE sushi restaurant, this is one of the best I've been to so far."}
{"text":"The food was average but the service was... Absent. Literally. The server checked on us once and then we had to wait 20 minutes to pay. We should have left and sent them a bill for our time. In summary: average food, no service."}
{"text":"Fast and polite service.  The green salad wasn't the best.  I highly recommend the spicy salmon.  All in all just an average all you can eat sushi house"}
{"text":"Naruto was recently opened and this place is really nice for the \"all you can eat\" place.  Although rolls are nothing special (which is expected in all you can eat place), the food is honest and fresh, and a good value for the price. For the all you can eat price you can get also hibachi. There is also a \"Grand Opening\" discount right now - 20% off. The place is clean and modern. Good restaurant to go to with your friends, and my kids love it."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times so far. My first experience there was not so good. The food took forever to arrive and the waiters kept missing our orders so we had to constantly remind them we ordered stuff. The food was mediocre, it wasn't bad and it wasn't excellent. My second and third experience there was a little better ( I went because my friends chose to go there) they didn't forget our orders and the food was a little better.  The waiters were not too friendly though. They seemed annoyed to bring us water or food.....they just looked annoyed in general. Overall this is an alright all-you-can-eat Japanese restaurant. Not the best but close to where I live. Edit: I just went here again tonight and this is my last review because I will not be coming here again. The service was horrible, the waiter didn't look like he wanted to help us. The food wasn't fresh at all. The sashimi was warm and looked like it was outside for a long time. It didn't really smell fresh either. I was scared to eat it because it just didn't look fresh. Would not be coming back."}
{"text":"Naruto Sushi, set in the former location of Galaxy Diner/New Galley Fish & Chips, at the rear of the once bustling plaza at the corner of Yonge and Elgin Mills is a 2013 addition to the Richmond Hill sushi scene.  Several months ago as I was finishing a long day of work I was desperate for something healthy and wholesome to fill my aching belly. As I drove north on Yonge I was met by darkened window after darkened window - odd for most towns but the norm many times in R.Hill.  Pulling into the plaza at around 9PM I was relieved to discover that the AYCE last call was 9:45PM and they close at 10PM. I rushed to a table and made a gigantic AYCE order for one consisting of a sashimi spread, 2 rolls, miso soup, seaweed salad and a collection of other staples.  For being end of night my expectations weren't high, but whatever I expected I was more than pleased with the outcome and the price. Quality seemed to be standard AYCE level, nothing mind blowing and nothing bad. Price was also consistent with the norm in the area.  Since this late night visit I have returned once again with a friend, and will likely return again. If in Richmond Hill this is a perfectly acceptable AYCE sushi option, and given the decline of the plaza around it, more often than not, it's not busy.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"WENT COMPLETELY DOWN THE DRAIN. Coming from someone who absolutely adores sushi. We had been going to this place since the grand opening and thought it was amazing! However since the grand opening they have introduced new menus (cut by atleast 50%). The food quality is also horrible. I couldn't even put some of the food in my mouth. No longer going to return."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place hundreds of times, well basically everyday. It's not too far from my house and its conviniently right at the elgin mills viva stop.  Anyways, I came here with Anastasiya on a Saturday for lunch.   The decor was great, looked pretty fresh and modern as compared to what the place used to be before.  The ordering system was the paper ticketing system.   The food here was lacklustre to be honest. Nothing was really wowing me, and some stuff was actually terrible.  MAINLY THE GALBI (Beef RIbs)  It was SO BAD. And the pieces looked inedible. We ordered it twice, thinking it was just that batch, but it wasn't.  Also, a lot of our orders didn't come in. I was highly dissapointed.   I dunno when I'll be back next."}
{"text":"Really nice all-you-can-eat sushi. My bf and I loved it so much that we came here twice for dinner and brought our friends over for lunch!! We also got the grand opening discount - 20% off, then turned into 15% off. By now, there's probably no discount but that's ok.The prices were really reasonable at $19/person. The sushi was fresh and Hibachi had a lot of flavor. My boyfriend really like the beef sashimi (it's one of the more expensive dishes on their regular menu) and I like the special sushi rolls. I love how they came in small plates so food is not wasted as much. Our favorite thing? Fried ice cream. And not the ones that just have the tempura flakes either! It was super delicious! We also had the red bean, green tea, and strawberry ice cream. All first rate! The venue could have been renovated better -- looked a bit cheesy to be honest but anywho, I didn't come here for the decorations but for the food!I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"To start off, the service wasn't the greatest. It wasn't friendly or warm. We ordered from the al la carte menu. I got 2 rolls which were both titled spicy. The rolls were rather on the larger side, it was hard to chew once you put a piece in your mouth. Also, they were drizzled with too much, with what I think was, spicy sauce such that I couldn't really taste the flavours of the fish itself, but just the sauce."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed by the sushi selection in Richmond Hill. A couple of years ago this area around Elgin Mills had tons of amazing sushi...now there is nothing.   Came here with Abbas during lunch - Saturday. The rolls were ok - nothing special, the rolls usually taste pretty standard. Not too much rice, koudos Naruto.  Can we please talk about the galbi? IT WAS DISGUSTING. I want to run and hide in a corner somewhere, I never thought I would say these words. It tasted like they were dipped in sugar water, marinated in a custard and honey paste, and then trimmed to the point where all I got was the bone. WHY?!?!??! I do not recommend even bothering with the beef ribs here, what a shame that someone could ruin galbi like this....  The green onion in beef rolls were the size of a newborn pinky. I had to stuff like 7 in my mouth just to get an understanding of what I was eating.   A lot of the stuff we ordered didn't come or it came really really late. I should have listened to my dad who told me this place was gross. The inside is nice and clean though, a lot of space. Kinda wasted space but whatever, it's their rent money.   I would recommend going to Kaze instead of this if you're in the area - just drive down Elgin Mills towards Leslie and enjoy good quality and fast service."}
{"text":"This is currently my favourite sushi place. Great sushi/sashimi, fresh and fast, However, today I left disappointed.  Not because of the food, but the rude lady who cashed me out when picking up my takeout order. I placed my order with her over the phone. I had to repeat my order 5 times before she finally got it right, or so I thought. When I went to pick up my order and paid I noticed the price was much higher then it should be for the 3 roll lunch special. When I checked my bag I was missing my miso soup and salad. So I came back inside to tell her and so she got me what she didn't put in the bag to begin with, reluctantly.. I told her that she also did not charge me for the 9.99 lunch special, which I told her I wanted more then once over the phone, and then told me that I didn't order that. Really?like if you make a mistake just apologize and make it better! So I said I told you what I wanted many times, I was quite clear, and so she said \"ok\" and walked away. The other lady behind the counter helped me out  since that girl wasn't, and returned my money. she was pleasant thankfully and apologized. That other girl left a bad taste in my mouth. Some of the people who work here I have found to be rude and disinterested until it comes time for the bill expecting a big tip.:. I have no problem tipping well if I get great, attentive, service. Hopefully someone who works there will see this review and change their attitude problem, or else this place will not last long since many ppl I have read have had bad attitude waitresses here as well. It doesn't matter how great the food is.. If you have rude service, there are many other places to go and eat, and I will if it happens again."}
{"text":"This is a new place that has opened in the space that was vacant for quite some time and was previously occupied by a diner. The diner went out of business a few years ago, repeating the fate of another restaurant that was in that space before.   So we have a place with some bad \"restaurant karma\" here. However, I do hope these guys overcome it and succeed despite the history of the location.  Naruto opened its doors right before the holidays and flooded the neighbourhood with flyers announcing their grand opening and some purdy sweet discounts. Worked on us. And, by the looks of it, on a bunch of other customers.   They gutted the place, opened it up and gave it a fresh and more urban look. There are rows of regular tables and three large hibachi tables. At least for now, the all-you-can-eat price includes hibachi - the guy is very entertaining and I recommend you take them up on that.  The food is good quality and fantastic value. It's as good or better than some a la cart sushi places around here. Definitely the best all-you-can-eat sushi I've come across.   The chefs are well-trained and the food is flying out fast. The services is typically good too except one occasion when the waiter seemed a bit spaced out and brought a bunch of things we didn't order (we didn't really mind since everything's included in the price anyway).   The lunch menu is understandably shorter that for dinner. Some of the rolls are missing from it and no sashimi. Still, there are plenty of salads, soups, appetizers, desserts, rolls, sushi, tempura, u-don and even chinese options to choose from."}
{"text":"AWESOME FIND! this place is conveniently walking distance from where i live and honestly the best find! Went in with the sis and her boyfriend for lunch the other day and decided to do the all u can eat sushi and hibachi which was well worth it! at $16.99; the menu for lunch time was quite extensive. Those who did not want the hibachi can do the all you can eat sushi for a cheaper price. Dinner time menu has alot more items as well as the hibachi included at a great price of $19.99! You cannot go wrong with this place with the fast service. The food was amazingly tasty and not a single dish disappointed from the calamari tempura to all the rolls! and the Hibachi! the Chef had an artful display of skill which was a great show! That alone was worth the upgrade. He did a great job and def did a great job iwht the food he had prepped! AWESOME service! The fried ice cream as divine! and the decor was honestly a big upgrade to what was there before! overall a MUST GO in richmond hill!"}
