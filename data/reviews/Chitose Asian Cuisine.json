{"text":"My girlfriend and I discovered this under-recognized gift from God after we were served what we thought to be hot parking lot garbage at Cynthias Paradise. From that point on we promised ourselves 2 things. Firstly, we would never jeopardize our lives again by eating food of that quality again. Secondly, we would not eat at any restaurant where there is a congregation of obese middle aged males wiping the sweat from their foreheads as they ram another piece of saucy sushi down their gullet trying to get their \"moneys worth\" of All You Can Eat Sushi. 

Holding true to the promises we made to ourselves, we discovered Chitose Asian Cuisine. This restaurant is nearly perfect in every possible way. Its magnificence is characterized by the skillfully prepared food, personable and customer oriented staff and the BEST sushi newmarket has to offer. The diverse array of food options and the absence of people sweating as they choke down endless rolls of sushi inevitably ruining your appetite makes the decision to go to Chitose a no-brainer!"}
{"text":"As I write this, I'm full to the point of comatose. 

When I walked in, I wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary. The atmosphere is nice, a little classy, but immediately forgotten once the first dish came out. 

The beef and green onion rolls were delicately sliced, and almost melted in my mouth. The sushi was a perfect ratio of rice and protein. The tuna sashimi was lightly seared and chilled, really bringing out the beautiful flavours. The beef golden curry had the right amount of kick, and the cashew beef was wonderfully savory. 

Then the server recommended the garlic tenderloin.

I don't really have words to describe this dish, other than I would name my next child after this lady to thank her for this service. 

On top of all this, their timing was perfection. No sooner had we finished a course when the next one arrived at our table. 

At the risk of offending my mother, possibly the best meal of my life."}
{"text":"I have had their Sushi and last night their red curry. Both times I have not been disappointed. Food is fresh with lots of flavour. Service is also excellent and staff very friendly staff treats patrons like they want you there( which for some reason is really hard to find in most Newmarket eateries always puzzles me?!) This will be my go to place for Asian cuisine:)
Thanks for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Had 2 dinner combo and a sear rolls, a total of $53. Prices are okay, but their portions are big. You can barely finish a combo urself and they are delicious, the tuna is not that good tho. I really recommend the sear salmon roll because it is so tasty! Overall the place is big and tidy, services are fast and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi, fast professional service. Usually not too busy. Low key relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to think this place was good but after receiving horrible and combative service on two different occasions I changed my mind. It's just this one server - she yells at patrons in the style of a harsh Victorian school mistress"}
{"text":"I'm wondering where the four star review comes from. Visited this restaurant after about a year of driving past it. Had the AYCE lunch. Ordered some sushi and Chinese food (chicken balls, pineapple fried rice). First, the sushi - the hand rolls were strangely wrapped. I'm not sure what's  customary for hand rolls, but I'm used to a more cone like shape. These looked like loose maki rolls yet to be cut. While the salmon wasn't horrible, I wasn't impressed with the quality. On to the fried foods - ordered the chicken balls and fried rice. didn't finish the order of chicken balls, and with one fork full of rice said no thank you. Also ordered a chicken dish not on the AYCE menu - the chicken was quite rubbery. Normally I don't give negative reviews, so I feel I should mention that the service received was quite welcoming. Our waiter was kind and attentive. It's unfortunate we didn't enjoy the food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Jut moved to town and was looking for a good sushi place.....this by far exceeded my expectation!! The environment was calm and the service was awesome. The waitress and waiter were very attentive. The food was to die for I had the sweet and sour soup and we also had a green dragon roll, California roll, avocado roll and BBQ eel roll. The taste was very fresh and zesty. My daughter and I were both very happy with our visit and we look forward to many more."}
{"text":"The service was good; they were fairly quick and definitely friendly. One of the chefs was usually the person serving us and he would remind us what food we were waiting on (as we did AYCE) and he topped up our waters regularly. It was slightly bordering on over visiting our table but I didn't mind too much. 

The food though is very mediocre. They have a ton of different items on the menu and we tried a lot of them, but they were all just average. I even found a HAIR in my pad thai! This is also considering that there are plenty of great restaurants in town that have better versions of the same food, just with a smaller selection."}
{"text":"Came here today 

.. Worst tasting dragon roll ...still has skin attached to the shrimp that was hard to digest ... And definetly didn't taste like sushi to me.. 

And some cheap cucumber roll... I mean I'm paying like $14 for some cheap cucumbers.. Ahem that's lunch special .. Much rather not.. Because I can get so much better for $9 in Markham ...

I didn't expect much from a chinese japanese restaurant but this was beyond .... What I thought it would be. 

Probably won't be back ever. Although the decor wasn't too bad..  And service was up to par but... Still food was ugh.. Cause the salmon absolutely did not taste fresh............  ."}
{"text":"We've been here 2x now. Ordered off the menu the first time and got the AYCE the second. Very good food. Fresh ingredients. No fishy smell or taste. Very good service and food comes pretty quickly. We have had a little bit of everything since we did the AYCE and everything was very good. Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Very good first impression! Very fresh food and unique since they have a pan-Asian fusion menu with Thai and Chinese, not to mention one of the very few japanese restaurants with a bit of dim sum too (I saw har gow and siu mai).

We had the sushi lunch C which was 8 pieces of spicy salmon roll and 4 pieces of salmon sushi for 9 bucks. It was excellent, the salmon was very fresh and not rice heavy. 

Second we got the rib eye mini hot pot for $18. Yes it's kind of a premium for all the mini hot pots but we were glad we tried it. It comes in a little pot and portable gas stove which was easy to control. You have a choice of soup base, we tried the soy milk one and it was delicious and light. It comes with veggies, tofu, clear noodle, and a nice portion of beef. Also if you feel the need to ball out there's a Wagyu Kobe beef option for 150.

The interior is very nice, Tiffany blue ceilings with cool right angle arm chairs and low couches. The service was great, our server was very attentive and the supervisor went above and beyond to make our experience enjoyable. He even opened the door for my mother on the way out! Although it wasn't very busy the service exceeded my expectations.

Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"my wife and I had lunch today we decided to do all you can eat we ordered off the Asian part of the menu we were really pleasantly surprised!we ordered 6 or 7 dishes all fantastic red curry chicken, chicken pad thai, kung pao chicken, chicken fried rice, general toe chicken and hot and sour soap. service was fast the server was super friendly food was excellent we will be back again don't know why anyone would eat at the Mandarin!"}
{"text":"Went here for AYCE lunch with my girlfriend and her family.  Because we got there soon after they opened, we were the only ones in the restaurant, so the service was amazing.  The staff were friendly towards us, explained menu items for my girlfriend's parents, and took our orders immediately.  Our food also came very quickly.

For an AYCE restaurant, the diversity of food they offer is good, but definitely lacking compared to others I've been to.  The quality of the food is hit and miss as well.  I enjoyed the Rainbow rolls and Dragon rolls, but the pork cutlet was too much skin/deep fried batter and not enough meat, the cucumber rolls tasted pretty bland, and the hand rolls were not my favourite.

I'd come back if I were in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come."}
{"text":"A fellow Yelper invited us to have AYCE sushi in this newly open joint.  

What I liked:
-Place is very clean with ample parking.
-All the sushi was very fresh especially the salmon.  
-The rolls were very well made and did not feel like AYCE quality.  I especially enjoyed the rainbow roll.  
-The waitress was very patient with us despite us having no rhythm to our ordering pattern. I think we ordered apps, entrees, apps, dessert, entrees, apps and dessert in that order.
-The tobiko was good.  
-the red curry and pad Thai tasted pretty good.  Better than most AYCE places.

What I didn't like:
Keep in mind that this is for the AYCE side:
-hand rolls were not the typical cone shape and just cylindrical.  In addition, the seaweed wrap didn't have that crunch to it.
-there was no eel sushi, eel sushi pizza or eel roll 
-no cold tofu, chicken wings or dim sum as the extras.  

Verdict: While the quality of the food itself and the service itself deserves 4 stars, I feel that for an AYCE place, you should have a few more options, so that's where they lose a 1/2 star.  Still when I'm in the area, I'd definitely go again. I'm more of a 3.5 stars on this one, but for the items they have on the menu, they do it well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing service, great food, great atmosphere. My favorite is by far the Red Thai Beef Curry."}
{"text":"Really good food and very fresh. Sashimi melts in your mouth. It was a very delicious meal. Order the seared salmon sushi roll and sweet shrimp. The service was also very good."}
{"text":"This app was confusing to set up and we lost our stellar review of this amazing Restaurant! This rating above doesnt have enough stars!
Best Value AYCE Asian cuisine everrrr!
We'll be back - friendly helpful staff and Fresh tasty sushi etc 
The Amayaki , exceptional ! We'll be back"}
{"text":"I thought adding AYCE would be the \"death knell\" as it is for so many AYCE restaurants.  However, the sushi served does not insult you by trying to hide a mass of rice under a thin slice of fish.  Besides excellent sushi, add in the fact that they also include items from the other menus as well.  A small plate of the wonderful Singapore noodles, Mango Chicken, General Tao's Chicken, Green Curry and others all expand the variety of the meal.  I can get maxed out on AYCE sushi, but with the added variety of incredibly flavoured Thai and Chinese dishes, expect to leave in pain.  Hit me and make us both happy..."}
{"text":"The all you can eat menu for $25CAD is great!! The fried mango salmon sushi is a must.
Great and clean place. The manager is awesome. Great service."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for AYCE after reading some good reviews about this restaurant. The atmosphere is quite nice and the restaurant was pretty quiet when we entered around dinner time on a Wednesday night. 

The staff are extremely friendly and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. the AYCE was $25 pp which for a weekday dinner price was a little steep to me. The AYCE menu is not the biggest I have seen but it had a decent amount of items.

Everything was made fresh and came out nice and hot (the hot dishes of course). The maki rolls and the hand rolls were great and had a lot of filling and wasn't just rice. The spicy salmon and the spider roll were delicious and so was the wagyu beef. All in all the food and service are great but the price is a little steep for AYCE. If you are in the area, give it a try! I would say it is the best AYCE in the area for sure."}
{"text":"...
Bland, where's the flavour?
I was a bit offended when the waitress told me that out of everything I'd enjoy the chicken wings when I didn't ask for a recommendation on what to eat...
It cost too much for how much I got over all and I have a family of seven, I could have gotten more food anywhere else...
Tsk tsk tsk..."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem of a place in Newmarket. The only reason I come to this plaza, if ever, is to shop at No Frills but I guess I have just found a better reason to visit this part of town! 

Their lunch specials are the best value and quality you can get for a sushi place. I ordered the Lunch special 5C which came with miso soup, 4 pcs salmon sushi and 8 pcs spicy salmon maki roll for $9+tax. The salmon was so fresh, you could tell by the colour! The taste was heavenly too. The rice to fish ratio was pretty good, not too much rice. The rice was flavoured quite well too and wasn't overly seasoned with vinegar. The miso soup was great, just the right amount of salt, with lots of tofu, mushrooms and seaweed.

Overall, this place is a great bang for your buck, especially, for the quality of seafood that you get. This will definitely be my go to place for any future sushi cravings!

P.S. They have an all you can eat lunch for $15 (dinner for $25) and currently they are running a 10% off promotion for it. They also have pop and tea included in AYCE. Now, I wish I had some company to try that out!"}
{"text":"This review is based on an AYCE lunch ($15).  I don't know how Chitose Asian flares among the competition in Newmarket.  Compared to the competition in Markham, Richmond Hills and downtown Toronto, the sushi, maki rolls and grilled food (no sashimi for lunch) are squarely middle of the road.  Fresh, solid, decent but no WOW moment.  The red curry is surprisingly good, however.

Services are friendly.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and clean.

I think I will return when I crave for Japanese food in the hood.  It seems like a reliable choice."}
{"text":"Four of us decided to go to Chitose for lunch today.

The place is clean, there is plenty of seating, and the service is very good.

The music is kept at a lower level which is nice, and there was tea on the table in less than two minutes.

I've been here before, and we often come for the \"all you can eat sushi.\"  There is a lunchtime version, and a dinner version.  The lunchtime all you can eat does not include red tuna.  Red tuna can be ordered separately, or you can opt for the dinner menu.  Then you can get sushi or handrolls.

You may ask why the red tuna is so important for me.  I must eat a gluten free diet.  I need to be strict.  Red tuna is my favourite of all sashimi.  I'm limited to which fish I can have b cause some is marinated in soy sauce.  I order red tuna every time I go for sushi.

The variety is great at Chitose, and goes beyond just sushi.  There are several soups, salads, noodle dishes, curries, and some Thai and Chinese dishes as well.

Some of these are available if you are on a gluten free diet, but you need to ask for no crumbs, or marinated fish, and avoid deep fried items.  I typically wrote. O gluten right on the order form.

I ordered salmon sashimi, a couple of red tuna handrolls, the Philadelphia maki, cucumber and avocado maki, miso soup, and a coconut ice cream.

The food was very good. The staff are beyond friendly and are happy to make sure you have a great meal."}
{"text":"I had heard that the food was good here so on the weekend my husband and I have it a try. We tried the springs which were fresh and hot. We were given a sample of the salmon mini pizza sushi which was yummy. The salmon was very fresh. We split a hot pot soup which was really delicious. The soup was sweet and the veggies and meat were plentiful. We are trying to come up with another excuse to go back again soon."}
{"text":"We were looking to find a new Sushi place to try and are so glad we chose Chitose.  After reading the reviews we felt confident that would have a good experience.

First of all, I don't eat Sushi, but my husband and two sons love it.  So I rely heavily on the kitchen menu when I eat with my family.  At first glace, the menu is full of favourite items and lots of new items I've never even heard of.  The restaurant is open, clean and modern.

Service: The service was spectacular, constantly clearing plates and inquiring if we needed anything, answering my questions about food I haven't had before and filling our water glasses without being asked.

Food: Well, the boys loved it, from the BC Tuna Sashimi to the deep fried Dragon Eye, they were not disappointed.  I ordered my regular items, mushroom tempura and deep fried scallops.  I also tried their Hot & Sour soup and Kung Pao chicken, which were delicious.  Then, I ordered some items I haven't before, Thai Chicken skewer, Salmon Amiyaki and Yang Chow rice.  All were tasty and will merit a second try next time.

Price: Well, if you pay with cash, you get a 15% discount, but even so, at $25 per person for a weeknight, a bit pricey.

Overall?  I would recommend and look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"I don't really feel good with a restaurant that specialized in Japanese and Thai, Chinese food. But Chitose Asian Cuisine might be good for a big group that just could not decide on what they want to eat.

This review is based on AYCE lunch ($15) experience. I would come back to try a la Carte during weedays when the sushi chef is not overwhelmed with all the orders. And no way I am going to order any of their Asian items.

The AYCE menu is decent but I would stay away from their cooked/Stir fried food. Since we were a big group, we ended up trying quite a selection from their menu.

Soup: I did not order any but my friend seemed to love their Miso soup since she ordered 4 rounds and almost want that as dessert

App: Seaweed Salad, Aged Tofu, Shrimp Tempura were both really good. The shrimp tempura was light and not oily at all!

Rolls: Golden, Rainbow, Green Dragon, Dynamite. All really similar with really nice presentation. But basically really similar. 

Sushi: Salmon, Fish Egg, Spicy Crab, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Crab, Spicy Salmon has good rice to fish ratio which is really good for an AYCE restaurant. Salmon was really fresh and so was the Flying Fish Eggs.

Hand Roll: Don't order that! They are basically a round roll of rice and fish wrapped in seaweed not the usual hand roll (Temaki).More like a uncut Maki and the seaweed was all soggy... 

Japanese: Beef Amayaki, I guess it is similar to Teriyaki? It taste like a Cantonese stir fried beef slice.. nothing Japanese in taste and texture about it

Asian: Red Curry was good but their Pad Thai should definitely be avoided. Asian fusion with a More Chinese influence.

Drinks and Dessert: All you can drink pop is from can not fountain which is really good for AYCE. The ice cream is good quality.

Service here was really good and attentive. The restaurant was not really busy on a Sunday afternoon but with just 2 sushi chefs working it was really hard to keep up with AYCE order. So might not be a good option if you want to have a quick lunch."}
