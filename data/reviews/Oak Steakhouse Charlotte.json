{"text":"Very pretty ambiance and very pleasant service.  (Warning:  Don't wear extremely high heels, the restaurant floor is very slick) 6 of us had a girl's night for a birthday and I was interested to try a new restaurant.  I got the pork ravioli and the soup that day was a corn jalapeno soup.  I strongly recommend not getting the pork ravioli. The pasta was tough and the pork inside was flavorless. However, the soup was excellent.  It seemed to also have a curry flavor to it. I got the crème brulee cheesecake for dessert and, OMG, it was amazing !  It had a crystalized crust on the top and cheesecake-flavored custard underneath with a sugary crust.  (I think a shortbread-like cookie crust would have been better ... I couldn't eat the crust because it was way too sweet)  I sampled some of my friend's items. I did not care for the 3 cheese lobster grits, they had a bit of a bite to them as if they could have cooked a bit longer.  In fact, she didn't eat it. We tried the pot of crème and it was nice, but again I'd pass next time.  One girl got the ice cream donut and didn't care for it much.  We all agreed the crème brulee cheesecake was divine and we all should have stuck with that.  One gal got the steak and I took a sample. It was very good, but a bit too much salt in the rub on the outside for my taste but she seemed happy with it."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. The decor was really upscale but still comfortable and the service was spectacular. As a vegetarian who occasionally eats fish, there aren't usually a ton of options for me on a steakhouse menu but I had some tough choices to make last night. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend the scallops, crabcakes, and the cheesecake. Oh man, that cheesecake... Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try Oak! It's walkable and the menu looked great. First impressions were very disappointing. It smelled like burnt plastic when we walked in. (Maybe an issue in the kitchen? Very strange.) The atmosphere is that of a hotel lobby restaurant. The ceilings are impossibly high, the decor is cold, lights were too bright and the tables & chairs were out of place. The two top tables were really tight (think Valentine's Day crammed together). It was not the romantic atmosphere we anticipated. The service was great and the food was fine. We had oysters, tuna, rib eye and Brussel sprouts. Overall I was really let down by Oak- almost entirely due to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Oak Steakhouse. We arrived with a reservation and were promptly seated and our waiter, Zach offered a superb variety of cocktails and appetizer choices. We started with a pork ravioli that had a great flavor. For the entree we had 8oz filet and 16 oz Ribeye, the temperature of the steaks was perfection and with the suggestion of the waiter we added the lobster macaroni and cheese. We were surprised with a fabulous creme brûlée for dessert with a champagne toast to top off our fabulous evening. I would highly recommend Oak to my friends and family."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in our experience was flawless. The restaurant is stunning, the food was beautiful and the service was outstanding. We had an assortment of starters, salads, steaks, sides and dessert. Top to bottom we enjoyed our meal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It is extremely impressive that Oak presented us such a fine experience on its 5th night of being open.  Decor is lovely; very welcoming staff; and service by Matthew was impeccable.  The octopus appetizer was the best I have ever had (including Italy!), and the porterhouse and truffle fries were divine.  Their other restaurant, O-Ku, is a favorite, as well; Oak is a welcome addition to the Southpark restaurant dining scene.  I'm looking forward to returning, AND to their addition soon of a Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here last night... food was very good... but some problems early on when the hostess sat us said to my adult daughter as she handed her the menu...'there you go sweetie'.  To me she said 'darling.  I'm not overly formal, but think this type of familiarity is misplaced in a restaurant like this. Friendly server, but service was very slow - we had to ask for our apps, for dishes to be cleared, for water....  We expected more"}
{"text":"Had brunch here with friends recently and was not impressed. Ordered a french press and cinnamon roll to start. The coffee had so many grinds in it they had to make a new one. The middle of the cinnamon rolls were raw. We also ended up ordering chicken and waffles, a breakfast skillet, grits and eggs Benedict. The Benedict and skillet were good, not great, just good. The chicken and waffles were pretty terrible. Soggy waffles and a chewy piece of chicken thigh. The grits were chewy and unappetizing. Blah!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary at Oak after hearing amazing reviews following the recent grand opening. We received a complimentary champagne toast upon arrival along with many staff stopping by to wish us a happy anniversary. What an extremely kind and thoughtful gesture! We had an overall wonderful experience - great ambience, attentive service, and incredible food. The 75 and Sunny cocktail is very refreshing with a little spice to it. The oysters Rockefeller were out of this world! And our main course certainly did not disappoint. We will be back again soon!  Pictured here: 8 oz filet, 16 oz ribeye, pork belly mac & cheese, brussel sprouts, and truffle frites"}
{"text":"We celebrated our 10 year anniversary there. Our waiter Zack was the best!! The food was prepared perfectly!! Great ambiance within the restaurant. This Steakhouse will fit in the Southpark area well."}
{"text":"Had a great Father's Day meal! Atmosphere is modern and overly noisy. Waiters are accommodating to changes and questions. The rack of lamb was the highlight of the meal, but the chocolate cake was yummy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really good if you want to impress a business associate (or spouse)! I had the NY Strip medium rare and it was prepared perfectly. A good steak does not need excessive seasoning or be drowning in butter. Sides were exceptional, especially the brussel sprouts. Even if you don't like brussel sprouts, you might love these! Service was excellent and very attentive."}
{"text":"My husband made a dinner reservation there for my birthday and the food was great! The service was absolutely amazing and the employees really surprised me. As soon as I walked in they were all wishing me a happy birthday... I mean how surprisingly sweet is that?  We had the tenderloin bistro, filet mignon, roasted mushroom, pork belly Mac n cheese, the oyster Rockefeller, the Local Bibb salad, and the creme brûlée cheese cake which was all really good.... the roasted mixed mushroom was actually surprisingly better than I had expected and the cheese cake is ah-mazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse - worth the splurge for a wonderful experience.  With locations in Charleston and Atlanta, we were excited to try this new place. Entrees: Filet Mignon and 20oz Bone-in Ribeye were both delicious and cooked to perfection.    Side dishes:  1.  Jalapeño cornbread - not too spicy, sweet and the texture almost made this pass as a dessert. Will order this again and again!  2.  Brussels sprouts - with a maple glaze these are a must. Even if you don't like Brussels, these will taste like heaven to you!  3.  Lobster Mac and cheese - creamy, large chunks of lobster and very flavorful.   Delicious, delicious, delicious. Excellent service. Couldn't have asked for more!  A nice change from the usual Charlotte restaurants!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for brunch last Sunday. We were thoroughly impressed with how smoothly the service was considering it was the first brunch service since the restaurants opening. The service was great and the food came out in a timely fashion. As expected, the food was delicious. I got the lobster frittata and he got the pork belly eggs Benedict, both were delicious. Overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Went for my wife's birthday, and from start to finish : one of the best dining experiences ever. Hospitality, service, and especially the food. Oysters Rockefeller, the ribeye, pork belly Mac and cheese, fried succotash, and the carrot cake. Made our night very special. Def going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this new Steakhouse in Charlotte!  Beautiful Restaurant and fabulous service while dining at the bar.  Our Bartender Greg was FABULOUS!!!  Very attentive and offered suggestions, completely knowledgeable about the menu.   Can't wait to go back, thank you!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate here, I gave this place 5 stars. This time my experience was the exact opposite; full disclosure, this time I ate here for an industry presentation in the restaurant's conference room on someone else's dime. An hour and a half into the conference (the presentation had actually already concluded by then) we still hadnt been served our main courses, so I had asked for everything to go 30 minutes prior (1 hour in) to 2 different servers 15 minutes apart; nothing was done. I didn't want to make a scene, but I left the restaurant hungry, disappointed and never even saw or tasted my main course after having been at the restaurant for more than 90 minutes."}
{"text":"I tried a couple steakhouse in Charlotte. Let me tell you, this place is by far my favorite steakhouse. SO WORTH THE MONEY. The food were AMAZING. The steak was cook perfectly (medium well done). I can't say the same about the cocktails... but the food made up for it so it deserved the whole 5 stars lol"}
{"text":"With a touch of charm and class, Oak provided the perfect space for a birthday dinner for little ole me. I called a week ahead to secure our reservation and the manager ensured Oak would make my birthday particularly special :)  We had a group of 16 and our table was prepared upon arrival. The staff was completely accommodating despite having a large party and some being late. I never once felt rushed and our waiters were very informative. Some of our orders were mixed up as far as sides being given to the wrong people, but we ended up just sharing our sides anyways.   I shared the Mixed Grill with a girlfriend, which includes lamb, sliced tenderloin and NY strip. The lamb was cooked to perfection and oh so tender! I loved the fingerling potatoes that came with the dish. However, the strip and tenderloin both lacked flavor. We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, truffle frites and brussel sprouts as sides to share. All delicious, but surprisingly the sprouts were my favorite! For dessert, the staff gave me a complimentary creme brulee cheesecake (check pic! How cute?!) and I also tried the butterscotch cookie. Both were delicious. I ended the meal with a French press to complement my dessert and it was perfect!  Thank you Oak for accommodating our group and for making little ole me feel so special. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at Oak last night for Valentine's Day and it was simply, okay. We arrived five minutes past our reservation, but weren't seated for another fifteen minutes (understandable for a holiday), however the big problem for me was that we were first seated at a hightop table no more than 8 feet from the host station, practically in the lobby. We asked to be moved and were moved to the next table over, but at least it wasn't a high top table.  Our waitress was wonderful! Very pleasant, very kind, and full of recommendations about the menu. She absolutely gets a 5 star, the rest of the experience, not so much.   We ordered drinks, we were really excited for the bar menu. My wife ordered a Carolina Summer and I ordered a Saskatoon. My wife's drink tasted like a unsweetened La Croix water and mine tasted like a concoction of essential oils with a little bit of alcohol. I was very surprised that, for the price ($15+) the bar was so light on their pours. I would not recommend ordering drinks here.   We ordered a salad to start, which was plenty large enough to share. Two steaks, a side of frites, and the grilled broccoli. The steaks were very good, almost great! The sides were par, especially the frites which were essentially your average fries with a little too much salt and garlic on top. The broccoli was good, and again, almost great.   I think this restaurant is close to being really good, but until they become more liberal with their alcohol pours and can boost the quality of their sides, I think it is an overpriced step-up from an Outback, etc. We ended our night by going to Firebirds in Ballantyne for some after-dinner drinks and honestly, probably will go straight to Firebirds next time."}
{"text":"I went to The Oak for the soft opening on Monday night - 5.8.17.  Michael was a great server & the food was awesome.  I will definitely be going back once officially opened!!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely best steak in charlotte. Went for our anniversary, made same day reservations and were treated like we were royalty. Frites were amazing, wine was amazing service was amazing. Literally wouldn't change a single thing. Will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Food is about four stars but service is three stars at best. Arrived in a pouring rain and can not find any valet parking within a hundred feet of the entrance. In fact the parking situation is very dicey as there is rarely any parking available for the restaurant. Ordered our drinks and then ordered a bottle of wine and our food. The food came and an additional glass of wine was ordered but after five minutes the waiter had to be reminded that the glass of wine had not arrived.  A pasta dish that was ordered was not available but we were not told that until just prior to the entrees being served so there was only time to take their substitute entree of another pasta rather then decide on another dish if we had been told about the pasta not being available soon after the order.  The wine list is pretty inclusive. The prices are the same as at Capital Grill but the service does not equal that at Capital grill.  If your reservations are for a  rainy night I suggest you cancel so you stay dry."}
{"text":"The service, decor, music and most important the food, were all fantastic. You definitely get what you are paying for here."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and excellent 5 star service. First time trying oysters Rockefeller, delicious! Loved the bib salad, tried the steak tartare but it's not my thing, my companion raved about it. Had the ny strip and lamb for dinner with the brussel sprouts and crispy potatoes, took more than half home for leftovers! Highly recommend the old fashioned cocktail and wine list. Finished the meal with espresso and a slice of the delicious creme brulee cheesecake. Definitely returning soon!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Oak for Queens Feast. My boyfriend and I opted to eat off the regular menu.  Ample parking, which is always a win. The decor is beautiful. They've made a nice looking steakhouse.   The food was spectacular. We both ordered filets and my boyfriend added a lobster tail. As sides we ordered the crispy potatoes and the Brussels sprouts. We spilt an Oak Salad to start. I had the dressing for the salad placed on the side since I'm not a huge dressing person and that worked out perfectly!  The filet has a really nice char to it. My boyfriend loves how large the serving of the lobster was. Both of us loved the sides. I did notice some people think the sides are too salty, but I thought they were great.  Service was quite good.   I will say, you can go to other steakhouses for a similar experience and quality for less cost. I did hear there is a bar menu though... so I'm sure I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is phenomenal when the food can match the ambiance right down to the core. The service was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful! Upon arrival, we were greeted but the hostess quickly. Our waiter came and checked on us and suggested drinks! Our first drink was wine which went perfectly with the steak!   We ordered a ton of food and drinks. (Our eyes were bigger than our belly.) Here is what we ordered in the order of our favorites:  CAB Prime Porterhouse Ribeye  Steak Tartare Carpaccio Oyster Rockefeller Pan Seared Scallops  Grilled Octopus Lobster Carbonara Confit Pork Shoulder Bolognese Pork Ravioli    Here are our favorite sides by order:  Brussel Sprouts Mixed Mushooms Pork Belly Mac & Cheese Truffle Frites  Whipped Potatoes  So many choices but at the end of the day, it was all so good!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars to the service, atmosphere, and bartender craft cocktails.  However nothing I ordered was as good as I would expect given the reputation and price.  I would not put my steak in a top 5 list for Charlotte and my apps and sides were just very mediocre.  I am one to support a local Steakhouse over a chain, but for this type of meal I would have to recommend Del Frisco's or Capital Grille.  I have returned twice since eating here, but only for cocktails at the bar which I continue to think are great."}
{"text":"We went to try out this new-ish restaurant in Southpark for Queen's Feast. The decor is stylish and upscale. Attire ranged anywhere from business casual to Country Club casual.   Immediately we ordered drinks and sat in the comfy seating near the bar. Our dining companions had arrived before us and had ordered a bottle of wine and the meat and cheese appetizer. They said it was so good they ate it all before we got there. I ordered a filthy dirty martini. Our server asked if I wanted it like Miley Cyrus used to be-very funny comment. The martini was EXCELLENT. I know this restaurant is big on bourbon but we skipped that. Once we moved to our table, our bar server followed us to the table and got a bottle of wine and water. Our \"real\" server was Bruce and he kept us on track. I will say this steakhouse has plenty of options besides steak. I will tell you that the filet and bone-in filet were superior. They melted in your mouth. Both pieces were cooked to order. Bruce brought out the executive chef, Alex, who said they get the meat locally. The meat is the star!   All the yelp reviews said not to miss the pork belly mac and cheese. It was amazing and the family size portion gave everyone a nice serving of it. Don't miss it!   Queens feast included dessert. I ordered the chocolate cake. Our table thought it was below average. The cake did not diminish our experience. It's a great addition to the steakhouse scene in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place more stars.  It's beautiful and the service was awesome.  I just can't get past the food and the wine selection.  We sat at the bar and ordered four items to share and only one I would order again.  We started with the meat and cheese plate.  It was fine, I didn't love the meats but that could just be my preference. We also ordered the filet with truffle fries on the bar bites menu (specials before 6:30.)  It was a great steak, cooked perfectly and the fries were to die for.  It was also a great value at $18 for a five ounce steak.  We also had half of an oak salad which was fine but over dressed.  The grilled octopus was super tender but also super salty.    The wine list and by the glass list could use some work.  The service from the female bartender was awesome.  She was very attentive and she comped us for a bottle of wine that we drank half of and just couldn't get past the weird flavor of the wine.  I would come back for a cocktail and those amazing fries!"}
{"text":"Oak Steakhouse is a great brunch secret in the South Park area of Charlotte. The service here was amazing. Our server knew the menu very well, and made great recommendations. The atmosphere inside is gorgeous. However, I wish this location had more seating for outside dining. The dishes we enjoyed here for brunch were great as well. I enjoyed the shrimp and grits. The grits were of a stone texture and was paired with a rich gravy. I would visit this location again"}
{"text":"Had an outstanding dinner at Oak the other night. Atmosphere was very cozy and the service was second to none. The NY Strip that I got was cooked to perfection and had one of the best sears I've ever seen at a steakhouse. Will definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I received a recommendation to go to Oak.  As I was a lone diner, the suggestion was to eat at the bar.  It was a great meal, phenomenal service from Sharon.  I plan to go back in the near future with my wife."}
{"text":"After returning from our trip to NC and posting two horrible reviews, I just had to write a glowing review of Oak.  We went there two nights in a row just because the burgers were the best we've ever had.  The restaurant is pretty and clean and the service is excellent. The manager (think his name was Jason-was outstanding).  If you get a chance, not to be missed this place."}
{"text":"Great bar, with high quality ingredients and bar staff. Upper end of price scale, but quality makes up for it."}
{"text":"On Sunday you have to go to brunch. I love the Oak Skillet and the french toast, not to mention the cinnamon rolls. :) Yummy! Also, the Mac and Cheese is amazzzing!!! its a favorite."}
{"text":"We tried Oak Steakhouse for the first time last night and it exceeded our expectations. We have eaten at most of the other top steak houses (Del Frisco's, Capital, Palm, Ruth's Chris) and Oak topped them all. From drinks (dirty martini's) to appetizers (octopus, burrata salad, salmon tartare) to entrees (steaks cooked and seasoned perfectly - dry ages rib eye and filet), sides (roasted mushrooms, collared greens, crispy potatoes, and pork belly mac & cheese), everything was excellent; complimented by top notch service by our server and surrounding staff.  We will definitely be back!! I was so engrossed with the food, I forgot to take pictures. If you are looking for delicious food and excellent service, I highly recommend Oak!! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place during the soft opening last Monday night .... We got there a little early and sat at the bar for a while so we got the whole experience... Great food, Great service (thank you, Micheal & Alex) would definitely go again...Highly recommended for a nice night on the town with a special someone."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Very good quality food prepared very well. Only knock was due to large group of 10 people it took a while to get the food but it was worth the wait. Very good experience highly recommend. It's pricey but very good for a special occasion."}

{"text":"We had made a reservation last minute due to other restaurants being booked, but Oak Steakhouse was somewhere we had always passed by and never tried. We arrived a little early and were told the wait would be a few minutes (which was fine since we were early). Ten minutes past our reservation time, the manager came over to apologize for the delay and said a few groups were hanging around longer than anticipated. Another ten minutes pass and the manager apologizes again saying we should be seated soon, and offers to have an appetizer sent to the table. Probably five more minutes pass before we are actually seated (for those of you not keeping track, that's 25 mins after our reservation time).  I started with a water anticipating ordering a cocktail after the longer wait, but since this was our first visit, I needed a moment to look over the menu. The waiter, Joshua, greeted us and took our drink (water) order, then left to get our drinks. He came back and asked if we wanted an appetizer, but we decided to order entrees and sides (NY strip and ribeye, pork belly mac and cheese and grilled asparagus), and Caesar salads to start. He then took all the menus, including the drinks menu, and didn't ask if I decided on a drink.  Salads came out first, and they were just like any other Caesar, except loaded with Parmesan. The manager stopped by again to apologize further, and presented us with the salmon tartare with a soy glaze. This was delicious. Our main course came out next and I laughed at the size of the cast iron plate the steak was on. I peered at our neighbors and surprisingly their steaks were on actual plates. The steaks were cooked perfectly, but were very salty. I like salt, but goodness, this was too much. My Texan soul died a little. The pork belly mac and cheese shockingly lacked salt, and the pork belly was tough. The grilled asparagus was fine.  Overall, I was disappointed tonight. The service received from Joshua was far different than what I observed with his other tables. For example, he went through all the top choices and his favorites on the menu with the table directly next to us, but quickly rushed to take our order and didn't bother to ask if we had dined at the establishment before. I distinctly felt like he was putting more effort into his customer service with the table of middle aged men as opposed to two younger women on a girls' night out. I'll be honest: I'm not expecting the waitstaff to wipe my nose for me, but the service just did not match up with the price tag. I've had much better service and a better overall experience at other restaurants.  The only saving grace of this experience was the manager, and unfortunately we did not get her name. However, I don't think we will be coming back again.  TL;DR: Manager and tartare were awesome. Service and food did not match up to their prices."}
{"text":"I ate here with some friends the other night. I should have written the review the next day but the dinner at Oak was such a non-event that I just forgot. If you look at my review history- you will see I am an easy 5. But this place was a 'meh' this the 3.   Overall, I paid $140 for 1 person and got an over cooked steak, slow service with a side of an excessively hot restaurant. The side salad and sides were good."}
{"text":"While the food was good and the service attentive, I found the prices to be excessive even for a high end steak house."}
{"text":"Sooo, it took us longer than it should have to find the door. In our defense, we found ourselves wandering around outside with another couple having the same trouble. There's a big sign on the wall, but you totally miss it if you're coming from the parking deck. Oops.  Once we entered, we were greeted promptly, but there seemed to be a little bit of chaos at the hostess stand. Our reservation was for 6:30 pm on a Saturday, and the place wasn't too packed when we got there, but it was hopping when we left!  Our waitress was great - personable, helpful with decisions, and pretty prompt (until the end when we waited a pretty long time to get a port - but she totally acknowledged it, which I really appreciated). We started with the pork ravioli since it's not an appetizer you see anywhere else, and it was yummmmy. Also divine were the yeast rolls they brought. For dinner, we got steak (of course we did). I got the 8 oz filet which was more expensive and smaller than the one at The Palm. I ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly. It had seasoning on it that reminded me of Del Frisco's - a good thing. The fella and I split the pork belly mac and cheese side, and I almost made myself sick on it... mmmmm. Between the Yelp reviews and our waitress' recommendation, we went with the creme brulee cheesecake - it was like a regular cheesecake with a hard shell. Tasty.   The ambiance isn't quite my style since it sorta feels like a restaurant in an office building with super tall ceilings and no intimacy (maybe because that's actually what it is?), but the bar was pretty. Service was pretty well spot-on and the food was more creative than what you find at other steakhouses. Dress code seems to lean toward business casual, but the fella was in jeans and was fine."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight, it was a great experience and delicious. The waitstaff were awesome, humorous and more than able to put up with our table after we'd had a few cocktails. We had the tuna tartare lettuce cups, the carpaccio, and the oysters Rockefeller. My only gripe was that the oysters mainly tasted of bacon and breadcrumbs, no oyster texture or flavor. Three of us had the filet, one the half rack of lamb, and we shared some Truffle fries and Brussel sprouts. The meat was cooked perfectly, the flame grill really does make a difference, the sauces that came with the meats were all also tasty. The Brussels weren't a hit for us, they came in a really aggressive oil and spice mixture that was kind of off putting. The truffle fries serving was HUGE and tasty. For dessert we got the ice cream sandwich (on the house) and the crime brulee cheesecake, the ice cream sandwich was a little weird because the cookies were super hard and difficult to eat. The cheesecake however was soooooooo good. The majority of the meal Was delicious, the service was excellent, if at times a little too excellent---a runner or waiter asked if we wanted more bread at least 4-5 times. $500 for 4 people is a little steep--the above food,  a few cocktails, a bottle of red wine and tip--especially in South Charlotte. But hey, sometimes quality is worth the price and I'd say at Oak that holds true."}
{"text":"Unfortunately things could have been better I realize they still have growing pains but Here's what we found :SAM who took care of us when we had a drink was excellent!! Bruce who came by and talked to us was at first humorous and that was nice however he needs to know when to go back to work  Emily who was our waitress was very good at first but when we had a few minor complaints she turned sour even after we told her we knew it wasn't her fault and my friends told her she looked mad  she never recovered came to table to check on us but couldn't get away fast enough Food for the price was OK but for the prices they charge should have excellent Soup was served with no spoon we asked 2 times for spoon I had to get up find Sam and he brought us a spoon  Justin the manager came over to see how things were two people had to sent their entree back to have it heated up Justin did take care of a couple of items off bill for our trouble but we told him staff needs to be re-trained to give better service I stopped at bar after friends left and Tanner at bar was very good I go to 3 other fine steak restaurant in Charlottr and never had any problems  I am a firm believer in giving everyone a 2nd chance but my friends won't be going back to this restaurant  I have never worked in the restaurant business but think I could a good job managing this place"}
{"text":"Wow is all I have to say about Oak. I've been to many Vegas steakhouses and this ranks up there with them. Friend and I went on a Friday night during Charlotte Restaurant week and ordered off the special menu.  We had the winter salad, the 8 oz filet, and then shared the apple cobbler and chocolate raspberry cake.  The winter salad was delicious. I'm not easily impressed by a salad at all and it barely had any dressing on it but it was superb. The filet was cooked to perfection. Had a nice char on the outside and I ordered mine medium rare and it was melt in your mouth good.  I didn't even use any steak sauce it was so delicious.  It came with whipped mashed potatoes and greens that were equally as amazing. Friend and I shared the two dessert options. The apple cobbler was the winner hands down. The chocolate cake tasted almost like it was frozen and was still thawing. It didn't take away from the dining experience though. Our server was very attentive and always kept our drinks filled.  They had some wines on special for restaurant week that were delicious as well.  There is ample parking that's free inside the parking deck.  There is also complimentary valet parking for Oak as well. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to it, semi-dark so my pictures didn't turn out that great.  They even gave us each a small loaf of coffee cake as we exited to enjoy in the morning.  The regular menu is very pricey but I'm glad that I took this opportunity to give Oak a try and learned that I would love to dine there again sometime.  I heard on Yelp that they have a bar menu and would like to find out more about that before returning.  The food was great and will not disappoint. Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. Check them out. I made my reservation ahead of time on Open table which I recommend because it's convenient and easy to use.    Oh, and before I forget, the complimentary bread and butter was also a hit at our table. Nothing but good things to say about this place :)"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last night and was very impressed. It is a very nice restaurant perfect for date night. our waiter Samuel was a pleasure from beginning to end. I had the ribeye steak it was delicious the best in Charlotte in my opinion. The oak house homemade sauce on my steak was great. The oyster Rockefeller was great.  I definitely will be return"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try Oak during their first full week open. Went with my family to enjoy a nice night out after a long day. I would say it's one of the better steakhouses in Charlotte!  The ambiance is top notch, we walked in and were greeted kindly and shown to our table quickly. I loved the details of the burned logo into the tables. If you like gin, the negroni for two is one of the best Charlotte has to offer! (and the presentation is great). It's a perfect size for a nice starter or a nice drink if you're ubering it for one.  For starters, we opened with the octopus and the foie gras. Both were outstanding, the octopus was nice and tender, which complemented the richness of the foie gras very well. I feel the foie was one of the better ones I've had in Charlotte, Hudson Valley maybe, though it wasn't acknowledged on the menu.   The burger, mac and cheese and mushrooms were fine, nothing out of this world or to write home about. The one side I would recommend would be the lobster grits... rich and velvety... it paired nicely with the steaks.   Now for the steaks, we got the top-of-the-line aged bone-in ribeye and the NY Strip... very good... but for the price I've had better. The doneness was a little spotty with my medium rare specimen, not sure if it's the method of cooking or instrumentation. I may just had back luck... but for the price, I rightly expected perfection.   The service was head and shoulders above average, the servers were knowledgeable and were eager to please. I was impressed.   Now, I'm not one to have a sweet tooth, but Oak's Cheesecake crème brulee is a must try. I'll leave that one be. I would have it every day if it didn't have any calories. Actually, I would have the entire pie if we're playing that game.   Overall, I need to go again... I just should make sure someone is taking me or I save up a few months. A nice place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I mean, who doesn't love a good Steakhouse?!?!  As far as I'm concerned, the more the merrier.  I made a reservation to take my boyfriend out for his birthday.  When they called to confirm the day before, they asked if we were celebrating anything and I told them.  So fast forward to yesterday's dinner.  We arrived promptly at 7pm, gave them my name, and said \"welcome and happy birthday\".  Ha!  Then we sat down and then the manager (maybe) came to wish him a happy birthday...and then our waitress.  I was laughing, but we were both incredibly impressed by the service and attention to detail for special occasions.  Our waitress was fantastic.  She was very friendly, and didn't know much about the bourbon selection, but was happy to bring us a list when we ordered a second round.  I ordered a glass of Cabernet and it was delicious.  The wine list by the glass has a wonderful selection (but don't expect to pay less than $10 for a glass).  The cocktails looked great, so I'll have to come back for one.  I will say, I was definitely NOT impressed with the fact that they charge for a block of ice for drinks on the rocks.  Don't get me wrong, I know I'm automatically paying a lot for a glass of something on the rocks at a nice upcharge, but you really want to charge me $2 for a block of ice???  Would have been nice to know before so it wasn't a surprise when the bill arrived.  The food was certainly nothing to complain about.  We started with a half portion of the Oak chopped salad and the shrimp cocktail.  Both were nice and light before the heavy meal.  The bread was also a trio of dinner rolls with some sweet butter...almost tasted like we were eating dessert!  We both ordered 8oz filets that were cooked PERFECTLY.  FYI-they have both wet and dry aged steaks for those of you who are connoisseurs.  I also recommend the Brussels (unique and cooked with cumin or some spice...awesome) and the Mac & Cheese (with pork belly in a delicious creamy sauce).  The wonderful ending was the Cheesecake Creme Brulee (get this and thank me later) and the surprise slide of chocolate cake with a candle and Happy Birthday written on the plate!  Overall, great experience, wonderful service and prompt food delivery for each course.  I'll definitely come back for future special occasions.  You certainly get what you pay for, so don't be surprised when the bill comes and it's over $100/person.  Except for the ice block charge...that was unnecessary."}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING business dinner Wednesday night. 8 oz Filet was the best steak I've had. Service was TOPS.  We literally had 6+ folks stop by our table to check on us. Server, Gabby, was well versed and efficient.  Oak is one of the best kept secret steakhouses in CLT. My business guests could not stop talking about their dinner. Well done Oak!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Perfect special occasion dining experience. Our server Jonathan did not miss a beat. Extremely knowledgeable & first-class service from beginning to end. We have searched for a comparable steakhouse to our New York favorites for 12 years. We have not been successful until now. Steaks were cooked to perfection as well as the sides and the cocktails. We were warmly greeted by practically the entire staff during our dining experience. It was a treat to be able to complement the head chef Alex. We highly recommend this restaurant and it's perfect staff and supreme service.  Thank you to everyone for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Beautiful steak. By far top 3 best filet mignon I've ever eaten. Literally melt in your mouth. A must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"First time here. Parking was fairly easy. Place was full but not crazy busy for a Saturday night. Had an 8:15 reservation. Asked for a booth which they gave us. The booth request seemed to throw hostess a little. Menu was pretty straight forward for steakhouse. The prices lead me to think they are wanting to grab some of Del Fiscos and RC customers. I had the pork chop which was very tasty and the risotto was great. The mixed vegetables that came with it were terrible. I would suggest some steamed broccoli for a choice. Wife had the filet and I did taste it and it was ok. We also got the whipped potatoes and the sautéed vegetables. The potatoes tasted like they were from a box and were very dry. The sautéed vegetables were just ok. We also started the meal with the cheese board and while a few of the items were pretty good (meats mainly), the 2, yes 2 cheeses were just ok. There also should have been some cranberries. The main reason I said the cheeses were just ok was because the center portion of both cheeses were softer, by the time we started making it to the outer portion, it was to hard to cut. I had the Caesar salad which was very good. I will always give a place a second shot to redeem a mediocre first time but we dropped over $200 here without buying a bottle of wine and if I'm going to do that, the entire meal better be more than just ok. I leave these reviews for 2 reasons. One that they management reads them and makes some changes and 2 so that others have something to compare when they do take the time to review."}
{"text":"Just wrapped up our first visit, and we're walking away full, happy and bursting with praise for this place. Driving by crowds at other South Park spots I want to yell - get your butts to Oak for brunch. I'm a picky person about service and the people of Oak are amazing! Decor and music - on point! We started off with a french press of Pure Intentions, along with chocolate chip banana bread and cinnamon rolls. Both were delicious but the bread was my favorite due to the combination of ooey gooey chocolate and the crisp but not burnt bottom. My fiancé ordered the skillet for her main - the homemade sausage and gravy were a hit! My lobster frittata didn't disappoint - they didn't skimp on the lobster and I loved the touch of lemon on the micro greens. Our server Sam surprised us with chocolate cake to go for my fiancé's birthday- such a sweet gesture! Definitely coming back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"So, we did it, WE TRIED OAK.  I am so sad to say that I'm.. underwhelmed. I expected greatness to match the prices here, and honestly I thought everything was good, but not great. Tasty, but not delicious. Drinks were perfect. Presentation was lovely. The interior of Oak itself, is beautiful. Our sever always seemed to be upselling, and was not super efficient. We came for the steak, but it was over seasoned (salty) and slightly over cooked. Which is tough when your spending so much $$$ on it. Sides were forgettable.   I just can't get over the fact that when you come to a steakhouse, you expect them to be great at what they do. You expect great steak. And I just got average."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first dinner last night. The food was outstanding. The octopus and pork ravioli  appetizer was excellent. I ordered the Salmon that had a perfect caramelizing on top and was super flavorful. Another had steak that was cooked perfect. Dessert was a gluten free chocolate cake that was dense but not too sweet. We didn't request gluten free but our waiter Zach suggested it and glad he did. I would definitely order it again.  And the restaurant decor is very cozy and welcoming. Overall first impression was very good. Great place for a date night and also great for business dinners"}
{"text":"My husband made reservations for Valentine's Day over a month before and when we arrived they told us \"we are way behind\" but did not give and estimate of time. They directed us to the over crowded bar where we waited for 15 min before anyone looked at us to serve us. Now it's not that they were rude but having 2 people manage and make all drinks for a restaurant is a bit overwhelming. After waiting for 35 min we asked again and they informed us that it would be the next table up. After more people left and a couple who came in 20 min after us sat down I asked why it was taking so long. They apologized and sat us within the next 10 min- that being said we waited over an hour from our reservation time. However management was trying to be very accommodating but kinda ruined a romantic night out.   The steak was quite good but I did not think it was the best steak I've ever had to expect the price. The Brussels sprouts were good but I've had better and the lobster Mac and cheese was skimping the lobster and flavor. Again the steak cooked perfect and it was delicious but not worth the wait or price.    I would try their Charleston location but do not think I'll go back to the one in Charlotte. It doesn't hold a candle to the experience we get a Hall's chophouse in Charleston which is what some reveries claim."}
{"text":"Eh.  I agree with several of the other people here. I love a great steakhouse and was so excited to try this one. However, it was quite unmemorable.  We had a party of 8 for NYE... the decor and ambience were inviting. Our service was fine but nothing to get excited about; empty glasses were left on our table throughout the meal... water was refilled sparingly. I asked for my steak to be rare; it was brought out medium well.  If I am paying 60+ for a steak, it should be cooked properly. It was replaced awhile later.  No apologies, no warm sides, etc. Instead, I found myself eating while the others were close to done.  I would much rather head to BLT, Bentley's, or one of the many other steakhouses in CLT.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week, and it was the best restaurant week experience we have ever had. Every single bite of the meal was delicious and Victor was an awesome server! Sometimes the service isn't great during restaurant week, but Victor was phenomenal. Never once treated us like we weren't his most important guests.   The ambiance is amazing. Smaller than I expected, but all of the decor is beautiful and we really enjoyed the environment and getting to soak it in for a couple of hours.   We started with the truffle fries before our 3 course dinner because...carbs. They were so good! It was a huge portion and we ate every single one. The winter salad was amazing and the steaks were perfectly cooked. We ended the meal with an able crisp and chocolate cake with French press coffee.   The entire menu looked wonderful and I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"After winning a gift card on Yelp for Indigo Road Restaurant Group my choices were Oak or O-Ku. Who doesn't love an incredible piece of meat? So, Oak it was! It was a special evening celebrating my girlfriend's Birthday.  There is a large parking deck attached with FREE parking, that's a plus! Oak also offers complimentary valet parking.  I made a last minute reservation on Open Table. Very easy site to use... I highly recommend making your reservations through OT! We ending up running a few minutes late, but were still quickly seated. It took a few more minutes before we saw a server to place a drink order. Sort of confusing because I think a couple different people showed up to our table, not really sure who our waiter was supposed to be - at first. They quickly filled our table glasses with quenching ice water. She settled on the Carolina Summer cocktail and He went for a Makers and ginger. The Carolina Summer was very tasty and refreshing.   As we sipped on our drinks and chatted, I mentioned to my girlfriend it sure would be nice if they offered bread to munch on while we browsed the menu... It wasn't 2 minutes later and a basket of rolls and butter appeared at the table. Magic!  After browsing the menu, we figured we would split a 12 ounce filet mignon (medium) and sides of brussel sprouts and crispy potatoes. They stated because of the style of cooking it would take some extra time for filet to be prepared. Not a problem at all, we were not in a hurry. It didn't seem like much longer than any other steakhouse when it all came out to the table. They even halved the filet for us, how fantastic!  My take on this meal: WOW WOW WOW! One WOW for each item! Fantastic, tasty, delicious, yummy, all those big words... What an incredible piece of meat - And I'm not talking about myself :-) .. I know I have been working out.. But, I digress. Everything was wonderful down to the homemade steak sauce, which you really didn't need at all.  We tried not to overindulge on the sides, but that was tough given their deliciousness. I had to force myself to focus on the finishing my half of the filet and we box of the remaining sides for weekend leftovers. Great idea. The waiter dropped off the obligatory dessert menu and then eventually the check as we passed on the sweets. He was nice enough to allow to spend a few minutes chatting post-dinner and enjoying each others company... My girlfriend and I, not the waiter and I.. But, I digress. I highly recommend Oak Steakhouse to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Business folks beware!!! Steakhouse that doesn't know how to cook steaks, small overpriced sides, and takes WAY too long to serve. Spent 500 (without tip) for four people for bland tasting moderate quality steaks, none were done to temperature requests, sent two back to the grill, manager came over immediately to apologize and replaced a couple sides, but for two $60 filets to be severely undercooked after a 1 hour 30 minute wait (restaurant was only 1/3 full) causing us a bad business-customer meeting, and not offering to take the steaks off the bill is unacceptable. Would NEVER risk taking business clients here for fear of a bad experience, and would never do business with again as they don't understand the customer experience in the upper tier premium value segment they are trying to play in."}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat at this restaurant because it has a great reputation in other cities . We were a big group so we sampled much of the menu. The steaks were okay but the sides were awful ( very salty !). We spoke with the manager and gave him our feedback. Normally most restaurants would offer some sort of compensation ( free dessert / take the sides off the bill) , however this manager interaction was very awkward - he barely spoke with us, but did not apologize and walked away. Very disappointed. Will not be going back . If you want a good steak house check out BLT or STK."}
{"text":"Best Mariachi Band in Charlotte!  I made reservation for our 14th anniversary here via Open Table. I checked off \"Anniversary\" as the occasion and for the Special Requests question I typed \"I would like a Mariachi band to play Mexican Hat Dance upon our arrival\"....... just to be a smart ass and see if anybody was actually reading the comments.   So we arrive 7:20pm, introduce ourselves to the hostess, she says \"Happy Anniversary but I'm sorry to say we don't have a Mariachi band available tonight.\" Haha, funny! Takes us to our table, leaves, super nice young lady.  Our waiter Bruce shows up \"Hi I'm Bruce, I'll be taking care you tonight....Daaaaaadadadadaa, dada.....daaaa...da..da...da.dada.!!!\" He air Trombones Mexican Hat dance, seriously. Air Trombone. Funny AF!  The food was off the charts, really cool staff, great service, nice ambiance. Thumbs up on the Porkbelly/MacCheese, bussle sprouts, carpaccio, nice wine list, Debragga NY strip was just stupid good, creme brûlée cheese cake.....We Uber'd it home, snorted a Crestor and passed out in a drunken food coma.  Ask for Bruce and maybe he'll do the MHD.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Rqdgna3Yw  Ciao! Agave"}
{"text":"WOW. What to say... this steakhouse will blow you out of the water. The food is absolutely amazing and the service is even better! Aaron took care of us and the service was impeccable. Make sure to try the pork belly Mac and cheese. The NY strip is to die for. Will be back soon! Maybe even this week!"}
{"text":"Have a reservation the place is hopping!  Not too noisy and the blues in the background is nice. The ambiance and decor seem fresh and modern- not a stuffy old steak place.   Service was excellent. We had 8oz filet that was perfect! Had some seasoning as well that was a bit salty to us.   Potato fingerling hash has no potato. But was excellent. The crispy potatoes were excellent and the grilled asparagus was ok.  Caesar salads were average.  Wine list was reasonable.  As usual we passed on desert.  Worth a visit"}
{"text":"Good, but should have been better. The Decour of the restaurant is beautiful, and the location is perfect right in South Park. Also, all the sides we ordered with our meal were amazing.  But there were a few things that bothered me about our meal. First the service, our server was very nice and professional. I just wish he was a little more tentative to our table. I felt like I was constantly looking for him to order a drink.  Speaking of drinks, I ordered one of their specialty cocktails that the waiter recommended. It was very good just weak.  At $15 a pop, I'd like to taste the booze in my drink.  Now on to the steak. I ordered the bone in aged ribeye medium. The first steak that came out was chard pretty bad and lacked flavor. The manager came over and offered to cook me another one. 20 minutes later a less chard steak came out. The second steak was a lot better and had some good flavor. It was just unfortunate that we were all done eating by the time it came out.  Overall, our dining experience was good just not great. And i feel that when you go to a high end steakhouse house everything should be great.  That's why you pay $15 cocktails and $60 steaks..."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic. Jennifer is the best waitress I have ever had. She was kind, personable, conversational, and did an absolutely excellent job serving us. Make a reservation here and ask for Jennifer as your waitress."}
{"text":"Amazing apps, steaks, and drinks what more can you ask for. We had a of couple drinks and appetizers at the bar, and ending up staying at the bar for dinner because of the friendly service. Both the Old fashion and Infused Mojito are incredible. Love the grilled Octopus, and the steaks were cooked to perfection. Great service as soon as we entered and the bartenders Sharon and Brody were Top Class! Amazing restaurant that is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The food & service was fair ! The waitress we had was good but the wait time with getting our food was ridiculous"}
{"text":"Hello Excellent Steak, goodbye bonus check. Ok, maybe a little dramatic. My wife and I went there this weekend. Easily made a reservation, and they gave us a great booth. Very nice , open atmosphere and not too congested. We shared the Burrata salad, Christina has the bone in filet, I had the ribeye (which they said they've heard is the best in Charlotte) the lobster Mac and Brussel sprouts. Add in two desserts and two glasses of wine, and we had a bill approaching 3 bills after tip. Holy crap.   The ribeye and filet were generous, cooked to perfection, and very tasty. (I think they're a little too proud about the Certified Angus Beef rating- that isn't all that special.  The lobster Mac was delicious, and the apple tart dessert was better than the chocolate mousse pie.   In all, the service was very good, and the food was as well. However, it wasn't that unique to be priced this high.  A good meal, just be ready come check time."}
{"text":"The good: The interior is gorgeous. Custom cocktails we sampled were very tasty.   Not so good: Coursing of the meal was extremely fast. We were a party of four with a 7:45 reservation, so I wouldn't think the staff would have been in such a hurry. To be fair, some people would have been fine with the pace, but it was a little quick for me.   The real disappointment were the steaks. When I order a $39 filet, I expect the person cooking it to know what he or she is doing and for there to be some char on it - some, at minimum. There was no char on any of the four we ordered. What a waste of high-quality beef! We ordered four sides: Brussels, lobster mac and cheese, pork belly mac and cheese and the jalapeno corn bread. All were fine, but not impressive.   Lastly - dinner bread. This seemed like sad grocery store bread - not the kinda good stuff Harris Teeter might bake in-store. Sad bread that apparently wasn't worth bothering to heat all the way through.   To be fair, we didn't alert anyone that we didn't enjoy the food. Complaining is so tiresome and I didn't want freebies - I wanted a great meal, but that opportunity had come and gone for March 6. I'd recommend Capitol Grill, Beef N Bottle or any number of other steakhouses ahead of this one. There's a Ruths Chris right around the corner too."}
{"text":"Top 3 steak house in charlotte in my opinion. Real nice ambience, quiet, great location.  Apps- oysters on half shell were great! Oysters Rockefeller were also delicious. Grilled octopus was tasty, different m, but tasty. Had a BBQ kind of flavor, would certainly get again.   Entree- filet was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Friend got the KC bone in strip and he loved it, also cooked and seasoned perfectly. Wife had the lobster carbonara and she crushed it. Though she only allowed me 1 bite, it was indeed delicious.  Sides- Brussel sprouts were delicious. Lobster Mac and cheese was great, coulda have had a few more pieces of lobster in my opinion, but was good none the less. Jalapeño cornbread was phenomenal! Perfect blend of sweet and spicy (not too spicy).  Dessert- wife wanted the chocolate cake even though I hate chocolate (don't judge me!), we compromised on the lemon cake, and Joanna our waitress hooked it up with the chocolate cake as well which my wife appreciated lol. The lemon was MOIST...yeah I said it. And my wife loved the chocolate cake!    Overall this was a good experience, great location, great food and great ambience! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"WOW!  What a great dining experience! From the time we entered the restaurant to the time we left we were treated like royalty.  Jennifer was our server and she is absolutely wonderful!  She went out of her way to make sure we were cared for at every step of our dining experience.  Justin, the manager, even took the time to engage us in conversation.  The deserts we absolutely amazing...especially when paired with the French pressed coffee...Yummy!!!  I highly recommend this establishment for a fine dining experience.  We plan to stop in for a casual bar experience in the near future."}
{"text":"We were a party of five here for my birthday. Overall the welcome and getting seated was fine. The front staff seemed a little distracted or maybe startled when we arrived, but were kind enough. We were offered to be seated while we wait for the rest of our party who was parking. To be honest, after reading the reviews and knowing this restaurant group, I was expecting a bit of fun. I would describe it as more somber than anything. But our server did well with asking if everything tasted good.   We ordered some drinks to get started. While $16 can seem a little steep for a cocktail (and yes, I know this is a nicer restaurant, I'm just tired of the $15 to $16 cocktail), our drinks were really tasty and seemed to have been made with skill and attention. Side note, the bar area is beautiful and the Oak Manhattan is exceptional.    We each ordered burrata salad, one person in our party got the vegetable soup, though they didn't actually order it and had just asked the server what the soup of the day is. To be fair, the person who asked what the soup of the day was had mostly lost their voice a little so it wasn't a big deal. The burrata though--I could eat the burrata salad every day of my life! It was so good!    For the main course everyone except me ordered the filet and I got the 16 oz. ribeye. We also ordered several sides. For sides we got the pork belly mac n cheese, the assorted mushrooms, collard greens, and truffle frites. None of the sides were bad, none unfortunately none of them were all that memorable either. About half our table wasn't big on the dry, hard, chunks of pork belly in the mac. I personally thought it was delicious. My steak came out medium, but I had ordered it medium rare. I did expect a perfect cook here for a $54 steak. This was not a huge deal and I didn't want them to throw it away as waste, so I didn't mention it to the server. I know they would have recooked it if I mentioned it. Our server was kind and very friendly. There were maybe two times when we needed something and waited a little while. Over all a great addition to the South Park restaurant scene and well worth a visit."}
