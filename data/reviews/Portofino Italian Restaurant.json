{"text":"Food was good!  Pasta dish was flavorful and the chicken parm was a huge piece of chicken with good breading/cheese/sauce. The house wine selection was decent. Excellent service and decent prices. The only complaint is that they serve small loaves of bread ... but they brought more bread to the table when we asked. I would stop in again if I am ever back in that area. We did not have the pizza, but we did see several tables with pizza. We would try pizza next time."}
{"text":"Not bad, but they still could improve.   My wife and I went here on a Friday evening around 8:00 p.m. The place was near capacity, but the wait time was not that long. The restaurant was in a strip mall area and it wasn't too big. The ambiance was nice.  It took a little bit for the waiter to come serve us, which was no big deal. The waiter did seem rushed and overworked (like most waiters). We placed our order as soon as he came to the table. The time between the order placement and the bread/salad service was a little long. Another waiter told us that our waiter \"had a lot of other tables\" and \"that we should cut him a little slack\". I thought those comments were a little forward and unprofessional, but didn't ruin the experience.   We received our bread and it was luke warm. The bread wasn't great, but when you are hungry it taste as good as water to a man in the desert. If I am correct, this is the same dough they use for their pizza. If that is the same dough, I would not think the pizza would be that great.     Next we received our salads. The salads appeared to be a Italian/Mediterranean salad. It had tomatoes, onions, romaine lettuce, green olives, and probably a few other things I could not remember ;) First off the salad was also luke warm, this was disconcerting because usually salads in restaurants are ice cold. The house salad was unique and not that great. Personally I am not a fan of olives, so the salad was not a high point.   Lastly we received our entrees. I ordered pomodoro angel hair pasta: basil, tomatoes, garlic and olive oil. It was good, although the portion seemed a little small for $10.00. My wife ordered the manicotti. She received three \"tubes\" of manicotti and she enjoyed it.   The price for everything was $22. $10 for my Pomodoro pasta dish and $11 for the manicotti (plus tax).   Overall, the food was not bad. The food and service could have been better. Personally, I  believe it is nice to go to a locally owned place than the Olive Gardens and Carrabba's."}
{"text":"Love their pasta dishes. Their Portabella Pollo in cream sauce. And their house dressing is a family secret and one of the best. Great wait staff. Have eaten here more than a dozen times with no disappointments."}
{"text":"Have only been twice.  First time was wonderful.  Heather our service was exceptional and the food was wonderful.  Second time, service was incredibly slow(not Heather), food was good not great.  Possibly a different chef.  Also, seemed like the owner had family or close friends in town and it kind of felt like you were sitting in their kitchen.  Sometimes this is nice and quaint.  Depends on your preferences.  The owner, although I have yet to meet him, comes around to the tables to check on patrons.  Nice touch!  Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"It was clean. Otherwise, the waitress was polite but not well informed on the menu. We had white pizza, ravioli, and the grilled ckn salad. The salad entree arrived 5m before the raviolis and the pizza 5m after the raviolis...not the best planning.  Lastly, the food. The pizza was ok but very bland  (really not worth the money or calories). The raviolis and ckn salad about the same. This was probably my first and last visit here.  There are better options in Gastonia and CLT."}
{"text":"Please teach your staff the menu. When multiple waitresses as if we want ranch or blue cheese with our antipasto platter appitizer there is a problem. One person okay but when two different people come to ask you have issues."}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience here. Our waitress was rushing us so badly when we first sat down, that was a major turn off. Unfortunately the food did not make the experience any better. The calamari had no seasoning, ordered the veal parm, 1 piece tasted old, the other piece was so chewy it could not be eaten, and our pizza was undercooked, the center was incredibly soggy. It will be a long time before I would give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time today.  The owner appears to be an old-school Italian, so you know the food will be excellent.  The pizza was very good...the best new york style pizza I have tried in the Charlotte area.  The wings were pretty good too.  They were cooked to perfection with a little crispiness on the outside, tender on the inside.  The wing sauce wasn't great, but nothing that can't be fixed...next time I will bring my own sauce.  I will be back again next week."}
{"text":"We always do pizza on one of the weekend nights and have tried several different locations around Lake Wylie - We still rate this portofino's as the best as compared to Ayrsley especially - the Gastonia staff appear Italian and obviously cook like Italians - would love to eat in sometime.  They prepare pizza with the right amount of sauce, cheese and are generous on toppings.  Their crust is also done the best. This is compared to Lake Wylie Pizza, Luigi's Pizza, Papa John's, etc..."}
{"text":"I tried Portofino's again for the first time in 15 years.  I thought I would give them another fair shot.  The salads were fresh and the bread was warm but I am a lasagna snob and really wasn't pleased with theirs.  I was craving a rich red meaty sauce and instead I got a very bland orange-colored thin sauce.  I never add salt to food but I had to salt the lasagna because it was lacking taste and texture.    My mom got the spaghetti and meatballs on half and bolognese on the other half.  The noodles were watery (that's my pet peeve with spaghetti).  I like dry noodles so the sauce clings to the noodles, not a wet watery mess.  The sauce wasn't that good and she had to salt her spaghetti as well.  Our waiter rarely checked back, I had to wait for his return to ask for straws and more bread and a box.  She and I both agreed we wouldn't be back for a pasta dish if anything at all."}
{"text":"Great place for some great Italian food-  Service is prompt and menu has a lot of choices."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a nice experience at Portofino's.  The service was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh bread and salad.  I don't know if they make their blue cheese dressing in-house, but I wanted to eat it with a spoon!  I ordered linguine with white clam sauce and my husband ordered penne with a 4-cheese sauce.  Both pasta dishes were okay, but needed more seasoning.  It was easy to fix the blandness of his penne dish with a little salt, but my linguine just seemed to have a flat taste.  There was plenty of fresh clams on top and a pool of butter or oil at the bottom of my dish, but it just didn't have the flavor that I was expecting.  Perhaps my hopes were too high since I am 6 months pregnant and have been craving this particular pasta dish my whole pregnancy!  The portions were plentiful and the pizzas looked great--perhaps I should have gone that route.  They were certainly busy too.  Typically, I would not return to a restaurant that I gave 3 out of 5 stars since we don't eat out a lot and like those meals to be really good when we do...but based on the excellent service and overall good experience, I think we would try it again."}
{"text":"My husband, mother, and I were passing through town, on our way to Charlotte airport. It had been a bad day filled with travel nightmares.   I found Portofino's on Yelp, and even though I called exactly at their closing time, they graciously took my order over the phone, and had a hot, fresh pizza waiting when we arrived. Briefly told them my sad travel story when we got there, and they could not have been nicer, more sympathetic, or more accommodating.  They allowed us to stay and eat in the restaurant (again, after the official closing time), refreshed our drinks, and checked on us several times. All this for a $14 pizza order.    I don't know when I'll be back in Gastonia, but it would be worth a special trip back to be treated so kindly.  Oh yeah, and the mushroom pizza was darned tasty!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for the price, the crust is my favorite style, thin but not tough. Great flavor. Atmosphere is quiet and casual.  The pizza  could be less oily. The wait staff could use some personality.  I see the price is listed on Yelp as $$, I disagree.  Figuring PER PERSON should be $.  Not pricey at all when eating pizza."}
{"text":"This place is so simple, yet so very good time after time.   Pizza is great as long as you're not looking for \"thick\" crust.  Would recommend the broccoli and garlic over linguine, add spinach, light on the oil.  Oh, and the house dressing is pretty good."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in Gastonia! Won't find a better NY style pie in town. Took a while to find this place and so glad that I did."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. It's New York style, and they do it so well. I can't comment on their other dishes, because their pizza is so perfect, I don't look at the rest of the menu, LOL. I will say this. I eat there by myself. I'm not a big spender - I get a small cheese pizza and a couple of beers, and I tip 20-25% because the service is always wonderful. And the last time I ate there, which was maybe the fourth or fifth time ever, a beautiful woman that I believe is one of the owners came to my table and commented that I wasn't at my usual table (for whatever reason, I don't ask, I usually get seated at a table near the back). I was floored that the woman recognized me, let alone remembered that I normally sat near the back. And she radiated warmth and family. I'm sure if I start ordering other dishes I'll come across one I don't like. But I will never stop appreciating the hospitality I always feel as soon as I step inside. It's like a sanctuary. I'm going there tomorrow. I just talked myself into it, LOL."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very pleasant and personable. I played it safe with the Chicken Parm & it was great; my date had the Del Bascaiola & it was Divine!  I will definitely order it next time."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I ordered the stuffed shells and it was lukewarm, and my husband ordered the chicken alfredo and it was scalding hot. Our waiter had the personality of a doorknob, but the bread sticks were good.. The food had almost zero flavor. I'm not impressed, nor would I recommend this place to anyone.  Olive Garden is right down the road and about the same price."}
{"text":"The food was better than I expected based on the initial impression. Looked more like a pizza joint. Dining atmosphere was nice other than the cockroach that decided to greet us. The waitress nor the FOH seemed concerned or surprised when we informed them.  Service wasnt that great, she never came back even to get our check. Had to flag manager to get check and cash out. Better service at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I like them, the atmosphere is intimate and a good date night spot. The pizza is good, you can get an Italy type toppings pizza or American type toppings pizza. The rest of the menu is good too. I like that they are family owned and operated. There are other Portofino's in Charlotte which are owned by other family members. I have friends from Italy who say it is as close to true Italian as you can find in the region. Therefore seasonings may not be typical of what your mother used. They can get busy on the weekend so plan on that, they have a smallish dining area."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their calzone and my boyfriend loves the pizza, the crust alone made him give me two thumbs up! They're very generous with the cheese and I love that. I tried penne ala vodka, and it was just okay. Ylit had very subtle flavors that the garlic bread we ordered just overpowered. It just needed some oomph! The service is very hit or miss depending on who you get. You can have the best waitress ever who works like a machine and never lets your glass go below half full OR you can have the nightmare guy that is slow as anything and forgets you exist until the food comes out. My boyfriend had to get up and ask for more drinks after waiting 20 minutes.   Moral of the story? Calzone to go, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced for how bland and small of a portion it is. Wouldn't recommended this for your first option of Italian food. Plus the service is poor. I walked in and didn't get asked for drinks till 20 minutes after."}
{"text":"Some of the employees they hire here just act like they don't even have a clue. Don't even know the menu, what comes with what, how much it is, etc. When you work at a restaurant, you need to know the front and back of a menu, or at least should. Me and my friend came here last week and usually look forward to the bread they give when they seat you, but it was definitely not fresh. It was very stale and cold. Not warm at all. Their pizza can be very greasy and their pasta used to be good but now not so much. I used to love this place but I don't know what happened."}
{"text":"This was a shot in the dark for us. Never even heard of this spot before. But on a lazy Saturday we decided to get some dinner here. The bread is awesome, I think I got full off it. The salad was good. The pizza my son had said it was good. The eggplant Parmesan that my wife had was okay (mushy). I'm not a fan of eggplants myself. I had the sausage and peppers. It was borderline. I won't get it again. I think I will come back to at least try the pizza."}
{"text":"I would give the food five plus stars. The service was very bad. I have lived in the south for over 20 years and have not had food that reminded me of home until today. The warm bread, the bruschetta, and every thing tasted delicious.  The server forgot my wife's salad dressing, and never remembered. She used mine, not her choice of dressing, but was ok to switch on the fly. We asked for more bread during the meal, the server said, not a problem, and that was the last we heard about the bread, it never came. The check was dropped on the table half way through the meal, had to keep asking for drinks, just horrible service.  I want to go back for the food, but am not looking forward to the service."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza! I also like the atmosphere here. Staff are always nice. We eat in often. The prices are quite reasonable. We had a side of meatballs recently and they were so good! The crust on the pizza is perfect too! Great for take out and also a nice place to eat in with your family. Friday nights and Saturday nights do get quite busy so I recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Love the cheesesteaks from here. They only serve them for lunch and they are huge. Great service every time I have been here. Just don't fill up on the bread, the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Food is always hot and tasty.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Especially Zach, he is always great."}
{"text":"The Del Boscaiola over Angel Hair was awesome.   I wish that the same could be said for the whole meal, however that was not the case.   I actually found the single largest hair I have ever seen in the salad.  My wife could not even eat her salad once I found the hair in my salad.  I completely understand that sometimes bad things happen even in the best restaurants.  But when I asked the waiter to remove the salads, he said that he has worked in restaurants for years and sometimes it happens.   No apologies or considerations from the staff or management. That was my biggest and only complaint.   It will be quite a while before I revisit Portofino in Gastonia.  Compared to what it once was and could be...  Portafino is not worth slowing down to try out."}
{"text":"The only place to get a cannoli in Gtown! And a damn good one at that! In case im not the only one who cares about this sorta thing..."}
{"text":"I got the meatball sub and fries this time and they were delicious as usual.  I've had their pizza and pasta, everything is phenomenal with great service. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food best in town. My favorite place but I haven't been in a while the service the last 2 times was horrible.  First time we sat for 20 min no one ever came over we left.  2 nd time order took forever then server brought out wrong order then brought us a pizza over said it was on the house then walked over said no never mind this was for someone else worst service ever. We haven't been back. I am crushed"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and am from up - state NY, I know Italian food. This was way above average. I had the pasta seafood delight...frank diavolo. The food had great multi-layers of flavor. The calamari was lightly breaded and tender...this is good food.   You all know me...this was way above average."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with a party of 7, ended up being a total disappointment.  Strike 1: Lack of communication between staff. When we walked to the front door, a staff member politely opened the door for us. However, as we walked by him to enter into the restaurant, he said that no tables were currently available. He was just in the process of telling us the wait time, when one of the other staff members stated that we could be seated right away. At least check the tables before you turn customers away.  Strike 2: Water did not arrive at the table until after 20 minutes of being seated. PLUS, the \"Sweet\" Tea was NOT sweet at all. Water and Sweet Tea were requested, but we were left waiting and thirsty. The place was not packed with customers, and water/sweet tea should not take long to bring to the table.  Strike 3: My boyfriend, of all people, did not receive his entree until the rest of the table had just about finished their meals! He ordered the Seafood Delight, which is a combination of shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and scallops in marinara sauce over linguine for $19.95. I understand that it is a large dish and has a lot of components to it, but if it's not almost ready, don't bring out the rest of the table's meals yet, keep the other dishes heated on warmers in the kitchen. The waitress said it would be about 4 more minutes. It took a lot longer than 4 minutes. It did not take the rest of the table only 4 minutes to finish their meals. We were not speed-eating. We were chatting and enjoying our meals at a decent pace. PLUS, the waitress brought extra bread to the table when we still had plenty of bread, and there was clearly no more space for bread, except in front of my boyfriend, where his actual entree belonged. We were utterly confused. None of us had requested more bread. It was as if the waitress thought it would make things better if she brought more bread instead of the entree. We ended up having to wait on my boyfriend.  In terms of the other food, the Fried Calamari ($9.95) was chewy and the skin covering was pale and unappealing. It did not have the nice crisp to it that I was expecting. The Del Boscaiola (Parmesan cream sauce with prosciutto and peas for $11.25) was delicious. I chose Cappellini noodles. I enjoyed the sauce. There were far too many peas, but I didn't mind. The Seafood Delight should be shared. In terms of portion, it is too much for one person. I do like the shrimp and scallop. However, the presentation is sloppy.  Strike 4: I asked if they did anything special for birthdays. The waitress said the staff would sing \"Happy Birthday\" and give us a slice of Tiramisu. Fantastic. Except the staff failed to communicate again. It was supposed to be a surprise for my boyfriend. However, one staff member started approaching us and happily singing \"Happy Birthday.\" Then, he stopped abruptly when he realized that nobody else was following suit. So much for a surprise. The rest of the staff then awkwardly tried to restart the singing and brought out the Tiramisu. Of course, the Tiramisu didn't even have a candle on it. Great. Well, at least the Tiramisu tasted great."}
{"text":"Great Italian food here in Gastonia, NC!  The food was fresh, arrived hot and full of flavor.  The restaurant has a nice \"family atmosphere\" and the service was very good when we arrived on a Friday evening.  While Olive Garden is great, I think the food at Portofino's is slightly better and certainly reasonably priced with large portions!  I highly recommend this restaurant for those who are searching for great Italian food in the Gastonia area."}
{"text":"Rushed from the beginning, didn't even get to sit down before we were asked what we wanted to drink. We ordered waters while we were deciding what drinks we wanted. When the waitress returned  with our waters she did not come back for awhile after that. When she returned over 10 minutes later she apologized and said she didn't realize we were her table and that she had been outside? We asked about the wine menu and the she responded with \"oh I don't know anything about wine\" hmmm...you are a waitress at an Italian restaurant, and only offer a few beers and a huge selection of wine. After giving her our order she failed to ask me what kind of noodles I wanted, and if I wanted red or white sauce which it asked on the menu..leading me to believe she did not know the menu....or the wine! After our food was dropped off at the table the manager did come by and ask us if we needed anything. The food was okay, didn't need anything. Halfway through our meal the waitress dropped off our check that we didn't ask for, without asking if we wanted dessert or asking us if we were ready for our bill. She walked to the table twice and finally picked up the book which we had not put anything in yet because we were trying to finish our meals. She said \"oh you aren't ready yet\" and we asked her to give us just a second which she stood and waited AT THE TABLE waiting for us to pull out our money. We asked her for a minute. She walked away watching us through the window. She returned after we put money in the book. And did not return to thank us. My husband and I are both managers of restaurants...and this is a prime example of how you do not treat your tables. We will not be back to visit this establishment."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Portifino's several times.  Here and at the Charlotte location.  I really enjoy their food from the warm bread, the crisp salads, and the fantastic pizza, calzones, and entrees.  I've had their eggplant parm and my husband has had their veal (I forget what he ordered).    I went last weekend.  The service was good.  Our waiter seemed a little nervous so I think he might have been new and our friends who were with us tend to intimidate waiters.    My husband ordered a cannoli and it was great."}
{"text":"Service, each time I have been to this location, has left..... something to desire, to say the least.  Food is very good, but when you want a total experience, I'd have to say, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I so want this place to be really good as we have moved back to NC from the NE and a great casual Italian restaurant is worth more than a great steak restaurant.  Don't get me wrong this is good italian food not great.  A little more basil here, a touch of oregano there, a touch more garlic, pepper or salt even at the right time, coupled with a little less olive oil and this would warrant more stars"}
{"text":"Good food.   I go there 2 or 3 times a month high turn over in wait staff seems to lead to disorganization and bad service.  Update.  Service is much much better.  I see the same faces now and it definitely helps."}
{"text":"Back in town for the holiday and of course we came back to portifinos and had the veal marsal.  AMAZING!  The place was extremely busy and they still sat us at the table in a reasonable time frame.  love this place!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, actually the best in the region. They close early (9 pm) on weeknight a and are crowded on the weekends."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are new to the area and decided to check out Portofino's before we went to the movies at 10. We walked at 9:15 and to get a quick pizza before our movie and were turned away by the hostess, what looked like a bus boy and bus girl, because they said they close in 15 minutes. I understand that this location closes at 9:30, but never in my life have I been turned away from a restaurant. Having waited tables all through college, I would have been fired if I had turned away paying customers on a Friday night. If this was my restaurant, I would be furious. Needless to say, we will not be spending our money here in the future."}
{"text":"Portofino's has great pizza and pasta!  The pizza is a little greasy, but that's how I like it!  I would say it is the second best pizza in Gastonia behind Brixx.  I usually get the chicken fetticini with alfredo sauce and that is also great!  And if you get the chicken fetticini to go you also get a plate of salad and loaf of bread to go...with oil and vinegar.  Wonderful!  Yes, it is a small restaurant and can be easily missed but it is worth checking out.   The best Italian restaurant in Gastonia easily."}
{"text":"The food is great ! I got the fried calamari and the chicken Marsala. Best Italian food I've had in town. The service was good as well :)"}
{"text":"Closest thing to real Italian in the region? Please. Their pasta comes from a box and they charge $15 a plate. I would only go for pizza.   The grilled salmon salad was almost on point... the salmon was cooked perfectly, but the salad was a bit skimp- the waitress said so herself.  The best part is the paper placemats they sit down in front of you after you've already started reading the menu...they tabletops are glass, so it's not serving any purpose;  they must want the tacky Italian restaurant in franklin square look."}
{"text":"I have eaten twice now at here and had pizza both times. Excellent pizza with a great crust!  Both times I went simple with one topping... Reminded me of the pizza I enjoyed in Italy."}
{"text":"Service and food are excellent here, Presentation picture says it all and tasted  as good as it looked. Mediterraneo Calamari and mussels blended in a white cream sauce"}
{"text":"I was a regular customer of Portofino's in Gastonia, NC until the experience my wife and I had today (Friday - 09.03.10). We were running errands around town separately and agreed to meet at Portofino's at 5:30 PM for dinner. I was running late so she took a seat at a table. When I arrived she was coming out the door with a very distressed look on her face. She had sat at a table for 15 minutes without anyone greeting her or offering as much as a glass of water. I thought she may have been over-reacting so we went back in and again took a seat. Again the wait staff passed us by without offering a greeting. We left and went to the Open Kitchen in Charlotte and had a wonderful meal. By the way...my wife and I always tip at least 20% of our bill and we have been faithful customers at Portofino's. I could understand if the place had been busy but this afternoon only 1/4 of the tables were occupied.  As we were leaving one of the owners asked us why and I told him, but we didn't get any type of apology. Good riddance Portofino's. I can get greasy pizza and lousy service anywhere, and I will from now on."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get.  Their pizza is about as good as a frozen pizza from the supermarket.  I  make better pasta as home too.  Flavor is just bland.  Price too expensive."}
{"text":"The closet New York style pizza you can get!!!  Portion size of meals are good.  Price range is average."}
{"text":"Fairly mediocre. Not terrible, but not good enough to go back.  I started with a caesar salad. It was iceberg lettuce with some cheese on top. Dressing on the side. Tasted better than it looked.  Bread and butter came out. Bread was very good. Tasted fresh and was still warm. Kind of an artisan style bread. Thick crust, good texture and taste.  I had the chicken parmesan. The chicken was tender enough to cut with a fork. The sauce was very salty with little other flavor. The color was just as pictured. To me it's a little off. A good sauce is a little darker from the color of cooling with spices. The bland taste can't be covered up with salt despite their best efforts. Sauce is what makes an Italian restaurant and Portofinos comes up short.  Service was fair. It was a slow night so about one server per table. My glass only went empty once.   I didn't try the pizza. That may be what makes the restaurant popular."}
{"text":"Used to go to Portofino's with my Grandpa 10 years ago for the Stromboli. Moved back to the area and now have devoured the same cheese filled creation on multiple occasions. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Solid Italian dishes with a casual setting. You can dress up if you like but don't worry if you're in jeans and a t-shirt. Waitress was pleasant and helpful while we picked our food.  The favorite dish from our group was my Veal Portobello, the creamy Marsala sauce is excellent. Oh and the sweet tea was very good too. We will be back."}
{"text":"My sister, brother and I came to eat tonight and had the worst experience we have ever had there. We come in all the time and usually love the service and the food. Our server was completely ridiculous. It took her forever to greet us. We ordered an appetizer with our drinks and it never came. My brother's drink stayed empty almost the whole time. When we ordered our entree's we ordered salads to come out after the appetizer. Salads came out...still no app!!! Then my brother got his pizza...still no app!! We canceled the app nicely..it then came out (aggravating)! At that point we were just done! We asked to leave and the server told us she would get the manager. THE MANAGER NEVER CAME!!!! UNBELIEVABLE DISRESPECT!!! The server then returned to argue about why everything went wrong saying the pizza came put early because it is precooked. Well then sweet heart, it would have been possible to bring it out at any point huh?! Like with the rest of our food!! After asking her to please stop and just let us box up and get far away from that retched experience! (In different words of course). She continued to give attitude. What once was a family favorite has now hit the taboo list.   And i want to add on here that even after all that we left said server a tip she most definitely did NOT deserve! I want her to read this and know that! We left you a tip bc it's not about the money it was about the experience. I hope you dont take that lightly ever again."}
{"text":"Second time for lunch. Just as good as the first time. Had the clams for an appetizer. Wonderful. First time I had the calamari, it was the best I've ever had. First time I had linguini with white wine sauce. Absolutely fabulous. This time linguine with peas and prosciutto. It said it had a parmesan cream sauce but it came out pink. Not bad but I asked for the white cream sauce. The bread they give you is to die for. I can't wait to bring my husband here."}
{"text":"This place is THE BOMB...love the food, EXCELLENT pizza, just like up north in Philadelphia, I've been there numerous times, and go back frequently.  Try the seafood dishes,  pasta is tender, and waitstaff friendly."}
{"text":"I have been going to Portofino's for over a decade. Excellent food and they make the best of their small strip mall location. This place is PACKED on the weekends. I often order food to go and they package their pastas in foil containers that keep it hot all the way home. Love this place."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Tony, the chef, came up & asked what We liked & decided to create our own dish.  It was fabulous! We were passing through, but we will def be back!  Yummo!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to knock you down a peg, Portofino's, but I kinda have to.  You see, I come from the land of lasagna, the place of pasta, the grove of gnocchi (sorry, that one was a stretch).  No, not the old country, but a slice of it in Western PA.  Sunday dinner at Grandma's house was no joke.  We're serious about the sauce.    I have heard the pizza here is ah-mah-zing, but I wanted to try an old favorite - manicotti.  I haven't had it since the last time my mom made it, but I was highly disappointed.  The shells were so thick, it kind of ruined the experience for me.  The filling was good, and I really do like their sauce, but that shell just threw me off.  Not thin and airy like my mama's.  Also, I ordered a glass of vino and they served it to me in a glass that just came out of the dishwasher, so it was warm, which was kind of gross.  I hope I can go back and try the pizza, hopefully it will be a better experience, because I want to love P-fino's."}
{"text":"Had a very good experience here. Was not crowded at a group of 6 was sat quickly. The waiter was nice and explained the difference between a stromboli and a calzone.  All of the food we ordered came out quickly and just as we ordered.  No complaints from anyone about the taste, and the size was very good, bordering too much.  The left over's were good the next day.  Will definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd and last time I will eat here.  They advertise gluten free pasta but the wait staff have no idea what that is and I have had to ask multiple times because I felt they shrugged me off.  This time I got a penne pasta even though I was told that the only gluten free pasta was spaghetti.  When I got the bill it said whole wheat.  The server said they didn't have a gluten free button...  Its my last trip and I hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Going here will remind you of three well known films, The Godfather? No, Lady and the Tramp?  No, more like The Sandlot, Stand by Me and The Fly.  Why you ask? Cause their food will remind you of what these three films have in common, projectile vomits scenes, this used to be the best place to get Italian food, not anymore."}
{"text":"Don't care for the pizza, but the pasta dishes are fine.  They have problems with consistency."}
{"text":"Yes I know it's an Italian restaurant but the owner and I have an understanding. My pizza is always perfect in my pasta is cooked Freshly. That is the key to good Italian food. Ask the chef \"do you have time to make my pasta fresh\"? If the answer is no eat the pizza.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Our server was slow and didn't seem very happy about working. We came in on a Saturday evening around 6:30-7. It wasn't slow, but they weren't busy either. The calamari was tough and rubbery. I had chicken parm and it tasted like it bulk packaged and frozen. Some of the breading was still white/yellow. Very off putting. Also it was pretty disappointing when the server sat my plate down,  there was a lot of water on the plate. I guess from where they didn't let the pasta drain fully before plating it. She sat the plate down and told my wife her pizza would be right out. About 5 mins after that she came back and said the chef burnt the pizza and he was making her a new one. Well that took another 15+ mins. I was completely done eating by time her pizza came out. The pizza was good, but nothing to really get excited for. If they don't change their quality control, get ready to add this restaurant to the closed in Gastonia list."}
{"text":"Since moving to Gaston County it has been hard to find \"good\" pizza. This is the closest to NY style that we have found that has good flavor at a decent price. Though a little on the high side, the price is reasonable and there was a sign on the door for a large special on Tuesdays. We got a large, half cheese and half pepperoni + bacon and it was $17.95, so I'd be interested in a special. Plenty of parking as this is in the big shopping center with Books A Million, Kohls, Gander Outdoors, etc. I find it ironic that Cici's is only two doors over and have NO idea why anyone would eat that when this is practically next-door."}
{"text":"Great Italian food & Friendly staff. Loved the aromas!!!  Bread made there was great. Pizzas were in great demand too."}
{"text":"Went to the Gastonia location. The food is average, nothing spectacular about the dressing."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here about 6 months ago and the experience was terrible. At that time we were told that they didn't pay their power bill (because they didn't get a bill?) so they were running on backup generators. Honestly, we should have just left then. The food was terrible.  We went in again tonight because we were in a pinch and just wanted some pizza. The bread they bring you before the meal was delicious. We ordered a meat lovers pizza.   When our server brought the pizza she dropped off the pizza and then left without asked/refilling either of drinks (which were both empty). I find it hard to excuse that. It took my wife getting up (about 10 minutes later) to ask the manager at the counter for refills.   The pizza was terrible. The crust was so thin that it couldn't hold up the toppings and was so soaked with grease that it was literally dripping."}
{"text":"Let's get the only negative part out of the way first:  I made a reservation for a party of 9 the day before we were to visit, then called the day of our meal and reconfirmed it.  When we arrived (15 minutes early), not only was there no table available for us, six parties were seated ahead of us.  We did not get our table for 45 minutes, by which time the kids were restless, the adults were starving and I was mortally embarrassed to have a guest from out of town having to stand and wait, since none of my fellow Gastonians were gentleman enough to offer a seat to an older lady.  *whew* By now you're wondering, \"After he wrote that, how in Zeus' name is he giving this place four stars?\"  It's simple:  From Brian, our incredibly professional and efficient server, to the meal itself, everything was top-notch.  I haven't had fried calamari this good since the Atlantic City boardwalk.  Even the cheese sticks, normally a throw-off item put on the menu to keep the kids quiet, were excellent.  My Veal Saltimbocca was cooked perfectly, and the angel-hair pasta was a perfect compliment.  My sons split a pepperoni pizza, and I couldn't resist swiping a piece.  Awesome, indeed!  Other notables at the table were the Quatro Formaggio and the Veal Parmesan.  Altogether excellent, and completely redeemed the initial irritation!  Oh, and for my fellow gin and tonic drinkers: Be sure you ask to have yours made with Bombay Sapphire.  It's a couple of bucks more, but WORTH it.  Wow."}
{"text":"I've been back several times and am bumping my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  This place is just awesome.  Excellent pizza and I've heard reports from friends that the pasta is amazing as well."}
