{"text":"3.5 stars. The offerings are pretty standard here, nothing that you can't find anywhere else. I tried the seafood pancake and the japchae. Prices are average with most mains being $13 or around that price. Japchae ($11, the cheapest main dish) was good, a bit subtle in flavor compared to some other ones I've tried. It had some tasty bulgogi beef and veggies. The glass noodles had good consistency. Portion size was fine. They have a BBQ meat section which looks enticing.

I also tried the seafood pancake ($15). Although it is $2-$3 more expensive than most other places, it's huge (easily shareable with 3-4 people) and contained a good number of pieces of squid and whole shrimps. The shrimps they use in particular are larger than I've seen at other restaurants. It was bit oily for my tastes but it had crispy parts. It had carrots, onions and green onions inside. Overall, I was quite satisfied with it. It comes with a simple sweet soy sauce for dipping.

The meal came with 3 banchan. Kimchi was one of them and surprisingly the other two were meats, one beef and the other sausage. Kimchi was good, the others were fine but very salty, perhaps they used some fermented sauce or preparation process. Tea was also provided. I think it had a rice flavor to it.

There are a decent number of tables mostly for seating 4 people. The location is close to the St. Mathieu exit of Peel metro (so you don't have to walk in the cold winter too long to get there). I'd certainly come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for a great Korean food fix. Location is very easily to find (right next to the metro) place is small and cozy and super clean. I love their seafood pancake because it's not too eggy and there's lots of yummy fillings and the stir fry rice cake is quite tasty."}
{"text":"This place is brand new so we decided to go check it out since my boyfriend and I are a big fan of korean food. The place was very clean and had cute decorations. Staff was so friendly, I believe they're a family business. The menu is quite big (forgot to take photos of menu :/) so many dishes for a very decent price(from 4$ appetizers to 15$ dishes) It's cool how this store gives you 5 different side dishes for free, including kimchi, some kind of omelette, fish cakes, sweet potato and i believe the last one was pickled radish(?). We got fried vegetarian dumplings and this sweet rice cake (love this one!) to start off. Food was delicious and so flavourful, the size of dish was pretty big as well and was worth paying for, I got some kind of bulgogi soup that had of course bulgogi (beef) with vegetables (carrots, mushrooms,etc) and i believe sweet potato noodles (like the ones they use for japchae), and it also came with a side of rice. At the end, staff offered us ice cream which was very nice of them! Love this place and will definitely be back for some more food!"}
