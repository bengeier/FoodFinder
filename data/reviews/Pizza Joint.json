{"text":"Kind of ruin my Saturday night. People went on break. They forgot my order. Girl promise it was next. She went on break and my order was forgotten again!! Stood there for 25 minutes! Never again will i go to that pizza place! 

P.s.Manager attempted to fix it by offering me a free slice!! I was so upset, i refuse! Yeah! Let me share a slice with the other 4 people waiting for the pizza!!"}
{"text":"This place never has any pizza! They're always out!! If you want pizza go to the food court!"}
{"text":"Well, the only reason I even considered this lame-looking pizza place was because I was starving& prepping for a night of drinking. Bad choice. 

The line was only about 8 people long API figured it would be quick, ended up waiting for 45 minutes. Figured it might be pretty good pizza for this long of a wait. 

Unfortunately I was disappointed. WAY too greasy, too much crust, burnt cheese on the end. Could only stomach one slice :( oh well, I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"We ordered a mushroom pizza and we had a terrible experience. When we waited over an hour we reminded them about our order. The cooks and cashier kind of had a fight with each other. The pizza we received had dough that was undercooked and was lopsided. We were told we would get a refund on my debit card and even got a receipt for the refund. It has been a week and the refund did not go through. No customer should spend an hour and a half waiting for their order to be cooked and end up with an uncooked pizza."}
{"text":"Convenient, cheap, tasty and reasonable. For $24.99 you get a large pizza, wings, breadsticks and beverages. A slice will run you $5-$7 and is actually two big slices. For $8 you get a slice and a beer (full bottles of Heineken, etc). The place is a bit disorganized, but I can overlook that. Thin crust yumminess. Reminds me of Sbarro pizza."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed this pizza place, conveniently located in Flamingo. Wouldn't go out of my way for it, but its awesomely convenient at the end of the night when staying in Flamingo. If you are getting the slice, make sure to check out whats available and what looks freshest before ordering. A \"slice\" is really a quarter of a pizza and they will cut in half when serving it, so if you are just wanting a quick small bit its good to share. Its a thicker type crust pizza which some have noted they don't like, but if you do its quite soft and delicious. pretty cheap at around $6 for a slice."}
{"text":"Taste: 2.5 stars
Not horrible, but definitely not delicious. It's decent for the price and convenience if you're staying at the Flamingo or just passing through the casino.

Value: 4.5 stars
The size of a single slice is ginormous! It's literally a quarter of an entire pizza. It's humongous! It was also super quick (as expected)."}
{"text":"Sorta hits the spot, but not really.

I would really only go to this place if I was staying at the Flamingo hotel and I was desperate for food (either due to laziness or time constraints).  And upon both of those circumstances (it was 1 AM and we were deathly lazy) did we pop into this Pizza Joint.

At something like $5 a slice or $18 for the whole pizza, we opted for the whole for cost efficiency.  There was only one worker and it took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out, post-ordering!

We take it back to our room and munch on the soggy slices with tough crusts.  I think we each ate one piece before giving up on the dream.  However, the dream began to take a small form of life when we discovered that we had cold pizza upon waking up with a late-morning Vegas hangover.  I think that cold pizza hit the spot more that morning than it did the night before, piping hot.

Well, whatever.  Pizza is still pizza, I suppose."}
{"text":"Large pizza slizes and the prices are pretty fair. The quality on the other hand is not that great. The doe I feel like is the biggest problem with this pizza. It doesnt taste right, very bland. The pizza was also extremely greasy. When i eat 2 large slices I just felt sick because of the amount of grease i consumed. Make sure you blot some of it off."}
{"text":"I really don't eat three meals while vacationing in Las Vegas but the lack of lunch and late dinner had me stopping by this place for pizza.  Aside from trying to watch my carbs...I was kind of craving some carbs so I stopped here after browsing the fast food places in the Flamingo after the pool before heading back up to my room.  I got the $9 slice of pizza and beer special...I ordered the sausage pizza and what appears to be one HUGE slice is really like three small slices.  It's a great deal though... the pizza was pretty tasty and both for under $10 is a good deal in Vegas.  From Chicago, I can get a little picky when it comes to quality of pizza...this place wasn't bad at all.

You can also get whole pizzas here as well which is an excellent deal.  I stayed in the Flamingo so during peak hours the line can get pretty long, but all and all a nice option to have if you're looking for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Yum this pizza was so good!! Not brick oven pizza but a fire oven and at $15 for a large two topping pizza it's a bargain on the strip and some good pizza! However they do charge 50 cents for a glass of water, a little annoying."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few times while visiting Las Vegas, and staying at the Flamingo. The pizza was okay-tasting, but was luke warm when served. Also, they have a sign posting $5.99 special for a slice of pizza and a soda (seemed to be a 16-oz cup), but when ordering, the rude girl with curly brown hair, tells me you can only get a soda deal with a one-topping pizza slice, after I requested the slice with multiple meats.. I was okay with that, but she needs a lesson in customer service. For the cheap price, it was good, but it would have been way better if the pizza was served hot. The crust tasted pretty good too, freshly made and was thin; eaten New York style. Not bad, since much of the food in Vegas can be pricey, if you visit certain places."}
{"text":"Not in love with THIS place. The counter person was constantly running back and forth, seemingly overwhelmed. The pizza LOOKED good, but it tasted bland and lifeless. The crust was better than the rest of the pizza. Even a topping and extra grated cheese on top couldn't save it..."}
{"text":"Bonannos was closed (along with the rest of the food court in The Flamingo, for constructon) so we tried this place across from the flamingo habitat. Ordered a whole pepperoni pie, took no more than 10 minutes, came out hot, fresh and pretty good. Well priced,  speedy, served beer and was open during a buzzed pizza craving at 7AM"}
{"text":"After a long night of clubbing, I stayed over at my friend's hotel room at the Flamingo. I was tired and not completely sober so I spent the night. My friend picked up a large cheese pizza from this place since it was next to their room elevator. I was hungry so I had one slice. It was the most bland, boring, tasteless, & pathetic pizza I've ever had in Vegas. The crust is two inches long and there's hardly any sauce. I could only eat one slice and practically had to force myself to eat it. The slices are pretty big. You can get better pizza from the frozen section of any market. I would only eat this if I was desperate. There are too many good pizza joints in Vegas. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Average pizza but at a good price. For the price you pay you do get a lot. They are always busy so the pies are fresh. I always stop here when I'm at Flamingo to get my pizza fix. Not the best in town but better than most others."}
{"text":"If I can give zero star for this review I would. Not only did I have to wait in line for over 15 minutes to order my pizza but they told me the wait would be about 25 minutes. After waiting for 30 minutes I walked up to the front to ask what's taking so long, only to have them say their \"printer is down\" aka pizza didn't even get made yet. The workers were slacking off and smiling at us like we were idiots which made me feel even more pist off. Obviously management isn't doing their job. Don't come here unless you want to waste almost an hour of your time. There's a food court right down the hall or there's always delivery pizza. If I was the owner I would definitely train my employees better."}
{"text":"Sooooo good and fresh if you buy the whole pizza probably the best pizza I have ever had and its huge each slice could easily be 2 slices"}
{"text":"This was one of the first surprises that I received at the Flamingo hotel & casino. Upon arriving late and making your way through the casino and past all of the carnival barkers wanting to sell you a timeshare, the Pizza Joint was a welcome sight to get some form of decent food in my system prior to passing out. Not only that, the quantity size of the pizza for the price was unexpected. 

Pizza usually starts at $4.50 for one topping. You think that you are getting one slice, right? In actually, you are getting two slices, which I thought was pretty cool considering that most places in a casino resort are expensive. I honestly thought that I had someone else's order when the lady called me up to receive my orders, which looked like double portions. With her big Cheshire cat grin, she assured me that the orders were indeed mine. 

The Pizza Joint has several tables directly across from it, unless you want to sit at the bar area. While at the tables, you can observe the natural wildlife that is part of the Flamingo's outdoor resort area. The pizza itself is typical New York style crust and cheese, yet for $4.50? I'm not complaining. In addition, the venue serves breakfast pizza and other assortments in the morning if you want something quick."}
{"text":"This is not the best pizza place that I've had here in Vegas, but when it's 3AM and you're craving for Pizza, it'll do. I wasn't staying here in the hotel, so it was kind of a walk from the parking structure. This place was crowded as there were many people dressed up; maybe coming from a bar, show or nightclub? A slice cost $5, and a whole pie was $20. I was with my sister so it was worth it to get a whole pizza. You have to eat this pizza fresh though, like when they give it to you. I had a slice only because I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel  and I'm glad I did. While hot, it was good. I planned on eating another slice or two when I got to my room, but by the time I got there the pizza was cold. Usually, pizza made not even half an hour ago would still be good. This pizza seemed to have dried up though and the cheese and pepperoni wasn't fresh anymore. I took a bite of the pizza and the oil piled under the cheese dripped down my shirt. Unless it's 3AM and there's no other pizza place to go, unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see the reviews for this pizza place to be as low as they were. We've been eating at The Pizza Joint for years and we think their pizza is delicious. I agree the service isn't always fast and it isn't the cheapest place in town, but if you order a freshly made pizza, it's really good and we have never been disappointed in the quality of the food. It really depends on what's important to you, the food, the service, or the price. For us, it's all about the pizza; and this is our go to pizza joint when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Recently raised prices. They charge for a vegie slice or whole as a 3 topping pizza. What a rip off. Many rude cashiers. They system of taking order and cashier getting pizza is slow. They have changed quality and 1/4 of pizza has no cheese. Management (food director) impossible to contact. 
I ordered half mushroom half pepperoni was charged for 2 items but received no more than regular portion on each side. Wow."}
{"text":"PROS AND CONS: VEGAS IS FULL OF BOTH  :)

Pizza Joint Pros:
Open late
The line moves fast
The slices are large
They have food other than pizza
Specials include pizza and beer ($8.50) or pizza and soda ($7.00)
Several nearby tables for seating

Pizza Joint Cons:
Expensive
The food itself is just average
Ranch cost extra and is in a package
It took a while to get your slices (sometimes)
They were at of pepperoni one time that we stopped by"}
{"text":"If your room at the Flamingo is near the right elevator, this place deserves two stars because it's convenient.  If your room is not near the elevators, steer clear!

This place closes at 11pm, but they ran out of pizza at 10:50pm so they turned away the rest of the customers in line and shut down early.  After much confusion regarding the ordering process and where the line was, I managed to get a single slice of meat lover's pizza for $4.59.  

Pizza was so-so."}
{"text":"Possibly the best buy food-wise in Las Vegas. This place is in back of Flamingo, on the walkway connecting the casino to the Linq and the adjacent shops, and if you're craving decent pizza at a price that won't break the bank, it's definitely worth the trip. For $12, you get two gigantic slices of pizza (about four slices elsewhere) and a drink. The pizza itself, while not fantastic, is far from bad, and again, you can't beat the price point."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in ALL OF VEGAS. Hands down.  Great sauce to cheese ratio. Reminds me of real pizza and not that chain garbage. 1 slice is all you need."}
{"text":"Ok pizza for late night craving. Price is nice. Taste ok. But they use a lot of dough."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast now since the breakfast place is now closed (sad face), the California Breakfast Burrito was super yummy, I had it twice.  They make the sandwiches and burritos to order so it was easy for my friend to get it without cheese.  

I did't have any pizza this trip but they sure do sell it, they are like 1/2 pizza size portions.

This was a highlight to a lackluster stay here this weekend."}
{"text":"After walking past this pizza all weekend, we finally decided to give it a try before heading out.  The only complaint is that there isn't much seating.  However, the pizza was delicious and exactly what we were craving and hoping for...yum!!"}
{"text":"Woke up around midnight and still sobering up from day drinking.......Just wanted to get some pizza to take upstairs and go back to sleep. 
The line wasn't that long, but goddamn, there was obviously an idiot at the counter. I didn't know which side though, but I did know that I could'a taken a cab to Cosmo, got a few slices from Secret Pizza, and been back in my room in the amount of time it took for me to put in my order. Turns out the idiot was a customer that was having a difficult time ordering from their small list of options, but they should've pulled someone else up front to keep the line moving. 
The drunk in me ended up ordering two slices ($4.75 each) and a salad ($9.99).........
Holy s**t bro, these slices are huge! I liked the Sausage (3 1/2 stars) better than the Pepperoni (3 stars), but both of them needed to spend a few more minutes in the oven because the crust wasn't fully cooked.

The Chicken Caesar Salad (3 stars) was a waste though. $10 for a salad that's been sitting around long enough for the croutons to be soft and almost soggy. It wasn't really bad, but wasn't worth the price of 2 slices.

{"text":"Being in Vegas you know that you are going to have to spend a lot of money, especially on food.  The wife and I were staying at the Flamingo, after checking in we were walking to our room and guess what caught my eye.

PIZZA, and YES it was pizza by the slice.  AND it was only 4.95.  AND it was a HUGE SLICE, now when I say HUGE it was a quarter of a large pizza.

The pizza was good, I ordered a pepperoni and I had enough to cut it down the middle split it with my wife.  

Now I didn't give this five stars because of two different reasons.  When you buy a soda it is a fountain soda and you don't get any refills and its pretty small.  The second reason is I usually like to eat my pizza with a little ranch dipping sauce and they charged me for it.  Maybe I'm spoiled but I hate getting charged for ranch.  

Anyways I really enjoyed the pizza and I will be back next time I go to the Flamingo,"}
{"text":"I called the casino to see if they were open and the operator said yes. I got there and they were \"closing for cleaning\" but there were still people in line. big waste of time."}
{"text":"You guys, no way. There is no way a little pizza place inside the Flamingo is supposed to taste as good as any of the other awesome places in our fair city. Yet here I am, about to write a solid 4-star review of this little joint. 

First, some background: I had just gotten off the High Roller and spent some time at the Polaroid Foto Bar. It was too late to hit up Guy Fieri's place, so we decided to drive back home and maybe hit up a Denny's along the way but then this place appeared. The line was pretty along, but it was moving fairly quickly as they had a ton of pizzas in the oven moving along pretty good. 

Now, on to the good stuff. I ordered to pizza and soda combos, which came out to about $22 (strip prices!). My friend ordered a pepperoni and I ordered the Hawaiian, which were served to us in like 2 minutes. Man, the pizzas were absolutely perfect. The cheese and both pizzas were perfectly melty and stretchy and gooey and, at least on my pizza, it was seasoned perfectly. I thought the crust was really good for being a basic crust (not seasoned like other places) and perfectly chewy. As for the amount of food you get, it's a bigger serving. They're more like Sbarro slices than Domino's slices. 

All in all, it was a really good pizza. Like I'd go back for more if it weren't on the strip. I guess you might be wondering then why this place is only getting four stars from me and not five? I'll tell you: I've only been there once. I now feel reluctant to give a place a perfect score if I've only been there once because I cannot speak to the consistency of their product or service. But believe you me... I will go back and I will update this review."}
{"text":"Best Pizza you can get at the Flamingo!! 

This is by far better pizza than Bonanno's in the food court and a way better value, be sure to tell them that you want one slice, it literally is about 1/4 of a pizza! we ate here twice on our last visit, my friends could eat here every night!   

This is only counter service but they do have some tables right across from it, you could also take it outside but now the only place you can sit around outside is the Patio Bar, just go  through the Habitat. 

I don't think they call this the Pizza Joint anymore??? i was just there last week it seems like they changed it to \"On The Go\"?  (at least i didn't see the pizza joint sign - could have been a beer side effect though!)"}
{"text":"+: a ton of food cheap to settle drunk tummies, conveniently on the way to our room and fast!

-: just not the best pizza in the world"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by $5 a slice they give you 2 slices! Pizza was on point! Bomb
But prior to ordering I had ordered a large soda and the lady said \"we have a special on the small\" so I said sure. After eating one huge slice of pizza I finish my drink and I go back to the lady and ask for a REFILL and she says \"we don't do refills\" I was like wtf? Why would someone offer you a smaller drink  when there's no refills? #ThanksLady I would've given this place a 5 star"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst foods we ate in Las Vegas. We were so hungry after the Motown show in Planet Hollywood. We were looking for a quick fix when our cousins called us from Flamingo and told us about the The Pizza Joint. So, we drove few Las Vegas blocks on the strip to Flamingo. When we arrived, we ordered immediately a large pizza,  an order of wings and some drinks. $51 of bad soggy pizza and tasteless wings. Pwe!! Supermarket pizza is much better. Even the girls that are taking the orders were not friendly at all. We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Okay, my 4 stars review of the new Pizza Joint at the Flamingo is not really because they have 4 star pizza.  The pizza is between 2-3 stars, but what they do have is convenience and inexpensive prices.  For less than $8, you can get a slice of pizza and a beer.  Three slices of pizza makes a large pizza, so the pieces are huge.  I'll definitely be back here on late nights when I'm headed back to the room after a long night and don't want to spend a small fortune at Johnny Rockets in the food court.  Food-3 stars, Value-5 stars, ambiance-practically none, convenience-5 stars, service-4 stars (they are friendly and helpful)."}
{"text":"I'll keep this brief: Pizza does not taste fresh, over a one-inch crust, and it tastes horrible the next day. I suppose it doesn't help that the Flamingo hotel in which the Pizza Joint resides in doesn't have fridges in their room. (Go figure.) If you're dying of starvation, sure, get a slice."}
{"text":"My friend loves Pizza Joint so much she ate there every single night on her last 4 day stay, haha! Needless to say when I stumbled back to The Flamingo at some god forsaken hour like 6:30 am, it was time for me to get some pizza myself. They were JUST opening (thank god), so I enjoyed a doughnut while I waited and ordered a \"slice\" of sausage pizza. I say \"slice\" because they actually serve you TWO ENORMOUS pieces of pizza. I f-cking loved the crust. Seriously, it was delicious. I would eat there again. And again. It's good pizza. 

...even if you're sober. :)"}
{"text":"This review comes a few months too late, but after reviewing my drafts and realizing I never posted - its long over due but needed!

Let me begin by saying I will NEVER EVER come here again! Terrible, terrible service is an extreme understatement. Emilio, the awesome (yes, I'm being sarcastic) pizza chef felt very empowered the evening we were there and demonstrated that by shoving a pizza in my cousin's face after she questioned why it was taking 35 minutes for a pizza and seeing countless people who came after her walk away with their orders. He was confrontational after that and rambled on and on for another 5 minutes before he tossed a pizza in a box and literally rimmed it in her face, mind you she caught this on camera. 

What followed was even more unbelievable. After a manager was summoned to \"fix\" the problem, we waited for 30 minutes, gave a thorough explanation of the events to this \"manager\" when he arrived - all while he retorted with very sarcastic comebacks, then he responded by saying there was nothing he could do or would do because this was the \"only pizza chef\" he had and wasn't about to lose him. Unbelieveable!!  Both the managers that responded to the complaint were RUDE and I could not believe the way they handled things, especially considering my friend attempted to play the video back and they refused to acknowledge what was clearly documented.

Because the management refused to do anything, she proceeded to file an incident report with security. It was terrible and the lack of professionalism altogether may have been enough to keep me away from the Flamingo all together. All these months later, I'm still in disbelief. I sure hope F & B stepped up their game and got rid of those 2 clowns!!"}
