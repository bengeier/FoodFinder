{"text":"I have been twice, each time for a chili dog to go.  It's an easy order, but the first time it took almost ten minutes, despite few customers, and the second time about half as long.  Both times an employee asked what I was waiting for, and only then did they find my order.  I was not the only person that waited, on each occasion, for an inordinate amount of time for an order.

The first time a manager felt bad about how long I had been standing there and \"comped\" me some fries, which I threw away because they were soggy and just gross.  The second time, despite ordering it to go, the chili dog came in a basket to eat \"in\".    

The chili dog had onions on it (nobody asked if I wanted onions) and the cashier was effectively hidden behind a stack of styrofoam cups. The chili dog was slightly better than a 7/11 product, but at almost triple the price and with a long wait.  Another customer had a gyro, which looked appetizing, but I am not sure I will be back to try it.    

I was hoping for someplace where I could grab something to bring back to the office but it doesn't appear that this is the place.  Huge space, with a small crowd (five or six employees or more, and approximately ten or fifteen guests).  Until they improve how fast the food gets out, the crowd will dwindle even more."}
{"text":"A group of us ate lunch there today, January 3
I ordered the classic burger and it had so much salt I couldn't eat it.
Most of us had the same problem.
To bad, as it is close to our homes, and we thought it would be somewhere
We would return to --NOT SO
We told the waitress but no one ever came out from the kitchen to address our concern.
I can't speak, about the other food that was ordered, by us just the Hamburg."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here and I was very disappointed. I threw my burger in the trash after two bites! We definitely won't be back! Burger was nothing different than what you get at McDonalds and the fries are way overpriced for the portion you receive and not fresh tasting. Pretty sure they won't be open for long, especially when you've got 5 Guys and In-N-Out burger nearby."}
{"text":"Hard to locate in their shopping center but the burgers are the best !!! Fresh.   Lived here two years never new this place was here. I'll be back"}
{"text":"This could possibly be my favorite burger in Goodyear!  Each visit has been great.

The servers are pleasant and attentive; the place is clean which makes for an enjoyable time.  

Their menu is fun and not the same old thing as everyone else's.

We posted a couple pictures so be sure to check them out.  

We even were given a couple coupons to give to friends.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Found this place on the Eat24 app and ordered the classic burger, the bleu cheese burger, potato skins and onion straws. The burgers were great, next time I will go there in person so they are hot & fresh"}
{"text":"Great Burgers, Gourmet for Locals! Must go back to try other Burgers and Sandwiches. The Poutin is a Must Have. The Beef and Style is Las Vegas Strip Quality. The staff (owners)    are very hospitable. New establishment of 4 months, the only thing to improve upon is the decor. Will be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best burger spots, hands down! If it's your first time, I would definitely recommend the \"Smokehouse Bleu Bacon Burger\". The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Good size meals, hot fries, good service. Got the Bruwburger and was a little too much for me; a ton of toppings. The green chili was perfect. We will most likely be back."}
{"text":"Went to the Burger Joint tonight and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger and fries with a sundae for dessert. The burger was very good but a little heavy on BBQ sauce. The fries were ok but no my favorite. The sundae was also good and the service was excellent. Definately will be back and nice to find a good burger place that isn't a chain."}
{"text":"Our first time at burger joint.  The burgers, the cauliflower wings with the humus sauce, truffles fries were all very good.  The burgers were juicy and cooked perfectly.  The price is reasonable and food quality is exceptional.  The service was good too.  It's better than bachi burger.  We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Just ate the burger joint for the first time with my family.Omg this place rocks! Fries are great the burgers are delicious. I ordered the bbq bacon chesse burger. Meat was delicious. This place carries food for children also my daughter enjoyed her regular cheeseburger and loved it. Staff is great and definitely a place to go back and enjoy again."}
{"text":"Great atomosphere and a very kind waitress. Fantastic tasty burgers and great tater tots. The only downside was that the truffle fries were too salty."}
{"text":"Came with my older brother to eat after the gym. Friendly staff And met the owner who is also a very nice guy! 10/10 will come back."}
{"text":"I ate the hot dogs... Really not good at all... Plus soggy French fries... Sweetened iced tea in the unsweetened dispenser..."}
{"text":"Its okay. Burgers are thin. Dont care for potato buns which fill you up faster. Pulled pork is good. Fries and shakes r good. Pretty working girls."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today staff was very nice but the food was horrible.  Had a philly cheesesteak and it was so bland it wasn't funny.  Canned mushrooms were used and did not compliment the sandwich."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends, and we ALL felt the burgers were way too salty, seemed like the beef was over-salted itself. I ordered my burger rare, it came in well done. Had the truffle fries, they were good, but again, over salted. Saltiness aside, everyone agreed the burgers would probably have been really good, but the salt masked what the meat may have tasted like, I can't say that I noticed the grass-fed difference."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and sides. Had the bacon burger with avocado. Poutine fries were great!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I venture out on Friday's to eat at various restaurants downtown.  My burger did taste good; although I ordered the special and my burger was HALF the size of my co-workers, so not a real savings;  $7.99 v $11.99.   Smaller price, smaller burger.    One of the ladies in our group dubbed this Burger Joint, \"One and done.\"  I have to agree,  it's just ok.  I wasn't wowed.   There are just as good if not better places downtown to grab a burger  AND less expensive,i.e.  Coney Island, just 3 doors east on the same street.  Anyway, maybe the after bar crowd will help keep this place alive.  I'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Closed as of 9/25/15. It's really too bad that this particular building can't seem to get a restaurant that will stay open. I thought this one would be here for a long time. It's so sad to see any business close here in Goodyear. We need more and better restaurants. I'd like to see more than just fast food, pizza, and burger joints."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place and decided to give it a try. The menu is pretty basic, with lots of choices and options. Fairly inexpensive for the amount of food you get. I tried the bacon burger. Tasty, but nothing to write home about. The fries were plentiful and crispy. The TV on the wall did not get local channels, which seemed odd. Bathroom had the urinal next to the door, facing the hallway, so make sure you lock the door."}
{"text":"This might be the best burger in town. I get the certified organic grass-fed beef from Bartels Farms in Oregon, easily a half-pound of juicy perfectly-cooked goodness. It's a meal on a bun, even better with avocado slices. This is not your traditional burger, but more and more I'm finding myself craving it. Karen, my server, is friendly and attentive, but not overly so, which is a good thing. One time they put too much sauce on it, turning the bun into a gloppy mess, and she quickly whisked it away and brought me a whole new one . . . not just a new bun, but a whole new burger, even though I'd taken a couple of bites. These guys takes their burgers seriously and so do I. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Goodyear has the best burger factory in town!! I just order a Az farmers and that Burger was slamming. Good customer service!! Great Cook!! Amazing place with juicy burgers"}
{"text":"Fantastic, juicy burger, perfectly soft artisan bun, topped with all the options I wanted. Bacon, carmelized onions, crispy onions strings, jalapeño ketchup. Wow!!  If that wasn't enough, the homemade tater tots the size of marshmallows complemented perfectly. Hubby loved the potato skins and his burger topped with an egg, bacon & cheese. This one is on the again list for sure!!!  Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this place. They put all their effort into making great food."}
{"text":"Wow, so good! The place is very new and they are still decorating. There are two tv's and they serve beer too. The service was very good, we were greeted by a cute girl ( Azuree) with a big smile, we actually felt as though she was glad too see us. The food is great. We ordered a burger each and an order of truffle fries, yum! The burgers are unbelievable, you can actually taste the meat! The burgers were both perfectly cooked and seasoned. Everything ( lettuce, onions, tomato etc) is fresh and the homemade ketchup is wonderful. The truffle fries were also very good, golden brown and an ample serving for two people to split. Some reviews have mentioned that this place is a \"bit pricey\" ... I'll just say you pay for what you get and the quality here is definitely worth a couple extra dollars. We will for sure return to the Burger Joint!"}
{"text":"Been there several times now, trying different things off of the menu.  Everything I've tried is quite tasty.  Staff is very polite and helpful.  A pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"The only issue I have with this place was that the food was soooo good I ate way too much! Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"All around great burgers. Compared to big restaurant chains, I would pick Burger Joint hands down any day.  

Staff is friendly and atmosphere is perfect.  Nothing obnoxious, just great food, friendly people, and easing going environment."}
{"text":"The burger was okay at best!
The fires were over salted and soggy
It was loud and very hot I'm thinking because there is no wall between the grill and the seating area."}
{"text":"Defiantly no where near an authentic Chicago dog. Grilled bun and jumbo dog cut in half. Won't be having another

Fries were good. Next time I'll try Italian bee and burger and see if those can save the place."}
{"text":"The gentleman that took our order was very nice but it was pretty much downhill from there. We had a party of 5 and it took about 35 minutes to get our order. Our order was incorrect, we were missing my sons hotdog and we had to wait an additional 15 minutes to get it.  The rest of our sandwiches seemed to be missing some of the toppings that we ordered but we didn't send them back because we couldn't really wait any longer. The burgers were ok, but not worth the money. 5 Guys is much better and quicker."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service and good food.  We ordered animal fries and really liked them."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries were good. Very tasty with the right amount of dressing and sauces. But the grilled cheese we ordered for our youngest was severely lacking in efforts and taste. An un-grilled burger bun with a couple  of slices of cheese causally thrown in between the bread. It was almost as soon as you ordered off menu they didn't care as much"}
{"text":"I am so sad that this place closed.  Does anyone know why?  The food was top notch and the customer service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Good food but it upset my stomach and I got more bread than anything. The place is less than professional, while we were eating some of the cooks friends came in went to the kitchen and started.talking to him.... I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Food is good. The issue that I have with this place is that when you call in an order they require that you give them a credit card number over the phone or they will not complete your order. It's a burger place not a hotel. This policy is completely ridiculous, and yes they are willing to lose customers over it. Like I said, food is good, nothing spectacular, but management policies need to improve. Go to In-N-Out up the street, you know they are amazing, fast and have great customer service."}
{"text":"The managers here are complete clowns!  Should be fired on the spot, using the F word in front of customers, not professional.  Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Brewburger, a big, messy, masterpiece of a burger. A sucker punch of flavor, yum, can I have another please! Was really awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place on the west side. Had a cheeseburger with fries, burger was super juicy & fries crispy and nicely seasoned. 
Like having ranch with my fries and liked the fact that I was given something out of a squirt bottle. 
Will be returning soon and recommending it to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just \"ok\" nothing to special about it. The first time I visited I enjoyed it, since than I have visited two more times and it just got worse. And on the down side it is pretty pricey for a bland hamburger. I'd rather much be taking my business to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"My sons and I are regulars....Best bacon cheese burgers, fries are aweson! Customer service ROCKS. See ya Tueasday!!!!"}
{"text":"Alright, after coming here three times I now have to say that I am really in love with their food. I have yet to have even a mediocre burger here, and neither have my wife or my friend (both of whom I have brought with me). Fantastic burgers, sides, and appetizers. If you enjoy burgers you will not be disappointed. Seriously."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are hooked! Best burgers and great customer service. The place is welcoming and cozy..we love it!"}
{"text":"This place makes a great fried burger. Reminded me of Five Guys with a more upscale twist. I like my burgers grilled so not my taste. The air conditioning was freezing and did not have much ambiance. No music just a few tv screens. Very quiet in there on a Sunday morning and we were the only people in there. It was good but was not a match for me."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Burger Joint yet, you're missing out! Perfectly cooked burgers with tons of flavor.  Truffle fries.....amazing. We ordered much more than we should have not knowing the portion sizes. The fried pickled appetizer - delicious. Pickled veggies in tempura batter. Don't pass this place up!!"}
{"text":"So sad. Today we mourn the loss of a great burger restaurant.   As you can see we have been coming here for two years and loved it
Today we were served cold, soggy fries, overcooked hockey pucks as a stand in for what use to leave us wiping up to our elbows with yummy burger juice and greasy onion rings.
Burger Joint you will be remembered as you once were not what you have become, so long"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service was amazing! The burger and fries were very well seasoned and cooked perfectly! A little pricey.  Two burgers, one order of truffle fries and two waters with a gratuity came to $42! In my opinion though, well worth it."}
{"text":"Great, attentive service. Awesome burgers....definitely  recommend the jalapeño burger and truffle fries!!!! Well worth the price so don't let that shy you away. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite burger place. Have been here 4 times now and have not been disappointed. Consistent flavor and temperature of cook."}
{"text":"This was by far the best burger in town. This satisfied a specific craving I've had for months. The gentleman serving us was very polite, knowledgeable, and friendly. The burger was just so amazingly juicy and seasoned perfectly. The bacon was a bit chewy but was so flavorful that I didn't mind. The three cheese fries with carmelized onions and special sauce were perfect as well. The onions were cooked just right and the fries just kinda soaked them up. The special sauce was so much more than special. It was like McDonald's Big Mac Sauce but on steroids. I had a very positive dining experience here and will be returning often."}
{"text":"Crikey, this food was good!  I've been twice now and it's worth the trip.  The staff is always friendly.  Hot, juicy, tasty burgers with crispy (not soggy and limp) fries will keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today expecting more than I got. $5.99 for a single patty mushroom Swiss burger and another $3 to get fries and a small drink. So after tax it cost me about $10 for a damn good burger, okay fries and a small rootbeer. Add to this my son's lunch $4 for burger, and $3 more for fries and another buck or so for a shake and my wife's identical order and it cost me $25 for 3 of us to eat there. 

Now the burger was good, really good, actually. The meat was fresh and so were the mushrooms, but for the price you pay here you're almost better off eating an Angus burger from McDonald's, or one of the fancy Six dollar burgers from Carl's Jr. I think if the burger had a little more meat then it would easily compete with the others I mentioned. 

Moving onto the milkshake...have you ever had ice cream that has been sitting in your freezer for too long and it takes on an unusual scent and flavor? Well that's what both their chocolate and vanilla shakes taste like. It wasn't what I was hoping for, but it wasn't too disgusting to enjoy. 

The restaurant itself. It's clean, well lit, and a little crowded with too many tables. It's next door to a nail salon and so it has that nasty acrylic odor creeping in from next door. Not so much creeping as it's almost overpowering. It's totally not the burger joint's fault, but it is hard to deal with none the less. 

The take away from this? Really good burgers. Seriously good burgers. But get them to go. Until the nail salon next door closes down, that acrylic odor is going to persist and disrupt an otherwise decent lunch/dinner. Also be prepared to open your wallet, they're a bit pricey for a burger joint. If they can make a fresh milkshake I'd bump this review to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Wow.... I loved the munchy style burger it's bomb burger juicy and so much flavor its a definite return for me....recommend it to all my friends best burger ive had in awhile comming from cali"}
{"text":"Big disappointment.
Went in at noon on Friday and placed my order - what a zoo.
Finally got my order 30 minutes later.
Food was average at best.
Had to look hard to find the hamburger patty.
Not sure this place will be around long ... I will not be going back.
Too bad for such a great location and so many looking for a \"go to\"
lunch spot."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch one day out of the blue.  Looked them up on yelp and though I would give it a try. They are a little pricey for what you get but I have to say it was a very tasty burger.  I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors and liked that they offer healthier options like lettuce wrapped burgers/grass fed etc."}
{"text":"The burgers are fresh  and messy and taste great!!  They give lots of fries and the service is excellent, fast, and friendly. The cashier suggested the munchie burger and it was an excellent suggestion."}
{"text":"The Burger Joint is definitely a place to checkout for a Real good burger. My server was beyond amazing. Had the almost famous fries that should be famous for the check-in perk really good bison burger was yummy definitely check it out! Definitely will be coming back and telling my friends to try it"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! A must try! Forgot to take a picture of my food.  Definitely my favorite burger place! Tip: if you're going to ask for a well-done ..it will be well done. If you're going to ask for Medium.. it will be pretty pink in the middle."}
{"text":"Another average tasting burger place. I regret paying $10 for an OK and tiny burger when I can get a delicious and cheaper one from other places. One of the stars is for the service, which was good."}
{"text":"WOW, WOW, WOW!  We were blown away by how good the burgers were. My husband had the Bacon burger and said it was the best he had had in a long time. I had the Blue Cheese burger and it was fantastic. Both were cooked perfectly (you can specify from rare to well done) to our specifications. The truffle fries were fabulous. A single order served us both with leftovers. The truffle ketchup (homemade) is to die for. This will become one of our go to restaurants."}
{"text":"My group had a cheeseburger, hot dog, and chicken pita sandwich. We all agreed each of our items were terrible. I took two bites of my cheeseburger and had to throw the rest away. The food had no flavor, the french fries were extremely greasy and slippery.  The restaurant is over priced for the non sense they seem to think is appropriate to feed people.  Its safe to say we won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Truffle fries are delicious. Buffalo cauliflower is awesome. We have ordered from here several time using the Ubereats app. Worth the wait for delivery. Food is always amazing and comes with good presentation. Not your typical burger joint."}
{"text":"Meh! Not good. 

Cleanliness: D-

Not very clean. Floors sticky. Tables dirty. The girl cleaning table slopped dirty water with a rag all over. The glass holding the silverware was terrible  (see attached picture). Cook has long beard that's not covered. Over all not a feeling that things are all that sanitary.

Price: C-

Kind of expensive for what you get. 

Food: C-

The burger was moist and tender, but underdone, i ordered medium mine was wedium rare. The bun was dry. Spiced well with good condiments. My wife's burger was prepared correctly yet the bun had blood on it, not good.

Atmosphere: C-

While they are attempting to be an upscale burger place, they fail. It is dirty, not laid out well and it was hot as Hades in there. Not sure if air conditionar was broken, but it was very hot. The guest next to us was complaining about it.

Overall, I would skip. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT burger joint!!!!  Unique burgers with steakhouse twist.  The au poivre burger is excellent.  My wife had the roasted portobello burger and loved it."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  The bacon burger was amazing! Also loved the hand cut fries. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously AMAZING food. My boyfriend and I struggle to find places we can eat out together at, I am vegan and he is not. Not only were we both able to eat here but the food was some of the best we've ever had!

I ordered the vegan portobello burger and the sweet potato tots. The portobello burger had an amazing umami flavor and the (huge) sweet potato tots are nothing short of addicting. They were crispy on the out side and creamy on the inside. Ive never had anything like those before! They had lots of vegan side options like fries and fried pickles and fried portobello strips and a white bean dipping sauce that I cant wait to try.

My boyfriend ordered a classic burger with the regular hand cut fries. He eats a burger at pretty much every place we go and he absolutely loved this one. His fries were so yummy-- I know because I kept eating them too. 

The other night my boyfriend ordered takeout from here and they package the food in 100% recycled cardboard which made me say to myself, now I HAVE to write a review. 

The guy who I presume is the owner is a super nice guy. Go support this local gem of a place, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Open late and delivers according to all of there flyers.  Huh?  It's 7:30 on a Friday night and the Dbacks are in town.  Wonder how long this place will stay in business."}
{"text":"So disappointed, giving one star because I tried to place an order by phone but \"Tommy\" would not take it unless I gave him a credit card. He stated that it was due to, too many people not picking up. Even after I told him I was outside and there were too many people in there (let me add it was raining hard) he refused to take my order. It seemed as if he was in a rush to get off the phone and did not care if he Lost a customer. When I asked for the owners he said they were not her out of state he did say where but don't remember. When i asked for a manager he said there was no manager in. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went with my husband, we ordered 2 burgers and one fries that we get for free because we check-in on Yelp. Everything was delicious, portion were good, and the piece of meat big . It is around $11 a burger."}
{"text":"Hit the spot!!! Sooooo good. The sweet potato \"tots\" are fricken awesome. Lived the cauliflower buffalo wings are great with ranch. I added the egg to my burger-boy was it goooooooood!
I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Updating my review to 5 stars. The burgers are ah-mazing! Been here twice in one week...yum!!!

Not what I was expecting when I walked in but the burgers are GOOD! It's a small space with minimal decor but who cares with burgers like this."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, originally was planning to go in early February but it closed earlier than we had wanted as we were waiting for a friend to arrive into town. 

This time, since we were watching a movie later in the evening, we decided to come here for dinner before we see the movie. Located fairly south on Eastern towards anthem, past St Rose Pkwy about 2 blocks. The restaurant itself is decent in size with a decent amount of seating. We were greeted and seated as soon as we had arrived. 

Their menu's are fairly simple with a few items for veggies, taters, and burgers. 21 items in total. With Yelp Check in, you get a complimentary choice of hand cut fries or Almost Famous fries ($4-$7 value) per party. Since we were a party of 5 people, we had picked Almost Famous fries for the complimentary choice and a order of Truffle fries to share as well. 

Almost famous fries include caramelized onions, three-cheese, and a secret sauce. Think of it as a fancier \"animal fries\" from In n Out. Larger hand cut fries with sliced grilled onions vs chopped onions, ample amount of cheese on top, and topped with a similar \"spread\" sauce resembling thousand island dressing. 

The Truffle fries are topped with parmesan, chives served with a side of truffle ketchup. To be honest, i dont remember there being parmesan but i remember upon delivery, the fries were topped with a bunch of \"very finely shredded truffle\" on top. I can't exactly tell if it was truffle as the flavor was much more mild compared to slices of truffle. May be difference of quality or how it was done. Truffle flavor on the fries were nice and mild. Not overpowering like some places could be. The fries itself were nice and crispy to the outside. Inside was nice and soft. done pretty well. My fav truffle fries to my memory to far ! 

Burgers had 9 different arrangements. All served \"regularly\" with \"Certified Black Angus Beef\" with exception to the \"Red Bird\" which comes with the \"All NAtural Chicken by Red Bird Farms\". If i remember correctly, it was like a $1.50 (labeled at Bartel Farms) additional for the \"Certified Organic Grass-Fed Beef by Bartel Farms. 

Add-Ons include Avocado for $2, Egg for $2, Bacon for $2, Roasted Mushrooms for $2, Foie Gras for $12, Truffles for $9.

Most of my friends had ordered the \"Classic\" which includes lettuce, onion, tomato, white american cheese, and secret sauce between a Medium Rare and Medium cook. One of my friends had noticed reviews stating cook may vary. They all thoroughly enjoyed their burgers stating it is possibly the best burger they've had. 

I had the \"Jalapeno\" which includes pickled and fried jalapenos with roasted and smoked jalapeno mayo topped with jack cheese. The included jalapenos didnt add much flavor besides the earthiness that jalapenos naturally have. The \"pickled and fried\" jalapenos seemed more like grilled/roasted jalapenos, texture wise. Was hoping for a spicy kick but didn't get any. Burger itself, i had requested done medium, and it was a perfect medium. Nice juicy, flavorful burger with a nice pink center. 

Overall, pretty good. Burger's arent a favorite item of mine but i don't mind eating them once in a while. Normally kind of far since I live on the west side of town but i do usually work nearby. Would like to try maybe the Blue Cheese one or the 2AM next time :)"}
{"text":"Burger Joint has a very casual setting and comes with more than attentive service, you can tell from the moment you walk in that the establishment wholeheartedly cares about your experience.

We came here for a friend's birthday and were not the least bit disappointed sharing three appetizers and a burger entree each. 


Was definitely worth the twenty minute drive out to Henderson."}
{"text":"This is so not worth the money or your time. The burgers are nothing special, the fries were HORRIBLE  and the chili dog was a JOKE! It had very little chili kind of spread on the one side of the bun which turned out to be a good thing because the chili was NASTY!!!! I was so excited to try it hoping for a really good burger place but we will not go back!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food!!!  These guys have some serious culinary chops!  Absolutely worth the drive if you're not already in Henderson. They use the best ingredients and the right techniques to create burger magic. Oh, and those tots and fried pickles...not to be missed!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for the fantastic food so close to home!"}
{"text":"We came to The Burger Joint at the suggestion of a friend. We've been back several times and each time the food is great and the service is excellent. The last time, they were actually handing out flowers to all of the ladies! We love supporting local businesses!"}
{"text":"HOT & NEW!!!! Yes in deed ~
  This new Burger Joint only open about a month, apparently started on a tight budget by Damien & Jose ~ nothing wrong with this as the food speaks for itself 
    I HAD have the BACON! This is MASSIVE!!!' Really DEEEE LISSSH! The tomato jam A++, Fried onion rings A++, Bacon, not crisp, but really good and this is just a FAB combination for a burger  I must say ~ however it was a challenge to finish, as a rule I don't order these kind of burgers..... I am a purist so next time I will go with the basic burger for sure. Also be aware, burgers are the ONLY thing on the menu, besides the sides that go with burgers, fries (sweet potato too!) Tater Tots etc. the Tots get RAVE REVIEWS, they were good, CRISPY OUTSIDE, could have been hotter in the centre, they were cooked thru, just not really hot in the centers.
    One item we ordered that I sincerely CANNOT recommend ~ the cauliflower wings....Don't do it! I am guessing the cauliflower is steamed, then the hot wing sauce (which I did like) added. Served with hummus, I've never seen hummus like this. If they fried the Cauliflower, as we know they fry the potatoes.... This dish could be \"OFF THE HOOK\"! And ditch the hummus keep the traditional Blue Cheese or even Ranch. Its TRADITIONAL for a REASON! Cuz it tastes GR8! 
   I don't mean to be harsh, I WANT this new, small business to succeed all menus need tweeting from time 2 time"}
{"text":"We love this place! The burgers are amazing, great service and free hand-cut fries with check-in- how can you go wrong!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best dining experiences my husband and I have had since moving to Goodyear last month. We just went here tonight for an early dinner. Both the girls working were very friendly and professional. Food came out quickly, fries and onion rings were fresh, veggie burger and Philly cheesesteak were both good. Everything was clean and well stocked. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Good burger and beer. Really fresh products. All made while you wait. Very friendly waitress. Did not know this place existed until I yelped for a burger place. 
I recommend trying it out. Local better than franchise. I love to see new places make it."}
{"text":"Very good burgers. Hand made patty's of certified black angus or organic fees beef from Bartels Farms in Oregon. The truffle friends we delicious. Just the right amount of truffle oil. We also had the sweet potato tots that were delicious. They do not have an extensive menu but u don't need it. Only been open a month. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Go me. . .1st time at Burger Joint and I order chicken, lol. However, the Red Bird was a good choice! Loved the Tator Tots . . .let's not forget the House made Sangria; definitely will give this place a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"Underestimated this place. Live pretty close by and was craving a burger and specifically sweet potato fries/tots. This place had the tots and man, they were delicious!!! The dipping sauce complemented it so well. I ordered the portobello burger and added a patty to it. Hit the spot! Go to spot for burgers now. Will be back and with more friends!"}
{"text":"As promised we tried The Burger Joint again. This time I had the Philly Cheese Steak and while it was good it was ruined by canned mushrooms. Had it had fresh mushrooms I would have given it four stars.  The same complaints the second visit...lackluster fries and canned mushrooms. Onion rings were good and my wife liked her cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Great meal!! Amazing jalapeño burger!! Amazing potato skins.. I was super happy!! Hope this place makes it!!"}
{"text":"Wowza. If you're craving a great juicy burger you should drop by here. The burgers are premium meat perfectly cooked and they have Az craft beer on draft. The sweet potatoe fries are ok but the onion rings are fabulous. They also make some spectacular shakes! When you're craving a great burger stop in here, nd no worries for you veggy lovers, they have an outstanding veggy burger and some chicken options! Have fun, eat well and enjoy life!"}
{"text":"I would like to start out with saying we received excellent service.  The gentleman helping us really went above and beyond.  He was surely attentive and friendly.  

As far as the food, meh. I was happy with the burger as it was cooked perfectly and still maintained the juiciness.  The Red Bird Chicken Sandwich was also good with the thick pieces of bacon used on the sandwich.  

What stands out are the 'Almost Famous Fries' that we ordered to share.  They were very very soggy.  For my taste I would have like them to be crisp and fresh.  We were both really disappointed.  Sides are always an important part of my meal especially at a burger restaurant.  I hope they can improve on these."}
{"text":"So in case you didnt know, Burger Joint opened it's doors here in Henderson! They are locally owned and operated small business headed by locals Damian and Jose.  Right here In Sundridge Plaza (Eastern/Sundridge Heights)

So why should you prefer this place over other burger places??
1. It's NOT the typical massed produced fast food joint, burgers  here dont have the preservatives and artificial flavors.

2. The burgers are hella good! Seasoned well. Organic. Black Angus 
Beef from Bartels Farms.  Very good quality beef.

3. My beer aficionados friends highly approve of their beer selection. 

4. They have vegetarian/vegan option.  Of all days I came in, it was my Meatless Monday, and was very happy to see Roasted Portobello ...even happier tasted delicious paired with fennel escabeche.

5. From reading the menu and seeing the artisan ingredients used for the different burger selections it shows that Chef Damian is really talented, there are burgers you wont see at other places. 

Our burgers were cooked as requested every single visit. (Med/rare and well done)

The Bleu Cheese with shallot port syrup/bacon mayo that I asked for wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun was really good! The creamy sauce balanced out the sharpness of the bleu cheese.

6, TRUFFLE!! Truffle fries is on the menu...

7. Tator Tots - made in house...that's another reason that pulled me in here, crazy, I know. Honestly Im not crazy for tots, mostly because everyone uses the frozen variety.. Chef though crafts his from a mold that's a little bigger size. The result, crisp on outside, moist AND FRESH potato inside. Ya'll who gripe about not getting very many are just used those bitty preserved ones...smh

tip: ask for it Truffled!! It's not on menu. 

8. Those who love Foie Gras, well you'll be in heaven. Foie is not on the menu but if they have some they can add it to your burger...or make you foie gravy fries..YEA FOIE GRAVY fries!!

9. They have burgers to please everyone.(see #4)  Even non foodies like Mr. B, who likes things plain, traditional.  The Classic burger here with the added burger patty  we requested was pretty impressive.  I knew hubby would approve.  Like I said beef quality is really good.

10. The staff is cool, the prices are on par with speciality burger places IMO.  What I dont get are the  people who spend average 5$ on cup of coffee everyday, then gripe on $$ they spend on a speciality burger?? ...ookay.

The ambiance is chill, it is family friendly,  the dining area is modestly decorated. There's some awesome looking pix of their food hanging on the wall though ;)  I like they're open late on Sundays, cause most places around here are closed early. The first few visits here, I was surprised to see it busy, with repeat customers,  especially since they haven't done any advertising.  Obviously the  local neighborhood knows what good!  Burger Joint is another good asset and option to eat in this area!!"}
{"text":"The sudden surge of burger photos on IG put this spot on my radar. I am rarely in Henderson, but popped in as soon as an opportunity presented itself. The check-in offer for free fries was a cool perk!

A friend and I shared the Bleu Burger (shallot-port syrup and bacon mayo) and the 3AM (sunny side egg, peppered bacon, carmelized onion, hollandaise), and added on the truffle fries and potato skins with the check-in offer. The Bleu burger was awesome in that they totally deliver on the cheese, but I couldn't really taste the bacon-mayo. The 3AM burger wasn't really my thing, and neither of us finished our portion. Both burgers were overcooked to well-done but we felt it wasn't worth the hassle to ask them to remake them, but it did make a negative impact. I will say that the truffle fries were amazing, and I really liked the house-made ketchups. The potato skins were received after the rest of our order, but weren't bad.

Service was polite. The layout is a little odd with a walk-up counter but table service, and very little in the way of decor. I do like that they have organic beef available and that they source their buns from a local bakery.  Eyeing the Au Poivre or the patty melt for another visit."}
{"text":"The truffle fries are AMAZING! Anyone who comes here must get some of those to pair with the Blue Burger. I am super happy my clients and I decided to stop here. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a take out. Tasted great and perfectly cooked. Bacon burger was my choice. Fries should have came with the price of burger."}
{"text":"I just had a burger..kinda hard to screw up a burger. It was ok. Seemed lacking some kind of punch to it. I think the burger needs to say something and not be so silent."}
{"text":"Stopped here late Sunday for a burger. Didn't realize it closes at 8pm, or at least that's when they started closing down. I'd expect them to be open a little later. 

Food was pretty good. Had a burger with fries. Burgers are customizable with toppings like bacon, avocado, fried egg, etc. Fries were near perfect in my opinion, crispy and golden brown on the outside. Burger was cooked well as well and assembled on a toasted bun. Nice touches. 

I think it's a tad pricey, just under 9 bucks for a cheeseburger, fries and regular drink."}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews here, we decided to stop by and try this establishment out. 

Upon walking in we were greeted immediately by a very nice female. We ordered the classic burger and the bacon burger. The classic burger was good. I asked for medium well, but my burger was served medium. Not a big deal, as I was starving. The burger itself lacked flavor. The bacon burger was good. Again, nothing spectacular, the burger was over cooked (asked for medium well) and lacked flavor. The fries were soggy....Quite disappointing! The tater tots were good (great concept), but lacked flavor. The food was good, but not good enough for me to want to return and have a cheat day. The service was EXCELLENT!!!!"}
{"text":"Burger was average at best, certainly nothing spectacular.  Customer Service was down right pathetic.  We asked for our order to go since they were already stacking chairs at 7:30pm and got home to find out we were one burger short.  Called back and were told there was nothing they would do about it tonight since they closed at eight and offered to credit us one burger as if they were doing us a favor!  We paid for the darn burger and didn't get it!  I called back and let them know I wasn't satisfied with that...  I was shocked that he argued that he felt crediting us what we paid for was sufficient.  After all, my husband and I had to share a burger for dinner, became defensive and asked what I wanted.  I felt he should comp a dinner.  No way..

The floors were sticky in places and greasy in other places.  Ultimately, we were told they would credit 2 burgers - the one we paid for and one free.  Don't want to eat there again though - I will definitely be visiting a manager and getting my $7.99 back for the burger we paid for and didn't get - not worth going back to eat for sure!"}
{"text":"Very mixed feelings about the Burger Joint with only one of four in the party really liking it. We wanted a fairly fast informal meal, nothing fancy. We had seen the Burger Joint in a strip mall as we drove down Eastern and wanted to give it a try. Yelp check in gets you free hand cut fries. And they have Goose Island beer on tap. Two major pluses to start. I'm not much a a burger guy so I went with their roasted portobello mushroom \"burger\" (it's meatless). Comes with avocado, roasted tomato and fennel escabeche on a big bun. My portobello mushroom and the fries were delish - loved it. And the servers were super friendly and attentive. So why only 3 stars. My wife and friends each got one of the burgers. Each of them felt the burgers were just meh (not bad, but for a burger place you expect the burgers to be special and these weren't). So while I would come back again for another meatless \"burger\", my wife and friends each would want to try somewhere else for their burgers next time."}
{"text":"Great burgers and lots of fries in the meal. Not like fast food burgers.  These are like the old school loaded up diner style burgers.  

Friendly and attentive staff.  Been a pretty solid line since we got here.  I'd recommend trying it.  We'll be back again."}
{"text":"This place is Great!! Good Service!! I love the fresh non-frozen food, that is served within a timely manner! The professional workers are worth mentioning, as friendly and personable! I have been here several times and have told all my friends and family about it and they love it too!!! you will not be sorry!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food clean restaurant. Smells wonderful. Excellent friendly service.  This is that cool hidden place you accidentally find! Awesome"}
{"text":"Had a random craving for gourmet burgers and thanks to Yelp, I found this place which was literally right around the corner. I placed a to-go order about 20min before closing and they were friendly, helpful and the food was ready in 15min. It wasn't too expensive either, less than $40 for to feed a family of 4 with an order of potato skins. The order was correct and the burgers were very good. Definitely gourmet. My only issue was by the time I got it home the buns weren't as crispy as they were when I left. Next time, I'll eat them at the restaurant, which was clean and cozy."}
{"text":"This was the best burgers we have had in awhile !!!the bacon bacon burger was the messiest best burger ever- tasted amazingly fresh - my husband had the 3 am and well he pretty much licked the plate . The home cut fries were amazing !!! And who does not like $1 beer while watching football !!! A must try in my opinion !!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific artisan burger. A total cut above the chains and \"fast casual\" formula places. I had The Original burger with what they called tobacco onions\" - shoestring onion rings. Deeply satisfying, cooked perfectly, on an artisan bun. All for maybe a few bucks more than a fast food place. Handcut fries were excellent.

Not much on the ambiance, but clean as a whistle and very cool indie music on what seemed decent speakers.

Will put this place on the list for many repeat visits."}
{"text":"I work a couple doors down and decided to give it a try when I found it was open. I tried the hand cut fries and the Roasted Portobello burger. Both were DELICIOUS! The staff was super friendly and my food was ready quickly. (I only have a 30 minute lunch break) 
I highly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Found this based on other yelp reviews. You will not be disappointed. Delicious food, friendly staff, great prices!! Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Food = excellent. Great quality ingredients perfectly cooked. Talk about great fresh fries!  Wow!  We had grass fed beef burger, exceptional.  

Service = friendly and efficient. 

Price = fair for what you get. Is it a bit more expensive than the typical fast casual burger joint?  Yes, but you are also eating better quality ingredients. You will know as soon as you taste the food. 

Decor = a bit rough, as you'll see with the Sharpie marked up walls, but the experience is worth it. 

TAKEAWAY:  we will be back, again and again."}
{"text":"Alright, I came back again and I feel a little better about the place... My fried egg still wasn't runny even after I told her to make sure it was... I'm thinking it just cooked more on my drive home so I won't totally blame it on them. It was piping hot and delicious! I added extra bacon and opted for sautéed onions instead of regular ones. I got the fried zucchini this time which was on point and delicious. Next time I think I'll get pulled pork added to it instead of the fried egg. If you want a good burger go here it really is good."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! We were heading to Parsley. They were closed so we saw this place. Didn't look like much from the outside but there were all there adolescent martial artists hanging out. The place was really busy. So glad we stopped in. I had a Jalapeno Burger and my hubby had the Patty Melt. He bit into his Patty Melt and his eyes got big and he said it was the best Patty Melt he ever ate. The burgers are a 80/20 blend with MUSHROOMS!! So juicy and you cant even tell there are mushrooms in the meat. The patty is healthier and more sustainable for the planet. The sides are family style and we ordered the Tots and Frickles. YUMMY! When we get a burger craving it may be the Burger Joint from now on. The burgers are great and the Beer is COLD!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Loved the secret sauce and the ketchup tastes homemade and is soooo delicious. Im not even a ketchup fan, but wish they sold their ketchup in bottles to go! The buns were wonderful. The tator tots are addicting. Will definitely make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Hello all!  I've been craving a good burger place for a while now and eyed this joint a few months ago.  I finally was able to make it down and I'm glad I did!  I got the jalapeno burger and the almost famous fries.  The burger was super juicy, tender, and flavorful and the pickled and fried jalapenos added just enough spice although I only saw the pickled ones.  The fries were a little less pleasing.  Although they were good, there wasn't really anything that set them apart.  They were just fries with stuff on them.  My cohorts got the bacon burger (delicious) the 3am burger (delicious) the tator tots (tasty with a great sriracha ketchup) and the poutine (too expensive and not worth it).  

All in all the food was pretty good and the burgers definitely stood out.  Are they worth as much as they are being charged as?  Idk about that but they are tasty.  I want to try the au poivre burger next time!  I also want to try the two ciders they have as well!  The only other things besides the fries that bothered us was how hot it was inside and the sun shining in our eye.  Maybe put some shades and put the ac down a bit.

Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get a free side of fries, tots, or almost famous fries!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Had a Smokehouse Bleu Burger and a Chilli Cheese Dog. Both were cooked perfectly and very hot. I plan on coming again soon. My compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"Eat here tonight if you haven't already.   You will thank me later.  Grab a beer get the 3 am and enjoy."}
{"text":"Ok, I have tried three times to like this place. But they keep failing me. Maybe it's startup jitters?  

My main issues: 
Too pricey. Today was over $14 for a crazy Greek burger, gorgonzola fries and a soda. The bigger had cheddar cheese and a few bits of gyros. Fries were a $2 up Chafee to have them throw some cheese crumbles. 
The burger. Ok, I like the 6 oz patty, but it is frozen and uninspired. Three bun is simple, there is no gourmet at all about any of this, except the name. Nor worth the price. 
The small things.  Only 8 choices on the soda machine, today two off them were out by 11:30 am. Constant sticky floor. I ordered a bbq bacon burger today, was told they had no bacon \" would you like to add an ingredient?\" It's a bacon burger, I want bacon. If I am eating in, (they do have a spacious dining area with rock on the speakers) then don't wrap everything up to go. Last time my fries were cold. 

I will give them over more shot in a month or so to see if they ironed the bugs out."}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars. Excellent service, excellent food...burger and fries! We always use Yelp when out of town, and that's how we stumbled on this jewel. You locals are lucky to have this place nearby. If we had one near us, we'd be regular customers. My husband had the Bacon and I had the Blue Cheese, and we shared the hand-cut fries. Everything was fresh and delicious! Don't pass this one by. They also have some craft beers, wine and a sangria that sounds amazing. We didn't partake, but the choices just add to the possibilities of this Burger Joint."}
{"text":"Definitely eat here!  Everything is delicious and the service is amazing. We had onion rings (more like onion straws, but perfectly crispy), potato skins, tater tots, bacon cheeseburgers, and a patty melt.  We enjoyed everything and will be back."}
{"text":"I really love this place!! The burgers are fantastic!!  Cooked perfectly to order by friendly folks who understand what it takes to make burgers great. Also, the onion straws are the best I've had in the Valley. They may actually put crack in them. So be careful. Divine! This is NOT a fast food burger. Take your time and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Was here last week after the Goodyear Fall Festival. I always judge a burger joint by their Chili Cheeseburger, and this Burger Joint did not disappoint. With a generous side of fries this burger was awesome!

The kids shared a shake since they'd eaten at the Fall Festival earlier and the wife enjoyed a Bacon Cheeseburger that had some of the best bacon she's had and complimented the burger well."}
{"text":"Best burger in Vegas!  I realize this is an arbitrary claim, but it's my review and based on  hundreds of different burgers that I have tried all over the country.

The quality of the meat, the proper temperature that it was cooked (been here 6 times and it has always been cooked to the mid-rare temp requested), the quality of the accompanying fries and ketchup, the friendliness and efficiency of the service and the cleanliness of the restaurant are all 10 out of 10!

The only improvement I could recommend and hope can be incorporated at a later date, is to improve the decor.  I say this with the very clear understanding that this takes time and above all else money.  Certainly not a deal breaker or a reason for anyone not to give this place a shot.  Hope you all enjoy it as much as I have!"}
{"text":"Pretty unique burgers.  Place is rather Spartan, but don't let that fool you.  
But the coody graw (I know, I know)?  Best dang onion rings I've ever had!
Who'da thunk that another burger place was even needed?   
Even if it was a lousy burger, which it's pretty good, I'd come for the onion rings."}
{"text":"My brother took my husband and myself to the best burger joint ever in Nevada. I have had lots of patty melts in my lifetime, but this the the juiciest cheesiest burger ever. I have never had a burger like this in California!! 

I encourage everyone to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place after a trail run in Estrella Park, and as I was quite hungry after burning all those calories, decided to stop in.  This is your typical suburban casual order-at-the-counter burger restaurant, with burgers, hot dogs, cheesesteaks, shakes, etc.  I went with the muchie burger, or whatever they called it...

The food took awhile to arrive, but that's OK... Better than having pre-heated food.  The burger was like a slightly better version of In-N-Out's animal style double double, with more flavor and better ingredients.  It was quite tasty for what is basically a fast food burger.

The fries, on the other hand, weren't terrible, but didn't really stand on their own.  Fortunately, there was malt vinegar at the table, so it was easy enough to add a little flavor to those fries.

It's not spectacular, but the service was friendly, and the burger was decent.  Worth stopping by if you're hungry and in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"By far the best burger ever. I've been here 5 times and each time I've been impressed. The service is outstanding and the burgers are incredible.

My favorite is the Au Poivre, but your mileage may vary. The truffle fries are awesome, but you'll need a friend to help with the fries. One person fries and burgers is a LOT of food.

Not cheap, but incredibly good."}
{"text":"Brand new place! I've been waiting for them to open. Originally called Texas BBQ but the name is Burger Joint Chicago. However the check says Burger Joint Phoenix. Ok here goes: clean, friendly staff, wood & brick interior, large windows on 2-sides. I ordered pulled pork with BBQ sauce. I asked them to put the cole slaw right on the pork- Carolina Style. This sandwich is correct. Just what one would expect from a wet thick pulled pork sandwich. The fries are fresh cut- very important to me. The fries are salted correctly. I will be trying the burgers at a later date. The prices are reasonable, classic rock on the sound system, 5-big screen tvs, 2-news, 3-sports. What I would like to see: draft beer and free wifi. I will be back. My instincts are positive. I do know this location has had a high turn-over for restaurants. I wish these folks well!"}
{"text":"Good service. Waitress took great care of us and kept checking to make sure everything was in order. Decent burgers, doesn't justify the price. For the same price there is a whole list of burger places that are much better in taste and quality.  Not a lot of atmosphere to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars...I loved my gyro and fries!

However, the cons: this place needs music, one TV should be on and add additional TV's, furnish with outdoor seating since they have a patio, advertise consistent hours on Yelp, the front door etc.  Your hours are so inconsistent, so that is why your business is so spotty throughout the evening.  You need to make the restaurant actually look like it is open if you plan to stay open until 8pm a few nights a week!"}
{"text":"New burger joint in my neck of the woods called The Burger Joint! A little expensive, but so good!!! Certified Angus Beef & organic grass fed, you can really taste the quality. I went with the blue cheese. Huge burger I didn't think I'd finish, but so good I had to. If your on eastern & horizon I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was ok good, though the 1/4 pound Angus burger was  a wee bit overcooked and thin for my taste.

I'm not a soda guy but had a root beer with it. They have several beers on tap.

Service was friendly and the guy came to check-in afterwards to see how we liked it.

Their A/C was busted but he apologized and said it would be fixed next week. 

The 2 meals were about $20 total.

I had the classic bacon cheeseburger with fries. Wifey had the smokehouse blue cheese bacon burger with zucchini fried thingies.

 I'll be back and hope for better next time."}
{"text":"Ordered our food and sat down - only to be told later they were out of veggie burgers. They refunded my money. Got my wife's order wrong. But she said the burger was good regardless. Fries were good. Undecided if we'll return. Probably not."}
{"text":"Great burgers, beef and veggie!!! Great prices too! The fries were amazing and the cauliflower with buffalo sauce was too, my favorite!"}
{"text":"In a few words. Simple place. Good burgers. Small though. Tiny bit expensive. 
I think it should be a little cheaper or make the burgers a little bigger. But for sure if you go you'll like the burgers. Well it's a burger everybody likes burgers."}
{"text":"I thought the prices too high. Took over half an hour to get our food. The malt was an over chocolatey shake. No malt in it at all."}
{"text":"Very good meal here today!!!  We got the pepper appetizer which was delicious.  We also had the hand cut fries - which we got for free with our yelp check in.  My husband had the jalapeño and I had the bacon burger.  The meat is so flavorful - it melts in your mouth and the patty had a nice char to it.  The kids had the kid burgers and they loved the fries.  Our daughter did not care for the grilled cheese but she is a picky eater.  The service was great and we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I only have one day a week off my strict diet to eat a great burger, I choose The Burger Joint. The staff always smiles and says I guess its been a week already. My favorite is the double meat double cheese with Bacon and all veggies. I am not a fan of the thousand island dressing so instead I add mayo.  It arrives so juicy that it takes me at least 6 napkins if not more to keep clean. I wouldn't have it any other way. I usually don't order a side just a soda. The burger is why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I love and appreciate a good burger and this place does not disappoint! I am obsessed with blue cheese so was happy that they offer a Bleu Cheese burger on their menu. It was delicious. So flavorful, cooked to perfection. My boyfriend got the 3am Burger and he loved it. For a starter you must try the Onion Strings and Almost Famous Fries, OMG amazing!!!!!!! I can't wait to go back and try more things. On a side note, both times I have gone it has been fairly empty but don't let that fool you, the food is delicious and the staff is friendly! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded our expectations! Burgers were so flavorful.  Fresh cut fries were the best!!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!! Dynamite \"Munchie Fries\"... If you like American Cheese, grilled onions, and Thousand Island Dressing. .. You gotta try those fries...wow!!! Hubbie had the Double Cheeseburger with all the fixings... good,  sloppy, yummy yum!!! Staff was helpful and friendly, place was very clean.  Will return for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant I recommend to all burger lovers. They have many different ways you can make your burger. Their fries are yummy and the burger buns are toasted and buttery. 

All the staff are very friendly and check on you half way through your meal. It's a step up from fast food. Take the time and visit this local eatery!"}
{"text":"I came in today for a second visit. I believe I'm giving a place another shot after the first one. Today did not disappoint. The burger and truffle fries were outstanding. Thank you. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about, burgers ok, no ambiance. They look like they are trying to be something they are not. I don't hate it but I don't love it, bored to tears with the menu. Prices are high for the quality of meat you get. I would not recommend this place but if a friend wanted to meet here I would be ok with it. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great local spot for lunch. I had a hot dog and sweet potato fries. Both were perfectly done. Hot dog was opened and grilled and the fries weren't overly salted and nice and crisp. Definitely a place I'll come back to."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service. My wife and I ordered from them via GrubHub. My wife ordered a classic well done burger and I ordered a medium bacon burger. When we received the order my wife's was fine but mine was rare. I called burger join directly. When I called and told (Jose) about the issue, without hesitating he apologized and said he'd bring me the burger cooked correctly himself in 15 minutes. When he showed up he apologized and threw in truffle fries (that were excellent). This was above and beyond, and after traveling with our toddler for 12 hours it meant a lot to my wife and I. Thank
You to Jose at Burger Joint for being exceptional. P.s the burger was incredible."}
{"text":"I must say I had higher hopes for this place. The burger I ordered was the jalapeño burger and it was absolutely flavorless. I ordered it medium and it came well done , I prob should have complained and returned it but whatever. I had the Tater Tots as a side and they were also pretty flavorless and just weird and not as crispy as I expected. They are also larger than expected but way overpriced at $6 basically you get 6-8 tots for $6. I mean come on, really ? What can those cost to make really. The Burger itself was actually seared so much that it tasted kind of burnt. The ketchup was made in house but tasted weird and sort of grainy. If the girl that was working there wasn't so nice then this would have been a 1 star review. 

Burger Joint , if you're trying to compete with places like Bachi Burger then you had better step up your game and figure things out. Or I hate to say it but you'll be closed within a year. Good luck!"}
{"text":"lousy, burger pattty way too small for the bun all i could taste was the bread, fries were tasty but a place called the burger joint with mediocre to poor burgers, wont be back"}
{"text":"Burger was juicy and fries were great. Worth the 8 mile drive from the freeway on our way back to Utah."}
{"text":"Quality of the food is really good. The burgers are seasoned and cooked to perfection. Their hamburger buns are nice and soft. Yes, like everyone has said the truffle fries are awesome. The tater tots are also very good as well. The onion rings are not soggy and flavorful too. :-)"}
{"text":"Mind boggling burgers.  I stopped for a burger here while visiting after riding the River Mountain Trail.  Hunger will lessen your choosiness, yet I stumbled upon the best burger I have ever eaten- and I've eaten a lot of burgers.   More expensive than the once - gray frozen puck you're used to finding?  Absolutely.   Pricier to be sure but so, so worth it.  You can tell they use high quality beef- the taste, the juice, the texture, was quite unlike any burger I've had- including hoity toity restaurants on the strip. I ordered the \"classic\" and it is indeed a classic, burger with the fix'in's you would expect, cheese (real cheese - white cheddar, onion strings- perfectly light and crispy, lettuce, tomato, and a nice bun.  I've ordered the A Poivre burger the next time and it was another level of incredible.  The truffle fries have A Lot of shaved truffle on them and are crispy and very very addicting.  The decor is not particularly exciting, but I don't eat decor and while it seems a bit pricey for a burger, the experience of eating said burger is worth so much more."}
{"text":"Just perfect. I love the selection of meat - black Angus, grass-fed organic, chicken, and vegan. Also the customizability of the burger options leaves a lot of room to mix things up. I had the grass fed beef and it was excellent. The jalepeno burger has a perfectly fried jalepeno and worked really well. Decent craft beer selection too. The cherry on top is that this place is dog friendly. Check it out!"}
{"text":"People on Yelp are such babies. This place is great! Yea it lacks ambience, and may look like a Thai Food restaurant turned into a Burger Place. But the food is consistent and the service never disappoints. In reality, that's what it's about when going into a burger restaurant. It's not Prime or Mastros on the strip. For you to get good food 9/10 times and then get bad food on the 10th means your experience is still an A. This is my family's favorite burger place in Las Vegas. Bummed they are closed for now but looking forward to them opening back up where we will continue to support locally owned businesses."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the food at the Burger Joint! I've been here 3 times in the past two weeks. Twice with the family and once with friends from out of town. Had had the blue cheese burger, bacon burger and the portobello burger. All have been Outstanding!  However the Truffle Fries are out of this world!  

You need to try this place - you'll make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were both in the mood for a burger tonight (Sunday) for dinner. I saw someone mention this place on the \"Yelp talk\" stating that they had organic grass-fed beef so I looked up the menu and the prices were very fair for top notch quality ingredients on a variety of unique and exciting burger topping creations. We almost didn't go because it's 25 min from where we live but it sounded so worth it, so we made the drive and are so glad we did! 

When we got there around 530pm, the whole parking lot was empty and so was the restaurant. Our waitress was the only one visible when we walked in, she was at the counter and walked up to us immediately with menus and sat us down at a booth spot. She got us our waters and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. Another couple walked in while we looked over the menu. Throughout our meal two delivery guys came in and had big bags of orders and a group of 4 came to dine in as well, so it was not empty the whole time! The place is dimly lit and very casual but still clean and nice. Not very big. 

We ordered the sweet potato tots with the Yelp check-in, the truffle fries, the fried pickles assortment, the 3am burger, and the red bird burger. 

You can choose a certified angus beef patty, an organic grass-fed beef patty, or an all-natural chicken patty with any of their creations listed on their menu. We both chose the organic grass-fed beef. 

The 3am burger was so juicy, it was dripping all over the place. He ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It was so A M A Z I N G. Everything about it was on point. 

My Red Bird Burger was also dripping all over the place, the yuzu BBQ sauce and cheese were so good. I asked for well done, it was perfect and still so, so juicy!! 

The truffle fries were really good. Amazing flavor. But we wish the fries were crispier!!

The sweet potato \"tots\" are not tots at all, they are huge and fluffy. Not bite-size and crispy. They are like mashed sweet potatoes in a deep-fried crust. IDK if that sounds good to you - it wasn't that good to us. 

The deep fried pickles assortment was really quite good. I feel the other veggies were even better than the pickles though. The batter was very light and super crispy. Yuuummmm!

Overall, it was worth the drive!! Love all the options they have on their menu, I want to try them all! the prices were super fair! The burgers were SO GOOD! And the service was very fast and very friendly. This place deserves to be busier than it was!! If you're looking for a big, juicy and gourmet burger check this place out!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time 4 days ago. It was so good that all I could think about was when can I go back and get another burger. 
My first trip had the double cheese burger and added bacon and a fried egg. I'm telling you this was one of the best burgers I've ever had. I would rank it in my top 2. 
Today I returned and tried the mushroom Swiss burger.  It was absolutely delicious. 
Their french fries are delicious too. 
I think I found my new favorite burger place. 
Only concern is their menu is mainly ala carte. You add what you want ie: bacon, fried egg, etc. 
The meals with an average burger run between $10 - $11. That includes fries and a drink. 
It's worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try the other night! We really enjoyed the almost fancy fries (I believe that is what they are called). Basically their version of \"animal fries\" and they were super yummy! 

We got a kids cheese burger for my son. It was yummy and perfect portion. My husband got the jalapeño burger and added an egg on top. He said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had! I got one of the specials of the night. It was ground pork with cheese, a chutney, and a Demi-glaze. So delicious! Tasted like a holiday meal! So yummy! My mom got a classic burger and she really did enjoy it.  She did have to ask them to make a new one as her medium burger was more like medium rare/rare. 

Definitely a great addition to the area and we will come back. It was just as good as any other gourmet burger like the habit, Anthony's gourmet burgers, or Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"On the decline. Was awesome, recent change in management and maybe owner not sure, has led to revised menu with a burger club card. Fries are still wonderful but the burgers seem to have suffered. Wait staff is friendly, music is awesome. I preferred the smaller simpler white menu. Feels more commercial and less caring now. Forgot to get a malt today but I hope they are still as good as before. This new black menu is bigger but not better."}
{"text":"This place was dead. Not a single person to n for hours, which makes me skeptical. I ordered a couple things to go because the kids were in the hotel room. 
I agree with other reviews that the burgers were fantastic we got a bacon cheeseburger and an Au one... we Also got some fries and the sweet potato tots. The fries were soggy which I like, but lacked flavor. It was like eating a potato whole. I loved the tots! They were soggy as well, but sooo good. 
The staff were great and nice, even though they might have been mad.... being it was so slow. 
I didn't like paying $40 for mediocre stuff. 
I really was hungry right after so grabbed some ice cream. Haha 
I give it a 3.5 stars. Not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I have ever tasted, and the prices are decent too! Definitely mouth watering"}
{"text":"This place is sort of tucked away in a strip mall, and if you're not in Anthem, it's a bit out of the way. It is worth the trip though, regardless of where you're coming from. At first glance, the prices may seem a little higher than some other establishments, but the quality is also a bit higher than many other establishments. The wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our burgers (my Jalapeño in particular was delicious) and the truffle fries were great (grated truffle on top!). The decor inside could maybe use a little spiffing up, but between the great food and the top notch service, it's definitely worth the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Located in the strip mall at Eastern and Sunridge Heights. Yum. Delicious food - unique burgers with your choice of USDA choice, grass fed beef or chicken. (There are also several VEGAN options!) Then choose your style. Husband chose the Red Bird - sub grass fed for chicken and add over medium egg. I had the portobello \"burger\" (VEGAN). Both burgers were delicious and BIG. Nice lemon (yuzu) flavor in the sauce on the portobello. 
Everything is a la carte. Side options include \"veggie\" and \"potatoes\". We chose the fried pickles. It was an assortment of fried pickles vegetables including pickles (little salty), carrots, cauliflower and jalapeno pickles. Yum - with a spicy siracha aioli. We also chose the Almost Famous Fries - reminiscent of animal style fries at In n Out, but with larger cut  fries and melted cheddar.
Servings of sides are very generous - we couldn't even finish half. 
Here's the constructive criticism- ambiance is like a cross between Dotty's Casino (minus the smoke) and Hardee's 20 years ago. Needs some unique decor to match the awesome menu. 
The beer selection - has room for growth. Would be nice to see some local brews on tap - or even bottled selection. 
Almost feels like a REALLY good meal with half-hearted decor, seating, lighting, background music, beer/wine. 
We will be back and hope to see this place make it and grow - need a niche to keep em coming in!"}
{"text":"My first mistake was going in at 12:15 on a Thursday afternoon, during the middle of lunch rush, to a place that has only been open a couple weeks. That one's on me. From there on out, on them.

Burger lunch special wasn't so special. Bun was warm and soft but HUGE and you had to search to find the small \"1/3lb patty\". Every bite was 3/4 bread and 1/4 everything else. I know it's the cheap lunch special, but at least make it somewhat tasty if you're going to advertise it in every building.

Fries were meh! Surprisingly long line just to refill your soda pop. Couldn't quite figure that one out.

Only good thing I can think of, great location and great vibe inside. Hope they figure things out and stick around so I can give it a second chance."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Was very good, ordered Chicken buffalo sandwich, chicken Swiss mushroom sandwich, fries, and sweet potatoes fries. Would certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"Good entry , dark but football was on sooo. I'm good saw grass feed in yelp and I'm here! Ha
Talked to dude about adding grass fed to sign outside. 
Really cool dude!
I ordered, so I'll fill you in on food...ok potato skins awesome , burger awesome, fries ( yea I was wondering about the hand cut fries) again awesome !
I'm stoked to find this place!"}
{"text":"Just okay

I have passed by the The Burger Joint several times, and have been wanting to stop in and get a meal. Well, today was the day.  

The staff at The Burger Joint are  friendly, accomadating, and even stopped by our table to ask us about our experience and offered to throw our trash away. 

All the food at the Burger Joint is cooked fresh to order.  The food is served piping hot, right to your table. Today, my lunch companions and I tried the Steakhouse Blue Bacon Burger, Bacon Cheese Burger, fries, and onion rings. The burgers were just okay, not bad but not great.  Maybe I was expecting more or maybe I ordered the wrong burger. The burger tasted as if it lacked any type of seasoning and I just didn't like the fries.

The service is great, and the prices are reasonable, you could do worse in a pinch."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Been here a few times and overall it's a place that I will visit again and again.  Hamburgers are big and could use a tastier bun but still good. Love their Chicago dog. Fries are ok but that is just personal taste.  One of the best places in the west valley for a burger."}
{"text":"Delicious burger with quality ingredients. Really nice to have an organic grass-fed burger option as well. Sweet potato tater tots were delicious as a side. Only reason for one star deduction is it is a bit pricey"}
{"text":"I had the cauliflower buffalo \"wings\", tater tots, and the portobello burger, everything was fresh and delicious. Our server Damian was friendly and knowledgeable. I will be coming back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Vegan options at at burger place! Say what!? The portobello burger is off the charts and the tots are a must have. They have so many vegan options for sides, you have to get them all. The staff are always friendly. Thank you for thinking about us vegans."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in they greeted us. They were very friendly and explained their menu. We got 2 burgers and the animal fries. Let me tell you they were cooked perfectly! The bread was soft the bacon thick and juicy! I would definitely come back again. Also we had service we haven't received in years! They constantly were checking on us. I would give them 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are some of the best burgers in town and definitely the best burgers this far south of the strip. Make sure to try their hand breaded fried veggies !!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time to the Burger Joint. I called in the order and my husband picked it up. We ordered the brewburger. It was awesome! Full green chilies and wonderfulness. We also had chili cheese fries and fried zucchini which were also both great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I drove across town to come and try out there food because they had such great reviews. When I got there, I ordered so many items because it all sounded so good! SO-


Food was great-
 we selected a few things from the menu that were vegan friendly and WOW. The mushroom burger was so juicy and had so much flavor, it probably was the juiciest burger I have has since becoming vegan. I personally wish there was less bun- but honestly that is just my preference. Maybe I will ask if having everything in a lettuce wrap is an option. FRIED PICKLES WERE AMAZING, I have been on this fried pickle kick- these were the tastiest most perfectly fried pickles I have had in a while. Tater tots were great, had this sweet taste to it but overall was really good. 

Service was good-
The young lady who was serving us was very nice, and also the cook- greeted us as we walked through the door! I'm assuming he was the owner, you can tell he really wants his clients to be comfortable and feel welcomed. I appreciated that


Location- 
If you are like me, if the food is great- I really don't care where it is or how it looks inside. However, if you are someone who cares about the ambiance and décor you may not be as comfortable with the Burger Joint. Take in mind they haven't been open very long, and it doesn't have a restaurant like décor. Plain tables, and no real theme. I didn't mind because the food and service made up for that aspect.

Overall it was a great try, because I live so far I probably would not drive back out to that side of town just for Burger Joint- but if I was in the area then YES I would definitely head here. Vegan/ Vegetarian options that taste delicious, a more down to earth approach, and good service. 

Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon burger with the organic grass-fed beef and it was delicious! I couldn't decide on a side so I ordered both the tots and the truffle fries to try some of each and both tasted great! The fries came with actual truffle shavings on top which is a huge plus in my book. Food came out quickly and the service was excellent. I thought the prices were extremely reasonable, especially considering the food quality. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow what a great burger!!!
Everything was so fresh and delicious....can I come back today???
I had the bacon burger with the bacon Mayo on the side (also asked for a side of secret sauce) as well as a basket of hand cut fries!!!! 
Just so damn good!! 
My husband comes regularly and says it's the BEST BURGER IN TOWN!!!
They also have craft beers and sangria....do yourself a favor and stop in today!!"}
{"text":"This joint is always clean & they have extra friendly staff. Also, they serve fresh 100% Angus beef never frozen meats. They add Thousand island dressing on burgers & THAT is a hallmark for burger joints. Love the prices for the quality juicy grilled melted cheese burgers! Their Italian beef was moist, soft and juicy as well. P.S Endless french CRISPY fries."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and the best onion strings ever and a glass of wine. Atmosphere is cozy and very clean. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dude so freaking good . The burgers are made to perfection . I go there every other day . The cook is amazing and the staff is helpful"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to get this place in a true grade but going with three stars because it's in a wide 2-4 range 

The good

The Cashier/Waitress, she was friendly and attentive not overly talkative and warm/welcoming but she did her job just fine representing the place 

The ingredients and the flavors. You can tell that they use quality ingredients and the flavors on the truffle fries and even my patty melt were good

The Bad

When I asked for Ice-T they didn't have any just had the honest tea half-and-half lemonade/iced tea in a bottle. I would think in today's age where people don't drink soda like they used to they would have a ice tea option maybe? If you're going to have Honest Tea in a bottle maybe should try just for the tea ones vs half-half

The price is very high and I get it they use quality ingredients. I got out of there for 17 bucks and I got the free truffle fries which would've been nine dollars more so would've been $26 for a burger/fries and drink and thx-tip. That's the same level of cost at the burger bar at Mandalay and for a local place, that's crazy, your flavors were good but you're never going to be on the level of the burger bar Mandalay

The real reason why this is a three star and not a four-star and probably should be a two star  is the actual cooking job on my burger. 

I asked for my burger medium and I don't have issues with medium rare, but this was so pink, the blood juices ran into the bread and made that near impossible to eat as it was falling apart in my hands. Still tasted good I wasn't going to send it back, but as I was about ready to leave I saw a man walked up and handed back his burger and said this is the pink in the middle and he has ordered medium....the same thing that was happening to me so obviously the cook has a major issue of understanding what medium is

I don't know maybe they're just having a bad night but there is only three people in there eating, so it's not like he was too busy to cook the hamburger all the way through

Like I said, good flavors and quality ingredients with ok service could have got this 4 stars with better execution and if it wasn't that tasty, would have been a 2 star

This is worth giving it another shot but that experience is going to mean it might be a once every 2 to 3 to 4 months place instead of an every 2 to 3 to 4 weeks place"}
{"text":"Wow, food is a little more pricey than your average burger place, but worth it! Delicious burgers and fries...I will definitely be splurging here from time to time!"}
{"text":"This place is f*cking good. They shave their own truffle so I had them make truffle tator tots and they were OMG!!! Yumm. Vegetarian options were great. I had cauliflower wings. Hubby loved his burger."}
{"text":"FINALLY A GREAT BURGER JOINT, no pun indented, IN HENDERSON.  I had the 3am Burger and Tater Tots and they were completely out of this world.  The burger was prepared perfectly, the egg was a perfect over medium and the sauce served with the home made Tater Tots was insane.  This is a must visit and it will be your new favorite burger place."}
{"text":"So the food here gets 5 stars--you can tell they use quality ingredients and everything tasted delicious! My husband and I shared the 3am burger and the jalapeño burger though they really aren't meant for cutting and sharing--they become messy. Both burgers had great flavors. The hand cut fries were perfectly salted and tasty. We also tried the fried pickles which were cut differently--lengthwise-and the batter and sauce was really good. Kids burgers were much better quality than most places. The reason I give this place a 4 instead of 5 is that is was unbearably warm inside the restaurant. It was 103 outside and felt like 95 inside the restaurant--I was sweating while I ate which didn't make for a comfortable meal. Food was great, just wish they had cranked up the AC so we were comfortable as we ate!"}
{"text":"I like burgers a lot. This one sucked. Super messy. Had too much sauce that they use. Fries were ok. I had called ahead to place an order, & it was on time. That, & friendly service was the highlight, but won't return for the food."}
{"text":"Excited to see a gourmet burger place here in Anthem.  It is in a plaza that is only 3/4 full without a national anchor tenant.

Ordered the 3AM burger which at $14 if executed properly would be worth it.  Unfortunately it was not.  The burger was ok.  You can tell that they ground their own meat as there still lots of \"crunchies\" in the meat.  I normally don't like it when the bun is too big for the patty but in this case the bun is way too small for the patty and you end up at the end with 3 bites of meat with no bun.

Also ordered the sweet potato \"tots\" and like the others said it was kind of a rip off.  I got 7 tots for $6.  And they weren't really tots.  It was fried, lightly coated balls of mashed sweet potato.  I appreciate that you know that the ingredient is fresh, but again it is lacking execution.

I really hope that the owners are seeing this and will take the construction criticism and adjust accordingly because I would really like to see them succeed."}
{"text":"Don't you hate it when you find something good, but it's out of town?  My husband and I were on a road trip, and we wanted a burger.  I found the Burger Joint on Yelp, and they did not disappoint! The bacon cheeseburger and fries were all kinds of right.  Juicy, well seasoned, and delicious. 

If you are ever in Henderson, NV, stop in and give this place a try.  You'll be glad you did :-)"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely crushed that I'm reviewing this so low. I was so excited to try it and we're out of state too so us choosing here meant we were putting faith into it...big mistake. I'd like to start by saying the positive: the waitress was nice and the burgers were really good- I had the blue cheese burger. BUT it didn't at all make up for the rest. We tried a lot of appetizers and all were very meh. But the POUTINE WAS DISGUSTING. INEDIBLE. And f'ing expensive! I love poutine usually, I've had it many times in the US and in Canada it's even better. This? A sorry excuse. The gravy wasn't gravy. More like watery duck juice. You heard me. Duck. It's not just the \"sauce\", there's ACTUAL fatty DUCK LIVER ON the poutine. I didn't know what it was and almost puked when I ate it. I'm an adventurous eater too. The cheese curds weren't cheese curds either. They were cut squares of cheese, not curds. I'm so incredibly disappointed. Burgers were good, everything else- N O P E. Not worth it. Will not be coming here again. In the words of my friend who ate with me, \"The best thing about this place is you can leave\"."}
{"text":"Wow, I was craving a good burger and my nephew wanted to try this place so we went yesterday. The lady at the front was very nice and attentive, I wish the food was as good as the service. I ordered a reg cheeseburger no special sauce and mustard instead. Lets just say it was a mustard burger, mustard literally dripping at the seams, like the guy took a ladle and slopped it on there! Mustard is pungent, spread thin on bun after you lightly butter it and toast on grill. The onion was cut way thick like it was to make onion rings, but I would've been ok with that, the bread was old, dry and falling apart all over the place, the \"angus beef\" pattie, dry and flavorless as can be! Haven't had a burger this bad in years. The fries looked ok but didn't taste good, tasted of old oil. Never again! One star is too much! Stomach ache. Waste of 18.00 for two."}
{"text":"Update... Had to edit my review after reading how they treat their employees and food. If knew they treated the raw food that way I would not have ate there. Never going back again..."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! We came in last Saturday and were greeted as soon as we hit the door. We sat down and received wonderful service from Alice. She explained each type of beef to us and recommended vegan options, since I do not eat beef. I chose the portobello mushroom and it was bomb! We also got the cauliflower wings and they are to die for!  You can taste the charbroil, the bun is soft and every burger I seen go out, looks exactly like the pictures on the wall!!  I will definitely be back! We have found our secret jewel!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. So glad I did. 

We were served by one of the owners and he made suggestions and told us about some items not on the menu. 

We started with the fried pickles appetizer. Very good sauce served with it and nice crispy batter. 

We tried the 3am burger, bacon burger, sea salt and pepper fries, and tater tots with truffle. The burgers were super juicy and had really great flavor. I loved the truffle tots and fries. They use real truffle and not just truffle oil like most places. 

Food and service are on point. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Tried the tots, truffle fries, cauliflower wings, potato skins, and the au poivre burger and ALL of it was great! The burger was perfectly cooked and the flavour was phenomenal. The cauliflower was just the right amount of spicy and the ketchups were a great addition to the different potato styles. We will certainly be back! Yum!"}
{"text":"Tater tots and fries were great. The vegan burger was pretty good and that's coming from someone who doesn't like mushrooms. i'd be awesome if they made their own vegan patty. I'd say the burger was a little too expensive though and I'm definitely willing to pay for food. I'd come back 1,000 times for those buffalo cauliflower wings though. 
It's so great to have vegan options so I really appreciate that. Service was super friendly and thoughtful.
I think they're doing construction? Idk. Don't expect much from the decor right now ;)"}
{"text":"We tried the portobello mushroom burger... Delicious! Great alternative to meat. We are not vegetarian or vegan, just like to switch it up every now and then. We also had the regular tots with siracha ketchup and sweet potato tots with truffle ketchup. Both were awesome as well. They also have a decent craft beer selection as well. The Burger Joint is a thousand times better than Bavarian Castle and Meat & 3 before that."}
{"text":"First time here. Double cheese and a malt. Both tasty and service was great."}
{"text":"Soooo good!!! Show this place some love! Came here on a whim for my birthday and will definitely be back. My wife isn't even a fan of burgers and she loved it. Definitely try the fried pickles and veggies plate, and the onion strings. The 3 am burger was really good with bacon, carmelized onions, and a sunny side up egg. And these guys will cook your patty exactly the way you want it. My medium rare was perfect"}
{"text":"Yummy! Perfectly cooked mid rare burger with lots of tasty bacon. Fries are good but could have been crispier. I like that there's no salt and pepper on the tables. Says the chefs are confident in their seasoning. As they should be. Everything was seasoned perfectly. Will definitely be back! Oh, and rolls of paper towels on the tables. Good call!"}
{"text":"When I walked in, the impression I got was exactly what the establishment's name suggests: it's just a burger joint.  The staff was nice.  It was unique for a small burger place to have someone walking around checking on everyone like a restaurant, clearing tables, and helping out. The food was cooked to order and everything tasted fresh. I also really liked the sweet potato fries. My grandmother enjoyed her chicken bacon ranch sandwich, as well.  This place is new, so not many people have posted reviews. I hope more will have a good experience like I did and share with Yelpers."}
{"text":"Burger Joint! 

I enjoyed my first experience at Burger Joint 4 months ago.  They were new, my Yelp friends were checking in, and Shirley B. raved about them.  So, I just had to come by because I'm FOMO and I love a good burger. I had their Double Classic CAB (Certified Angus Beef) with just cheese because I like to keep my burgers simple.  This burger was a beast.  It was thick, juicy, and had all the flavors that remind me of a good home cooked backyard burger.  I loved it.  I also had a side of tater tots. These little bad boys aren't so little.  Each tots is the size of a large marshmallow. They are fried to perfection and compliments the burger well.  I was so full on my first visit that I couldn't even breathe.  On my most recent visit, I decided to build my own burger.  A BYO is not on the menu, but they'll do it if you ask.  I started off with the Classic CAB, added bacon, cheese, and a ground chicken patty.  This was good and hit the spot, but I think I'll just stick to the Double Classic CAB in the future.  

Burger Joint offers more than just classic style burgers.  They have specialty burgers too. The 3AM Burger (burger, sunny-side up egg, peppered bacon, roasted tomato, onions, & hollandaise sauce) is a popular pick.  Prices for a burger start at $9.00 and can get very expensive if you start to pile on the add on's. Bottom line, expect to pay about $15 when it's all said and done.  In my opinion, this isn't a lot considering that you get quality Angus beef and the portions are huge.  The same burger would set you back about $25 on the strip.  The restaurant itself is very clean and the staff is amazing.  Burger Joint has a 4 star average on Yelp.  Overall, I can't argue with these Yelpers.  4 stars from me too. 

TIP #1:  Check In on Yelp for free fries or tater tots. 
TIP #2:  Extra chicken patty is $1.50
TIP #3:  Their secret sauce has a kick to it.

2017 Yelp Review #34"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I age there. I remember being unimpressed by the place when I entered. I wanted to leave. And I was empty. My father said we should stay and check it out. I'm glad we did.  The reviews are right on. This was a a five star burger. It was delicious as were the fries.  Little gem in my neighborhood.I will be back."}
{"text":"Its A-OK, but its not fantastic. 

Walking in on a Sunday evening you would think a place with high marks would have more than 0 people in it. Walking in i was a bit surprised that the walls were drawn on with crayon and markers, as it was not very creative for a decor direction. If the place was a kids spot, or even a cheaper fast food style option for a burger then maybe but not when i am paying $10+ for a burger and an additional $4+ for a side of fries or tots. I ordered the \"Bacon\" for $11, medium rare, and it came out cooked as such. Presentation was in a plastic basket where again if your at a fast food spot then fine, but not a $10+ burger as the presentation on your website on the cutting board is so much more appropriate and creative. The burger tasted just ok also, the meat wasn't wowing me with flavor or seasoning, but the bacon and fried onions on it had to come in and save the day/burger. I ate my meal happily but knew half way done that i would not return here for all the reasons above. Even if i am just going for a burger, id like to not feel like i am sitting in a cafeteria in elementary school (decor). And feel like i couldn't have had a better burger from Habit Burger for half the cost. If you live close then maybe this spot is for you, but there are too many better options closer to my home to ever come back here."}
{"text":"I will readily admit that the food was not perfect, but I was surprised and very impressed by a particular part of my meal. It tipped the rating balance for me.

Burger Joint is a Henderson burger restaurant located on the opposite end of a plaza from the more well-known local spot CRAFTkitchen. With the dark tables, relatively dim lighting, TVs, and music covering mostly the past two decades (the other couple dining rocked out to System of a Down's \"Chop Suey!\"), the place has a bit of a sports bar feel, sans the bar (although beer is offered).

Shirley B. suggested that I would have a better meal here than at a new chain restaurant over by Green Valley Ranch, and by golly she was right. My Bacon burger ($11) was cooked perfectly medium-rare and was quite delicious with the combination of Duroc bacon, cheddar, crispy onion, roasted tomato, and bacon mayo. The locally baked bun was light and not only held everything together neatly, but also soaked up the meat juices that had started pooling on my plate. Lack of sweetness aside, very few burgers in this price range ($9-14) which I've tried are significantly superior.

The best part for me was actually the free-with-Yelp-check-in fries. I was allowed to pick from three of the potato sides, and I went for the Almost Famous Fries ($7 normally). The written description of caramelized onions, three cheeses, and secret sauce didn't really ring a bell, but the bite screamed In-N-Out Animal Style fries, except with thicker, more delicious fries. The sauce seemed so familiar at first, but I detected a bit of a horseradish-esque zing here and also felt that it could be a bit sweeter than my usual fare. As a complement to my burger, these fries certainly made up for any lack of sweetness.

The chef was right that the portion size is intended for sharing. After finishing my burger, I had to box half of my fries to-go, lest my dessert plans be derailed completely. I agree with others that the fries are not very crispy, but that's not my main priority when I'm dealing with fries smothered in loads of toppings. I would have been more critical if I'd had the simple salt and pepper fries and they had come out limp.

I'll have to start stopping by Burger Joint after work and/or when I'm in the mood for a burger. With a multitude of other apps/sides, five other regular burgers (and rotating specials), a variety of premium (or ultra-premium) add-ons, and chicken and portobello burgers, they should tickle my novelty bone enough as long I don't visit unreasonably frequently."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim and it was so good! We had Roasted Portobello Burgers with Tater Tots. The burger was amazing - a big juicy mushroom with lots of avo and super yummy roasted tomatoes. The tots are huge, crispy and come with this spicy ketchup that I could eat on anything. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Burgers are fresh! As advertised.
Their SPF (sweet potato fries) are tasty 
Nice little lunch spot. Service is fast and the selection of food is great. Would go back again especially for the SPF so good."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident.  It's tucked away in a strip mall and looks very unassuming.  My buddy suggested, what I thought was this place.  In the end it was another place but man-oh-man were we pleasantly surprised.  

I have only had the standard burger each time that we've come here, but my wife has had the blue cheese burger and the bacon burger.  All three times that we have gone all the burgers were phenomenal.  

Tonight we did the truffle fries and the tater tots.  Both potato dishes were gourmet.  The last time that we came we shared the poutine fries.  These poutine fries will ruin it for any other poutine fries that you will ever eat.  

Go to the BURGER JOINT... You won't be sorry.

{"text":"Very delicious food! You can tell they make everything in house. I had the jalapeño burger, which was juicy and delicious, the hand cut fries, as well as a sharing of their tater tots to start. Everything was tasty and I loved the dipping sauces to compliment. Good quality, friendly service. Great neighborhood burger spot!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!! I had this place bookmarked, and we were in the area. My husband was driving in the rain, so I was naming off a few places for him to choose. As soon as I read 'Burger Joint' he made his decision. 

We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and were invited to sit where we wanted. They had a few TVs with the Packers vs. Falcons playing, so that was cool. Our waiter could not have been more professional. He brought us waters without us having to ask, and then showed the both of us some highlights on the menu. 

We chose to split a Bacon Burger, medium-rare, and hand cut fries. They split the burger for us, and put each in its own tray. The food was awesome. My husband devoured his. He declared this his 'favorite burger place'. The fries were very tasty. We could not have asked for a better burger or service. Top notch on both. Even the chef thanked us before we left. To us, this place seemed like it would fit in perfectly in any trendy neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place was really good!! I had the Crazy Greek. It was made very quickly and was a great burger. I'll be back to try the feta fries."}
{"text":"Jose Navarro greeted me and gave me several popular selections.  I went with the classic cheeseburger and potato skins.  The hamburger was medium rare with pink in the center. I was concerned about their sauce but it was delicious and not overwhelming.  The beef is coursely ground so it has a wonderful taste.  I think the beef quality is one of the best that I've tasted.  The potato skins were delicious and had plenty of tasty bacon bits.  Since I was one of the few customers, Jose refilled my glass and brought me some ranch dressing to go with my potato skins.  I think that location does not have the heavy traffic that the stores close to Smith's grocery store has but I think word of mouth will help.  Maybe more coupons being sent out."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience at this restaurant tonight!!  I've been there before but it has been a while and only for lunch.  Tonight we got there around 8pm and ordered a kids cheeseburger and italian beef.  The burger was not anything great and our italian beef was cold and put on a bun all folded together meat was still not even separated.  I brought it back and asked for it to be heated and seperated since it was cold and not presented very nicely. (You would think the aim would be like Portillo's) It was was brought back very nicely but the sauce on it in the bun was wet with the saltiest au jus I've ever had in my life.  We are from Chicago and it is appalling to go to a place like this that claims to use fresh ingredients and everything else.  The food was awful!!  They could do so much better if their food actually tasted good and their staff had some personality when they spoke to their clientele as well.  Never going back!!"}
{"text":"I have been twice during the week for the spicy feta fries. First time I ordered they were busy and the order took about 5 minutes...not bad...the fries were good. Second time was a mess...ordered, waited waited and waited until I started noticing that people who ordered 5-10 minutes after me were getting their food. So I asked the girl and she walks over to the back area and magically appears with my order of feta fries. No \"sorry for the inconvenience\" or anything other than \"oh here it is\"....but the fries were good...not worth being 15 minutes late to work good, but they were good. 
Based on the other reviews of them not being able to stay open during their indicated operating hours, who know how much longer they will be around. I may go back and try the blackbean veggie burger..not sure there was really a \"need\" for another burger place downtown ...but I'm a vegetarian so maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"Wow! NOW THIS is the real deal! I decided on the 3am burger and hubby got the bacon burger (I forget the name). No kids menu, but the waitress (a mother herself) had some custom sliders made for us. You can upgrade your beef to grass fed organic, and let me tell you, this meat is so juicy. If I could give more than five stars, I would. Love love love little joints like this! They make their burgers with love and the chef even came to ask how everything was tasting."}
{"text":"The food is good; but, it always varies a bit on how saturated with oil it is. Otherwise, the food is much better than fast food at a near comparable price."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying 5 stars is an understatement. First time in here and it wasn't busy at all (this place should be busy from open to close). Great service. Good pricing. And the best part... the food. Our waitress explained the menu to us and answered all our questions. I had the jalapeño burger, tater tots, fried portobello strips, and a beer. Everything we had was exceptional. Definitely will be back and will recommend to all."}
{"text":"Wow I was pleasantly,  and not so pleasantly,  surprised by this burger joint. The price was high in my opinion but the burgers were really good."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best burgers I have ever had(and I have had a lot). Highly quality ingredients in a low key, simple atmosphere. Had the bacon burger and my girlfriend had the classic original. Everything is made to order and tested fantastic. This place puts Bachi Burger to shame. Will be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit nervous about coming here after reading a few reviews; well I think everyone is entitled to their opinions here is mine:

Came in today for the first time, order the jalapeño burger grass fed  delicious . As a side I order the tater tots and fries with truffle! Outstanding.. 
Jasmine was our server, she was so delightful and extremely helpful! 
Overall outstanding service and delicious food. If I'm ever in town and want a delicious burger I will come here!! Thanks burger joint for the great experience! Kudos to Jasmine :))"}
{"text":"Although hidden on your way up Eastern to Anthem, this tucked away craft burger spot is definitely worth the hide and seek! Definitely a contender for best burger in town. The 3AM is great, perfect medium rare or \"occasional\" as they refer to it. They are a bit messy but who cares, they're juicy and full of flavor! Lets be honest bacon, fried egg and hollandaise sauce...how can you go wrong? The fried pickles and jalapeños are light and airy with a tempura batter, although we preferred it with ranch versus the aioli. The hand cut fries and kids sliders were a hit. Fries were perfect crisp bite with a fluffy center. You can definitely tell by the menu the chefs have fine dining backgrounds, which they've translated into burgers. If you get chance, go check them out!"}
{"text":"Om....nom nom nom....ok, I have been here twice in the past 48 hours, that is saying ALOT. I am a burger snob, this place rocks. I've gotten the classic, the portobello, the hand cut fries, the tater tots, the potato skins....ALL DELISH! I wish they had sour cream for the skins, but that really is my only complaint. The owners are great, I truly hope they make it, it is a little hard to find, unless you're familiar with the Plaza."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night...

We ordered two burgers, one classic and one bacon.  The burgers looked good, they were cooked as requested temperature wise, but were way too salty.  I did eat mine, however my wife had a hard time with hers because it was way too salty for her.  

The fries were good, a little dry but was fixed with some ketchup.

We really like this place but not sure why everything was over salted.  We have never experienced this before and it was really sad.

We will be back to this place it was sad we could not enjoy it as much as we were hoping for last night."}
{"text":"Excellent Burger!!!! Jalapeño Burger was way better than I ever expected.
Truffle Fries are a must. This place murders the Burger Competition
Unfortunately they don't have the Big Dollar location and budget. If you like burgers this place is a must try!!! Service was very attentive."}
{"text":"After a hiking adventure up in Seven Hills, it was time for a burger adventure. Where I had been a tour guide on the hiking adventure, Yelp was a tour guide on my burger adventure. After reading some reviews with the cumulative 4.5 star adventure, after the hike it was off to Sunridge Heights Shopping Center to set off on a burger adventure in the Burger Joint. 

  When we stepped inside Burger Joint we were in the culinary home Chefs Damian Altamirano and Chef Jose Navarro. These two chefs have an impressive resume under their belt. Their experience includes opening Tableau at Wynn and Old Homestead in Ceasar's Palace. Additionally Chef Damian Altamirano spent 14 years working with Chef Jean-Marie Josselin who is known as a pioneer of Hawaii regional cuisine. 

  Understandably, the prices are high. When I say high my burger and bottomless Coke added up to around $20. If it weren't for the Yelp Check-in offer for complimentary hand cut fries, a burger meal would be around $25. But I only live once, so it was a burger adventure at a higher price of admission. 

  Inside the culinary home of Chefs Damian Altamirano and Jose Navarro, they made us feel at home. We were greeted right away and throughout the adventure our waiter checked up on us. This is a relatively small restaurant. I think that the waiter was also the chef. For all I know he might of been Chef Damian Altamirano or Jose Navarro. Because we were the only ones dining here on this late Saturday afternoon, we felt as if we the personal  guests in a talented guests home. If I were facing away from the door, my eyes would take in the open kitchen where the talented chef was creating his burger masterpiece. I have said a few times that open kitchens represent good customer service because I the guest am confident that their is no skulldugery going down in the kitchen. The waiter further exemplified great customer service when my dining companion didn't care for the style of fries that he ordered. The waiter had zero problem replacing this with a different style of fries. 

  The menu was vegan and burger friendly. If I was a Vegan this menu would suit me. The vegan menu includes fried potatoes with bean hummus, cauliflower wings, and a roasted  portobello burger. But the closest I am to being a Vegan is a Las Vegan. I am a Las Vegan that was up to a thick juicy burger. 

  When I ordered the burger, I was aware of a certified Black Angus or organic grass-fed beef option. I chose the former. I decided on the bacon burger (surprisingly a simple name). At $11 it included duroc bacon, cheddar cheese, crispy onions, roasted tomato, cracked pepper, and bacon mayo. The burger also included Sir Kensington ketchup. Without hesitation I used the Yelp Check-in offer for the complimentary hand cut fries that I will write again normally cost $4. These are hand cut fries featuring fresh cracked black pepper and sea salt. Fast forward to the end of the meal, my impression was that the Burger and hand cut fries were solid. 

   With the Burger Joint burger adventure behind me, in retrospect I write that it was a highly rated restaurant worth trying. It was an enjoyable experience spending part of a late Sunday afternoon being a guest in the culinary home of Chefs Damian Altamirano and Jose Navarro. Enjoyable experiences are what adventures are all about."}
{"text":"Burgers are better than average, and I wish I could say they were great. The service here is outstanding. The people that own/work here are super nice. The house made sangria was the best ever. Awesome people, decent food."}
{"text":"Good solid burger, jalapeño burger is tasty!  Truffle fries are great!!!!  Fresh ingredients and you can have different types of quality beef.

Simple spot in the Henderson area with a chill atmosphere.  Service is great too!"}
{"text":"Tucked in a strip mall, it was kind of hard to find, but like the end of a rainbow you find the pot of gold or in this case a plate of good burgers. It's a very casual joint-almost sports bar like, playing throwback 90's early 2000 songs. The place is very clean though and our server was really friendly and helpful. I opted for a bleu cheese burger with an egg on top and it was juicy and flavorful. Something about an oozing yolk on a well made burger just elevates the whole experience. I would come back and try out some more burger selections and just hang out for the music. Prices are justified as the burgers are more upgraded ( organic and grass fed beef ), but still reasonable for someone to try out at least once."}
{"text":"This (burger) joint is serving quality eats while tucked away in a quiet, but packed shopping center near Anthem. It's a very casual space with minimal decor and amenities. The open kitchen is very small with an intimate order counter. I think it's great to have a no-fuss spot and still be able to eat elevated food.

Stuffed Mini Peppers ($7): Peppered goat cheese, pimenton aioli
Hand Cut Fries ($4)
Truffle Fries ($9): Parmesan, chives, truffle ketchup
Tater Tots ($6): Chives, onion, Sriracha ketchup
Classic Burger ($9): Lettuce, tomato, onion, White American cheese, secret sauce
Au Poivre ($12): Brandy-three peppercorn sauce, crispy onion, jack cheese
3AM ($14): Sunny side-up egg, Duroc bacon, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, hollandaise

I'm really impressed with their fries and for me, that alone makes this place worthwhile. The housemade fries are delicious by itself, seasoned simply with sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper. And they take it up a level with their version of Truffle Fries. Most restaurants serve \"Truffle\" Fries doused in that (usually) overwhelming truffle oil and I am not a fan. When I found out that Burger Joint was using real truffles, I was immediately impressed and so ecstatic to see the nugget of truffle shaved on the fries. The truffle ketchup is unnecessary, but still nice. The Tater Tots is another impressive item as these tots are housemade and very delicious!! I like the Sriracha ketchup, but like the truffle ketchup, I can do without it.

I've had the Classic Burger twice and it's really stellar. The quality of the meat really shows and it's a very tasty patty. Plus, the addition of White American Cheese, secret sauce (think INO sauce, Thousand Island or Russian dressing), and the fluffy black sesame buns really make this one of the better burgers I've eaten. The Au Poivre and 3AM Burgers, on the other hand, did not excite me. They sound like they'd be amazing and I really appreciate the ingredients and thought going into these creations, however, it just fell flat.

It's been a while since my last visit and I'd love to return to try the Cauliflower Wings and some of the newer menu items like the Crispy Portobello, Poutine, and Almost Famous Fries."}
{"text":"Quality burgers in a casual atmosphere. They put an interesting twist on the popular egg and bacon burger by adding a sweet chili Demi glaze; the perfect contrast to the rich yolk that oozes from the fried egg! Fries were good and plentiful. Limited menu but I like a place that sticks to a few things and does them well."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm disappointed today. I ordered a medium rare blue cheese burger and it was cooked very well done.  It was dry and flavorless and for the price I think his will be my last visit. My friend's burger was overcooked as well and she said the same thing. Also the table next to us were having issues with their order...first the wrong burger was brought out to them, then he was complaining that his jalepenos were cold as if taken from other burger sitting around.

The fries were more burnt and dry than normal so I would have to say maybe the chef was having an off day. Thankfully he comped our meals without us asking so that was awesome for sure. I only took one bite from my burger before I had to stop and wasn't planning on eating more.

I had really high hopes for this place but I don't want to risk every visit not getting consistent food. :/"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 4 stars because of their confusing hours. I never know when they are open because the hours are constantly changing. 
I didn't expect to like this place as much as I did but the burgers are great. I ordered a hot mess burger and it was really good. I wish they would have asked how I wanted it cooked, or better yet I wish I would have told them how I wanted it cooked but none the less it was great."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place to see what's new.  I'm not a burger fan, but wanted to see what else the menu offered.  Burgers and more burgers.  There is a grain/bean burger for those who want a meatless choice.  That's the only veggie choice, in fact.

I passed on the burger, though, and ordered sweet potato fries.  I have since been back to order them again, so this review is for the sp fries.  Although they are cut thinner than I prefer, they are nicely crispy and stay crispy.  $4 for a decent amount and they're addictive.

The place is spacious and has 2-3 tellies to entertain.  The wood tables are nicely varnished and there is wonderful natural lighting pouring through all the windows.  

Young staff is friendly and the manager (or owner) greets the guests."}
{"text":"great food!!!! 1st time tonight! It was delicious!!! Great burger,great prices, great root beer float!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Service was great. Nice little, local spot to get a good cheeseburger for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"A friend and I were in the area and had a craving for a juicy burger. We arrived around 1-2pm and found seating right away. It's a small place and can see how it could be a wait if the restaurant was at half capacity. Looking over the menu, it is strictly a burger joint so don't expect much variety. You're given three choices of meat, along with several presets - the sides are ordered separate. My buddy and I chose the 3AM preset with CAB cooked Med and Med Rare, with fries and tater tots.

Burgers:
My buddy and I were excited to try the burger - sunny side egg with hollandaise sauce sounded fantastic. When we cut into our burgers, we were disappointed to find out our burgers were overcooked - both of ours were medium well.. borderline well. We asked the waitress if we could have them prepare some new pattys, but with the correct temperatures. She took them away and several minutes later, our new burgers arrived. We cut into the burgers once again.. and dismayed to see both burgers were overcooked again. Mine was closer to a Medium and his a Med-well. We were hungry at this point and decided not to complain again. On another note, I should've asked how many ounces each patty was - they were relatively small (if I'm paying $14 for a burger, at least be 6-8oz).

Sides:
The taters tots were interesting - they seemed like they were prepared inhouse. They were relatively big for being tots, but didn't have much seasoning. The sauce that came with it was subtle taste. The fries were nothing to really mention.

Overall, my buddy and I were dissatisfied with the whole experience. If you're strictly a burger joint, I would think getting temperatures on burgers would be a breeze. Out of four pattys, and couldn't get one temperature right... eh.The tots and fries were lackluster. We weren't full after eating the burgers + sides, but we just wanted to leave with the whole experience a total failure. Yelp let us down this time - we're not planning on returning to this restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"Super good! Had just the basic hamburger and it was probably one of the top 5 burgers I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"I was less than impressed with Burger Joint. I work in downtown Phoenix; there's no reason to go here when Five Guys is nearby and WAY better. 

I think I finished the burger, but tossed the fries. 

Sorry, I just can't lie to ya. I'm not going back, and I wouldn't take anyone here. 

Note: As of recently, this places closes at 3 p.m. That may change as the weather gets cooler."}
{"text":"OK, I came by here on a Friday night last week and decided not to go in as it was empty.  Why, I guess because it was empty for a Friday.  My friends and I decided to go to Bachi Burger instead. 

However,  this Saturday, I decided to go there and really enjoyed this place a lot.  They have quite a bit of items on the menu that are vegetarian or vegan, for those that need it, and yep I do!  However, the meaty bits are equally good.

1.  The burgers.  We had the jalapeno, the Au Poivre and also the Portobello Vegan Burger.  All were good and here are the key points:

a. Juicy - these things are dripping and oozing with juicy juiciness!  Nice and thick when it comes out with shredded lettuce, tomatoes and cheese.  The jalapeno was not too hot but just right. I ordered it medium rare and this was truly medium rare.  It was perfect and that is hard to find at many places.

b.  Size - Okay, the burgers seemed a bit underwhelming in size (roundness) and served in a plastic tray.  Did not seem too enticing at first, however, the Au Poivre was served on a plate because it was oozing with the pepper sauce.  The heights of all the burgers are really tall, and they have a toothpick in them to keep the burger together.  

c.  Taste - But, alas, looks are deceiving everything was very tasty and we were planning only to eat half of the burgers and bring the rest home.  However, it was so good, we gulped them down.  I don't think it mattered that they roundness was not too large, these were tasty.

2.  The fries - Almost famous fries.  With a yelp check in, it was free and this was a huge order of fries.  Grillled onions and sauce. Very nice.

3.  The drinks - OK, they have draft beer here so that was pretty darn satisfying.

4.  The place - Seems like a cross between a fast food place and one that is sit down and order. It it is set up almost like a order and pick up place, but they will seat you and give you a menu.

5.  Price - I think that you will still end up spending about 20.00 here per person between burger, fries and drink along with a tip.

Overall, very good and tasty and i will be back.  Having the Vegan offerings is also convenient...

GK says, check it outl"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Burger Joint as soon as they opened today so we knew we'd be the first ones there. We were warmly welcomed and, of course, told to sit anywhere. I'm a vegan but my friend is not. She enjoyed looking over the menu quite thoroughly while I had the sole main \"burger\" option for myself. She selected the patty melt medium rare and I had the portabello mushroom burger. We also decided to share an order of tater tots that come with a side of sriracha ketchup.

When our orders came, I was so pleased to see how perfectly cooked everything was. The portabello mushroom for my \"burger\" was cooked just right. Quite often they are so drippy, but this was not the case. The avocado was also divine. Nothing worse that a nasty avocado. 

My friend was also quite happy with her patty melt. She made a lot of yummy and mmm-mmm sounds so I'm guessing that was a good sign. ;)

I have to say I was a BIG fan of the Tater Tots. And loved the sriracha ketchup. I love spicy foods and this was just right. They don't add a ton of seasoning to the Tater Tots themselves, so you'll wants to add a touch of S&P, but that's it. These things were addictive, but so BIG! After that big portobello burger I really couldn't eat that many of the tots, even though we were sharing.

I really enjoyed our lunch here and even though we were early I was surprised that more people weren't coming in as we were leaving. I'm wondering if people don't want to pay for high quality ingredients (which they DO use) or if it's the fact that all they do is burgers? I'll be spreading the word, for sure, because even for a vegan? I really loved it.

Great job, Burger Joint. Thank you for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"One of the top burgers we have ever had! I had the farmer's burger with a fried egg and fantastic thick cut applewood bacon. Perfect fresh fries. We will definitely be back. The owner TJ knows his business, that's for sure! There is a green chile burger that looked really good - I'll try that next time!"}
{"text":"We were a little leery when we went in because the decor was very \"strip mall\" like. However the burgers were very yummy! Loved my bacon burger, add avocado. Super filling. They had a few craft beers and coke products. A definite do again. I hope they improve the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is an updated review since being contacted by management/ownership.First of all, I am please know that the ownership/management listens and didn't discount my review.  They listen, and I believe have corrected issue that I brought up to their attention.  I have eaten their twice since my discussion with with them.

I had the cheese burgers on each of those visits.  They where much better & juicer than on my previous review.   On my last visit my wife and I got a couple burgers to go with frys. I bring this up cause the fry were fresh and hot just like my wife likes them (when their not hot she make me take them back for hot ones)  I love supporting small business"}
{"text":"Can we talk about the appetizers?! I feel like I can talk about the apps more than I can talk about the burgers which is ironic considering the name, \"Burger Joint.\" 

The cauliflower buffalo wings dipped in the hummus was da bomb! Truffle tots, thanks to our fellow yelpers for giving us that exciting piece of the secret menu, were delicious!!!!! Like mash potatoes inside a truffle cylindrical exterior! Shooo guuudd!! 

Ironically, I was so phased by the appetizers, I wasn't feeling the burgers too much! The burgers were burgers, that's for sure! I mainly came on yelp to talk about the appetizers!"}
{"text":"Ooh! A fancy, but not so fancy place to get burgers in Anthem! I love the quality ingredients, but please for burgers and fries I've had more satisfying meals (shake shack, freddy's, even in n out) for half the price or less. My next cheat meal won't be wasted that's for sure. 

I was most impressed with their classic burger! With the secret sauce, onions, tomatoes, and lettuce it was like having a gourmet In n out burger. It would've been perfect if it was actually cooked medium. It was more like a medium rare. Ugh. 

The tater tots are a great accompaniment! These tots are massive! I had with truffles and it was delicious!  The fries are basic (don't forget your free fries with Yelp check-in).

The bleu cheese burger was okay (I love bleu cheese!), but I probably would not order it again. 

They have really good customer service here. No complaints there.

{"text":"Food was lack luster and customer service was poor. Three employees passed us by then two stopped to have a conversation behind the counter while we waited to place an order. After finishing their conversation they went to grab the third employee to man the cash register. He was so distracted by the other two employees we had to repeat our order three times while he continued to look behind him to catch some of the conversation. 

When our food arrived the order was wrong and we were missing an order of fries. We asked the employee who brought us our food to rectify this and he said he would. He went back to the cash register and forgot about us until we were finished eating. We told him to forget about the fries and left.  

Most likely won't be going back.  In and Out is a far better alternative- even though they're usually ten times as busy they're much more friendly, efficient,  and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It was good, customer service was ok - the gentleman was nice, also the same person to make the burgers, but the female was extremely dry -  I'm pretty sure she was annoyed we didn't sit down to eat, I'm sorry we wanted to order to go. It was also our first time there. We wanted to order 2 grassfed burgers and 2 fresh cut fries and we were told that the order of fries is shareable so we should just order 1 \"unless we're feeling hungry\"...(we were hungry lmao) ..so we did, but only to find out they weren't. That was pretty annoying. Burger was good but we wanted the grassfed burger and the cook told us that the \"all natural beef burger was fattier and better\". So that was also annoying. I'm not a fan of the seeded bun, I probably would've asked if they had seedless buns had I known it was seeded lol. We might be back."}
{"text":"My first 2-star review. I should have been wary when they initially advertised as a bbq/burger joint then ended up ditching the bbq.

I ordered an Italian beef, dipped, with hot peppers; and fries. Totally disappointing. The fries were indeed fresh but weren't all that great. The Italian beef was all wrong. The hot peppers were not giardinera but just marinated jalapeños. \"Dipped\" here apparently means just spooning some jus onto the beef. Regardless, had it been actually dipped, the jus would have made it way too salty. 

Saw them making burgers on the grill. Not hand-formed, looked frozen. You'd think that a place called Burger Joint Chicago would do the burger part or Chicago part well. At least on this first visit, I was impressed by neither."}
{"text":"I just had lunch here and have to say the burgers and tots are amazing. The owner - chef Jose does a great job. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"As this is a fairly new restaurant I think that the reviews are mixed due to the fact they are still finding their groove. I placed an online order to pick up food to go not always the best way to experience food first time however circumstances out of my control. 
I was greeted 10 seconds after opening the door and asked if I was dining alone the place was fairly quiet I told them I was picking up the server knew my name before I said it and stated it was being completed. Extra points for knowing all that!!
We ordered the Red Bird, Patty Melt, and Roasted Portobello which covered everyone's tastes hand cut fries and sweet potato tots. 
All of them were made to order and cooked to perfection, each with ample toppings flavorful and dripping with juicy deliciousness,even though they were transported they were still hot in tact and did not look like fast food burgers they remained well preserved and completely drool worthy...which leads me to believe a dine in experience would be even better!! 
The Sweet potato tots are mind blowingly good in my opinion not enough places off sweet potatoes as an option, Crispy on the outside soft and flavorful on the inside I could make a meal just out of these. Having Vegetarian and Vegan options is a win win as well.
I will return I will dine in and my only hope is that they continue to make great food and expand the menu you do what you do well now change it up offer a weekly special or seasonal twist lets keep it interesting, it gives us even more reason to come back!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town... and definitely one the top for Henderson! Fresh and tasty! They use Certified Angus Beef and have an organic burger option. Try the tater tots they are super good!"}
{"text":"(A about a month ago I visited this restaurant, sadly they are no more).  A great hamburger is a wondrous thing, Meat, bread, and salad all in one delivery system.  The burger joint makes a great burger. I was looking to try the gourmet burgers at a local Italian restaurant when I was informed they no longer featured them, luckily I remembered a news article on the 3 am burger at the  Burger Joint.

I started my meal with the stuffed mini-peppers. They come lightly breaded, stuffed with goat cheese and covered with a pimento aioli.  The effect is just fantastic, each one is fluffy, cheesy, and deliciously accented by the aioli.

The 3 am burger comes with a perfectly seasoned patty, peppered bacon, a grilled bun, roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions, a sunny-side egg, and is topped with hollandaise sauce. The combination is amazing and is close to burger perfection.  The service was at a high level, it was quick, considerate, and responsive. My coffee was quickly refilled and I was given a to-go coffee on my way out .  Simply a great meal."}
{"text":"Ordered here again tonight. Tried the cauliflower buffalo \"wings\" and those where amazing, my husband got the same burger with truffle and this time it was perfect, and I got the portobello burger also came out perfectly. This is a great place! Thank you for the good customer service!"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious!
The burgers were fantastic!
And they will cook them the way you like them, medium rare.
The fries and tater tots with homemade ketchup were great. 
The staff was friendly and spot on. 
I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow...this place was a definite winner.  Just around the corner from our friends' house so they recommend it.  The truffle fries were da bomb!  I had the burger with the egg on it and it was loaded...could barely get it in my mouth.  Very high quality ingredients and really great burger combinations.  A guy came out after the waitress took our drink order and explained the menu and all the substitutions they offered (chicken burger or portabella sub in any of the burger choices).  He may have been an owner because you could tell he was really knowledgeable and proud of the products they use.  He also thanked us when we left.  We also took a burger home for our friend and she reheated it several hours later and still loved every bite.  Hope this place sticks around so we can go again on our next trip."}
{"text":"Been there twice now.  Burgers and real good real fresh tasting.  The only thing I would improve on them is shredded lettuce, just think it goes best on burgers.

Fries didnt care for.  Onion rings frozen would never get them again.  good shakes, great sundea.

Service was ok,  staff still needs some training but they were very friendly."}
{"text":"Really good burger. Hand it fries above average. A bit pricey.  Quality of beef is apparent and 5 oz or so patty is ample.  Cooked to specification and juicy.  Lettuce tomato and onion was first rate."}
{"text":"I ordered the Maui (teriyaki) Burger with no lettuce or tomato, fries and a drink, and my boyfriend ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger meal so we could share both. The guy behind the counter was friendly and helpful. Our burgers were good, although I think the cheese stood out more than the teriyaki flavor. Love their fries--they are battered and yummy. We also enjoyed the music that was playing there. Need to try a hot dog next time!"}
{"text":"This place is located in a very unassuming strip mall, so I wasn't expecting it to knock my socks off, but it did. The chef (owner, I'm assuming) greeted us and helped serve us and was super friendly. I had the bacon burger and some regular fries. The fries were good but the burger was the real star. The patty was suuuper juicy and flavorful, the toppings were amazing and the bun was fluffy and perfect. I honestly can't stop thinking about this burger and I need to go back and get another one ASAP! They also have $1 Miller drafts during football... What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"I had a friend from SoCal visiting about a week and a half ago so we decided to take him here. He loves burgers and every time he came, we have to try a burger place. We decided on Burger Joint. Why? Because of the yelp reviews of course! 

We arrived on a Saturday night at around 7 PM. The establishment wasn't crowded at all...it was actually pretty empty. The odd part was, judging from their interior, I would've thought it was one of those \"order up front and sit down to wait for your order\" type of place but it's not. It's actually a sit down restaurant that offers waiter/waitress service.

We were seated fairly quickly, they got us waters, and we each took some time to look over their menu and make life changing decisions. Bonus tip: if you check in on Yelp, you'll get a check in offer! You get free fries! The check in offer allows you to choose between their hand cut fries, almost famous fries, or tater tots. We decided to give their almost famous fries a try, which had caramelized onions, three cheeses, and secret sauce.  

My boyfriend and I decided to share a burger. We decided to go with their Classic, which came with lettuce, onion, tomato, American cheese, and \"secret\" sauce. We also added avocado onto ours for an upgrade of $2. For all their beef burgers, their patties are certified black angus beef but they also have organic grass-fed beef for an upgrade of $2.50 if you so choose. 

I'm not a burger lover but Burger Joint may be my favorite burger place. The seasoning of their burgers are on point. The tenderness and juiciness of their burgers are fantastic. My boyfriend mentioned how the build of their burgers reminded him of our favorite burger joint in the Bay Area named Super Duper Burger. And I must say, it's quite close. The size of the burgers, however, are a bit on the smaller side as we have noticed. You definitely don't need to share. 

As for the almost famous fries, I can't say that I am a fan. I was never a fan of the animal style fries at In and Out either so it makes sense. The almost famous fries is pretty much a better made version of In and Out's animal style fries. I prefer my fries to be nice and crispy so with the sauce and cheese, they get a little on the soggy side. 

My friend got an order of the truffle fries for all of us to share and I must say, they were pretty good. The truffle flavor definitely makes itself known. It was nicely salted too! Though, their fries are a little bit on the thicker side. I prefer thinner and crispier fries, similar to the ones you get at Burger Bar or even McDonalds. So pretty much between thick French fries and shoestring fries. 

Overall, Burger Joint is delicious. It is definitely worth a try. The location may not be ideal for those from the Southwest but we did it anyways! I will definitely be coming back again for their burgers -- it may not be soon but it will happen."}
{"text":"Service could be a bit better, as for the food on point got the 3am was amazing from the bun, egg, bacon and cooked to perfection. If your looking for a good burger spot make sure to ck them out.

Only downside I wish each burger came with a nice side of fries and look forward to bringing my friends to try them out"}
{"text":"Straight burger joint with some interesting side options. I had the Classic, which was awesome, the wife tried the Portobello. She loved it. We had the cheese stuffed mini peppers and sweet tater tots and they were fantastic.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really great burgers. Companion ordered the \"Red Bird\" which is a chicken burger but she had it made with burger instead.  I tried the \"Au Poivre\" burger.  Both had exceptional toppings and the burger was fresh and mounded high.  The only drawback was that the roll was not substantial enough to hold all of the ingredients. The \"Tater Tots\"  were made fresh and excellent.  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"So we were on our way back home from Vegas when we decided to stop for lunch before we left. Wanted a good burger and this place did not disappoint. Great food. They source bread from a local bakery and the beef we ate was off the chain. If you order bacon on your burger it does not come crispy so if you like bacon well done be sure to ask for it. Fries we hand cut and cooked great. This is a local find and completely off the strip in Henderson but worth the 15 min drive out of the city."}
{"text":"In town from Milwaukee and wanted to find something that wasn't a major chain. Burgers were great! Had a patty melt and husband had 3AM. Loved the fried pickles which also came with some other fried pickled veggies that they pickle in house. Too bad this place isn't close to home!!! Service was also great and friendly!!"}
{"text":"I didn't like the food from this place. My daughter had chicken tenders and you can tell they were frozen. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome employees and the food was amazing!! The fires were crispy and delicious!!! I will totally go again and again"}
{"text":"I LOVE that Burger Joint has vegan options. The portobello burger on vegan bread is sooo good. What really steals the show are the tots though. OMG. Love that the staff understand vegan, take all possible measures to avoid cross-contamination, and deliver some reallllllyyyyyyy good vegan eats."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Delicious and creative menu. The burger was perfect. Hand cut fries delish. And the poutine.... Lets just say yum. Whether your a veggie (great vegan options) or an omni you must make this place a regular in your dining out rotation."}
{"text":"We got there at 2p and the place was empty. read good things on Yelp and saw a little clip about them in a magazine for up and coming burger joints.

My expectations were pretty high, Yelp hyped me up!  We ordered a portobello burger, 3am and a bacon one, I don't remember the name. I checked in and got a free French fries and we ordered the tator tots as well. 

Sadly I was disappointed. My portobello burger was just ok. Maybe I didn't read the description good enough but there was like a cold slaw in it and just didn't feel good biting into something sorta cold in my mouth. 

Hubby said his 3am burger was meh, he ordered it medium and it looked more on the done side, no pink in his burger.... however it looked amazing!

Our friend had the bacon burger and he said his was ok. He mentioned that the bacon had so much fat that it was almost hard to eat... 

The highlight for us, the tots!! Oh my, crunchy on the outside and fluffy and moist and delicious on the inside!! I would go back just for those!!  The free fries were over cooked and dry, but can't complain when they were free. 

The tots aren't enough to go back. But maybe your experience will be better than ours. Might have been a bad day, everyone has those every so often."}
{"text":"Came here because of Yelp! reviews and yes, I can honestly say that the burgers here are amazing!  The truffle fries -- YUM!  The 3AM burger (love the egg!) was juicy -- the buns just melt in your mouth.  Hubby had the Red Bird Chicken sandwich -- I took a bite, it was good but let's just say that I didn't trade my 3AM burger for his Red Bird.  LOL.  :-)  

I don't typically seek out a burger joint but next time if I'm craving a quality burger, I'll definitely be coming back to THE Burger Joint!"}
{"text":"The service was ok, the food tasted ok, the timeliness was ok. Overall just ok. My Smash Burger, drink (free refills), and sweet potato fries totaled to $12. It was worth a try but I don't think I'd come back.... On the bright side, it definitely is a better burger than what you can get from fast food chains!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the cauliflower, potato skins, and a patty melt- all were fantastic. The service was great, our waitress was very friendly. 

We can't wait to come back to try more of the food, we were very impressed."}
{"text":"I just came home from the Burger joint in Goodyear. Just opened this month. I went to 5 guys when yhry opened last year and there is NO COMPARISON between the two. I have never went back to 5 guys. Thier fries were terrible thier burger isnt half as good as the burger joint.  My wife and have aknack for picking food establishments that will be there in the next 5 years. well done burger joint , great food, great service

The Wrights"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! Can't remember the last time I was full from eating one hamburger. I had the bacon burger which I will definitely order again and my husband had the 3am burger and almost licked the plate!

Prices are a bit up there but well worth the money. This isn't your typical fast food joint.

Also ordered truffle fries which didn't tickle my fancy but the in house made tater tots did!

Place was pretty empty so service was great and fast!

If your looking for a delicious, filling, gourmet burger this is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Open less than a month and already with so many reviews, mostly positive, a testament for how burger hungry Henderson is.
I arrived half expecting a five guys type burger and was pleasantly surprised to see the quality ingredients.
I used my free check in offer to get fries with my bacon burger and ordered the onion ring appetizer.
The service here was as good as you can get, perhaps because there was only one other diner, but everything came out quickly and the server was very attentive.
The onion rings are the thin shoestring style which were tasty, if a little salty, but the menu didn't make it clear what style they were and I was craving the larger style onion rings. 
The burger came stacked high with tomato jam, bacon, cheese and a patty that was cooked medium rare despite my request for medium. (Note: I expect this from burger places so I always order medium burgers to make sure they arrive cooked enough.  I actually prefer the medium rare.)
The burger was too big to fit into my mouth so I admit I did use a knife and fork to make it more manageable. I also separated a piece of the burger from the toppings and found that it was well seasoned and held up on its own.  It is quality meat, not the usual filler stuffed ground.

Although stacked high, this burger was not a mess as in some of the popular chains, instead having just enough sauce to enhance the flavor without getting all over you.

I was not impressed with the fries, although they seemed to be fresher than most, they were oily and soggy.  I would try the tots next time as they look delicious.

The price point is a little high for a Henderson burger joint with the burgers running about $11.00 each without any sides and the fries 5-7 dollars each.  Perhaps once they start drawing crowds they will run a combination at a dollar or two savings.  

Expect to spend about $15.00 per person if you share the fries or tots.

Also their non-alcoholic drink selection is poor and overpriced.  I did not use this to affect the rating but want to mention it. I drink only unsweetened tea and water.   The Joint does not have regular or unsweetened iced tea.  They do carry Honest Tea but it was $3.00 and it was only half and half which well exceeded my sugar intake for the day.

Overall a welcome addition to Henderson."}
{"text":"So so good. From the second you walk in it's a friendly environment. Our server was so friendly and helpful. The sweet potato tots were to die for and I literally ordered three serving oops. We also got the French fries and onion strings and the French fries were French fries but the onion rings will make any onion hater a believer. 

The ranch dip tastes like it has Greek yogurt and dill. So good. Especially with the sweet potatoes. The ketchup is also really good too they add Sriracha sauce to it which at first I was concerned it wouldn't play out to good but it was just enough to not make it spicy but enough to make an amazing flavor combination. 

For my entre I got the BBQ cauliflower and it was so good. Will be back"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the Burger Joint after finding it on Yelp and reading many positive reviews. Their menu looks great on paper and I love how it features gourmet ingredients that you don't typically find at neighborhood burger restaurants.

After dining at the Burger Joint I debated whether or not wanted to write a review. I love supporting local small businesses, but the problem with small businesses is that people are afraid to give them honest reviews. But if this were my restaurant I would want people to give me constructive criticism so I could make the place better and busier.

When you walk in, the ambiance of the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. They did an okay job remodeling the space, but the white paint and lack of decorations lend the restaurant a generic and cheap feel. The window blinds also need to be improved to battle the blaring afternoon sun. 

The staff is very friendly and were a pleasure to deal with. Service was excellent and I would give it 4 stars! However this restaurant deserves 3 stars because of the food. 

I requested the off the menu foie gras toast that another Yelper recommended. The waitress kindly informed me that they did not have it anymore, but they could make a foie gras slider. Yay! But I was shocked when I received a slider with a cold slice of foie that hadn't been seared. Every other aspect of the slider was perfect, but nobody wants cold foie on a slider. It was almost inedible.

We also ordered the sweet potato tots, portabella mushroom burger and a bacon cheese burger. The idea of homemade tots sounded wonderful, but they arrived as large balls of mashed and deep fried sweet potato. No texture and mushy in the center. Only the outer edge was good.

The portabella mushroom burger was equally disappointing. It sounded great on the menu,  but the portabella was overcooked and mushy and the sandwich had little flavor.

The bacon cheeseburger was good, but as another Yelper mentioned it was also overcooked. My medium order was cooked well. The black sesame seed bun is a nice touch, but the bacon was undercooked and was not crispy like you would hope for. 

At the end of the dining experience I couldn't help but to feel cheated. We paid $40 for a burger meal that could have been amazing but ended up being average at best. I wish this restaurant success and I hope they learn from their shortcomings."}
{"text":"This place was much more casual than what I was expecting, which was actually a good surprise.

We went in on a Tuesday night and we were the only people there. We were immediately greeted by the server, who was super friendly. I'll say this: the service we had was really good. I would go back alone just for that.

She noticed that I was wearing a Modern Times beer hoodie and commented \"HEY! We have Modern Times here.\" Major brownie points - they have a great beer selection and I even noticed a local brewery in the cooler.

The check-in offer is great - it says it's for free fries with purchase of a burger, but the waitress let me use it for tots (more browning points)! My BF and I started out by sharing the onion rings. These are more considered onion strings, but they were damn delicious.

I ordered the patty melt and I feel comfortable saying that this may be one of the best I've ever had. It was really delicious! I also ordered the tots, which you can tell are homemade - watch out for that sriracha ketchup though! I wasn't ready and it caught me off guard. Haha! My BF had the bacon burger and it was HUGE! It was also really good, and he got potato skins on the side. Those were probably my least favorite part of the meal, and they were still quite good.

The prices are very reasonable, I was actually surprised. I was impressed after my first visit and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far the best buger I've ever had. That homemade taste you want but can never find. This is the spot. Great customer service. I recommend it to everyone looking ng for that bomb burger."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! Have been here several times and great food always. Truly a craft burger. A variety of fries to choose from - big servings, so share. Fairly new to the Anthem area in Henderson. Anthem residents receive a discount, which is another plus. One of the owners is usually behind the scenes and serving customers. Excellent service. Lots of craft beers to go with your burger. Kid friendly. Please give them your business! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG!!! The BEST Burger I have EVER had. Topped off with Excellent service by Alice! I guarantee any time someone asks where should they eat Burger Joint will be my 1st answer!!!! They greet you when you walk in the door, they are attentive without being obstructive to your meal & they serve options for almost everybody. I had to give the cook a Thumbs Up from my table, because he prepared my burger at a Perfect Medium...I'll be back before weeks end for sure!"}
{"text":"Holy wow!!!!!!!!!  Ordered from UberEATS. This place is a tad pricey but sooooo worth it!! I ordered the almost famous fries and the cauliflower wings!!!  So goooood! My friend got the bacon burger and truffle fries!  She loved them!!!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Not good service. Took to long to get food. Soda was flat. Out of oreo for oreo milkshake. Was not busy at all."}
{"text":"I got the 3AM burger and truffle fries. Burger is delicious. Fries could be a little more on the crispy side. But that's just my preference. Server was very nice and attentive. Would definitely come back and try the other burgers."}
{"text":"It's a total hipster vibe, wannabe more sit down, when the surrounding screams sit wherever you like after you order at the counter.  Not that the service was bad, but it was more-so that type of environment.  

If I'm not mistaken, the patties are served in 6 oz portions, which leads me to think that I'll be full only if I got a side of french fries.  I like my burgers gourmet, so I was excited with all the different toppings and flavors each burger had to offer.  

I had a chance to try the truffle ketchup- not a fan, the truffle flavor is overpowering the ketchup. The spicy ketchup- more up my alley, but definitely the original was the best.  The perfect medium was to mix the two together.  Either way, from first taste I could tell it was no ordinary ketchup, so I asked.  Sounds like it's a local place with two brothers or something to that effect- said so our waitress, that produces them and Burger Joint was smart enough to carry this awesome ketchup.

The burger is greasy, served with the perfect amount of ingredients, offers a satisfying feeling that you'll probably make a mess out of piled high burger.  A little on the pricey side, definitely satisfying taste, but can't be an everyday burger, more like a treat.  Had a free Yelp check in for some fries and I walked out with a great big smile.  

I forget, but they have some great lunch price special that is offered for take out also."}
{"text":"2nd time we've come and they're CLOSED when they're supposed to be open! WTH!? Came by at noon on a Saturday and at 7pm on Thursday! POOR advertising. Why set out street signage with hours when they're not open!? And they deliver!?? Yah right, no-one answers the number. What a shame since downtown could really use a good burger place, especially one that is open late."}
{"text":"Burger Joint is my new favorite burger joint. Review as follows ~

Service: 5/5
We could tell our server was still learning, but she was super attentive and friendly. The cook, presumably the owner, even greeted us and gave us our menus so we weren't waiting long. 

Pricing: 5/5
This may be a burger joint, but it's definitely not fast food. The quality of the ingredients is evident, and I found the prices to be incredibly reasonable!

Food:

Stuffed Peppers: 5/5
Stuffed with melted goat cheese and breaded and fried into crispy perfection, these stuffed peppers are amazing. They're like jalapeño poppers, but fancier, tastier, and definitely don't come from the frozen food section in a grocery store. To take the words of Drake out of context, these are the best I ever had.

Truffle Fries: 5/5
They use REAL truffles here. WHAT!? Who uses real truffles on French fries? These guys! And they're amazing. Even the ketchup is amazing.

Roasted Portobello Burger: 5/5
To all the non-meat eaters out there, look no further. You've found it. One of the best damn vegan burgers out there. And no, it's not a frozen veggie patty or black bean burger (thank god). They use a portobello mushroom, that is juicy, flavorful, and a great substitute with a meaty texture. This burger is so damn good, my omnivorous boyfriend would order it himself. And when vegan/vegetarian food is good enough for a meat eater, you know it's good.

The only complaint I have is that they serve the burgers in plastic baskets with paper, and their burgers are WAY too juicy for paper.

Overall: 5/5
I can't even think of a place that compares to Burger Joint -- amazing tasting food with quality ingredients for a reasonable price. Plus, a killer vegan option! I will definitely be back ^_^

Tip: check in right now and get a free order of fries! (Yes even the truffle fries)"}
{"text":"This is one damn good burger! We arrived right at 11:00 to place a to-go order. The decor inside is very minimal with a customer supplied graffiti wall. I chose the bacon burger which had bacon (of course), cheddar cheese, fried onions, tomato jam and peppered mayo. Thanks to the Yelp check in offer I also got a free order of tots. 

Be aware the tater tots are quite large, these are no Ore Ida tots. With 8 to an order two people can easily split them. The order was ready in about 10 minutes as promised. 

The tots were cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and tender inside. My burger was ordered medium rare and although it was more on the rare side its better than being overcooked. It's obvious the beef is of a high quality and all of the flavors went well together. I didn't see or taste any tomato jam or any difference in the mayo but overall a really good burger that I enjoyed.  

At $11-14 per burger, and $5-9 per side I think its priced too high for what it is. I will return but it will have to be on pay day :)"}
{"text":"I was on my way the The Hero Factory when I noticed this place had opened. It's their grand opening and it showed. Ordering was a bit chaotic, but customers are still getting a feel for the layout. The Hangover Burger sounded terrific, topped with bacon and an egg. Then I saw they have poutine and I about jumped for joy! Poutine, in downtown Phx? This, I had to try.

It took about 15 minutes for my order to come up. Maybe a little on the long side, but not terrible. However, orders were coming up out of sequence, and that didn't make any fans. 

So, I brought lunch back to the office and announce the new place has poutine. Only one person knew what I was talking about. At this point, I think you understand how significant this food is to me. I spent nearly every weekend in the late '90s in Canada. Yea, I thought. A taste of my second home. Sadly, this was not what I was looking forward to. While the fries were good, they were topped with shredded cheese and beef broth. Beef broth!! Ugh. At this point, I'm just a grumpy otter so that might have made the burger just okay. Not good, just okay. The bun was nice and soft, but the meat tasted industrial. For $13.21, I was hoping for more. I'll give them a couple of weeks and head back. Hopefully things will have improved. Until then, I'll sulk over these soupy fries. Gah!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!  Delicious stuffed Peppers. The burgers were juicy, and flavorful.  There isn't much ambience, but we came for the food. We will be back for the food!!"}
{"text":"Really good burger. Very fresh. The waitress was super nice and attentive. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible;  over priced.  don't waste your money or time.  Management horrible!!"}
{"text":"The Burger Joint.. what it lacks in curb appeal - it more than makes up for it with the food & service.  

Jose welcomed me with a big smile and gave me the low down on the menu.  I wasn't sure what to get, as it all looked so good.  I settled on the au Poivre.. and holy crap was it delicious!  The sauce alone was worth the price.  A side of hand cut fries (yes.. very fresh) and a kilt lifter.. I was in heaven!  

I will be back - I want to sample ALL the offerings!"}
