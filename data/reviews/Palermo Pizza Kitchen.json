{"text":"Do not eat here, I ordered an antipasto and the salami was actually black around the edges. I went back and they were not at all concerned nor did they refund my money."}
{"text":"Not only are the owners complety rude, and the bathroom was disgusting, but the food itself is a reason to never go back. My pizza was cold, and i asked for a new piece, the reheated the piece i was GIVEN! when i asked for a fresh one, the dough was hard as a rock and i didnt finish and left. I wouldnt recommend this to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"While hunting dinner on Rainbow Blvd., I passed a strip mall with a sign declaring, simply, \"PIZZA.\" Naturally, I turned around and went to investigate. Good pizza? Bad pizza? I'll be the judge of that.

Palermo offers pizzas whole and by the slice, calzones, cold and hot subs, salads and pastas for dine-in, take-out or delivery. I ordered some garlic knots and a personal pizza, which is more than enough for two people. The knots are bite-sized and not overpowering. The pizza crust is very similar to authentic NYC pizza. The service is good, too--the cashier came by a couple times to bring our food by and refill drinks.

It appears to be a popular place at lunchtime--there's a sign on the wall instructing students to pick up their orders when their names are called, not to rearrange the tables, and they offer a student discount equal to the amount of sales tax that would be charged.

Overall, a pretty good stop. I would definitely consider coming back or getting delivery."}
