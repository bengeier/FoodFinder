{"text":"1st time going there and it was amazing,the service was great really nice and the food is even better"}
{"text":"I don't really get why it's rated so well, the food was pretty bland. It wasn't bad, it just all tasted like something you could easily make at home, and for a lot cheaper. It's healthy which is great, but just really uninspiring."}
{"text":"I am staying at the hotel next door to Foosia so my coming here was a complete chance encounter. And a great chance encounter it proved to be.

This is a great place to dine for the foodie looking to try something different, or for anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to the typical fast/ casual joint. The meals are based on a build a bowl concept. You choose from a variety of South East Asian items (rice, veggies, meats, sauces, and a variety of other toppings) and create the bowl to your hearts content. The closest comparison to Foosia, for those on the east and west coast, is Shophouse. 

Great food and great dine in experience, extra points for the nice patio. Five stars."}
{"text":"I am reviewing solely on catering. 

We had them cater our lunch at work. The food was good. I would have liked it if they used more spices and flavoring."}
{"text":"Purchased a chicken and rice bowl tonight for take out. Got home and a few bites in I am about to take another bite when I notice a screw in my bowl. Call the restaurant to let them know and the young lady says \" you will have to bring in the screw for us to see\" so we drive back there and the same young lady that We spoke to over the phone says \" we don't have any screws like that in our restaurant so it must have come from somewhere else\" offered me a free meal and said I'll leave I note for the owner but I can't guarantee when he will get back to you.  Worst service I have ever seen in the food industry. No accountability or concern that they delivered a product with the possibility of injuring or creating a health hazard. Never will I go back to Foosia and I will be sending the photos to the AZ health department ."}
{"text":"Bottom Line: It's a good Asian version of Chipotle, but over priced probably due to the \"Economy's of Scale\" that Chipotle commands. It's very fair to compare the Chicken Bowls of both. It's just different sauces and toppings that make the difference. But Chipotle just increase their price to $6.50 vs. Foosia's $8.50. That's $2. Remember Chipotle uses Free-Rooming Chicken, they don't skimp. I'm unsure of Foosia \"fresh\" meaning.

I eat at Chipotle close to 3 times a week. I'd easily switch to Foosia as I enjoy Asian inspired more then Mexican inspired. But 3 times at Foosia is more like 4 times at Chipotle. For that reason, I don't think they will catch on.

For those quoting, $10 as not to much for quality. Compare it to Chop Shop's $10. And tell me this is the same. Chop Shop's lines are out the door at 2 locations. So you can do better at this price point.

Foosia, I hope you rethink your pricing. It's the only thing keeping you from long term success."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday.  Fantastic food and service!  Fresh and tasty...it felt healthy, like a home cooked meal and was super fast for our lunch hour.  I did a mix of the steak and chicken since I didn't know which I'd prefer--I'll mix again next time!  Excited to have another place for lunch not too far from the office.  I believe the ownership is local which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time, food quality poor, we had high hopes for this place but what a disappointment.  We took one bite and headed for the trash!  Pei Wei blows this place away.  The only good feedback I can give is the restaurant was clean..."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch today and had a great lunch! We both got the bowl with various combinations and really enjoyed the fresh ingredients and being able to mix and match the sauces!

It was nice to find a place with healthy options that didn't taste like something that everyone else has. 

The patio was nice and they accommodated our puppy! 

We can't wait to stop back by!"}
{"text":"Food is really good and tasty, you can pick exactly which items you want in your bowl and which you don't. Only complaint- for the price they really skimp on the chicken or meat portion. If I ask for a bit more, they try to charge me for extra protein"}
{"text":"Ate Foosia for lunch. Easy to eat healthy here with all the veggies and protein. Shrimp were cooked fresh and habanero sauce paired well."}
{"text":"Once again back at my favorite lunch spot in Scottsdale.  Don't be shy when it comes to mixing up the bowls with sauces....you can't go wrong.  Fresh food anytime of the day is always a good thing!!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty and healthy which is always nice. I tried all the sauces and they were all tasty. Jerry did a great job going above and beyond to make sure my wife was happy with the way the steak was cooked. He Came and brought to food to us although it's not required in non-full service eateries. I had the shrimp, came with 5 good size pieces. 

We will definitely be back to try some more variations at this place. It's definitely worth a try if you like asian food and enjoy rice bowls. Good alternative to burrito bowls at chipotle."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the staff is friendly (albeit nobody is aware of walk-ins when theyre slow) and the food is good and fresh.  The chicken is very clean for dark meat and has a great citrus flavor from the marinade.  The owner is nice and tries hard."}
{"text":"Great concept restaurant. Fresh and delish! The device is great the place is clean and best if all the food is fresh!"}
{"text":"Really good, clean food with some great choices. I was also surprised that it was flavorful; staff was very nice and helpful as well. Honestly, wish there was one closer to us, but will go back again. Oh, and the crispy tofu is pretty damn tasty!"}
{"text":"Love the food, so fresh and it's so rare to find so many flavors coming to life in your mouth in a fast good place. I just think they are changing the idea of fast food and showing us that you can make healthy food fast and delicious! I love it this is my second stop and it was as good as I remember it the first time. It's the kind of place you will crave to come back for. Try it!"}
{"text":"Loved the spicy Tofu with brown rice. Their steamed/wok vegetables, sauces and toppings are flavourful. Very clean atmosphere nice outside patio... being a vegetarian is like being extinct but this place really made my day."}
{"text":"I like Foosia. It's fast. It's casual. It's reasonably priced. It's tasty. And it currently has a Yelp offer for a free beverage. What more could you wish for when you're in search of a quick bite? 

You select your base (rice lettuce, noodles), your protein (tofu if you're vegetarian), and your sauce (samples gladly given). Not up to the standards of a fine Chinese/Asian restaurant of course, but equivalent to the relationship that Chipotle has with good Mexican food.

Overall, a nice \"healthyish\" alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"First time there, Had my two kids with me.  The vegetables and other \"toppings\" tasted fresh.  My only complaint was that they are a bit skimpy on the protein.  Didn't feel that I got my money's worth.  Also, the workers didn't offer much help with the menu.  Since it's a new restaurant, it's helpful if the workers provide info. about all of the different choices, especially when you have kids.  For example, they should have warned me that the cucumbers that my sons ordered had hot pepper flakes on them, which makes them spicy."}
{"text":"It was ok ....I expected much more from reviews, way to much rice and just didn't do it for me...Or if was ORGANIC would have made a whole lot more of a difference....Sorry not a winner 4 me...=/// And My husband would not eat here and had to watch him eat at Ling & Louies....That sucked...=///////// Not feelin this at alll........??!!?"}
{"text":"My wife brought it home for my family. I was not impressed. The spicy food was not. The stir fry vegetables were raw. The rice - not sticky. My son could not finish his and he picked it out.  Pei Wei has better sauces. Overall it was bland. Ours was a to go order so I am sure the service is good."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before. My boss and I more or less stumbled onto it looking for a quick lunch place. While I was working on my computer (they have WIFI), my boss surprised me with wonderful plate of the freshest most tasty ingredients. It was really extraordinary well balanced, exciting, healthy - just super!
I agree with Mossey and told the manager, I wished he would open one in Phoenix too. I spoke with the manager about this and it is on his list if/when this one does well.
No doubt it will!

Btw, they have cool hand dryers:)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is delicious, fresh, and healthy and the space is really modern and attractive.  They have just enough options to suit every taste (from someone who likes light, vegetarian food like me to a meat-and-potatoes kind of person like my boyfriend) but not overwhelm.  I love that I now have a healthy Asian-style place to go to grab a quick lunch or dinner (no more Pei Wei!).  I've gone a few times and experimented with different combinations, which has been really fun and led me to a few favorites.  The tofu is a standout - it is done to perfection (small, slightly crispy cubes that are really nicely spiced) and will convert the biggest tofu-haters out there.  I also always make sure to top my dish with the fresh herbs.  Definitely a good place to bring friends or co-workers - there is something for everyone there."}
{"text":"Second review 

I've been here about 10 times now and the last 3 times - the staff seems to be younger and younger.  In addition, the food canisters are ALWAYS empty.  The last two times, the greens were empty or VERY little left and I had to ask for fresh greens (she was going to serve me old lettuce).  Secondly, the slaw, pickled cucumbers, and bean sprouts were all low today.  This was today 11/12 at about 130.  I assume there was a lunch rush but when I was the only person in line and only a few patrons in the restaurant.  The food should be stocked or constantly refilled, like Chipotle.  Chipotle always has fresh ingredients and they are constantly refilling and keeping things fresh. Makes me worried about the meat temperatures and safety of the food.  Today, I don't think there was one adult-manager in the place, and come to think of it, only the first few times have I seen a manager-type person.  If there was, they surely are not focused on what is happening.  Seems like they have grown and become satisfied with how busy they have become and are now slacking.  I won't return - $11 for lunch can be spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, healthy!    My first Bowl today and will return to have more Bowls and try various combinations.   Eager to try the tofu and other sauces.   The place is bright,open and airy with a good outdoor area i addition to inside.    Great for a quick lunch or dinner or take-out.   Will be perfect for our hot summer days when a light meal is exactly what we want and need!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week. Service was fantastic. The restaurant reminded me of an asian chipotle. The prices are really reasonable for what you get. The food is prepared and cooked on the premises. I loved how fresh and tasty everything was. The sauces were also very delicious. The restaurant had a modern vibe, appeared to be environmentally conscious (recycle bin, biodegradable plates, etc.). It was also incredibly clean inside. Will definitely be going back:)"}
{"text":"Have you ever imagined what if two of your favorite restaurants had a child? What if Chipotle and Pei Wei joined together and had an offspring?? Now you can see what it would be like-at Foosia Asia Fresh. This great new local restaurant give you a fresh, healthy alternative for lunch or dinner. 

The set up is kinda like Chipotle. You go thru the line, and start off by picking the base for your bowl. You choose from Jasmine rice, brown rice, chilled rice noodles, mixed greens, or flatbread. They you choose your protein from marinated steak, shredded pork, grilled chicken, seared shrimp, or crispy tofu.  Next you choose your vegetables (fresh, steamed or wok-ed). Then comes one of 7 custom sauces. ( I chose the Fooster sauce, which is a sriracha based sauce which was great). Then to finish it off, there are toppings chinese slaw, pickled chilies, crispy shallots, toasted peanuts, thai herbs, bean sprouts, lime squeeze. 

The finished bowl is tasty, filling, and refreshing, as well as leaving you feeling like you had healthy meal. There is talk of more locations to come. Let's support the new kid on the block and watch it grow.."}
{"text":"i really do like the concept and that peanut sauce is amazing

i do think however that they should have more options

like some avocado on this would be amazing"}
{"text":"The food is very good and the vegetables are fresh, and the service is great too...but there is one problem.  For what it is, it's very overpriced.  If you aren't picky about prices, then this place is great."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time. The staff was courteous and recommended good food. We got ours to go. When we got home my wife took a few bites and then found a bug cooked into the food. Needless to say we both threw our food out and will never go back."}
{"text":"Ugggggg...this will be quick and to the point.
Employes were, how can I say this nicely...stupid. Protein portions were terrible. Steak was saturated in soy sauce, veggies were shriveled and so over cooked. Nothing seemed to be fresh. Came in to order for a family of 4 and the employe asked me if I need a bag? Really? Cashier did not know if I needed to sign the receipt..clueless! 
So, needless to say we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  Not sure I get it.   None of the individual ingredients were of high quality or particularly flavorful for me. The steak was tough. Poor value / quality price point  overall from my perspective.  Not enough draw for me to go back and give it a second shot."}
{"text":"Great Fresh Food! My friend and I were in the neighborhood and decided to try Foosia for lunch.  The restaurant was simply decorated and very clean.  Since it was our first time here, the friendly staff explained how to create a bowl.  First, you have a choice of jasmine rice, brown rice, or noodles.  I chose a combination of the jasmine rice and noodles.  The rice was perfectly prepared and the noodles light, just the way I like.  Then you add your protein and you have a choice of steamed or wok vegetables.  You get a ton, and a nice variety.  They add a sauce/sauces, great options, something for everyone.  Wait, we are not finished.  You get more topping choices, all fresh ingredients.  The meat was delicious, tender and juicy.  The bowl was enormous, enough for two meals.  Definitely worth the $10.  If you like specialty refreshments, they have a fabulous selection. The only thing I would change, is the music.  When we first arrived it was too loud, but I think they turned it down later or maybe I just adjusted to it."}
{"text":"I got a coupon in the mail for a free bowl and I had never heard of this place but I do enjoy healthy asian food. My roommate had been there before and told me what to expect and suggested things that she liked. My fiance and I were the only ones in there at the moment so we had undivided attention from the 'night crew'. They let us sample what we we interested in and had a great attitude about everything. I usually like my rice noodles warm but wtf.. :) AH-MAZING!! I ordered the majority of the items with RWB and Okinawan sauce, went home and we both smashed on it. Im pretty picky when it comes to new places but I always look at the reviews. I was so impressed with this place that I will be returning with a few more people. :)"}
{"text":"Every time I dine here it's a great experience! Very fresh, healthy and delicious options! It's similar to Chipotle but much better!! The sauces are perfect and the service is always fast and friendly ! If you haven't tried Foosia you are definitely missing out! :)"}
{"text":"This is the chipotle of Asian good! It's all fresh and great! Service is great, and food is always amazing. 
The selection of sauces is yummy. If you like spicy, I suggest their Siracha styled sauce."}
{"text":"We stopped by the Starbucks across the street and decided to give this place a try. They have healthy food options and great outdoor seating. Highly recommended if you are looking for healthy eating in or near Scottsdale. I like to pick what I eat but this place is great."}
{"text":"Very good, quick healthy fast meal? I would definitely give this place five stars if they did two things. Turn down the music and don't put cilantro in the cucumbers. This place should be bigger than chipotle!"}
{"text":"Like Chipotle for Asian food. Decently healthy. Always clean. Service is pretty quick. Not the most authentic Asian food but tasty"}
{"text":"The food here is great. Very healthy an very fresh. They only prepare small portions at a time so always fresh."}
{"text":"Freshly prepared chopped veggies with meat or shrimp toppings and prepared sauces.  Not organic.  Fooasia is a startup fast food / sit down place to eat.  Two dinners (you choose the food) runs just under $20.  Much better than fast food at same price point.  Geared to health conscious professional wanting a nice but fast meal."}
{"text":"I love this concept. 

(The Chipotle style serving has been discussed enough)

The ingredients are pretty good. I like that I don't get charged extra for shrimp or steak if I order the smaller kids bowl (which is just over $6 after tax). They all taste good and it's a quick, lighter option for lunch if you choose the right ingredients. Can't complain about the price. 

Like Chipotle, I don't think the point of this place is to be authentic Asian food, who really thinks Chipotle is 100% authentic Mexican food? It's Asian inspired, and the idea works with the lime, pickled cucumbers, bean sprouts and mint/cilantro. 

Will always come back for lunch or a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"Was visiting in the area and this place happened to be close by. Very pleased with the refreshing alternative to your typical greasy Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Food is flavorful and fresh!  I think I'm hooked!  Have been there twice in one week!
I'm only giving four stars because they boast that they use herbs they  grow on site, but their basil plants are dying from lack of watering!  Nothing fresh about them and a bad comment on the mission of the company!"}
{"text":"Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews off yelp and had to try it; the food was awesome! I truly enjoyed it and the portions were really good! 
Must try the \"two nuts walk into the bar\" sauce!"}
{"text":"It's not for everyone. It's more like a fast food restaurant. The food is different. It's not your regular Asian page. 
Ll"}
{"text":"It's good but sometimes the portions are way to small (depending on who's doing the preparing). The cost is too high to get skimped..."}
{"text":"Foosia has excellent service and very tasty food. The steak was delicious. The place was also very spacious and clean, and they get bonus points for having recycling cans."}
{"text":"I really love it here! My friend and I always come right after our workouts! The staff here is always so nice and friendly! Daniel & Drew are always so knowledgable and are always very attentive to our needs! We always feel like we are very welcomed here! The food is always very fresh and the restaurant is extremely clean! The staff is always walking around cleaning the tables and are asking how we are doing! This shows how much they care about their customers! I defiantly recommend this place to anyone who likes Asian style cuisine!"}
{"text":"Foosia has been described as the \"Chipotle of Asian food\" more than once.  That's just a very accurate description!  It's a trendy, casual restaurant with an airy atmosphere.  You walk through a line and build your meal using the familiar base-ingredients-sauce-toppings, formula.  First, choose either noodles, rice or lettuce.  Then add a protein (I like the chicken).  Choose your style of veggies, either wok glazed or steamed.  Sauce it up - don't be afraid to mix and match if you're feeling adventurous!  And finally, add toppings like peanuts, sprouts or seeds.  At the end of the line you can add your drink.  Choose from typical fountain drinks, nifty sodas from the fridge, sake for an authentic touch, or wine if you're really trying to impress your date.

Prices are similar to Chipotle, too.  It's a good value for a lot of good food and a fun time.  The employees are helpful and courteous.  My only complaint is in regards to my voice getting up and over the tall sneeze guards while I'm trying to order.  I end up pointing and miming more than actually talking to the person serving up my bowl.

A bonus in my book are the compost/recycle bins.  They each have a sign listing what goes in which one, so you have no excuse not to use them and do your part!"}
{"text":"I've been to Foosia two times - first time was great in terms of food and service, second time would have definitely steered me away if it was my first visit. I got there more than 20 minutes before closing and all of the chairs were up when I walked in which is fine I guess since I wasn't dining in. The employees looked like they did NOT want to help me and I was right. The rice I got was mostly hard and I only ate it because I was super hungry. I was really upset that after paying for a large drink I saw the iced tea was already put away. I'll be back again but even Chipotle has better service 20 minutes before close, just saying."}
{"text":"Super bomb place. My girlfriend brought me in because she is all about it. It's like an Asian cuisine version of Chipotle. You walk down the line and pick what you want. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The flavors of PeiWei with the format of Chipotle.  Two of my favorite places combined.  Brilliant!  Wish I'd thought of it.

Pick your platform, protein, veggies, sauce and toppings.  Delicious and casual with decent prices."}
{"text":"4 of us just ate there and enjoyed the way the meals were laid out, the food was very fresh, the portions were large and the flavors all worked very well together. The 4 of us all ordered something different and were very pleased and look forward to going back real soon. Fred the owner is very friendly and excited about his restaurant and sharing his appreciation and passion for different flavors!"}
{"text":"We went for a lunch and it is a busy place during afternoon. I took some brown rice with grilled chicken and a bit of mango lime and sliced cucumbers and wontons. I am super satisfied for the fresh taste and definitely price worthy. I think they got some outdoor seating too. However am not sure as I was in a hurry on my first visit."}
{"text":"First off- Like one of the other posters on Yelp, I feel a little guilty giving only 2 stars as I too REALLY like the concept. However, the devil is in the details and the execution and I just thought this is where they fall short. 

First of all, liked the ingredients, but for some reason they just didn't work well together. 

I also thought that the 4 separate bowls we ordered were VERY light on sauce. So much so that it was often difficult to discern the flavor as it was outweighed by the blandness of the noodles and protein.  Blandness that is EXCEPT for the crispy tofu. 

NOW- if you look at the menu online it CLEARLY says crispy tofu. What it DOES NOT say is that it is VERY spicy. So, when ordering a children's bowl with crispy tofu, and asking for a non-spicy sauce to accompany it that a kid would like-  one would think that the person on the other end would bring up the fact that the tofu is VERY spicy. So much so that it was hot for my palate and I like spice. Too much so for a seven year old who happily took her bite of two pieces of tofu chewed and swallowed before she realized just how hot it was. Between cries, coughs from the spice, and a glass of milk, lets just say I had to fix something else for my daughter. 

The chicken was fine and so was my wife's shrimp. BUT Seriously, if you have a 'children's bowl' on the menu, AND Tofu is a choice, you probably ought to: (a) Call it SPICY CRISPY TOFU (b) Recommend that if the children's bowl is for a child, you recommend something OTHER than the TOFU!!

I would have let it slide if this was the lunch rush, but the place was empty and it seemed to be that the owner/manager was actually running the show. I mean seriously, not sure what they were thinking. Or maybe they just weren't??"}
{"text":"Good quick place to eat. Just like Chipotle but Asian. Healthy and easy and you can make it spicy! Yum. About $15 plate n drink."}
{"text":"We stopped in here as we saw the sign off the road and it was a great choice!  We had never heard of it so I Yelped it before going in and saw their reviews.
We both got Teriyaki Chicken Bowls and liked that there was several toppings you can add. I would only say it would be nicer if they would add a little more they put them on as it was a bit skimpy but when I went up and asked for some more Chinese slaw they happily gave me some more.  Plenty of staff and they were very friendly there. 
I wish you could get the Cilantro on the side without all the other herbs but no biggie. 
Overall Fresh and Delish!  :)"}
{"text":"Dolf asked if I wanted to go to lunch, and said we were going to the \"Asian Chipotle.\" I found this funny, because the last time we went to lunch, we went to the \"Italian Chipotle\" and actually walked past Chipotle to get there! I didn't know what to expect, and while I enjoyed the food, it wasn't what I was expecting. It was just a bowl of ingredients, and while it was fresh and I left full, it didn't blow me away. I also had an unwelcoming experience with a guy I assume was the owner. He didn't seem happy to be there, and wasn't the nicest person I met while dining at Foosia. This didn't blow me away, and while I am satisfied, I doubt I would go back. Their sauces are good, though. I prefer Chipotle!"}
{"text":"So sad waited months as I watched this being built all that real estate space for this? Food so low quality like a cheap buffet limited selection did not taste fresh took it to go for 9 dollars NOT even worth stopping. Cashier could not count change back seems like low budget NO choices cheap food."}
{"text":"The Asian spin on Chipotle is actually quite good!   I didn't love the first couple bites, but after mixing everything together, it was realllllllllly good.   Lots of flavor mixed together.   I got brown rice, grilled chicken, Muay Thai vinaigrette, veggies, etc."}
{"text":"Decent portions, relatively healthy for fast food. Probably just a one time visit for me. One good thing, my kid really enjoyed her rice and steak bowl."}
{"text":"I decided to give Foosia a try for the first time. I went there during the busy lunch hour and although the line had about 10 people in it, the wait wasn't long at all. I asked the young employee if I could do  half of steak and half of chicken to accompany my brown rice and sautéed veggies with peanut Thai sauce and she definitely agreed to. Overall the food was very fresh and tasty for a fast Asian spot (similar to chipotle). I even decided to get my hands into their the current promo: buy one $25 gift card get one free! I will be back soon Foosia!"}
{"text":"Foosia is like the Subway of Asian food. (Or chipotle of Asian food, there I said it) It has that very clean quick lunch time feel. There is enough variety but they still keep it simple. I got the chilled noodles which I was excited and nervous for all at the same time. And they were great! I added steak, glazed veggies with teriyaki and Saracha sauce. It was awesome. It is slightly pricier than chipotle but feels and tastes super fresh. Jammed packed with veggies and protein, I'll be sure to visit again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  There are so many options to choose from.  It's always clean and the staff is friendly.  In just minutes from walking in the door your are eating a healthy, fresh, high quality meal.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken over chilled rice noodles. Lots of fresh toppings and variety of sauces. Open a location in Chandler please!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great.  They have huge portions, so I always opt for the kids bowl.  The chicken and tofu are amazing with the peanut sauce!    The atmosphere is casual and clean.  The staff is nice and fast, so you don't have to worry about long lines.  I come here once a week for lunch!"}
{"text":"Fresh healthy ingredients! Great friendly service! Quick healthy meal.  Good price for the portion size."}
{"text":"The food is over priced for what you get. I just paid almost $13 for a bowl full of veggies and 4 shrimp.  It's a nope."}
{"text":"I'm so sad this place is closed. I'm internally crying. It was yummy and healthy and the people were always super kind. Bummed."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the very first time today (thanks UberEATS!) It was very fresh and delish! You can tell all of the ingredients are fresh and would be definitely be coming back with my boyfriend!"}
{"text":"Foosia is a great choice if you're looking for Healthy, Fast Food!
I have been there three times and have always enjoyed the Marinated Steak with Brown Rice.

Something to keep in mind:  a giant Steak Burrito at Chipotle is $7.50, but at Foosia you should expect to pay a couple dollars more, granted, for a healthier food item.

The service here is great, and it's nice that they offer drink options that include beer, wine, and sake.  I've only been here once when there's been a long line.  Usually it's very quick.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I can either see this place taking off OR miserably flopping. I say this because I have been in twice now during prime dinner time and it's always dead. The food is great though and I like the variety of choices they offer. The staff is always very helpful and happy to serve you which is an added bonus in this type of restaurant. I just hope that they are doing enough to get people in the door. The only reason I even knew about this place or thought I should try it was because it is in the same strip mall as my daughter's weekly guitar lesson. 

Regarding the food for those that do not know: You start with a base of rice or noodles, add a protein (tofu available), veggies, sauce, and toppings. It's very much designed like Chipotle in that aspect but think fresh (fast), asian food."}
{"text":"The employees were amazing, and they let me try the sauces before I ordered. I love dark meat chicken and it was delicious. They also let me know we can put as much sauce as you want, so get some on the side if you like a lot of sauce. It was very much like Chipotle in that the food is sitting there waiting to be used. I loved it here. Not every place is for everyone but I can't wait to go back. It was soooo goood!!!"}
{"text":"The food and flavors are still very much on point, but the portion size has taken a serious hit since its early days! There is less of everything - base, protein, vegetables, and even the \"garnish\" stuff. It's not a place I rave about anymore."}
{"text":"After a day-out in the Phoenix area, we're often on the lookout for fast, healthy places to grab a bite to eat before heading north. Found this place on Yelp and glad we swung by. Really nice decor; bright and airy. Good vegetarian options with regular, crispy or spicy tofu, or you can just go with steamed or sauteed veggies. Then you pick your own housemade sauce, and toppings. Everything looked fresh and tasted great! Loved seeing the compost and recycling bins. Nice! Really wish there were more of these restaurants so we could easily grab fast, healthy food while on the go. We sure could use one up in the Prescott/Prescott Valley area."}
{"text":"I love this place and am totally addicted! I actually feel good about myself when I walk out stuffed, and full of healthy stir fry veggies and protein. For the base, I usually get just the mixed greens to keep the carbs down, and don't miss the rice or noodles. With the toppings, you can really get as much or as little flavor as you want. You can expect to pay about $10 for a bowl and drink for lunch, worth every penny."}
{"text":"A fast, delicious, you pick the ingredients place. Foosia makes great, fresh, filling, adorable meals. I highly recommend if you want an affordable quick meal."}
{"text":"This place is great! Figure it as an Asian version of chipotle. The portions are very generous albeit $2 more than chipotle bowls. The healthy options are what I love, they have many options and a lot of them are the no carb types."}
{"text":"Food was quick, affordable and the best part was that it was yummy. It's very similar to the chipotle experience except for Chinese food. My only complaint was that they don't have enough options for cooked veggies. And for being a Foosia virgin, they rush you through the lines a bit."}
{"text":"We have been going to Foosia for years (ever since we moved to Arizona). In the beginning, it was great - It was a quick option for gluten-free asian-style take out, and wasn't as heavy and greasy as most places.

However, I must say, I am EXTREMELY disappointed and upset by the customer service and management at this place. It's gone way downhill.

BOTH times I've gone over the past 2-3 months, the staff have NOT been wearing gloves, and never once put them on, while serving me and making my rice bowls. Can we stop and think about how disgusting that is?

Halfway through the first visit, I mentioned to the girl working that I thought it was unsanitary that she was pushing my food down into the container with her BARE HANDS (so gross). I asked her to remake our rice bowls wearing gloves, as it's proper protocol when working at a restaurant. (I've worked in the food industry for years while I was in high school and college, and am well aware of protocol. You ALWAYS wear fresh gloves while serving customers.)

The second time this past weekend, the employee STILL wasn't wearing gloves while serving me and preparing my meal to go. I was horrified that this was still happening. I would've thought management would've fixed it after my first attempt at letting them know.

Out of courtesy, I emailed management this past weekend to let them know what was going on. I let them know I was extremely displeased and I would not be going back unless they were able to either justify this behavior, or promise it wouldn't happen again. Do you want to know their response?

After I took the time to write them a KIND email explaining that I was disappointed in the service and lack of sanitation, I explained that I would rather have them deal with it behind the scenes than leave a negative review. If the management team had responded nicely, I wouldn't be writing this right now.

However, the management team responded sarcastically with a \"THANKS DUDE.\" That is it. That's the response I got. I didn't get a \"I\"m sorry that this happened, we will make it right etc.\" or a \"We are so sorry for your poor experience. We promise we will address this immediately.\" NOPE. NOTHING.

I am really sad that someone managing a business would deal with a displeased customer in this way. We will never be returning, I can tell you that."}
{"text":"Gave this place a 2nd try, but I was less than impressed. Maybe I have high expectations for health-conscious food after chipotle and panera, but I didn't find the food here amazing. Spicy tofu was the best meat option (and I loveee meat) and I wasn't a huge fan of the sauces. I'm glad there are good veggie options, but they didn't feel fresh. 

Kudos to them for making an asian chipotle-style place. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding. Discovered the place through Yelp and was so pleased that our experience matched the majority of reviews we had seen. The food is fantastic; fresh ingredients, satisfying array of options in terms of both proteins and vegetables, sauces and spices which bore hallmarks of well thought out recipes and proper planning, and of course great service all made this a very welcoming, very pleasing first experience here. I have to keep talking about those spices and sauces; what a treat! So easy for places like this to phone it in when it comes to delicate flavor combinations, but not so here. Very impressed. Portion size is perfect for my dietary needs, which is a nice way of saying I was really hungry and it filled me up nicely. Will be back."}
{"text":"Oh god... that flat bread was god-awful. Literally tasted like poo... The sauce was a bit gamey too... I figured this place would be like Flat Top Grill (which is brilliant, BTW) but it didn't even come close. 

Just awful... There is a lingering smell in my garbage can."}
{"text":"Very delicious and creative. The food is definitely yummy. The ingredients and sauces are very well thought out and tasty. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star review from me is because it's a bit pricey. 9 bucks for something about the size of an ordinary teriyaki bowl and not much different is kind of steep in my opinion. Then again, it's in Scottsdale, so if you're rich and money isn't an issue the place is certainly delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was exceptional! I'm not a big fast food girl but this place was healthy, tasty and super fast! I'm vegetarian and my boyfriend is a true carnivore and we both loved the food! The restaurant space was super comfortable and VERY clean! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious!  I'm obsessed with this restaurant.  The staff is so friendly and the owner is regularly there and makes it a point to make sure his customers are taken care of.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Foosia! 

When Yelp reviewers say it's \"Pei Wei meets Chipoltle\",  they nailed it. 

Although a bit intimidating on your first visit, the staff is more than happy to explain how it works, and they will let you try the sauces and recommend additions to your meal to help you navigate the ordering process. 

The food is fresh, healthy and excellent! 

Check it out! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"This was a delightful surprise today and everyone in my family enjoyed the occasion. Definitely a Chipotle type of setup with a large selection of items to customize your dish and make it special and unique.

Inside is very nice and simply decorated. We were excited that they were not blasting music at a crazy loud level and we could actually hear ourselves chewing. Nice!

Ordered the Steak bowl with Wok glazed Veggies on Rice Noodles and covered it with their tasty Thai Peanut Sauce. Really liked being able to load up as many topping as the bowl could handle. Even managed to lose a couple on the floor as we walked to the table. LOL!

My wife and Granddaughter worked together on a Chicken bowl with both Mixed Greens and steamed Veggies and of course a good soaking of their Thai Peanut sauce. It was fun watching the 2 year old nibble on the pieces of chicken and veggies. She even tried using the Grammy's chopsticks but decided to go back to using her fingers.

Service was friendly and the place was very clean. They were very good at helping us during the ordering process and made sure to give us a big side of crispy Wontons for our little munchkin.

Overall we enjoyed the experience and will be coming back again. Look for their specials in the weekly mailers. We found a buy one get one free coupon and had to take advantage of it on this visit. OH YEAH BABY!

3.75 STARS"}
{"text":"A new favorite for fast but healthy!  It's like Chipotle but Asian.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Another episode of ripoff city. Nothing is cooked to order, so everything is just sitting in their pans and the meat did not look very appetizing, so i opted for shrimp. The first choice is rice or rice noodles, but the noodles are the cheap white version, not the excellent Singapore style that they should be using. So, they put a boat load of white rice on bottom of plastic bowl (to stay) and then for about $10 bucks, I would have gotten four medium sized shrimps. After that, it was a medley of what looked like two frozen veggies choices and some standard sauces (those should be grilled with the meat). The concept seems like a Mongolian grill without the grill part and the good value. I never made it down the line because I don't get taken to the Scottsdale cleaners, everyone else does. Skip this pretender unless your one of \"those\" born every minute."}
{"text":"It's like a Chipotle with an Asian twist! Great steak and chicken. Even shrimp, pork and tofu options. The wok glazed veggies are delicious or you can get them simply steamed. Lots of unique sauces and even a kids bowl. Plus I've gotten  a free drink w/ Yelp check ins twice now! Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was seriously not good. We thought they at least Wok cooked the food with the sauce. But they pile on cold veggies that are beyond bland. A small amount of sauce. Nothing hot or even warm about it. I can't even tell you how bad this place is. Sorry but it's true."}
{"text":"The good: great flavors- the pork is delicious, different options, clean and friendly team

The bad: this is my first time here so my biggest concern was the temperature of the food. I came for a late lunch, I get it, but didn't feel like the items were super fresh or hot. I think this would have been different should I have come during lunch or dinner hour. My other suggestion: the sauces should've served warm, not cold.

Overall, I enjoyed it and would try it again. Love the concept."}
{"text":"This is such a great place for a fast meal with real food.  It's basically Asian version of chipotle, but a bit better-- more vegetables, more sauces, more variety.  I wish it were closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Fast and fresh. My husband and I really enjoyed the variety of sauces for our rice bowls. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the steak chunks in my bowl were pretty fatty and I can't handle fatty meats."}
{"text":"This is too funny. First let's get this out of the way the food was good fast and I appreciate the low carb option.  The service was great. Now for the funny part I came here without checking Yelp first. I ordered my food and started to eat it. Before opening Yelp I already knew why the haters would give it one or two stars and I was correct.  They complain about the price. I am sorry but if $10 is too much for a quality lunch then the problem is not so much with the restaurant but with your finances.  But what really aggravates me about this folks is don't they look at the menu!  This place has a giant menu over the counter with the prices clearly marked.  Here is some free financial advice read the menu first if you are cutting close on funds walk the 20 feet across the parking lot to Jack in the Box. I know the food is not as high a quality and healthy at Jack. 

I bet most of the folks here complaining about paying $10 for quality food are also for increasing the minimum wage.

 Sorry rant over. This place is great the food is great the people are great and you won't do wrong by coming here but know they don't have a 99 cent value menu."}
{"text":"Fresh veggies, good jasmine rice and variety of sauces. Didn't care for the chicken though, had a faint flavor like cooking fuel.  Next time I'll try the tofu. Also I would have liked to know what the sodium content was of all the sauces but it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. I have tried on a few separate occasions, but I continue to find myself underwhelmed. I have had the rice and the noodles, several different types of meat, different sauces and veggies - hoping to find the right combo - and while it's not BAD, it's not GREAT either. My favorite is the noodles, however I hate that their cold. They end up making the whole dish lukewarm and unappetizing. I actually take it back to my office and pop it in our break room microwave to warm it up. 
I will say it has always been quick to get through the line, so it works if you need to grab a quick healthy lunch. 
Lastly, I don't think the food justifies the price. My meal, without anything additional or a drink, was over 10 bucks (after tax).
They do have a few select alcoholic beverages which I haven't tried, but wanted to note as it's a nice option if you're looking for that. 

Overall not my favorite lunch spot, however I suggest you check it out for yourself. Hopefully you find something you like!"}
{"text":"Not impressed
For the price they should be more generous
Won't be long and they'll be out of business"}
{"text":"Over priced Asian Chipolte...Worst stomach ache after I ate this food. I felt like I ate 10 lbs of food. Sauces are super salty. I would never recommend this to anyone. If you want something fast and really good food go across the street to Zoe's."}
{"text":"I'm quite a fan of this new restaurant, and really hope that they expand throughout the Valley. As said before, it's an Asian version of Chipotle. So far I've tried the chicken, tofu, and shrimp. The shrimp is my favorite, it's cooked perfectly since it's grilled to order and the portion is large. I like being able to customize my meal as they have a ton of fresh, flavorful and healthy options. There's a lot of different types of veggies and toppings to add on at no extra cost. The staff has always been very nice and efficient. This is a great spot to get a quick, healthy, quality, low-cost meal!"}
{"text":"I just found my new FAVORITE Restaurant- FOOSIA!  

The best way to describe it is like Chipotle but with an Asian flare.  It has the assembly line of creating the dish where you can choose from Asian Noodles or seasoned white rice or lettuce as your base.  Then, with your base Carbs in place- you build on top of that with various proteins (Chicken, Steak, Pork, Etc..) followed by an array of different veggies and sauces.  The end result in an incredibly tasty and healthy bowl of awesomeness!

The restaurant was incredibly clean and the service was great.  It all polished metal and chrome, similar to Chipotle..  The price was about $10 for a huge bowl of Asian heaven!

My only compliant is that I wish they had more locations. Their only location that I know of was up by the Scottsdale Airpark.  I HIGHLY Recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Asian style food and is trying to watch what they eat.  All of the ingredients were TOP NOTCH!!  Just writing about it makes me want to hop in the car and go there again!! Which I will most certainly do!!"}
{"text":"For fast food new age Asian. This was impressive 

Love the vibe of the place. Minimalist decor. Clean feel 

The food was ultra fresh and the veggies super crisp. My only criticism is the meat could have been hotter"}
{"text":"The concept here is similar to Chipotle: you choose what kind of bowl you want - rice (jasmine or brown), rice noodles, or mixed greens; then choose your protein (steak, pork, chicken, shrimp, tofu); then choose the vegetable prep (steamed or stir-fried); choose one of 7 different sauces; finally, choose from a variety of toppings. The ingredients are very fresh and that is reflected in the flavors of the food, though I found the seasonings to be on the mild side even though I ordered the habanero sauce. The restaurant - the indoor space and the patio - is spacious and brightly lit, and the service is friendly. Additional points for recycling (the refuse bins are labeled \"recycle\" and \"compost\") and for free wifi."}
{"text":"I literally love this place for a quick and healthy lunch! You can build-your-own bowl with rice or noodles, hot or cold, and add a ton of fresh veggies (marinated or steamed) on top! What could be better? I always go with chilled rice noodles, half marinated steak/half grilled chicken, Chinese slaw, asian cucumbers (love!), bean sprouts, herb mix, pickled chiles, chopped scallions, limes, peanuts, and crispy wontons. For sauces, I mix the Holy Foobanero and the peanut sauce. It is about $10 when all said and done, and in my opinion, completely worth it! I wish that they had one closer to home (Arcadia area... hint hint!) because I would come a lot more often."}
{"text":"Foosia is the future of Asian eating! Chipotle style line with many different options on what to throw in the bowl. All 7 of their sauces sounded amazing but I ended up choosing the two nuts sauce (haaaa) and in hindsight was a glorious decision. Add in the fact that there is a check in offer (free soft drink) I will definitely be taking my food tasting talents back to Foosia in the near future."}
{"text":"I love Foosia when I need a quick, healthy meal. Lightly cooked veggies and rice noodles are my favorite. And my 10 month old likes it!!"}
{"text":"I will keep this review succinct.  I rarely give five stars to a quick service restaurant, and you should definitely know Foosi earned it!

The counter help was all smiles, answered any question I had, and one of the girls even picked around the onions for me in the vegetable mix so I would not have to have them on my dish!

But it is truly the food that steals the show here. You build your own fresh stirfry. You can choose Jasmine or brown rice, your choice of protein (pick the spicy crispy tofu... Some of the best tofu i have eaten and they make it fresh for each customer!), vegetables, and very creative additions, including pickled cucumbers, fresh bean sprouts, and unique Asian sauces. I chose the muy thai... Sweet, pungent, light. Very authentic to Thai cuisine.

Long story short, this place needs to expand into a chain or franchise immediately. If they had this in Philadelphia, I would eat there multiple times a week!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices for the healthy eaters. Large portions, of course loaded with rice. Delicious if you like pre-cooked food kept warm until eaten. I expected more. Lots of choices of beverages with a quirky selection of sodas with a healthy twist, like dry cucumber. Doesn't seem to be mainstream.  Some like it that way."}
{"text":"Ran out to grab lunch for the office and decided to try Foosia. I must say, it wasn't bad. It's definitely the Chipotle of Asian-style food, though. They had quite a few options to choose from -- brown or Jasmine rice, and then chicken, steak, pork, as well as healthy veggies to add on top and sauces. 

Not sure if the staff was annoyed with the fact that I was pointing to what I wanted rather than calling it by name (since it was my first time in, I didn't know what everything was to begin with), or that I had ordered for 3 people, but they seemed annoyed with me. I may be back to try it again, but not for a while... The staff attitude definitely put me off."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Very healthy. A lot of sauce options. Also if you're feeling like a drink their chilled sake is great as well!"}
{"text":"Really tasty and quick, but overpriced. $10 for a chicken bowl and fountain drink. I would like this place a lot more if they lowered their prices by about $2."}
{"text":"I came here for a Yelp Elite event a little ways back and was not disappointed.  It is very similar to Chipotle's style of build your own noodle dishes.  I liked that there are more choices than Chipotle though...and obviously this is more of the Asian style fare.  I got a Jasmine rice bowl with grilled chicken and Fooster sauce (their take on Sriracha) with Chinese slaw, cucumbers, scallions, lime squeeze, sesame seeds, wonton, and chopped egg.  I loved the indie type bottled sodas this location carried too and enjoyed a Black Cherry soda I haven't had since I was a kid.  There were quite a few Sakes we were able to taste from (for the event).  The owner of the location was there that night and was quite helpful in explaining the idea behind Foosia.  I do hope one makes its way over to the west side sometime soon.  If you're a fan of Asian cuisine and Chipotle, this one is for you!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food that is also good for you. Service is also very good and staff is extremely polite and friendly. Lastly, I'm a huge ice tea fan and Foosia's tea is excellent.  If you're looking for something healthy that also tastes good check this place out."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Asian fast casual concept in the Valley that I could find.  If there's something else in Scottsdale, please help me out.

Always looking for a place I can make gains at.  Went with Brown Rice, Slow Roasted Pork, Wok Glazed vegetables, holy foobanero sauce and peanut dust I suppose.  Overall I enjoyed the taste.  Couldn't complain at all."}
{"text":"Love the concept here....even if it is basically a spin off of Chipotle.  Choose your base (rice, noodle), your protein, and pick your sides.  You can custom order...and it turns into a very sizeable meal, just the way you want it.  Quality food fast. That's what I want at lunchtime!"}
{"text":"Food okay but Michael customer service sucked. Won't go back. Too many places to eat at with better personalities"}
{"text":"If you love Chipotle and want it to be Asian... This is your place. I hate to compare it to Chipotle though.... Because this is definitely and original concept that is much more delusions. I love fast casual dining. Also the store is very clean and the manager is very nice! Must try this!"}
{"text":"Yum - love this quick, casual, reasonably priced Asian concept restaurant.  We enjoyed rice, steak, veggies and a little sauce...super fresh and pretty healthy too.  Love the fast, make your own concept!"}
{"text":"This place was healthy and gave a you pretty big portions for the price. It was only 25¢ for extra vegetables! The chicken was juicy and the \"Thai hot\" alike sauce was to die for! My girlfriend on the steak and she said that it was just as good! We have been trying to eat healthier and the menu here made it easy and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times been entirely satisfied with great food with great flavor, that's reasonably priced. 

You have lots of options to choose from and can make your meal extremely healthy by opting to have the protein put on greens instead of rice. 

Also impressed by the compost and recycling bins instead of trash - a lot more work for a small restaurant - but definitely a trend more restaurants should follow! 

Check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fast but fresh. you get a good deal of veggies which I like. Not greasy. Tastes good."}
{"text":"This place really grew on me. It's like an Asian Chipotle with bowls that come with whatever you'd like. Their portions are pretty good, and it's really great if you're looking for a filling meal that isn't a million calories. I like the spicy tofu, and chicken. Didn't care too much for the steak. All in all, it's a pretty cool atmosphere and the employees are always very kind."}
{"text":"We love it! Fresh veggies and great protein choices and gluten free options! They also have a pet friendly patio which our fur-baby loves!  The food is always good and always fresh. It's a healthy FAST food. Also, the music is always good!"}
{"text":"It was OK. Same concept as chipolte. I liked that they flash stir fry the vegetables right there on the spot.but for what me and family had in the end we would have rather had chipolte or samurai Sam's. Would maybe go back if in a pinch and needed something quick over in the Scottsdale area, but not my first choice"}
{"text":"I can probably say that I am a regular here. Not much has changed: the quality of the food is still great. I can't go a week without my rice noodle and chicken bowl. But the real reason I'm updating my review is because of the girl who works here- Vanessa. She is everything I could ask for customer service wise. She's always really welcoming, seems to know exactly what she's doing (and everything about the menu and products they have here), and always treats me with respect. I have not had one poor interaction with her- she really exemplifies top notch customer service. Kudos to Vanessa, and to the management/hiring team at Foosia for finding this gem of an employee. I really appreciate her kindness every time I come in!"}
{"text":"Not my taste.  Tasted like I was just eating jumbled junk...and this after seeking the advice of the staff who were more than nice but didn't seem to have a clue about food combinations.  We ordered shrimp and had to be warned that we would only get exactly four.  So, we ordered with knowledge, but it still seemed like an awfully small portion for the price."}
{"text":"So disappointing-  After two visits both times the chicken and shrimp were terrible.  Shrimp were overcooked and chewy while the chicken was overdone as well. The veggies and rice are fine as so are the sauces.  

Friendly quick service but the quality isn't there."}
{"text":"The build you own food boom has been growing after the success of burritos and subs. However I am not sure it ports over to Asian that well.

At foosia you start with a choice of rice or noodles(cold) proteins, sauce and then the veggie line. I had the spicy tofu and a Caribbean habenero  sauce. with all of the veggies. The tofu took time to cook and came out and on near the end. Since the sauce is added second most of my meal did not have the sauce on it. The veggies and flavors were quite fresh, however since they were just piled on they flavors did not meld. at $9 for this I was far from impressed."}
{"text":"Awesome concept. Healthy, quick Asian bowl,  yum! It was a little confusing first timer. Wish there was more help with choosing the sauces. Also,  the meat portions seem to be a bit skimpy. Overall though four stars for flavor and quality.  Restaurant was very clean and staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Mediocre (at best) food for an extraordinary price! Let's compare:
Foosia Chicken Bowl vs. Typical Teriyaki Bowl Place:
Price $8.50 vs. $5.00
Made to order: No vs. Yes
Large Portion: No vs. $1.00
White Meat: No vs. $.50
Brown Rice: Yes vs. Yes
All veggie: Yes vs. Yes
Different Sauces: Yes vs. Yes

I ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice. They had no all-white-meat option for the chicken, which irked me. Every decent fast food asian-bowl place I've been to has this option and they charge less per meal. They gave me a decent amount of chicken but only because I raised my eyebrows and glared at the guy when he gave me one scoop of chicken before trying to pile on the veggies. But the chicken is fatty and very oily. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is modeled after Chipotle, which we love; however, we won't be back for a few reasons.  First my kids did not like the food.  They said the steak was tough.  Second the price was too high.  Lunch was $30 for two adults and two children with no drinks.  The concept is good.  I wish they offered better food for a smaller portion for a smaller price."}
{"text":"I love the food here it is so fresh and healthy. I'm only giving it four stars however because of a poor service experience today. There was a young girl with brown hair who obviously hates her job. Me and my friends asked her how it worked and she rolled her eyes at us at least two or three times. she definitely was not trying to hide the fact that she hates her job. It was so bad that I had to end up explaining it to my friends who had never been there before. She pretty much ignored my request for help. Customer service is important and will keep customers coming back. Everyone else I have previously experienced here seems great however."}
{"text":"Overall this place is OK if you want something really legit go to Thai basil in the Pv mall but this place is about convenience and I get that. My one biggest complaint is they have supposedly a cooked version of vegetables and a raw well the cooked is every bit as raw as the raw can you possibly cook them a little more not really into crunchy cooked vegetables"}
{"text":"A tip of the hat to any place that can get me to eat my vegetables, cost under $10, and actually taste good.  Foosia has done a great job executing the ever popular Chipotle model and bringing good fresh Asian to the busy lunch masses."}
{"text":"The food is very tasteful. The service is fast and friendly. It could take 5 min if your in a hurry or 15 if you want to ask questions and be social. I won't be going anywhere else for my Asian food ( served like at chipotle in bowl and you stop at each station to pick what you like)."}
{"text":"This place is great! Highly recommend it. Fast casual set up like a Chipolte but Asian food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I will be back - tomorrow!

Fantastic fresh food. I am so impressed with this restaurant. Quality ingredients, fresh preparation, great flavors, reasonable prices. My bowl with steak, the Korean BBQ sauce, steamed veggies and a couple of toppings was great. At first I thought the amount of sauce they put on may have been too light but I elected to trust them and I was glad. The sauces are bold and well flavored. You don't need a lot to create a good dish.

Prices were good too. I was happy that a large iced tea was only $2. I went to another fast casual restaurant like this yesterday where a large was $3.50. No price gouging here."}
{"text":"Really liked this place, has a chipotle set-up. Everything was fresh, it was quick and cheap. I had really been wanting to check it out and I was not disappointed. I will for be going back."}
{"text":"This is like a fresh, healthy Asian Chipotle.  The ingredients are fresh and good-looking, the sauces have lots of flavor, and the shrimp are enormous (you get 4 in the shrimp bowl).  The place is spacious, with spare Asian decor.    

The process is quick, the results are head and shoulders above fast food, and the service is super pleasant.  A perfect quick meal between activities.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"A must try! The food is fresh, healthy, and delicious. The staff is super friendly . A great new concept that  is sure to be a hit!"}
{"text":"I tried this place today. I like the concept, but the food was not very good especially for the price. I had the rice noodles which were a little dry and the \"crispy\" tofu. The tofu was soaked in oil and spice, and it was definitely not crispy!!  Also, the pickled cucumbers tasted more like sugared cucumbers. My daughter had the beef which was dry too!!  I am really disappointed because I wanted to like this place. Our lunch was about $20 and I did not order a drink. TOO MUCH for dried rice noodles and beef!!  :("}
{"text":"Loved this place! Kids eat free on the weekend! 

Great vegan options. Choice of white rice, brown rice, or rice noodles as a base, and fried tofu (regular or spicy) as a main protein option. 

Lots of good veggies and sauces as add ins! We were told all sauces are vegan with the exception of the Thai sauce, which has fish oil. 

An extra side of rice is free, which is great for kids. Getting extra sauces is also free, which is great.

Don't forget crushed peanuts on top as a finisher!"}
{"text":"I've been here about three times now and I'm quite impressed.  I typically get the spicy tofu in either a bowl or salad preparation.  I get all the veggie toppings, no egg, with the peanut sauce .. Verrry tasty.  Sometimes those red fresno chiles can be a bit spicy, so watch out. Lucky for you they have fresh brewed teas and some really neat sodas in the fridge... One in particular is a ginger beer that has real ginger in it.  Refreshing on a hot day! Sometimes it can seem skimpy on the toppings, but they never balk if you ask for a bit more.  
It's quite affordable, and the line is never long.  I hope to see another one of these pop up a bit further south... Tempe Marketplace perhaps?? =)"}
{"text":"Asian Vr. Of Chipotle! Cheap, Healthy and delicious. Pretty Clean inside and the staffs are fine. Lots of Veggies! Korean BBQ sauce never betrays."}
{"text":"I took my family here tonight. The staff was friendly, courteous, and helpful. The food was amazing! Normally I finish my meals no problem. I was totally stuffed and had to take some home. It was quality food that really filled you up and their selection of additions really make your order unique."}
{"text":"I used Yelp to choose my lunch today.  Foosia is clean, has friendly employees and the food is delicious.  
Foosia is cafeteria style... build your meal, get your drink and enjoy. Because the foods are pre-made rather than made to order, diners with food allergies should research the menu and ingredients online or it will be slim pickins. 
If you are HANGRY the bowl won't be enough to fill you up but give yourself an excuse to go get dessert. I like that the food isn't super greasy and heavy. The veg tastes fresh and the meat is seasoned just right. 
Foosia recycles and composts food waste, yay Foosia . Options for dine in or take out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile but just never got around to it. Today, after eating a heavy breakfast, I was craving some \"Asian\" stir fry veggies so I decided to come here for an early dinner.  I wasn't disappointed and will definitely come back to try another creation!"}
{"text":"So if your a fan of Chipotle......then imagine this place as Chipotle with an Asian inspired pallet. The food is simply delicious......I always have the rice bowl with Jasmine rice.....Spicy Tofu.....Wok Veggies.....green onions.....cucumbers.....cilantro.....and an awesome teriyaki sauce. They have something for you meat lovers as well (LOL) but since I am Vegan of course this dish is perfect for me. So if your looking for something fresh.....healthy.....and a simple Asian Flare....then Foosia is your spot. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and there are lots of yummy sauce choices. The price is a little high for the portion. The employees could really use some cheering up. They don't even greet you when you walk up to the counter."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last Wednesday for lunch.  This is set up like Chipotle and you pick your \"base\" of noodles, bread or salad options, then a protein and a sauce.  There are a number of other toppings to choose from.  It is a little overwhelming to try to figure out what to put together and the variations you could choose from would be practically endless.  It would help if there were some predetermined options available so that you could try some suggested combinations of all the ingredients at least until you get a feel for what you do and do not like.  I had the steak on salad greed with siracha sauce and just told them to put on all the toppings since I wasn't sure what to choose.  It was very tasty and the portions are large.  I don't care for the \"cold\" sterile kind of decor but the food was great and you can sit outside. THe prices are not bad considering the portion size.  There is ample parking."}
{"text":"I remember hearing about this place when it opened and being super excited about an Asian chipotle-style restaurant. Finally decided to try it since its relatively healthy with vegetarian options and not super expensive. Plus I got a free drink thanks to checking in on yelp!
There was nobody in there when I went, which was around 530 on a Sunday. However, while I was eating about 3 people came through to get food to-go. It was very clean in there, a good amount of seating. Would be a good place to stop for lunch in the area if you don't want fast food but you also don't want to go to a waiter service type place. 
I was helped right away, no line since I was the only one! The girl helping me was pleasant, helped me decide whether or not to go for the spicy tofu. I ended up getting it. Had brown rice with spicy tofu, steamed vegetables, green onion, sesame seeds, pea shoots, and the peanut sauce on the side.
I got a tea and it was delicious, a berry iced tea, I loved it! The food was where this place lost a few stars for me. Idk what it was but I just couldn't really get into it. The tofu wasn't too bad, overall my meal was just meh and made me feel a bit sick afterwards. The sauce was good but I wish there would've been a little more. It just felt like something was missing from the bowl or something and it was like too dry! Not sure how to explain, it wasn't bad or anything but I just wasn't totally thrilled with it. I did like everything else about this place though."}
{"text":"Love this place. A tasty and healthy lunch every time. The place is always spotless and the staff is great."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!!! I am trying out veganism and wow, this is the go to place!! The have a crispy tofu bowl, and vegan sauces, everything was crazy fresh. And not to mention, the staff member helping me (Daniel or mike I can't remember ha) was so knowledgable about the food and the ingredients and was very kind and patient with my questions and nutritional needs :) This is my new go to place!!"}
{"text":"Best service ever. Friendly, helpful, amazing, wonderful. Always smiling. Greets you as soon as you come in, obviously deserving of tips here. Great employees. Delicious AND healthy food. Shrimp and steak are my favorites here. My new favorite spot!
Addition: Made a Yelp account just to compliment this place/the employees."}
{"text":"First time.  It is refreshing. A great deal of up potential.  Looking forward to coming again to try more new things.  Great complementary flavors that you do not find elsewhere for the price.  Don't be intimidated by the chili peppers. Owner was very receptive to comments."}
{"text":"Really good. The only recommendation would be to use a firm tofu rather than the silken tofu. The meat dishes are all good. Terrific staff."}
{"text":"It took me a few tries to get it right but this place is super good. I recommend the Fooster Sauce if you like Sriracha sauce.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Foosia is a favorite spot for me and the hubs, it's similar to Chipotle but Asian inspired.  You can start with brown rice, jasmine rice or cold rice noodles. From there choose your protein the options are shrimp, chicken, steak or tofu (I always go for the Tofu since I eat a plant based diet.), pick a sauce, then top with your favorite vegetables and finish with toasted shallots, peanuts and fried wonton strips. They offer sodas, tea and  a choice of alcohol beverages.This place is bright and cheery and the staff is always friendly! There is plenty of indoor seating and they also have a great outdoor seating area. If you are looking for something delicious and different this is a must try spot!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  I've been here several times and it's always been delicious.  The serving sizes are large and enough for two meals if you can keep yourself from eating it all at once.  I also like the taste of their green iced tea."}
{"text":"This place is one of my FAVORITE spots in the Valley!  I think I'm Foosia addicted.  Like everyone says, its the Chipotle of Asian food.  And it NEVER disappoints.  Its easy to make healthy choices too, lots of fresh veggies.  And the steak is so good.  The staff is great too, they will come and check on you at your table to make sure you have everything you need.  Not typical for a quick-service restaurant like this. 

Anyways, keep up the great work Foosia- looking forward to seeing more of these around the Valley."}
{"text":"Bland food. Nice people working there, though. They have gluten free beer, which is cool for those of us in that category. The sauces didn't really do anything for me. Hopefully you'll like it better."}
{"text":"I like it! This is like Chipotle with Asian food. You pick one item from each category (like rice or noodles, wok veggies, protein and sauces) and have a bowl. The ingredients were fresh, service was fast and there is plenty of indoor/outdoor seating.  Good spot to grab lunch in the area."}
{"text":"We have tried a few restaurants like this in CA and really enjoyed them so we wanted to try Foosia on a recent trip to Scottsdale.     The concept is great i.e. made to order Asian bowls containing the ingredients you select at the counter.     Unfortunately on a quiet Friday evening, the ingredients had lost some of their freshness.   The rice was dried out and crispy in places.  The meat was barely warm.  The flavors are definitely good  and if you get there during a busier time you might have a better experience."}
{"text":"If Chipotle had an asian sibling, it would be Foosia. I believe there is so much potential to their concept. The flavor choices they offer are both original and familiar. Original because they put their own twist on the usual and familiar because you can easily identify the sweet, spicy, tangy asian flavors.

The place is clean and the staff were very helpful. They did not have a lot of customers when we visited but I guess it was because we got there very late. I would think the place becomes busy during lunch and dinner.

The ordering order. First selection, the bowl. Its just there way of saying choose your carbs. They offer jasmine rice, brown rice, noodles and flat bread. You can also go all greens if you don't feel like carbo loading. Next choice, your protein. They have pork, beef, chicken, shrimp and tofu. Third in line are the veggies. The customers can make a choice on how they want the veggies cooked. It can be a quick stir fry or steamed. Fourth station is the sauce choices. I had the Kim Jong-Who??? BBQ and my wife tried the Two nuts walk into a bar. Yes, they have weird names but it does give a good idea of what to expect (lets touch on the sauce a little bit more later). The last stop is for the toppings section. The choices are crispy wantons, thai herbs, peanuts, shallots and many more.

Like I said, the sauce. It makes a difference. Kim Jong-Who??? BBQ is as you guess it, a korean bbq sauce. Sweet and spicy. It has a great kick that cuts through the sweetness of the bbq sauce. Sweet and spicy is always... ALWAYS...a good combination. My wife had the Two nuts walk into a bar. Yes, you got it right, peanut sauce. If you like the  southeast asian flavor of Malaysia and Thailand, this is your sauce. It has a balanced hint of soy sauce and coconut that would satisfy your craving for some salty and creamy finish.

The combination of carbs, properly cooked protein, veggies, tasty sauce, some fresh herbs and a topping of crunchy wantons or peanuts would definitely make every bite an experience. There are layers and layers of flavors and textures that would really make the meal interesting. The fusion at Foosia is a spoonful that is worth a try.

Chipotle meets Fresh Asian Flare= FOOSIA

Good.Fresh.Tasty.Value!

Lots of healthy and delish options, very fresh food, and the price can't be beat.

The place is no frills, but clean, and comfortable.  Take out is a breeze and the food is just plain good!

I will be back and so will you..."}
{"text":"We found this little gem close by and are so glad we did! Their service was excellent (hard to come by these days) and the food was great! It is a mix between Pei Wei and chipotle! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Only one word to describe this please.  \"Awesome \". You want to eat healthy this is the place OMG IT is so dam good my husband and workout and we can finally eat out or take home for a great protein low carb meal.  Awesome awesome"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. The concept is like a chipotle but Asian food. The food appeared good behind the glass.  Ate the food and very disappointed, the vegetables were over seasoned with salt, the chicken was over cooked tasking like rubber. The rice was ok. The cost for bowl $10.81. The food not worth the money ."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and had a bowl with:
Brown rice, steak, and all the toppings. For the sauce I mixed the house sriracha and Korean bbq. 

The food was good although not particularly hot (temperature). The veggies had been sitting for a while and were a bit mushy. While everything was seasoned well, I thought the sauces were overly sweet and lacked a depth of flavor. 

The bowls are very similar in size to a burrito bowl
At chipotle and It was definitely a substantial amount of food. 

I wasn't blown away, but wasn't disappointed either."}
{"text":"This is the Chipotle of Asian cuisine.  It's fresh, it's healthy, and it's filling.  You can choose white or brown rice or cold noodles, then choose your protein.  After that, you can add one of two types of veggie mixes.  My hubby was a little disappointed because both the veggie mixes had broccoli in them, which he hates, so he had to skip the veggies altogether.  I think they should have more than two of the same veggie medley.  Maybe let people choose each veggie individually that they'd like instead of having them all mixed.  I liked the variety of sauces too.  

One thing that really impressed me about Foosia was the use of sustainable and earth friendly products.  Nothing in this restaurant is thrown out.  Instead, it is all either composted or recycled.  If every restaurant had a conscience like Foosia, this world would be a much cleaner place."}
{"text":"I like this whole concept. Food was good, clean atmosphere, and healthy. Only thing I don't care for is the rude employees. I've been here two times already, and both times the employees serving you act like its an inconvenience to do their job. I hope you guys expand and pop up throughout the valley because the food truly is healthy, and good for being fast. It's very similar to a chipotle only Asian inspired"}
{"text":"To me, customer service is what defines a restaurant. While good food might get you in the door, great service is what keeps me coming back. You want loyal customers, especially if you're trying to build a business. 

Right when we walked in the door, we were greeted by a manager/owner asking us if we had been to this eatery before. He offered recommendations along with explaining the concept of the restaurant, and I was immediately impressed. 

Everyone working at the place was extra friendly, and a different person (definitely looked like an owner) specifically went out of his way to ask us if we were enjoying our meal. 

Like many other reviews have said, they offer healthy options along with great, innovative sauces. 

One tip for improvement though, since they're obviously a brand new business, there were too many things to pick (and look at) on the menu. Simplify it to picking a protein and picking a sauce. Otherwise I can only imagine a very hectic line during lunch rush. 

I can picture this becoming a HUGE success like Chipotle, and I have no doubts I will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Foosia the other day because Seychelle M. talked about how good the food was. Well, it exceeded my expectations! It was delicious and fresh. I ordered spicy tofu, which was added later, and the sauce and limes made it quite tasty. In the picture, the squares aren't crutons, they are the spicy tofu, which was cooked to perfection. I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Foosia is like Chipotle, trying to be Asian style. The place is nice and clean and staff are friendly. The food however didn't impress me. I had a bowl of brown rice, chicken, steamed veggie and most of the toppings with mango-lime sauce. The taste of the dish is flavorless and flat. It's hard to swallow the food not because the food was bad but because of rough texture of the food. Also the proportion of protein is considerably less than other ingredients. Another time I tried the Thai Vinaigrette sauce but it was too sour.

Overall, most taste of the food came from the sauce but the two sauces I tried didn't satisfy my taste buds."}
{"text":"Really solid, fresh, tasty option. 

This is a cafeteria - style place where you order something from each step in the line. Carb, protein, veggies, sauce, extras. I had the chicken on brown rice with the vinaigrette sauce, and it was great! Everything was nice and fresh. I especially liked the brightness of the veggies and the freshness of the cilantro and mint. The portions are reasonably sized. Probably not enough on my hungry days, but good. 

The service was efficient and friendly, and the building was clean.

Great lunch option!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! It's like an Asian version of Chipotle. You can choose between rice, noodles or flatbread for base, add choice of veggies and protein and sauces! As a vegetarian, I chose the Rice Noodles with sautéed veggies, Peanut and Korean BBQ and Sauces, topped with bean sprouts, fried onions and wontons! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I would have never thought of going to Foosia since I don't live in the area  Luckily, I was invited to an elite yelp event where Foosia hosted. I was impressed - I got free food, drinks, sake, candy, and what - a $25 gift card?! Who doesn't love \"free\" stuff?

So after a nice, tough hike on Squaw Peak, I wanted something good, fast, not where I need to dress cute, and cheap. Even better, what about free? So I head to Foosia with my future hubs and the place was pretty empty which was nice. 

I ordered the noodles, with vegetables, okinawan pineapple sauce, grilled shrimp, wonton chips, and red peppers. I also got an iced green tea. Maybe it was just that I was starving and tired, but I was scarfing that thing down! I was eating so fast that I was starting to get heartburn! I rarely get heartburn so I realized I needed to slow my roll. 

The only con I have was that I only got four shrimps, FOUR! That's it?! The shrimp was full of flavor, plump, and succulent! The green tea was amazing too. It was better than some coffee shops i've been to. 

If only they were closer to me, i'd go more often!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, lots of choices, and very fresh food! Came here two days in a row, for lunch, and both times were incredible. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for gluten and dairy free! Usually when eating out I can only have one or two things due to my food allergies but here I could eat almost everything they offer! It was so nice to have choices and the staff was incredible! Great customer service and great food. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was an interesting place, almost a cross between a Panda Express and a Salad Bar. I did enjoy it, but it was heavy on the sauces. Make sure to get them on the side. I loved all the variety of vegetables you could choose from. You could make it healthy or unhealthy depending on what you pile on."}
{"text":"Love the concept and the food! My only complaint was that the girl let me taste two different sauces and jumped the gun pouring the wrong sauce on by accident. I did think it was a little pricey but the food was excellent and I did not feel guilty eating every last bite! Next time I will be sure to be clear on the sauce I choose though LOL"}
{"text":"Quick Chipotle like Asian food restaurant.  Delicious food, very very nice staff willing to walk you through what everything is without sounding like you're interrupting them.  I will definitely be back, the crispy tofu was excellent!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with the flavor and value. I would recommend mixing the siracha sauce with the peanut sauce. I'll be treating this like my Chinese food Chipotle! Stay healthy with fresh ingredients at a low price."}
{"text":"Love this place !!! So simple and fresh, good quality meats and veggies. Clean atmosphere and easy location. I find myself here once a week and split the bowl for dinner and lunch the next day because it's a generous portion."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My wife and I really wanted to give this please a try given we are Asian food fanatics. However, Panda Express offers a better bowl and we haven't eaten there in years. 

The teriyaki chicken bowl had flavorless cold noodles, maybe 4 oz of chicken and the vegetables were outnumbered by the diced green onion. 

Such a sad experience. Guess we will stick to the mom and pop Chinese restaurants we love."}
{"text":"Love the prices. Small meat portions but the cold noodle bowl with veggies & pineapple sauce is excellent. Very refreshing and leaves a taste in your mouth that you'll miss later. I wish they had more locations! I hope they grow"}
{"text":"What an awesome concept: fresh healthy food served fast that is also delicious! 

I met one of the owners, Fred, while there and he shared with me that his medical doctor wanted him to eat healthier and gave him some suggestions for how to improve his diet. From that moment, the concept for the restaurant was born. 

After some work with investors and others he knew from his years in the restaurant business, Fred took the proposed menu to his doctor. With his doctor's blessing, Foosia was born. 

Think of the eatery as Chipotle meets Asian cuisine. The menu is easy to understand and walks you thru all your healthy choices. The servers behind the counter offer suggestions and even allow you to customize your meal anyway you want. For example, I was the first customer based on my server's experience to mix all the basic ingredients which were salad greens, chilled noodles and 2 types of rice:) I highly recommend the house sauce which is sweet with a little kick!

With a regular drink, the meal was very affordable. While I am not a local, I will be eating here regularly whenever business or pleasure brings me back to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I went and met Cassey Ho during her tour and she said she went to lunch at Foosia. So of course, I HAD to go and try it out. Like others said, definitely Chipotle, Asian style. I got the tofu as the protein and the tofu was so good!! It had a nice kick to it. I got the housemade sriracha and peanut sauce together...so good!! Topped it off with crushed peanuts and wonton pieces and the dried scallops or something..YUM!
Only thing I would change next time is I would go without the veggies. Not that I don't like veggies....but I don't like carrots, which is part of the mixed veggies."}
{"text":"A play on CHIPOTLE with very lousy execution. Essentially the same idea with one or two added ingredients that do not add anything to the theme.  

Meat and food quality is nowhere on par with chipotle. I walked in at 8pm, all the veggies were ultra soggy (and drenched in oil), meat was cooked in peanut oil and fish sauce (yuck!), and the whole thing just did not work. Rice was very dried out with no flavor. 

Overall everything tasted very 'stale' and not fresh. My bowl with double meat and a bottled pellegrino was over $17 !!! Don't let the 'stock' photography on their yelp page fool you - in person it looks nothing like that.  The best thing I can compare this quality of food to is your average MALL food...at 3x the price


I will not be returning back..."}
{"text":"The concept is good. The decor is great, and the employees, although yes, they are young as some people pointed out, they were very friendly.

Unfortunately, a restaurant comes down to the food.  It always comes down to the food, and in this case, it was not good.

It was 6:30PM on a Friday night, and the place was empty, which should have been a warning, but we went in anyway.  The protein in the warmers up front was old, old, old.   The only thing that saved our meal was the fact that we both wanted tofu, which is cooked to order.  The rest of the food (the rices and vegetables) were also old, bit not as critical to the dish.  You can keep rice in a warner a long time and its still good.

We sampled several of the sauces and they were all wonderful, a nice blend of sweet and spicy, good texture and color, I can't say enough positive things about the sauces, but unless something changes with the other food, this place will not last.  Especially when the official Chipotle version of Asian food makes its way to Phoenix.

A couple came in after us and left because they didn't eat tofu, and I don't blame them.  I understand that you don't want to waste food if there are no customers, but its a vicious circle because you won't have customers without fresh food.  Why can't all of it be cooked to order? At least until you are constantly busy?  

For those sauces, 
I would wait."}
{"text":"Delicious food with healthy options! Absolutely loved it! The meat was tender (steak) and I loved the Korean BBQ sauce, there were so many great sauces to choose from. The staff was great and helpful with explaining the menu as well."}
{"text":"Tried foosia while trying to find healthy \"clean\" food and we weren't disappointed. Love this place!  It is similar to chipotle meeting Asian stirfry. Everything looked and tasted delicious.  Great customer service too. I also enjoyed having no caffeine and no sugar fruit ice tea. So many times it is loaded with caffeine and sugar. I wish California had a few of these, I would eat there all the time.  Foosia we will be back!"}
{"text":"Foosia is an awesome restaurant that has delicious, fresh food and fast service! 
You build your own bowl and have a ton of options to choose from. The chicken and steak are fantastic, but we love everything there! I can be a little bit of a health nut, so I love that they have options to suit me. 
If you're looking for a fast place to grab lunch, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Foosia has been on my list of places to try for a while. I finally swung in for lunch today and was impressed by the employees professionalism. 

In regards to the quality of food, the grilled chicken and jasmine rice was fantastic! I tried the peanut sauce which was smooth and flavorful. I was not a fan of the toppings, but this is just my personal preference. I did choose to add wonton strips (boring I know!). 

It was unfortunate that the vegetables are pre blended with an overwhelming amount of broccoli. I would have loved the carrots, peppers, etc but I couldn't justify getting the vegetables when the majority was broccoli. 

I also think, while this concept is similar to chipotle, the price is much higher. Grilled chicken, one of the cheapest proteins was still $10+."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is the word I would use to describe my meal here. The food was luke warm and bland. My boyfriend even went and got extra sauce, but it didn't help. Honestly, if you put a blindfold on me and told me to try their food and then asked what style cuisine it was, I wouldn't be sure. The only reason I am giving Foosia a 2 star is because it was clean and I don't feel like I am going to be sick. I'm just completely underwhelmed. To put it in perspective I don't even like Panda Express--it makes me sick-- but if I were given the choice between the two I would eat at Panda because at least it is flavorful... That's how much I disliked my chicken bowl."}
{"text":"Saw that this place was in the neighborhood and I was curious to see what it was like. Hopped on Yelp! and saw that it had lots of good reviews, so I took my brother and checked it out today. Since it's a relatively new business, we got a free entree coupon in the mail (extra incentive to come in). I got Jasmine rice with shrimp, veggies, and I mixed 2 sauces-fooster (because I love Sriracha) and holy foobanero (a sweet/spicy mix). Delicious! I will probably be back to test the tofu. Management and employee were very friendly, nice open space with a patio."}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit. It's a good alternative to chipotle, similar concept. But it's like getting punched in the face with flavor. I get white rice, steak or chicken, wok glazed veggies. Cucumbers, bean sprouts, and cabbage, fooster (Sriracha) and peanut sauce! You will not be disappointed I promise! I come here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is a great lunch spot , all fresh and flavorful food. I had a free coupon to try this place and so glad I did cause I had no clue such goodness was around the corner .. I will for sure be back. It's kinda like chipotle but Asian style. I had the tofu and it was Delish !"}
{"text":"Very clean, nice friendly staff. Absolutely a Pei Wei meets Chipotle dining style and taste. I was really looking forward to trying this place out. All the reviews have been great. But for me, it was just ok. And like a 1 meal ok. Not likely to return. I would rather just spend a few more bucks and got to Pei Wei. I will say the flat bread was really good. I would maybe go back just for that!"}
{"text":"You'll like this, nothing to write home about but enjoy the chipotle style preparation."}
{"text":"This place has great food. I normally create my plate with the brown rice, grilled chicken, sautéed veggies, peanut sauce, siracha sauce, cilantro and fried wontons to top it off...hopefully I didn't forget anything. The point is...you won't be disappointed!! The girls are very friendly that work here too."}
{"text":"It was my first time here this afternoon, and I was quite impressed! The staff was pleasant and welcoming, the atmosphere was clean and modern, and the food was great as well! I liked the way of ordering your bowl, much like it is done at Chipotle. It felt very healthy in the various options they provided, and they have less drinks in addition to regular sodas"}
{"text":"The food tastes good and I like that you can completely customize the bowl to what you like. It is fun to mix sauces and the overall concept is simple and healthy, which I like! :) My only complaint is the price. I got a chicken bowl, no drinks or anything else, and it was $10. If the price dropped by at least a couple dollars I would be more likely to go more often. Thanks Foosia!"}
{"text":"A nice change of pace.  I like the fact that the dishes come with brown or white rice or rice noodles.  The noodles are not chilled as advertised but room temperature which is OK.  The tofu is very lightly fried but be careful if you don't want your dish to be spicy ask for the tofu to be prepared without the seven spices which makes it really hot with a powerful kick.  Toppings are nicely done, fresh, and plentiful.  The price is certainly good and the portions are large.  A nice large covered/shaded patio but it might be hot in the summer since there didn't seem to be misters.  The concept seems to be catching on since places like Pelini, Fired, Which Wich and others are all giving you the opportunity to customize your meal from a variety of toppings or add-ins.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite restaurants! 

I have been there 5-6 times to date and loved it every time. 

Great food and healthy options - from brown rice to flavorful wok-glazed veggies to spicy tofu (or any protein) I am hooked!

I love their fooster sauce! And try mixing it with the peanut sauce - yum.

Overall, great quality and delicious taste.

The employees are incredibly friendly and helpful and receptive to your needs. If you don't know what meat you'll like just ask to sample!

The owner also is very nice and seems to be very interested in feedback!

Hope it spreads like wildfire. I'll be back before I return to PVD."}
{"text":"Enjoying a great healthy and great-tasting lunch. It's nice to give business to a locally owned non-franchised restaurant. If you are in the area and want a fast and healthy alternative, check them out. Grilled shrimp and lime sauce are great. The chillies and cucumber rock too."}
{"text":"Yuck & $11.25 and four small shrimp..Skip this kids. Not even close to Chipotle quality."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by this place, based off the reviews I expected far better. My girl and I both ordered rice bowls (she got the chicken, I got the steak) and tried different sauces. Everything was...bland. It felt like a microwave meal, and for 20$ it shouldn't. Paper bowls scream food truck; the lukewarm food, under cooked rice, stale wontons, limp veggies, and unseasoned beef just speak of a lack of effort. I went back to the counter for extra sauce, but was still left feeling underwhelmed by the flavor. 
I'll give 'em two stars for the fact that it was clean, and I didn't feel like the food was going to make me sick. But I didn't feel like I got value for what I paid, and I certainly didn't enjoy the meal. 
I would give this place a hard pass."}
{"text":"I drove by tonight and saw the new restaurant and I a to say the food is really good!  I got in line and the staff was very pleasant and walked me through my order.  I got the child bowl with wet noodles, steak which was grilled and yummy, peanut sauce, the leaves (mint I think) and lime sauce.   I was not sure about the cold noodles verses hot noodles I am used too, but the combination of the food in my mouth was exceptional.

Even though I got a child bowl, it was more than enough to feel me up and for $5 and change, how could I go wrong.  Same amount of food at Chipolte's would have been $7 or more.

Congrats on your new restaurant concept and I look forward to my next bowl!"}
{"text":"Always fresh food and great portions. Friendly staff and clean environment! One of my favs"}
{"text":"Like the other reviewers have stated this reminded me of a Asian Chipotle, which is meant as a compliment. Was very tasty and good quality for quick eats. Service was very friendly in the line and came over and checked that we were pleased with our food while we were eating. We will definitely be back and I would recommend this place. The only change I would suggest was I thought the alcohol seemed way over priced."}
{"text":"My wife and I had seen this place a few times and were intrigued. We were even more intrigued when we heard it was an oriental version of Chipotle. We decided to give it a try and loved it. You get to choose when goes in your bowl, like: rice, protein, veggies, sauces, and extras. It would be nice if they used white meat chicken. We were assured that each choice was made to compliment the others. So, you really couldn't make a poor combination. We loved it and would go back."}
{"text":"Basically it's an Asian Food Chipotle. The food is fresh and they offer a lot of great combos the ingredients felt fresher than Chipotle but they skimp you on the sauce. I liked my fried tofu but my husband didn't enjoy his spicy version. Overall if you're in the area I would say go ahead and stop! However, I would not make a special trip for it."}
{"text":"If you go in when the food is freshly cooked, it's great.  But, 99% of the time, the food, veggies and meat, have been sitting for hours and are gross.  I stopped going after giving it 5 chances and only getting fresh food one time."}
{"text":"Be sure to take a look at the menu prior to arrival, once your in line you feel pressured to order fast and there's lots of options. 

This is Chipotle's run with Asian food. I'm happy to report its just like Chipotle as far as atmosphere and portion size! Little on the spicy side.

The fooster sauce with tofu was excellent and on the spicy side. My sister had steak with foo foo mango lime. She said it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Place is ok, wasn't what I expected they fill your bowl with rice and half a scoop of your protein. Sides are ok aswell nothing to Make you say wow. I would probably never revisit ....

Was contacted by them and they took care of me explained a bit more my options and was very good the second time around will def be back"}
{"text":"Here is what I get,  and it's delicious every time: half brown rice and half veggies with chicken,  both hot sauce and peanut sauce,  and all the veggies,  herbs and peppers available.   Then I sit out on the lovely shaded patio next to the herb boxes and read my book and listen to the birds chirping in the trees.  It is a wonderful way to spend a lunch break."}
{"text":"Quick spot to grab a healthy meal. Lots of options and usually decent deals"}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot, healthy with lots of different combos. I'm here at least twice a week. Keep up the awesome flavor!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Like an Asian Chipotle.  The peanut sauce on top of a Salad or noodles is great!  The food is good and the place is clean.  Highly recommend for fast, inexpensive Asian fusion."}
{"text":"It did taste fresh. Even the pre-woked veggies were not overdone. Adding the Thai basil and herbs was a good call, tasty. It's a chipotle style setup, I'll need to experiment with different items and sauces to find my perfect meal. My husband is allergic to gluten so it's a great choice for a quick, cheap and easy meal for us."}
{"text":"What a great new restaurant in the Scottsdale Airpark area! I can see how it would be quick and easy (and healthy!) for lunch, but we came here for dinner on a Friday night. It was quite slow at 6:15 so the gal behind the counter was super patient with us. I got the brown rice, chicken, steamed veggies, and mango-lime sauce with a half ladle of the peanut sauce. Yum-o! It is so cool how you can select your sauces and there are about 8 to choose from. And its great how they mix and match so you can blend your own flavors. I appreciated how I could taste the sauces before committing to one. There was plenty of food and even for dinner, I only ate about half. I didn't like that it was dark meat chicken; I am a white meat kinda girl. But overall a fan, and with how quick, easy and convenient it is, I am planning on coming back!"}
{"text":"I love checking out new dining ideas and I definitely welcomed the casual/healthy approach to everything I read about Foosia.

We came early on a Friday evening (about 5:45) and were one of only 2 occupied tables at the time. The crowd grew as we ate; people in line were pretty interested in learning about this new concept.

I assembled my meal with brown rice, tofu, the wok-glazed veggie mix (you can also sub just regular steamed vegetables), their peanut sauce, toasted peanuts, herb mix, bean sprouts and two lime wedges for squeezing.

The good:

-Tasty ingredients. The brown rice was fluffy perfection. We both agreed we were wary that it might be stale/chewy based on appearance, but it was ideal in taste and texture. All vegetables and toppings were super fresh!

-My fried-to-order tofu cubes were abundant in amount and seasoned perfectly.

-The sauces were absolutely delicious. I tried a sample of their peanut sauce and knew it would make it's way to my bowl. Their website says it contains peanuts, dark soy sauce and coconut milk. Boyfriend used the BBQ sauce on his bowl and it was incredibly flavorful as well. 

-Ample toppings of extras. The herb mix gave the PERFECT minty/basily pop throughout the bowl. The lime wedges gave the perfect amount of final bright flavor. Protip: Don't try to add TOO many selections, as tempting as they look.

The \"needs work\" section:

-I can see this ordering system getting really slow during peak times. I like that I got my tofu made right as I ordered, but it took a few minutes and I wonder if a busy lunch line would get backed up?

-It would be great if the menu gave descriptions of what's all in the sauces. Their peanut sauce is labeled \"Two nuts walk into a bar...\" which is cute and obviously their peanut sauce, but listing out the ingredients as it's shown on their website could probably save both staff and customer some time.

-Girl forgot to top boyfriend's bowl with his sauce. Not a huge deal, but I did have to go up and get a ramekin for pouring. We'd be out of luck had we taken our order to go.

All in all, I liked Foosia. We will definitely be back, but will probably give them a few weeks in between trips in order for them to work some kinks out. A great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan!
I got the brown rice with chicken and a lil bit of everything. Love love love, the cucumber topping. 
Very much so a Asian flavored chipotle/subway type of establishment. 

The portions were huge! I was so full when I finished my bowl, I regret not having saved half for another meal. Btw. They have a red chili garnish that will literally knock your socks off and is so spicy it makes your ears burn. I think I lost my hearing for a moment because it was so spicy. I loved it. But if you aren't a spicy food fan, stay clear away from this stuff. It's potent.

I appreciate the environmentally conscious recycling and compost aspect of this establishment as well.

{"text":"Phenomenal fast gourmet healthy asian in a Chipotle model. I would highly recommend the grilled shrimp w/ the fresh mango kafir. Oh freaking wow! Tastegasm."}
{"text":"Usually don't review unless I get excellent service or a horrific experience. This place has potential and I have been waiting years to try it. I finally did because I work down the street and was given a coupon for a free bowl. THANK GOD it was free! I would have never paid for service that was so slow and unfriendly. I also got a shrimp bowl with one tiny scoop of steamed stir fry that was undercooked and soggy brown iceberg lettuce with 4 shrimp. If I had paid, it would've been $13 for this. Not pleased at all and won't be back"}
{"text":"Um, I'm not sure what to rate this place. I know it's supposed to be healthy and a \"fast-casual\" place, but they just don't hit the spot like a Chipotle or Fired Pie would. I didn't eat the entire meal because it wasn't appetizing. Healthy, yes. Good for you, yes. But... hmm, not really worth the price and nothing seems special here. 

If you're hooked on eating healthy, this is probably your type of place. I'm hooked on eating mostly healthy, so I'll stick to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Ok I love this place!!! Treat myself to foosia at least once a week! Basically Asian food chipotle style! Meaning that you get to choose what you want in your rice or noodle bowl. Very fresh ingredients! I've tried their chicken and crispy tofu and both were delicious. I would say though, the tofu could be a little bit crispier and should be place in the bowl before you top it off with the sauce of your choice. 

Customer service is good, it would be helpful if staff would give new customers a run down. I've literally given new customers a little 411 of what to expect while in line lol. I have to say if you're looking for something fast and healthy foosia will be your place to go!"}
{"text":"Good place to just grab a fast asian lunch or dinner.  When busy sometimes service can be slow if there are first timers ahead of you.  Food does the trick though I would like to see the ingredients be fresher, more flavorful and more of it.  A little pricey for what you get, even in NoSco."}
{"text":"We picked up lunch for our staff today from Foosia.  We ordered family style and it was delicious and fresh, as always.  The sauces are amazing, the veggies cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable!!  Thanks for a memorable lunch!"}
{"text":"The concept is not new .. Pick a bowl, protein, veggie, sauce and toppings .. Enjoy!!

You can have a fresh green salad as a base instead of rice (for the lo-carbers), then choose from chicken, beef, pork, shrimp or tofu, veggies, sauce and top it any way you like!! You could create a new bowl everyday!!

I like the chicken with the salad mixed greens, wok glazed veggies, foo foo mango sauce and marinated cucumbers and chilis .. Crushed peanuts to finish!! Delish and filling !!

Staff is always friendly... Expect a line at lunch time.. But there is plenty of indoor and shady outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Hubby ordered take out from here.  The food was ok. Pretty bland and pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is my fav quick and healthy meal pick up! It's like an Asian style build your own bowl....I get the brown rice, chicken or shrimp (or mixed), steamed veggies, bean sprouts, cilantro, and love the wonton crisps on top! The pineapple teriyaki sauce is my jam. Simple, quick, and practically guilt free (with exception of those fries wontons). Reasonably priced and huge portions. I wish there were more locations, but am lucky this one isn't too far from me.

I also like their environmental awareness and the efforts made to recycle. Kudos!"}
{"text":"If you like to drop deuces, this is the place for you. This place can give taco bell a run for its money for the title of TBS."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Bruno Mars - Just The Way You Are)

Oh their sauce, their sauce
Make me give them stars while I'm writing
Their food, their food
Comes perfectly at Foosia for biting
It's so beautiful
And I want it every day

Yeah I know, I know

When I compliment them
I Hope you believe me
And its so, its so
Good to think it sees what I see
But every time it asks me to Bo Bites I say okay


Foosia is a healthy Asian Fusion style restaurant made to your order and liking.  

At first site this place is very similar to your typical Chipotle.  Start ordering with a base of lettuce or rice and then moving on with your proteins.  Next is your vegetable selections and sauce.  I went from a lettuce bowl with steak and vegetables.  Then added the mango lime sauce with some cilantro, bean sprouts, cucumbers, fried won tons, and a tad bit of Thai red chili.  Overall my entree was solid and definitely fresh to the bite.  I'm generally not a fan of eating a lot of Asian food simply because of the way it's cooked and how my love handles would hate me for it, but Foosia has solved my problem!  Fresh ingredients cooked under a calorie conscious menu with exotic funky named sauces to provide a POW to your mouth like, Holy Foobanero, Two Nuts Walk Into a Bar, and Okinawan Pineapple Pow!  

In the end, Foosia is hot and high especially with a more healthy and environmentally aware food culture.  As the push for a non-GMO ingredient continues I can see Foosia on the cusp of a new food revolution! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I really want to like it, but it just feels very average to me. The decor is modern, which is cool, but the ceilings are very high and the minimalism makes it feel cold and impersonal. The employees aren't especially enthusiastic either. 

I appreciate they have tofu and you have the option of white or brown rice, cold rice noodles, or flatbread and there is a good variety of sauces and toppings,
But nothing really had a lot of flavor which I was hoping for. 

Perhaps if they had \"recommended\" bowls it would help.. That way you know what proteins and toppings go well with what sauces."}
{"text":"This place could be good but the portions served are ridiculously small.  The bowl I ordered had hardly any chicken or vegetables.  If they want to piggy back off Chipotle's concept they should also follow suit with their portion sizes. No one in our group was happy with their food or the service."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Asian version of Chipotle. I get a double meat portion then I can save half as another meal. He meat is very tasty. Don't get the shrimp. I ordered it as an additional protein & they gave me 4. That's ridiculous. The staff is very friendly & the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised...the staff was very nice and attentive...but wait, you're not reading this to hear about the staff...you wanna know about the food. Its a fresh/Asian take on assembly line food...but its actually quite good. Vegetables come in a heaping serving, portions are nice and big for lunch, and even though it came with only 4 shrimps, they were.cooked to order and cooked perfectly...I plan to return."}
{"text":"Foosia is a fast casual, American take on Asian Fusion! Came here for a sake and menu tasting courtesy of a Yelp event and came here a few times after because I enjoyed the food.

Definitely easy to order and is a build your own bowl tailored to your tastes, which is great! From having a rice or noodle base, types of vegetables, protein and toppings. You can have whatever you'd like! I always go for some brown rice with steamed veggies, huge fan of the marinated steak and/or seared shrimp. What I love most is that their shrimp here is cooked to order and although you get about 5 or 6, it is fresh! I usually do their vinagrette sauce and all of the toppings except for wonton strips. The protein is always well cooked and their ingredients are so fresh tasting. Their portion of sauce to bowl is also very good as it doesn't leave your bowl drenched and drowning in sauce, but enough to be so flavorful and refreshing.

Their drink selection is great here. I do a Zico, coconut water but their Zippang is a deliciously, bubbly sake that's good if you're looking for something to wind down a bit.

Service here is phenomenal, with workers so friendly and kind. They often make rounds to ensure all is okay with the food and the restaurant is always clean. On my last visit I was trying to use up the rest of my gift card and told the cashier to take my remaining balance off of the gal behind me. They were so sweet and give me a little extra shrimp. I wasn't looking for anything, except just for a random act of kindness.

Definitely a great twist on yet another fast casual concept, but this one really works. Keep it up Foosia!"}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times but I have to give this place a 1 and will never come back based purely off one of the owners being a complete asshole. I think there are 2 owners and 1 is actually very nice, I don't know how to describe him other then well groomed, friendly and the shorter one of the two. The asshole is the big heavy set one who walks around barking orders at employees with never a smile.
I came here on a Sunday and it was quiet with no one else in the place. I couldn't decide between the rice and salad base and the cute young girl working said I can do half/half. I did that and I asked for extra red peppers and extra cucumbers. Like Chipotle, the trays can get pretty big so she had a hard time closing it. As soon as the owner noticed he said she shouldn't be filling it that high and it gives the customers 2 bowls for the price of 1 and was a complete dick about it. Then he turns to me and says how they can't do that anymore to keep the price fair for everyone. WTF. #1 I didn't fill the bowl, #2 the girl was so nice, friendly and helpful which is pretty uncommon for what's considered a fast-food chain so he should be more appreciative of his employees, and #3 I think he was under the impression I got \"double protein\" which I didn't. So before he goes off on employees and customers like an unprofessional hungry asshole, maybe he should learn some customer service skills first especially considering this is a new business. He made me feel like I was trying to rip the place off. Even if he thought I did ask for double protein, just charge me extra for it like any other place would instead of flying off the handle."}
{"text":"Get the shrimp. Seriously. 

Hubby says the chicken is ok, but I wasn't wowed by the steak. We both thought the shrimp was amazing. 

Sauces are kind of overwhelming - lots of choices. My favorite was the peanut - it was slightly spicy but not bad (and I'm wimpy). 

A very easy place to eat healthy. I absolutely LOVE that they recycle AND COMPOST!!! So very sad how rare this is in AZ."}
{"text":"I don't know why Yelp shows this place closed, they're definitely not! I really like this place. I think it could be the next chipotle (asian twist) franchise... It was clean, and the staff was friendly.
I have brown rice and noodles, chicken and tofu, and all the fixings. Tofu was spicy (yumm), Fresno chilies were wicked hot!

I wish they had a place in Phoenix!!

I would definitely put invest in their stock!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like Chipotle, you should like foosia.  It's like a healthy Asian twist on Chipotle.  Fresh food, really nice staff who seem to want to make you happy.  Nice little porch to eat outside if you want.  I've been over 5 times and it is always good.  Interior and clean and modern."}
{"text":"This place is kind of like Chipotle but with an Asian twist instead of Mexican: you walk down the line Subway-style and they build your bowl with the ingredients you select. It can be difficult to rate the food at places like this because your experience can vary quite a bit depending on what YOU put into your bowl. I was happy with my selection, so I had a positive experience. 

The place is very clean and has a modern minimalist decor. They care a lot about recycling and have separate trash cans. When we were there, the staff were very attentive, helpful and friendly. They may have been a bit more on their game since we were there with a big group, but it didn't seem like the behavior was too far out of the ordinary for them. 

On to ordering food. The line moved pretty quickly, but I can see how that could be a bottleneck like it can be at any of these places. On the plus side, a vast majority of the options were available immediately, so there was no waiting beyond the time it took patrons to make their choices. I had the lettuce with beef and my wife had chicken with jasmine rice. I found both meats to be a little bland on their own, but they were cooked well: not too dry and not over or under done, either. The beef and chicken were cut into nice-sized pieces and the portions were reasonable. We both added the steamed veggies on top, then selected sauces. The reason the meats are lightly seasoned is so that YOU can choose your flavors by adding the sauce(s) of your choice. I added peanut sauce and the house sriracha, then topped the whole thing with sliced chiles, cucumbers and crushed peanuts. I think the dish came together well -- especially if you like things more than a little spicy. My wife was also happy with her chicken bowl, although the said having a little more sauce on the side would have been good: the rice absorbs it more than the lettuce did in mine.

As for drinks, we both had soft drinks, but there were a wide variety of red and white wines, bottled sodas, and sakes. If I were going to order alcohol, I think the Zipang or Nigori sakes would have been good.

When I am in the area again, I would return and try the chilled rice noodles as my base instead of lettuce or rice... just for something different."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here once a week and it never disappoints. ALWAYS AMAZING! The pulled pork and chicken Are given in a plentiful amount and the cucumbers are to die for. All toppings are a great mix together and I recommend the peanut sauce.  Fresh, healthy alternative when eating out and fills you up!"}
{"text":"This is fantastic! The perfect place for meat-eaters and veggie lovers alike :) Staff is friendly, food is fresh and tasty...what more could you want :)"}
{"text":"Its kinda like a Chipotle - everything is premade and you make the choices and they assemble it in front of you.  Instead of getting cheese, salsa, sour cream and lettuce you get to choose from 2 vegetable mixes, sprouts and some more healthy alternatives.  So its a healthier choice if that interests you.  I assume most everyone has been to Chipotle - so its my compare point - this place has a nicer interior/seating and atmosphere.  I'd come back when I'm nearby and give it another shot - the food was just not that exciting/flavorful on my first visit."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times and this place has never let me down so is well deserving of a glowing review. It's fresh, healthy and very tasty. It should be able to appease to a diversity of tastes with the variety available.

Much like Chipotle, there is a base (rice, noodles, or veggies) ingredient, a variety of proteins, either steamed or wok glazed veggies, many delicious sounding sauces and even some nice additional toppings (hard boiled egg, fried wontons, herb mix, crushed peanuts, fried scallions, etc).

Prices are a little high (roughly $10/bowl) but it is filling. Additionally, there's no limit on the toppings and sauces (that I'm aware of). The employees have been nice and helpful every time I've been there.

Overall, this is a great place for a fresh quick bite to eat that is delicious and will fill you up. The variety of combinations can keep building the bowls interesting on every visit. I would highly recommend!

PS: they have their sauces available for sale."}
{"text":"Another fast casual concept. Like it. Like it better than I like Chipotle, the fast casual concept to which Foosia is so often compared. Can't say it's a genuine substitute for going out to a nice Chinese restaurant... but its faster and cheaper and ready to carry out if you like. 

You pick a base, a protein, veggies, a sauce... all costing the same with the price determined by your choice of protein. A bit limited. They do have tofu, the preparation of which takes a couple of extra minutes, if you're a vegetarian. The servers will gladly let you sample sauces... before you make your choices. I'm not sure if Foosia is genuinely healthy (Asian food often fools me), but the restaurant does give the illusion of healthy eating, which is an improvement over most fast food establishments. 

Thanks to Yelp and Foosia for the free drink offer. Everyone in our party used the promotion without a hint of annoyance from the staff, something I appreciate. Friendly service. Fair price. Quality ingredients. Clean dining room. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Take out shouldn't be cold when it gets home. 3rd time here. Sad. Not - not warm - cold. Veggies, chicken, rice...everything. Cold Asian food is not ok. If I wanted to reheat my dinner, I'd go to the frozen section."}
{"text":"A great place.  We have eaten here a few times and it the opportunity to have healthy minimally processed food for not much money. The day they decided to give away free bowls in exchange for donations to anti-bullying campaign sealed the deal."}
{"text":"I have heard good things so we finally decided to check this place out. The food was very tasty.  Think fast food Asian with a healthy flare. The store manager took our order and he also was our cashier. He was very friendly and patient as we were questioning him about food allergens for my son.  My only complaint would be the extremely uncomfortable torture-like chairs and benches (similar to Chipotle). Also, there was some food on the floor near our table so it could be a little cleaner. We will be back again if we are in need of a quick meal. If it was a little more comfortable, I would love to stay for drinks but I wouldn't recommend this as a place to lounge."}
{"text":"When they first opened, back in March or April of this year, they sent out coupons in the neighborhood mailers, which is how I learned about them. 

VEGAN INFO:
I needed the skinny on their vegan options for a vegan site, so I spoke with a manager and requested a list of their ingredients.  She was very helpful and patient, and luckily Foosia has a list of the ingredients for all of their sauces and toppings (I promise you, not every restaurant/eatery does). 

All of the sauces are vegan except the Muay Thai Vinaigrette, which contains a fish 
byproduct.  

As for the toppings, everything was vegan except for the hard boiled eggs (duh), and  the crispy wonton wrappers, which contain eggs. 

My most recent visit:
I went in tonight, after 8:30pm (they close at 9pm), thinking I'd just see if they had anything left that still looked fresh.  It's extremely rare that I eat past 7pm, but Manic Monday + back to school shopping left me drained and in need of healthy nourishment, STAT. As I peeked through the looking glass searching for the tofu, one of the employees offered to help me. \"Are you out of tofu?\" I asked.  He said, \"Yes, but we can make some more.\"  I was like, \"No, that's ok. I know it's almost closing time.\" But he insisted and assured me that it was no problem, and he was very genuine about it.  It had been a few months since I visited so I couldn't recall which sauce was my fav.  He happily allowed me to taste a few and my Holy Foobanero (a spicy sauce with a hit of sweetness) love was rediscovered.  By the time my sauce taste test was over, my tofu was ready.  The employee (maybe he was a manager; if he isn't, he deserves a promotion) asked if I'd like to dine in; I graciously declined.  As he packed my to-go order, he re-assured me that I was welcome back any time.  Usually when you enter an establishment close to closing time you're greeted with the daggers-of-death stares and major attitude. Not here.  The man (should be manager), and even the cook would cooked up my fresh order of tofu, was so very nice and friendly that it really put a smile on my face. It also made me feel bad for taking so long to come back.  

The food? My (late) vegan meal consisted of brown rice, tofu, wok glazed veggies (which were still fresh), fresno chiles, green onions, and extra Holy Foobanero.  It was so fresh and so good. Simply delicious. Filling too, yet not heavy. I could only eat 1/2 of it. I did notice that the prices increased slightly; a tofu bowl was $7.50 in April, now it's $8. Just an observation. 

I like that they seem to be eco-friendly too, from the to-go containers to the napkins. And they have designated recycle bins inside the restaurant, which has a nice, large, clean, open dining area. 

So again, the food in and of itself is very good (healthy, fresh, & flavorful!), but the excellent customer service kicked my experience up several more notches.  I will frequent them much more often."}
{"text":"Wow!  Fantastic and fresh Asian fare!  Food was delicious and healthy, the service was super helpful and friendly! Hope this catches on and becomes a chain!"}
{"text":"I easily give this place and its staff a 5 star! The customer service = outstanding. Cleanliness is great! Atmosphere relaxing! I will definitely make this a regular go to. A won't let you down place"}
{"text":"As others have said, Foosia is the Chipotle of Asian cuisine.  The food was good, nothing amazing.  I had tofu and veggies in the peanut sauce and it was pretty tasty.  I'll likely go back the next time I'm craving Asian food and want something quick and easy."}
{"text":"I used to be a foodie for Foosia but lately I feel like a fool.  This is the second time we have been for lunch that we have had to wait for the food prep to be partially complete when the establishment opens at 11.  We waited approximately 10 minutes for the food items to be prepped -and there was still no white rice ready.  Rather than wait any longer we ordered the brown rice with our lunch options.  The patrons behind us encountered the same situation but opted to wait for the white rice and were granted with 2 free lunch coupons for their patience.  Apparently one's inconvenience is not another's.  The white rice was finally ready at 11:25.  The young ladies that work here were hustling but they either need more help, better time management or a Manager on site.  To top it off, the 2nd group of customers spilled a container of red sauce all over the floor next to us, splattering on my husband's pant leg and neither the customer or the employees offered an apology as the floor was wiped up under his feet.  When this spot opened it appeared that the Mgr/Owner was always on site.  Perhaps this is the fix to ensure happy customers."}
{"text":"I came here on their 1 year anniversary and they were offering 1 free entree -what a deal!!! Otherwise I probably would never stop in here. 
I got the Jasmine rice with tofu and wok glazed veggies and the pineapple sauce, topped with crispy wonton noodles. 
It was pretty busy that day but they made the tofu fresh. The tofu is battered cubes with a hint of a spicy flavor. 
I was pleasantly surprised how tasty it all was. I love the concept to customize your meal even the littlest ingredients and I even got the peanut sauce on the side just incase I didn't like pineapple but it was all excellent. It was enough for 2 meals which is great for the value.  I noticed the prices are on par with Pei Wei but I love Pei Wei's tofu better. -sorry. It wasn't bad, just personal preference. I need a bag of the crispy wonton noodles to snack on next time for sure. 
For it being so busy the workers were friendly and happy to explain things on the menu.

I will come back for sure with my fiancé to try a different combo of flavors. He's kinda picky so with their menu I'm sure he can find something he'll like. 

Thanks for the excellent free meal Foosia keep up the great flavors!"}
{"text":"Foosia is good for a quick, relatively healthy, Asian inspired lunch. You have a pick of brown or white rice, noodles, or salad (more like a Napa cabbage mix) as a base. Then you add a protein, veggies, toppings and a sauce. I came with a group of coworkers and we all enjoyed the food. Vegetarians have tofu and eggs as options. They cook the shrimp and the tofu to order which is great. The cafeteria/chipotle style line moves pretty quickly as well, which is a plus, and there are plenty of seats to dine in."}
{"text":"Foosia:  the Vietnamese Chipotle

Seriously.

Start with a base:  rice, noodles, mixed greens, or flatbread
Add a protein:  chicken, steak, shrimp, tofu, pork

...top it off with veggies and sauce

...then extras like peanuts, crispy wontons, lime squeeze, slaw, or shallots

I made a sweet bun-style bowl with both mixed greens and rice noodles.  I topped it off with peanut sauce and crushed peanuts.  The chicken was fresh and cooked to perfection and the the veggies were fresh.  I enjoyed this lunch for sure!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently went to Foosia for lunch.  The following are our thoughts.  Note, my wife is originally from Vietnam, and we eat Asian food regularly.

My wife and I ordered salads with noodles and some pork meat. The quality was NOT GOOD and the Sriracha sauce did very little to cover up the faults of the poorly made food.  The noodles were overcooked and soggy (more like a paste rather then noodles).  The sauce tasted nothing like the appropriate Sriracha.  The vegetables were not fresh enough, and appeared to be sitting.

We both came to this conclusion as we completed lunch, and returned to other things that day.  

My wife is Vietnamese/Chinese from Vietnam.  She also eaten Vietnamese and Chinese, in Vietnam and the USA, including the highly Americanized Chinese.  She told me that she will go to Panda Express, the Americanized Chinese restaurant next time (better quality, and cheaper).  This is in regard to quality.  I agree with her assessment.  We will NOT be returning to this restaurant.  

---------------------------

Here are a couple of things to note:

1) Sriracha is not Thai.  It is a pepper sauce that was created in California by an immigrant family from Vietnam.  The family happened to also have Chinese heritage.  Your menu lists it as Thai, and it is not.  Get it right.  The reason why it has been adopted by many is because there are some kinds of similar sauces common throughout Southeast Asia, but they are NOT exactly the same.  

2) My wife and I recommend that you get your vegetables fresher.  They were not fresh enough.  The bean sprouts looked very old!!!

3) I suggest that you do some research on the kinds of common street food combinations that are common in the various Southeast Asian countries.  Perhaps even go so far as to list recommendations for the customer (they are of course free to choose whatever they want).  Some of the ones that come to mind are (from my travels to Ho Chi Minh City are):

Bun Thit Nuong
Bun Nem Nuong
Bun Tom Heo Nuong

4) Learn to cook noodles.  No one appreciates noodles that are cooked to the point they are paste."}
{"text":"Foosia is really a wonderful new venue for fresh and healthy food. Would have been 5 stars but they don't serve whit e meat chicken. They have beer and saki and other interesting bottled drinks. Kind of like Chipotle. Even better. In July there is a 2 for 1 $25 gift card offer. You will indeed be glad you ed this place out. Delicious and fresh. Great dressings and other goodies!"}
{"text":"I visited Foosia for the first time tonight thanks to a BOGO coupon I was given.  While the idea is great, a lot of things bother me, even though above all the food does taste great.

Temperature - 2/5; Foosia is similar to chipotle, except the food isn't good and hot.  For example, serving cold rice noodles is not the best.  I love rice noodles but wish they were hot.  The rest of the food was close to room tempurature.

Staff - 5/5; really nice people and great service!

Taste - 4/5; the food was great, no doubt about that.3

Price/Portions - 2.5/5; Paying $8 for what you get is really too much.  I would expect to pay $5-$6.  I can go to a regular asian restaurant and spend $10 for 50% - 75% more than what I got in my bowl, and it's hot.

Fresh/Healthy  - this is the dealbreaker for a place like this.  Look at chipotle - they make statements about their meat, produce, and ingredients.  They show you ingredients on their website.  My wife even asked an employee at a Chipotle once what items do/do not contain GMO's.  She got an answer and we knew what to avoid.

Go to Foosia's website - there is no such information.  I am highly skeptical that the sauces at Foosia don't contain preservatives, stabilizers, modified corn starch, HFCS, etc....  It's pretty hard to have a restaurant without these items in sauces - Foosia, prove it to us if you want to call yourself fresh/healthy food.

IF it is true that the meat is vegetarian fed & range raised, the vegetables & soy are non-GMO, and the food is hot...well my rating is a 5.  As it stands, I'm disappointed - but again it did taste great."}
{"text":"Foosia is perfect for a quick lunch or a long meal with a big group--especially when everyone wants something personalized or different. The sauces are great, the food seems to always be freshly prepared, and they make your tofu to order and based on your preference for spicy-ness. Some might not like that the noodles are cold, but I found it kind of refreshing. Also, they serve China Mist tea and real sugar soda (bottled) which both pair perfectly with spicy Asian food."}
{"text":"The food here was actually really good and clean. The inside of the place isn't anything special...feels like an under-decorated Chipotle. I ordered a chicken bowl and asked for extra chicken, but it was still lacking. Over all, I felt like I was eating a veggie bowl with rice and a bit of meat.

This is a good place for a lighter, clean meal, but didn't cut it as a dinner for me."}
{"text":"Go here if you want to leave hungry.   The quality of the food is middle of the road and the portions are surprisingly small.  My $10 meal had a small \"spoon\" of chicken and the kids meal had half of that.   The young server's comment to me about portions was that you're paying for the vegetables.  However, there's not enough protein to call it a meal."}
{"text":"Food quantity declines. Chipotle and Qdoba are great fillers, Foosia - food is good but not full worth the price."}
{"text":"Good spot for an interesting style of food. Similar to wok box but I feel is a little bit better quality and more consistent with the service and food. Great spot for a quick convenient tasty lunch. Many options on their menu."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and have really enjoyed it. The food is fresh and tastes great. I especially liked the Korean BBQ version. We'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"I came to Foosia for an Yelp event.  When I walked outside, I didn't know what to expect at all as the outside sign said it was Asian fusion.  Foosia is like an Asian Chipotle where you can make your own bowl but with a lot of Asian vegetables and Asian spiced meats/tofu.  The service was really great and the people were extremely friendly."}
{"text":"THE BEST!  if it's the cold rice noodles or the hot brown rice.... Add the protein and some steamed veggies... And dress it with the Foobenaro sauce... The rest is all in the final touches."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant serving up fresh and delicious healthy options. It's a super simple concept. Pick what you like to eat to be added to your bowl. Everything you want, and nothing you don't.  Choices of meats are beef, pork, chicken, and the best tofu for those with selective tastebuds. Available to you is a huge selection of fresh veggies sourced locally. Over 5 different type of sauces to bring the flavors of the Asia into your mouth. 
The staff here was very friendly, and they were very helpful in explaining everything to me. I had a chance to chat with Ginna, the young manager of this location, and wow, I was so impressed by how efficiently she and her staff keep the place looking flawless, while serving their customers. The staff here took the time to walk around and ask their customers how their food was. You don't see that anymore. If you are looking for healthier options for lunch and dinner while supporting local businesses, check this place out. Highly recommended. Until next time, stay hungry."}
{"text":"Try this for the first time over the weekend food was great Kinda reminded me of chipotle but Asian inspired. Definitely agree that looking at the menu ahead of time is a good idea. there is a lot of pressure to know what you want and  to order once you're in line"}
{"text":"Asian Chipotle where you choose your bowl, protein, vegetables,  sauce and toppings. 

I chose the Jasmine Rice, Marinated Steak, Wok Glazed Vegetables with the Kim Jong BBQ Korean Sauce, Bean Sprouts topped with green onions and cilantro. 

Was tasty with a very slight kick. After you sit down you should mix your bowl so you get a good mixture of everything or you will get a spoon full of cilantro. 

The menu as you come up to the counter resembles Chipotle,  the only thing missing is the tortillas. 

Good concept from chipotle style, kind of on the pricey side for $8.90 for the Marinated Steak Bowl since they were on the skimpy side of steak. 

The restaurant was very clean and liked the soda fountain for refills. 

Definitely a good place to come by for a quick meal and may be back again in the near future."}
