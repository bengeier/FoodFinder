{"text":"The salads were amazing and the service was excellent.  This is definitely a repeat for our group."}
{"text":"My family and I were craving salads tonight so someone suggested salad creations. We live about 30 minutes away from salad creations and when we got there they were closed....at 7:15. The lights were completely off, chairs up and no one inside. Why say you are open until 8 when you are only ACTUALLY open until 7? We were all very disappointed to say the least. We won't be back for a very long time."}
{"text":"I will tell  you I was really reluctant to go here because I thought it was like Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes... When in fact it is nothing like either of those!! :)  This place was great it was like the best way to put it was subway for salads!!!   You pick your type of lettuce,spinach, or romaine then you can either pick a salad that is on the menu or create your own with all the toppings including but not limited too nuts, berries,dressings,crutons, Veggies,Jalepeno, pepperchinis... etc.!!  Plus the staff mixes it all up for you with these great tools that i have never seen before . I always ask for the dressing on the side because then you can take it home and use it for your own salad.  I would recommend the raspberry dressing it is so YUMMY!!!   A large which is served in a very cute fun bowl, is about $8 and wow you get so stuffed off of the meal!     All in all AMAZING taste and presentation! :D"}
{"text":"I have never heard of Salad Creations, probably because I don't have one where I live, but I wish I did. I was in Wisconsin where I found Salad Creations and I tried their Apple Pecan Salad, and oh my goodness it was delicious; everything went well together in it and it wasn't drenched in dressing. The inside of the building was average, nothing fancy but it went with the atmosphere. The only reason this place got 4 stars is that I wasn't greeted with a \"welcome to Salad Creations\" or anything; other than that I would defiantly go again. I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for a light and healthy meal."}
{"text":"I'm writing this again because it wasn't included in the reviews for some reason.  I've been to this restaurant 4 times and today was a reminder why I don't go there anymore. It always seems like the employees take an unreasonable amount of time to make our salads. She kept returning to the salad ingredient lists on the counter after every part of the salad. It was a very time consuming process. When my salad was almost done, she added chicken instead of the shrimp that I had requested. We had to start all over at square one. When my mother got her salad made it also took a very long time. Today we had a coupon for buy one get one free and our total STILL came out to $15.00! When we questioned why it was so expensive for one salad that was supposed to be $7.99She said, \"I think the added shrimp is $3.50\" She thinks? I just wanted to get out of there. The prices are outrageous and the salads are subpar. I've tried to give this place a fair chance, but the employees are very slow and the prices are not worth it. I would never go there without a buy one get one or my two salads would be $30!  Absolutely outrageous. I doubt they'll last more than a year at this location."}
{"text":"Salad was good, but very expensive! I also thought I would add on a bottle of water and my total was over $11.00! (The salad was 7.99, so $3 for a small bottle of water???) i thought hey, I'll help a local business out... Never again! I was also curious about nutritional/ ingredients of the salad dressings and was treated very rudely. The young girl that helped me was very nice, but the older woman was not nice at all. So much for supporting a local business."}
{"text":"This place is an \"upscale\" version of Sweet Tomatoes. Aside from the layout and some of the ingredients, the two places are essentially the same. I was expecting an impressive array of salads and toppings, but instead found the same ole' same ole'. They do offer wraps, soups, and desert a' la carte, but they didn't seem to be anything special. You can either pick your lettuce then all your toppings, or chose from their 11 \"Featured Salads\" where they combine an already set menu of toppings to your salad. Neither option is self-service and you have your \"salad chef\" add ingredients to you salad by pointing to the glass as if you were at Subway or Chipotle.  My eating partner took the custom salad approach and I chose one of their featured (Favorite Chef Salad) salads. For each selection the portion sizes are excellent and each option costs about the same depending on how much meat you add to the custom salad. I believe that if all that you are having for a meal is a salad, then you should have a decent amount of protein in it. Salad Creations also believes this and charges you a bit much in my opinion for the option. In conclusion, Salad Creations is nothing special. Anyway, both salads were alright at best and nothing to write home about. The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean, the ingredients were fresh and there were several decent dressing choices. However, if you want a salad with all-you-can-eat toppings and and few extras, just go to Sweet Tomatoes. It costs less and you get more, but you don't all get the \"protein\" options that Salad Creations offers at a price."}
{"text":"In the mood for some rabbit food?  This is a great place to try.  Fresh salads, served your way like subway.  My coworkers wanted to eat healthy, so we gave this place a shot for lunch.  I ordered the Balsamic Orange and Bleu with Wild Alaskan salmon ($10.50 with the salmon, which was $3.50).  As a carnivore, I have to say that this was a darn tasty salad.  The leaf was a mixed green concoction, along with edamame as a replacement for almonds.  The bleu cheese was the perfect amount, and same with the salmon.  Everything tasted fresh, and they chop it up really good so everything is mixed in.  The balsamic sauce gave the salad a light sweet flavor that I enjoyed.  The full size salad was a pretty good portion too.  I am definitely coming back here the next time I feel like a salad.  It really beat out the Ruby Tuesday salad bar down the street from my work.  Sure, it took me 20 minutes to get here, but it was worth it!  Salad Creations rocks!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place today as I was trying to find a new place to try for lunch. I was looking for a healthy place to eat and hit the jackpot! Salad creations has a lot of creatively made salads of their own, and you can also create your own as well! They also have some wrap options, soup, and dessert. The service is real quick and organized. As soon as you walk in, you're already standing in line, and the staff greet you with a friendly smile and ask how they can help. The good thing about being in line quickly is you get served quick, but the only thing I would like to see is more menu options.  Overall, great place, I do plan on trying their other salads and creating my own too. They have so many great and healthy toppings!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Wild Alaskian and it was served up with speed.  The feta cheese was fresh and smelly (yum.), the Asian sesame ginger dressing was light and it really complimented the salad.  It is a line-bar setting with nice round tables and umbrellas outside.  You can do a lot of people watching in this new shopping center, except for the kids causing havoc in the parking lot.  One of the salad chefs, Brian, was very friendly and accomodating with my requests.  He seemed very happy to serve everyone, even though it was pretty crowded.  Brian actually recommended my dish.  The fish was fresh and tasty, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Salad Creations...should be called \"Gourmet Salads\".    Fresh, Healthy, Tasty, Filling, Satisfying, AND you get it the way you want it.  Peace-Love-and-Happiness...it's all there.  Four different sets of \"green leaves\" - Romain, Iceburg, Spinach, or Spring MIx. Endless array of typical and NON-typical throw-ins. I can't even remember how many different dressings were available.  You can order from the menu, tweak what they've got, or start from scratch.   Do you feel like a traditional salad bowl, \"wrapping\" it up, or panini-izing it?  You choose.   Went today.  Took the fam.  Kid gobbled her salad wrap DOWN!  Yes, she actually loved the taste of eating healthy.    See you tomorrow for lunch, Gourmet.....I mean Salad Creations!"}
{"text":"Salad Creations is the bastard child of Cold Stone Creamery and Sweet Tomatoes.  They even have a crazy spatula-esque contraption to chop up the meat into more bite-sized pieces within your salad.  I'll admit, I was slightly overwhelmed at first, but it wasn't too confusing and the employees are incredibly patient and helpful.  So I decided to have the full sized salad, which ended up being much bigger than I could actually handle.  Next you choose the greens from four different bins hanging behind the the employees: mixed greens, romaine, spinach, and ugh, iceburg.    The employee puts the chosen greens into a large mixing bowl, and adds as many options as you choose.  I believe the menu said there were 40 options, but I'm not sure if that included the meats and dressings, or if it was just the vegetables.  Meat costs extra and they have handful of varieties of them.  Shrimp and Wild Alaskan Salmon cost extra. **record screech** Did I just see Wild Alaskan Salmon? Not that crappy farm-raised garbage that is full of pesticides and other toxins?  Whoa!  Now I'm impressed.  I take my lovely salad down to the register and decide to splurge on a cookie.  The cashier points out to me that the cookie is outdated, but says that if I still want it, it's free. BONUS!  And even though that cookie was dated the day before I bought it, it was a moist and incredibly delicious oatmeal raisin cookie.  Maybe eventually I'll tire of this place for salads, but with so many possible combinations of veggies, meat and dressings, I'm guessing it won't be for awhile."}
{"text":"Went with a co-worker during lunch and it's a good stop if you are on a time limit for lunch. it's quick and you leave feeling full in a good way. Lots of leafy greens instead of a big juicy cheeseburger once in a while is just one element to a longer life.  Now, I'm sure not all the salad dressings or additives are healthy but you're always in control of what you want in your salad. I really enjoy salads so this place was right down my alley. I got an Asian Chicken Salad with wontons & edamame and keep in mind that the smallest size isn't small at all - just look at my pics. My co-worker got a salmon salad with mandarin oranges - now that looked good.  This was my first time here so I need to try other things to  have a true feeling about this place. I do plan on ordering a panini the next time I go. I think the prices are a bit high for salad. They should add fresh baked bread to their menu to accompany the salads. I'll let you know how the panini tasted....."}
{"text":"Well in the past week I've had two salads and a panini. I had bought two Groupon coupons and was very excited to try this.   I didn't have a problem with the price but with the quality and taste.  Really,it's hard to screw up a salad, or a sandwich but nothing was very appetizing and actually threw most of my last salad away."}
{"text":"I'm not a salad guy by any means, but the idea of a Subway-esque salad place seemed interesting at least.  The problem is really threefold.  One is that there are so many options.  Even if you get the \"full creation\", with which you can get any of the throw ins, it's rather overwhelming.  Two is that they aren't presented in a way that the options are easy to understand.  the full creation comes with any of the thrown ins, while with the junior creation comes with a set amount (four, I think) and you pay for each additional one.  That's easy enough, but then you pick lettuce, then you pick the throw ins, then you pick a protein (extra choice, even if you choose a full creation), then you pick a dressing, then you choose if you want it tossed or chopped.  It's just too much!  Three is that the options add up (in price) really, really fast.  If you don't like the full creation ($6-9) and go for the junior (approx $2 less), you can easily make up the difference in throw ins - just four will make up the difference in price, not to mention the size of the salad itself.  There is also no simple explanation of size difference (you can ask to see a bowl, but it doesn't really help visualize the difference).  To top it all off - literally - if you want chicken or something on your salad, you're adding to the cost no matter which salad you ordered.  They also have paninis and wraps, as well as soups, but let's face it - you went for a salad, right?  That's like going to Subway for a salad, or ordering a pizza from a sandwich shop.  Hmm.  Guess that does happen.  What they need is a model more like Subway and less like you're going to get picked to death on every little thing you put on the salad.  While the quality of the salad itself is pretty decent, trying to figure out the menu board and what goes with what without just getting bowled over (sorry) by what you can order without being taken is too much.  That said, the staff is friendly, and the double-pizza-cutter that chops up the salad is neat to watch - probably worth ordering yours chopped just for that reason.  I just wish it was a nicer experience all around."}
{"text":"I came back to this place since I got hooked on a Sample on the way st Star Trek... They got me good...  You enter and theres 3 refrigirated Lettus dispeners in the wall! I haven't been this excited since I saw Red wine on TAP... +one star  $15 for 2 giagantic wraps... more expensive then Subway but worth it I thought...  Rosted BEETs! Great..."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go and get a good salad. The menu features featured salads with kitschy names like \"It's Chic to Be Greek\" and \"Chinese Chopstick\" or you can come up with your own \"unique\" salad by choosing from all the different lettuce mixes, vegetables, dressings, cheeses, and meats. All salads either come in \"Jr\" or \"Full\" sizes. They also offer a few types of wraps.  If I sound unenthusiastic, it's because I am! I have nothing against a good salad - in fact, the Stetson Chopped at Cowboy Ciao, the Grilled Vegetable at California Pizza Kitchen, and the Broadway Pea at Kincaid's are all noteworthy salads in my book and would make me remember and return to those restaurants in the future. However, that being said, I just don't think the majority of salads are all that special or satisfying, especially not for a main course. I need substance to my meals, and a salad usually just doesn't cut it.   Now I don't want to unfairly bias people against this franchise concept  or this location - the salad I got (the Chopped Veggie) was chock-full of really fresh vegetables and the roasted garlic vinaigrette was really flavorful, and it was a lot of salad for $5. But it just didn't give me that satisfying feeling I get after having a meal with carbs or lots of protein. If you love salads and the concept of getting a salad specially made and tossed to your specifications (sort of like the \"sandwich artistry\" Subway has made famous but with salads), you will love this place. If you want a truly full belly, you may want to take your $5 elsewhere. Like Quizno's. Just kidding, of course."}
{"text":"Salads are good - but everything is very expensive and the manager treats the employees like dirt.  I've seen it first hand multiple times."}
