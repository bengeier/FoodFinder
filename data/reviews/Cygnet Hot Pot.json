{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night and got the regular ayce for $23.99 ($2 more for weekends/holidays) plus additional $3 for soup base of sweet corn and pork bone. 

They've got a great selection of sauces in their \"make your own sauce\" bar. Their beef was fresh and fatty - it was delicious. They've also got a wide range of hot pot food, snacks including rice dishes and desserts.

You can also collect points if you own a vicinity card."}
{"text":"GOT REALY SICK!!  My buddies and I went here Wednesday night.  The atmosphere was good and the food looked alright.   We had the all you can eat seafood option for $28.99.   Unfortunately things turned for the worst the following day.  We all got sick with the same symptoms and in bed for over 20 hours with no appetite and feeling noxious.   Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if that was possible. Horrible service, lazy staff. I don't know what was worse, the food or the service. The meat looked grey, probably from sitting out oxidizing for hours or days. The \"pot\" was slightly larger than a mug. Overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Started out ok until I received the Chinese lettuce with flys in it.  Not just one but several. Obviously other things were probably not washed either.  They gave us a new bowl of lettuce but it wasn't the same.  Lost my appetite."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. It is the absolute worst hot pot place. 

The service here is so awful. Like downright garbage. The servers are always on their phones in a corner somewhere, they never come around, and when they're taking your order, if someone calls them midway, they'll just leave you without saying anything. We also had to order many times because we didn't get half the things we ordered and some of the things we received, we did not ask for. We couldn't find our server so we tried asking someone else who was standing around for help but they basically told us it wasn't their job and didn't even bother telling our server we were looking for them. I honestly have so many negative things to say about the service...

Not to mention the food quality here is bad. Like it made my stomach hurt and I threw up, bad. The food is not fresh, they look like they've been sitting out at room temperature for hours. Nothing looked appetizing. 

This place is also way overpriced for what it offers. Their pots are tiny! And if you want a bigger pot, it's an extra $4. Getting a soup base is also extra depending on which you want. 

The only positive thing about this place would be their washrooms being tidy and clean. But other than that, this restaurant is just one big negative. I'm generally a very forgiving, second chance kind of person, but I will never come back here. Not even if my meal was free."}
{"text":"Went here Feb 8 with 2 friends, and all of us got food poisoning.  The only thing we did in common was come to this restaurant.  We had diarrhea, vomiting, the chills and aches and pains. Still recovering but avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"I tried this place first they open. People lining up. I waited for 20 mins. The service is ok. Maybe it was the first day they open and they don't have enough staff. The menu looks good and seems has lots of food choice. They have 9 Soupbases. Spicy and non-spicy. You can mix and match 2 soupbase if you like. My favor is their signature spicy  and Pickled Cabbage with Fish Soupbase. They also have free upgrade during the soft opening. I got half lobster, angus beef slices and beef ribs.  Overall experience is good!!"}
{"text":"Overall an acceptable experience. The price is leaning on the high side (got the seafood option on a weekend - which is not fresh TBH) when considering the extra cost for the soup base. It doesn't help that drinks are not included (ordered a jar of watermelon juice for $8.50 - enough for 4 glasses). 

Normally would have given this 3 stars if not for the semi-lacking service. My pot literally dried up twice and no one bothered to add some water until I tell them to. Never had this problem with other places before. 

On the plus side, the table is huge and the environment is comfy enough if you care more about the ambient environment more than anything else. Don't think I will visit again though."}
{"text":"Went there with 3 friends for dinner on Thursday night. Had their $19.99 AYCE special. All the Soup base cost extra. I had the $3 pork bone soup which was quite flavourful. After we ordered our soups and drinks, they gave us this iPad to order our own food like in those sushi places. I was blown away by the quality of their beef! They had this really nicely marbled angus I have not seen anywhere else. Portions are a bit small so we had to repeat the order a few times.  The special didn't include a lot of seafood, it only included some fish, shrimp and squid rolls. If you want seafood You'd have to go with their regular menu. In the end with drinks tand tax it cost the four of us $116. Pretty good of a deal consider the quality of the food there."}
{"text":"Love this hot pot place. The soup is actually quite flavourful. You get to make your own sauce and selection of food is quite diverse. You can choose to have your own pot or have separate pots. When you order food you are ordering on a touchpad which is great. Price is pretty decent for hot pot in Markham."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekday night and chose to go with the regular hotpot instead of the seafood option. I opted for the Sweet Corn SpareRibs Soupbase while my friend chose the Signature Tomato Soupbase. Both soupbases were an additional $3 on top of the dinner price. I liked the tomato soupbase more as I found it quite flavourful. 

When we sat down, the server attended to us right away and explained how the menu works. He was able to speak in English when I did not understand what he was saying in Chinese at first. 

During the meal, the service became slow as there were only two servers besides the person at the cashier that were taking orders for the whole restaurant. Every time I wanted to flag someone down, it took a while as they never came around to our tables or someone else flagged them down faster. 
 
I did not have any problems with missing orders as all the food that we ordered arrived promptly. Their menu is quite extensive with a wide variety of vegetables, meat, rice, noodles and other types of hot pot food. They also have a nice selection of sauces in the \"make your own sauce\" bar located in the middle of the restaurant. 

Their beef and lamb slices seem to be fresh but there can be room for improvement. Even though there is a seafood option, salmon is included in the regular selection which was nice. The servers came around to refill water to our pots twice. The pot was really tiny and limited the amount of food you can put inside. It costs another few dollars extra to upgrade the pot to a larger size.
 
For dessert, I tried their \"ice pudding\" which turns out to be clear jelly pieces that are in the shape of ice drenched with sugary syrup. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and would try another soupbase flavour next time."}
{"text":"This place is a joke for lunch! They really need to fix it. I know this is suppose to be an AYCE hot pot place. But we were in the area and saw that they have lunch special for $9.99. So how it works is that it's like a pick your own noodle soup. You get to choose 6 ingredients. $9.99 seemed a decent price for lunch so we went.

They give you a sheet of paper and you have some meat options and you can pick vegetables and noodles. Same ingredients you can pick for hot pot. Simple enough? NO!!! 

First of all during a late lunch time there was no one in the restaurant except for one other table who were already eating. We waited more than 40 min for them to make us soup noodle! Definitely faster if we just cooked it ourselves. Second of all when our noodles came they got it all wrong. They mixed up the ingredients of two orders. While a third order was mostly right. So some of the ingredients of order 1 was mixed with ingredients of order 2 spilt into two bowls. 

The waiter for the life of me couldn't figure out what's wrong. You look at the sheet, look at the checked off ingredients and see if it matches what's in the bowl!  So simple but he couldn't figure out and just took the bowls back. Then they brought one bowl back for me and basically what they did is take some of my ingredients from bowl 2 and put it back into bowl one. So I had ingredients from order 2 mixed with my order. But Still, I didn't get everything I ordered but at that point I was hungry!!! What was worse is that they tried to remake order 2 and ended up remaking order 3 which was the only order they had gotten right in the first place. So in the end only one person got what they want even though they trie to fix the other two orders!!! 

I didn't get all the stuff I ordered and one person got nothing they ordered. They just apologized but they didn't really fix it and didn't offer us any discount or at least the order that's all wrong should be free!!! I really don't recommend ordering their lunch special. Stick with the hot pot! I guess they were trying to get traffic for lunch time with this lunch special, but they failed big time!!!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????the all you can eat giant surf clam is the best thing on the menu hands down? other places charge extra for it and can get really expanaive? if you like seafood and scallop its gotta be a great choice? the meal came with two giant oyster as well?you can eat your money's worth by just ordering the giant surf clam/scallop?will be back for sure? only problem is its not spicy enough?"}
{"text":"Great quality of meat and BBQ choice! Im a returning customer. Definitely would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends were all excited about our hotpot night and had high hopes for this place as the line were pretty long. We figured if the line was that long, this place must be amazing.

Service:
After we got seated, my disappointment then started.  Maybe because we didn't speak mandarin, most of the staff there didn't seem to want to take our order.   We managed to flag down a guy after 15 mins to take our order, he was very courteous and told us how amazing the soup base was (which it turns out great), but have way through our order, he passed us on to another server to take he rest of our order.  What ended up happening was, out of the 20 items we ordered, only 5 came.  While the table beside us continue to have flow of food coming to them.  At first, we thought they must be just busy, so we asked 3 waiters to check on our order for us.  They either just brushed us off or told us they will check.  And as we sit there for the next 40mins with just 5 items and with our soup base burning to the bottom.  We flagged the 4th waiter, he was nice enough to retake our order, but again, only 3 items out of the 6 items we've ordered came. We got fed up and just want to order the dessert and leave.  We were told all the putting was so out and they only had vanilla and chocolate ice cream left ( blah... who wants to eat that at a Chinese hotpot place).  So we just proceed to paying our bill :(  We figured their iPad ordering system must have had a flaw as the table beside us were getting more than what they could consume, and sometime double order of what they've order, our food must've been registered to their table instead and we were just sitting their starving, watching our soup burn to the bottom of the pot. 

Food:
I'm not a meat eater, but my friends that went with me said the meat quality was really good.  The soup base was pretty good too. From the very little food that we ate, the quality was pretty good.  Selection was great.  However, if you're allergic to MSG like me, stay away from the sauce, I woke up this morning and coughing and my throat was burning.  The sauce have a lot of MSG.  


Price:
We were told that for a hot pot place, all soup base cost extra.  So basically it costed $27.99 for the food and $5 for our soup base.  So after tax and our Watermelon juice, it costed $40 per person.  In my opinion, if the service was good, it would've been worth it.  But since we only each had a hand full of food, it was definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I just went today for dinner. The menu is very extensive and I like how you order with an iPad. A previous hotpot place I went to used pen and paper which was a lot less effective. 
I was seated near the kitchen and where they dump the dirty dishes. That didn't bother me, it was the extremely loud crashes of the plates that bothered me. Could the waiters please learn how to treat things gently please haha?

It also confused me how you needed to pay for soup bases. I would understand if a special flavoured soup cost extra, but there is no plain soup that comes with your order. 

Finally, they always missed orders. My family ordered a ton of food that never came, and sometimes we were given food we never ordered. 
Stick to the meat and vegetables. I ordered 2pc chicken nuggets for fun and they came as shrivelled, nearly BLACK triangles. 

Make sure to try the frozen grapes too! Very cold and tasty :)"}
{"text":"Came to check this place out as we were regulars at the previous hot pot place (hi-pot).

Have to say it was pretty decent, not super amazing but better than the other options in the area if I compare every aspect.

Food:
We opted for the angus beef and lobster addon.  Lobster was fresh and was a welcome addon.  The ribeye and beef ribs were okay but not sure I would get it again, not a huge fan of thicker cuts in hot pot but it was alright.

Salmon was a little fishy but the rest veggie, shrimp, wontons and noodles were decent.

The kids menu and yogurt was a nice added value for our three year old and they don't charge unless they are older than 6.

I appreciated the Self serve sauce station as well and had no problems with the taste of their sauces.

Service:
We went pretty early around 6:30 on Friday so it was not full when we arrived but we had a waiter attend to us right away and had no issues reordering.  Compared to the other hot pot places in Markham Richmond hill, the service was too notch.  

Conclusion:
Would definitely come back here as one of my go to places for hot pot"}
{"text":"I miss HiPot. The selection is very limited and the soup base isn't that great. Would not suggest coming here if you love hotspot."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with two friends. I don't understand why people would be lining up for this.

Food was alright, but service was beyond terrible. They missed our order 3 times. We asked 3 different waiters to help us check on our order and none of them came back to tell us anything. We were there for a total of 3.5 hours for our food to come (we had to reorder over and over again). I went up to the counter to bring the issue up to who looks like a manager and he brushed me off.. didn't come by the table at all with our missing order. 

Also never been to a hot pot place where you have to pay extra for any soup base. They don't have any soup base that comes with the already expensive $28/pp. So if we don't order soup, do they just serve us raw food...? Anyway, not worth the $40/pp after tips and tax.

Will not return."}
{"text":"This place was packed on the weekend so my biggest tip is to call ahead to make a reservation. We ended up waiting anyway mainly because there was no one at the front even though there were crowds of people coming in. The servers just ignored the people coming in, so it was a bit hectic. The three waitresses for our table were horrible...The worst was when we were in the middle of ordering and one just turned her head completely to another table and just stared at them.. Very \"glitch in the matrix\" moment there.. But we eventually got her back. Phew!

There's not too many sauce options but all the basics are there. Soy sauce, chilli, garlic, coriander, peanut sauce, satay, etc. 

It was a basic set price. $28 per person plus just 3-6$ for the soup base which we shared.  (recommending the tomato base) We didn't get the premium stuff as it didn't seem very worth it. The meat qualities were good and there are quite a lot of options to order so we actually got a nice fill of everything. I'm satisfied with our visit here. Though just the service was really not the best. I think I'll try other places around. So many hot pot options in Markham. Don't worry, I'll Yelp you all about it. ;)"}
{"text":"January 3rd, 2017
Alright, I don't know why they closed hipot and replaced it with this place but it's not even comparable. 

Where do I even begin? I went here with the fam (dad and sister) to celebrate the old man's birthday and from first entering, it look pretty nice with the new décor and brighter compared to hipot (only positive thing).

Our server was female, always on her phone, would leave mid order to seat people down. Didn't even offer water or anything to drink when seated.She punched in several wrong orders on her iPad and we ended up eating okra instead of taro twice, my dad's beef balls, tripe and mussels didn't come even upon requesting it  several times. Tried to wave down this skinny guy to order and said his job was to only bring out food?? Why tf is there only 2 waiters/ress at 7:30pm??? 

Overall, food wasn't great, not fresh (greyish beef, wilted greens, etc) over priced as hell and, service was horrid. Before you ask, yes my family is Chinese too."}
{"text":"It's not bad, but it's not spetacular either. I came in during their grand opening promo period where everyone gets the +$6 premium menu for free...basically everyone was there for the free lobster.
After an hour wait for Saturday dinner we were finally seated at our table, but I'm pretty sure the line will be shorter in the future when they don't have the promo anymore to compete with the Si Chuan hot pot next door.

Environment:
I mean...it's a hot pot place, what can you expect more from it. Even though the place is newly renovated, I still feel their ventilation still strong enough, that it leaves a layer of fog on the window and RIP for those wearing glasses. Also, your clothes will have the special hot pot smell on, so be sure not to wear anything remotely fancy. 

Food:
Their menu is pretty extensive, which I think has more than 100 items. Personally I don't feel the +$6 premium menu is worth it, because other then the lobster (you only get 1/2 per person, it's very small), the beef were not anywhere noticeably better than their normal beef. Also...short ribs in hot pot is just plain weird. 
I would suggest only ordering the raw meats and veggies, just skip the noodles and the cooked food, those are absolutely terrible. 
They have a sauce bar for you to customize, so that's a nice touch. Usually I like the sesame sauce, but I feel theirs is kinda watered down so there isn't much of the sesame aroma and flavour.

Service:
The service was surprisingly decent at this place, especially when the restaurant was super busy during the grand opening week, the waiters were really friendly and tentative. 
The way ordering works is that you choose from the menu and the waiter will have an iPad to place the orders. Personally I'd prefer putting the order down by ourselves, but this wasn't a big issue since the food came out really quickly and all we had to do was to re-order from the waiter."}
{"text":"Went for their special pricing hotpot ($20) but found out it didn't include a bunch of stuff.  So someone explain to these people that when you have a lower price and but it excludes a bunch of stuff, its not really a 'special'!  The whole experience had nothing special about it, very limited items for what you pay, drinks not included, dessert with not many choices was limited to 2 each (of all the things to limit, sugar/water is what they decided to limit).  $20 is where you start, by the end of the night after add ons expect to pay about $40."}
{"text":"This restaurant is being managed by an arrogant, rude, prideful owner that yells at his customers after they mislead us. Their waiter informed my friends, told us there is a promotional activity thru WeChat. After eating, we went and pay. My friend just asked about the 20% discount promotion with the use of our Vicinity card and then the owner crawl into his defensive zone and started raising his voice at us. He basically did not respect us at all and instead of telling us nicely, he raised his voice and asked us to pay the full amount. To be honest, we weren't mad because of the misleading info that his waiter provided us at first or the need to pay the full amount, we were just very displeased with the way the owner dealt with the situation and he even threaten to call the cops to escort us out of the property after raising his voice at his customers. Therefore, instead of allowing his customers to leave in peace, he rather threaten his customers in the most horrific way possible and not even admitting the mistake. That $19.99 is even false advertising because you have to pay extra for even the soup base! Yeap, definitely the worst customer experience I've ever had dining out of my home. This is a restaurant I will never recommend anyone to visit, that's for sure."}
{"text":"The overall yelp score doesn't do this place justice. Had great service and amazing food here for a decent price considering the quality. Compared to other hot pot places, like Made in China or Little Sheep, Cygnet is my favourite ayce hot pot restaurant.

We came here on Christmas for dinner and were seated immediately. The server took the time to explain to us the different pricing for the hot pot menu and even advised us that if we aren't big seafood fans, we don't need to feel obligated to order the premium hot pot menu. We decided on the mid-tier menu which included tripe, homemade shrimp wontons, house prepared shrimp balls, homemade fish noodles, and angus beef kebabs. There was more, but these were the most memorable items.

We sat in a booth and we each ordered 2 pots of broth. I shared a small pot of mushroom broth with my dad ($5 - not included in ayce price) while my sister and bf got a split pot of the mild and signature spicy ($6). Bf commented that the spicy broth was SUPER spicy, but really tasty. I would rethink the spicy broth if you're considering ordering it and are vulnerable to spice.

You order from an iPad and once you put your order through, everything arrives promptly and quickly. Everything was phenomenal. From the sauce station to the service speed/attentiveness to the quality of the food, we had a fun time with our hot pot experience.

In the future, we will definitely be coming back (and soon). I'll be letting my friends know about this place, despite how pricey it is compared to other hot pot restaurants (you're paying for quality here)!"}
{"text":"Came here today for some Chongqing hotpot for lunch. We thought $21.99 per person was not bad.  $28.99 is for dinner. The difference is that at dinner there's wide selection on seafood and better quality of beef than lunch. 

For soup base, I opt for Classic Chongqing Spicy Soupbase (Butter Flavor). I find the spicy level medium to hot which was tolerable for me. However, I find Chine Hotpot located on Spadina Ave. is more flavourful and is also Chongqing influence. 

Service is quick and attentive. Their fatty beef and regular beef slice is yummy!!!  Lamb slices is incredible!  Have to try if any of you come here for lunch or dinner. Shrimp is juicy and shrimp tofu is great!  Vegetables is fresh. There's many more items you can choose from but this what my wife and I was focusing on. 

This place gets a 4/5 is because of their cleanliness. The server seated is by the window (good sign) but when we sat down my wife notice a seat next to her was covered in chilli oil. Luckily her seat is fine. 

Overall a great lunch. We will definitely try their dinner."}
{"text":"Arrived at 630pm on a Saturday night, place was quite empty... But it started to fill in at around 730-8 ish, therefore suggest make reservations before going!!

This place is for individual mini pots. Like many hotpot places, soup bases are additional charges. The prices for the soup ranges from $2 to about $10, therefore not as pricey as other places I have been before. After choosing your soup, server will hand you the iPad where you can order your meats & veggies. I find it really convenient especially you have a group of hungry hoomans :P The orderings came pretty fast and meats looked quite fresh. They also have the sauce bar where you can create your own dipping sauce.

FOOD:
- skewers were very tasty and delicious. My fav would be the lamb and octopus 
-ordered their Special Pork Bone soup... soup was very rich in flavor, very bone-y... just a little bit salty to my liking but that's ok
- parents ordered the tomato soup. The aroma was so rich of tomato flavor, and very creamy
- dessert choices were very limited... only frozen grapes, coconut milk sago, and some \"ice pudding\", which looked like they have put liquid brown sugar on the bottom with Chinese cinnamon, topped with very interesting transparent pudding

ATMOSPHERE:
- very spacious, tables are big enough for having multiple dishes

SERVICES:
- servers are nice, English is not the greatest but able to communicate

Will consider going back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such a low score. It is by far my favourite hotpot place in the GTA. I live downtown in hotpot central, but every time I go to visit family in Richmond Hill I always make sure to stop by this place. First of all, they have jumbo shrimp! I'm not a big shrimp fan, but this is a huge plus since most hotpot places that offer shrimp give you the the little measly ones. Their seafood options overall is quite large and they don't limit the number of orders you can make. In fact, their entire food selection is quite impressive and I'm very pleased with the meat portions you get when you make an order.

I've never had bad service at this place. The waiters have always been attentive and polite. That being said, I did take one star off as they do have a tendency to forget orders and the portion of cuttlefish they bring is so small that you have to make multiple orders just to get enough for the table. (Not a real problem, since they don't give you a hard time for it...I just really love cuttlefish)."}
