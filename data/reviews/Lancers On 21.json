{"text":"Went there today hoping to get a taste of the original Lancers. Went in sat at the bar and the fruit flies greeted us almost as fast of our barmaid. Sat at the bar ordered drinks but we were constantly bombarded by fruit flies and other flying insects. We decided to go upstairs and eat. Even more flies. Server was great food average. Hard to enjoy while swatting flies. Please address this as I dont want this to be my last memory of Lancers. Will give it another try."}
{"text":"Our first experience here. On Father's Day, they opened at 1:00 we arrived at 1:05. They was no hostess and we seated ourselves and were told the kitchen was still setting up. The menus are printed on paper and stained from repeated use. There was no air conditioning or it was very low, it was uncomfortably hot. We both ordered the Fried catfish, mac and cheese and fried corn.  We waited over an hour for our food and had to ask the waitress to bring rolls (which other tables had) and drink refills.  When the food arrived it was hot and seasoned well. The food was very good, but do not come if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I've always loved Lancers seafood and I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed at the new location. The staff is very friendly yet service is a bit slow. I've tried both the scampies and perch and loved both. Great place to order lunch from if you work in the downtown Cleveland area, definitely call ahead though. I visited on a Saturday night and there was a live band and a mature crowd."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite restaurant to eat at.
The fish was under seasoned. The table was dirty and I had to ask for a new tablecloth 
Food came fast but had to ask for cocktail sauce and tarter sauce. Why did they us cooking onions for the salad??
Management asked how was the food and instead not being truthful I told the truth which resulted in 15% off the bill .....not the same old Lancer's"}
