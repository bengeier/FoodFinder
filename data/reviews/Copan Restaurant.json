{"text":"Food was good but this place sucks!!! The waitress didn't know anything about the restaurant. This is for sure not a family restaurant. This place is really small and the music is very loud, we asked if they could turn it down an they didn't do anything. Will not return."}
{"text":"My experience was good.
I've been here twice for breakfast and I liked it both times. Friendly service, quality tableware, good fresh coffee, the food was delicious and fresh. Pupusas seemed made right before they came to my table. Good prices. They seem to care about the place. 
I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went there to have dinner,i had eaten there before and really enjoyed the food. This time the food was soo oily, i almost threw up. I told the waitress who didn't speak much English  but the little she did understand, she went back to the kitchen to get the cook who is also the manager, he came up front and his first response to us was\" what!\" no customer service whatsoever, He was totally disrespectful and didn't give us a chance  to explain what  our complaint was . In his rant he mentioned that we were on his property as if we needed to leave. I didn't mention that we are a black couple and there seemed to be a racial undertone to his intolerance and attitude towards us . if you are black or of any other race other than Latino,  expect to get the same treatment if there's a problem with your food. I felt like we were NOT welcome there in the first place. I have never been treated like that as a customer before and I hope it will never happen again. I can't believe that they can treat people like that and still be in business"}
{"text":"Got three types of pupusas from there to try, cheese and cheese, beans and cheese, and beef and cheese. Would not recommend. Tasted heavily of grease and bread and not much else. Not sure why my newspaper recommended that item."}
{"text":"This PLACE IS AMAZING!!! I always eat here because #1 the food is amazing.#2 amazing service.#3 the place is beautiful and very clean. If I were you I wouldn't settle down for anything else but here!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!   4 people went for lunch. 2 got food and 2 never received!   They did not understand enough English to complain.   As we were paying they brought the 2 dinners and wanted to charge!   Crazy"}
{"text":"I always passed this restaurant but never thought to stop. However,I visited Copan Restaurant with a colleague for lunch and was pleased.I can't recall the exact name of my meal but it consisted of rice,black beans,and steak.My steak was seasoned to perfection and the sides added the \"final touch\" of flavoring.I will be back again for lunch!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. My girlfriend and I stumbled across this place luckily! I had the Carne Asada Honduren style. It was amazing and I ordered the fried sweet bananas on the side. They were cooked to perfection plus they give you a white creamcheese to dip them in! I'm going back today just thinking about it actually."}
{"text":"No complaints from us
Nice clean and fast
Picture is worth a thousand words
Neighborhood was looking like day lite only 
We would come back for breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"Everything about this place seemed a bit average. Nothing wrong with it, just nothing was particularly great. I stopped in because I was craving horchata. We came back to eat later in the day. The torta de milanesa was ok. I couldn't complain. The horchata was ok, again I can't complain. I wouldn't go out of my way for this place is what I'm saying."}
{"text":"How the Copan Restaurant lost stars on this review:

#1 - If I have to ask the waitress to bring chips and salsa to the table!! (never experienced that before)

#2 - My beverage is empty and you don't even bother to ask if I would like a refill or even a glass of water to wash down your spicy food. (nearly choked to death).

#3 - I made a request for a utensil from another waitress because mine NEVER CAME BACK and I'm still waiting on the utensil from the 2nd waitress.

#4 - My waitress totally abandoned me!  I had to go and get YOU to pay for my meal.  SMH!

The food was OK and that's all.  I know those tamales I had were not prepared properly.  Are they supposed to be soppy wet with what I think is grease?

I mean, what happened here?  It felt like they picked this restaurant up out of Los Angeles and plopped it right down in Charlotte.  Yeah, I felt like I was right back at home with the rest of the rude folks.  Copan your customer service is SHOT!

As Chris Tucker said in the movie Friday, I will Never, Never, eva, Eva, EVA come back to this restaurant again.  EVA, EVA!!!!"}
