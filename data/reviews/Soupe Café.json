{"text":"After eating here several times and loving the home-made quality and low prices, I decided to buy 3 large frozen containers of chicken-noodle soup yesterday. At the suggestion of the owner, I switched one of the frozen for a fresh container and just had a delicious serving of that soup for lunch today! I'll be serving the other 2 containers to my lunch guests on Sunday. The only reason I didn't give a perfect 5-star rating is because the menus on the chalk boards are too busy & I can't figure out what the special of the day is, without asking."}
{"text":"I can recommend Soup at Soupe Cafe, they have big pots of 5-6 soups all hot & ready for you to serve yourself. They have corn muffins or rolls to add to your meal. The price is from 5.25$ to 8.00$. My roll was stale and since the girl serving couldn't give me a fresh one she recommended microwaving it, seemed ok on first or second bite but soon became stale again, I asked for cold butter & she said there wasn't any. So the soup was great, service just ok, maybe had the owner been there she/he would have made more of an effort."}
{"text":"Small (only 7 tables) well-lit soup/sandwich/dessert caf√©. There is a $5.49 plus tax large soup & bagel special, but that's only for the vegetarian soups; the meat based are $1.00 extra. I had the lemon chicken/rice with a bagel,tasty,but there was no discernible lemon flavour. This establishment is self-serve,the soup pots are on the counter,labeled with ladles attached to the respective pots. Bagels are toasted and buttered or not, depending on personal preferences and served to you at the counter. Tables are kept clean and debris free."}
{"text":"Nice little place with healthy options for lunch. From sandwiches to soup (of course) and desserts.

Few tables to eat inside, but everything can be warmed up to go.

Although the soup I got was pretty good (lentil and red curry) it definitely needed some salt. Like a lot. And I don't over salt my meals usually.

My friend got a sandwich here, panini, it got heated there and when he took it off, the bottom was burned. The second time he went there, it was not cooked enough. Guess they have to work on that.

Service was nice, but we only had one spoon in the bag for the soups. Little details often make a difference"}
{"text":"What a ridiculous experience. I wasted 25 minutes here getting my food (how is this even possible when everything is pre-cooked??) I asked for the roast beef wrap from the menu and they told me they dont have wraps, only sandwiches because they changed their menu. Okay, but I also ordered a smoothie, and they gave to me in a to go coffee cup with no lid :)) Not to mention I had to change my order twice because they don't have the ingredients. Please sort yourselves out"}
