{"text":"Went here last Friday for dinner very disappointed!  Waited for ever for someone to tell us to seat ourselves and then waited forever for the waitress to come over it seemed they were very busy gossiping at the counter.  Food was so-so nothing special the salads good use cheese served very plain.  Better restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Got my mojo back after having a few of their appetite teasers. Love LPW for a no-frills bite to eat."}
{"text":"There'a a reason that everyone loves this place; it's your typical neighborhood bar in the evening (it's typically middle-aged locals, not a rowdy crowd) but it's also a great place to grab a nice meal with your family during the day. They also have a fish fry every Friday during Lent. The food is really good for bar food, and it's very reasonably priced. Obviously, this is not five star fine dining, but if you're looking for a cheap and inviting place to hang out with friends and family, this is a great place, and the food is great for what it is."}
{"text":"This place is very dark and dingy on the inside. It is the cliche of townie bar. The food was just okay but the drinks were super cheap and the service was good."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar, with the friendliness that comes with it.  Also the quality of food you would expect. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Unmmmm, no. It's a bar with tables in the next room. It's feels grungy. Service was good, food, not so much. Praying I don't get sick! Everything tasted like it came from a can! Nothing fresh or tasty about it.  Guess who won't be back?"}
{"text":"Great little dive bar. Food and drinks are both reasonably priced. It had been recommended to me to visit on a Tuesday, with their $5 burger or chicken sandwich deal, but without any specials on the night we were here, the food was still pretty cheap, and excellent quality for the price. I had a Philly Steak Sandwich, which was steak, onion, and green peppers on a hoagie served with fries, which was excellent. Very tasty, and good sized portions, as I was pretty hungry when we arrived, and quite content when we left. My fiance had a London Reuben Burger, which is pretty self-explanatory, and she was also pleased with the flavoring and the portion size. Given the reasonable prices, and the outstanding quality of the food, this is definitely a place we would return if in the area."}
{"text":"If you like fried food and laid back, then this is the place for you.  Nothing that will blow your mind, but the people are great, the restaurant is laid back and casual and the food, while not very creative, is cooked well, presented well and the prices are not ridiculous."}
{"text":"Don't go here for the decor, but the staff is friendly and the fried pickles are very tasty.  Good value."}
{"text":"Alright, i was about to give it 3 stars bc it's not that great, but it's super cheap... wait, but it's kinda filthy too, so umm, 3, final answer.  The food is edible, but a bum could afford to eat here, so i mean, it sure beats eating out of a dumpster.  Cheap brews, cheaper food.  I think the building is made out of iron, my phone practically turns off whenever I go inside."}
{"text":"Our crew at work orders burgers every Tuesday (when they're $5 on special) but we decided to all troop down there last week on a Wednesday.  Even at full price (which isn't high), the burgers at LPW are seriously good.  No gourmet Michael Simon silliness here, these are just huge, well-cooked burgers, done the way you like them.  Half my crew couldn't finish theirs (I triumphed, because I'm no quitter).  And the fries are yummy, too.  Service was fast and accurate and parking was a breeze."}
{"text":"Okay bar food. Nice bar setting but food is average, service is average and in general doesn't really art itself apart in anything. Would I go there again? Probably if I'm in the area. Would I go out of my way to go there or make note of it to others? Probably not vegetable soup was good though and wings were fairly priced."}
{"text":"I can't give this palce 5 stars because hell, its just not a 5 star place.  But it's the Pickle!  If ever in Brecksville stop over at the neighborhood bar for cheap, quality food (you get what you pay for though), a typical old bar atmosphere, free popcorn, and sit in chairs that I swear haven't changed since I was 5.  The place is awesome, I'm there every weekend."}
{"text":"This small tavern, has great burgers and the best fries within 100 miles!  It's simple, unpretentious, and the folks are mellow and ready to accommodate their customers.  I understand they added music on the weekend and will surely check it out on the weekend."}
{"text":"Not particularly good. Bathroom is nasty. Food decent. Terrible cell phone signal and no WiFi. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Stopped on a Sunday evening 5:30. Pretty empty. Wife got flat iron steak special. I got Patty Melt, Wife's aunt got a burger. We all got iced tea. We enjoyed our food, price was right. The waitress, noticing our iced tea glasses were half full approached and offered to put more ice in the glasses, not more tea, more ice. We all declined. I think she was distracted by the friends she was visiting with that were eating there."}
{"text":"Okay, so it is a bar with an old fashioned family restaurant attached. We were there almost 2 hours for the Tuesday night burger special. They need more staff. The table was a little sticky. However, the food was delicious. The French fries were nice and crispy, and the Half pound burger didn't taste like a pre-made frozen patty. Our total bill was $15.30 for 2 meals and 2 Cokes. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is a area staple! Been around for years and not much has changed - I see this as a good thing! Stable and reliable!  My family goes every year for St. Pattys Day corn beef! Very nice place for a bar night dinner, or to catch up with some friends over drinks!"}
{"text":"The food is typical.  Wait how much was my meal... Then that food is awesome!  Very friendly atmosphere.  Prompt service.  Diner/Bar type place with no particular theme.  (Sorry if there is an attempted theme.  I didn't see it.)  Not a foodie spot or hidden gem, but something about this place just feels... nice.  Side note: My apologies for my complete unintentional dine and dash.  Wrong card.  Also sorry to the other guest whose bill I signed for them."}
{"text":"Went in for a fried baloney sandwich. Was appalled when I saw 4 paper thin slices of baloney fried. You have to be kidding me. What happened to the thick slices of slab baloney like that serve all over Buffalo?? Even Mr Oscar Meyer wouldn't eat this stuff and neither would my seiner dog!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to LPW twice in the past week and am going again tomorrow night.   Food is very good.   Service friendly and speedy.  Good soups too.  My party had some perch and pollack with fries and they really enjoyed them.  We also had the veggie platter which was good sized and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great prices.   Good food. Typical fare: burgers chicken, fish, etc  Really friendly and eccentric staff. This place is a keeper.   Try the hot pickle. I buy them and use them in bloody marys."}
{"text":"I believe in awarding stars bearing in mind the type of restaurant reviewed.   One can tell by the name that LPW won't replace Ohio's lost Maisonette restaurant in Cincy any time soon, nor does it aspire to do so, but for a sports-bar type venue, these folks do it all right, and do so at the right price! Stopped for lunch on a Saturday.  The lady got a cheeseburger and fries, I got scrod and broccoli, we split an order of their fried pickles as an app. The pickles were dill spears coated with just the right amount of what was likely a beer batter and deep fried to tangy perfection. They got the spears vs. chips decision right!  The lady usually looks askew at this type of fare, but happily camped out over the plate and ate her fair share!    And here's the kicker they were under four bucks!   Kudos Mr. Pickle; you done good!  The fries were very lightly battered and done perfectly, with just the right amount of crispness outside followed by a creamy interior, ... the fry guy here knows his craft! And the burger was good as well.. ...typical of the genre.    I find it difficult to fawn excessively over  a burger.  The scrod was a very generous sized portion, nicely caramelized and served with lemon and butter and perfectly done. When I was given the option of fries or baked potato or rice I asked if there were a green option and broccoli was offered, it was done perfectly as well and the amount was easily enough for two to share. My dinner came with a salad, which happily WAS NOT from a bag-o-lettuce, but rather freshly cut romaine, a cuke slice or two, carrot shreds and tomato, and it was accompanied by a store bought dinner roll and butter.  The service was quite good, although the waitress appeared to be a bit over-extended, but that's a management issue, not the server's fault.  Happily they are in the Cleveland Entertainment book, and as I had the coupon sitting on the table during the meal, the waitress took the value off of the ticket before it was even presented! I'm all for efficiency, especially when it affects how quickly I can get out of a restaurant.  That move garnered the fifth star!  We both stated that we will go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with how gross this place is - I wasn't sure I wanted to order anything. The food was not outstanding. I think I would go across the street to the Tavern!!"}
{"text":"Was boozin and cruisin with my canine comrade. Went all the way out to Hudson via Brecksville/82. Looking for anything to Yelp. Nothing. Not even in the strip mall I used to hit in Hudson on my dry cleaning route back in the day. There was a deli, but it opened at fucking 11! Who even wants to go to a deli after 11? Weak. Breezed through Peninsula. Winking Lizard? Bah. Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.  Cozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome. Also got a pickle. That's eight dollars with the beer, just to recap. Great value, nice location, old men. I won't wait four more years to come back."}
{"text":"Have dined in twice now and today was take out for corned beef sandwich. I don't know why I keep thinking this place is going to change. Food is at best \"ok\". The inside is a dive needs some serious updating. This would be ok if this place was a hidden dive bar with amazing food- not the case. Today's lunch- puke. Dry corned beef, probably the worst I ever have had.  Lession learned never returning."}
