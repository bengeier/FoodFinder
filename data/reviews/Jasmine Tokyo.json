{"text":"Overall rating: 2.5 for a 4:30 weekday visit (no one at the bar and 4 tables, including us - mostly parties of 2, like us).  I've decided to count, from entering an establishment to the time our party is spotted to the time we are acknowledged or helped (no, I don't  speed count). This visit, it was 5 before we were spotted and 82 before a hostess came to seat us.  Place was clean, server prompt, nice. Salmon was dry, overcooked. Walnut and tempura shrimp were good but warm/cool, not hot. Liked the tofu and veggies. Fried prawns were tasty. Crab legs? Crab legs, nothing spectacular. The fried rice? Hardened, couldn't pay me to eat it. All the meat dishes, with the exception of almost well done prime rib (not happy that there was no one at the carving station to cut or anyone to call and ask) had an after taste of cough medicine - so did the tapioca, but cake was ok.  Also almost got run over by the hostess while on my way to get food, she was rushing toward the empty side of the restaurant. My response? Smile, and an 'oh, sorry excuse me.' Hers a raised eyebrow that became a frown and a parting huff. Wanna pay over $20 for that plus tax and tip? Go for it lol, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Great place! Great customer service. I checked into Yelp and got 20% off my tab. The sushi was ok, I have had better. Lots of dessert options. The food was ok. They had oysters for lunch! The place is clean and huge. I would come back here when I visit again. Recommend it anytime!"}
{"text":"A good place for some good sushi. Happy hour prices are super reasonable, and the place has a nice feel.  I gotta try that again. :)"}
{"text":"I came around 12 o'clock and was so hungry for sushi! I actually was excited there was a sushi buffet in the area. But after walking around the buffet line my stomach started to tell me I shouldn't eat here ever!!! I wanted to sample everything on my plate, so I filled it up with sushi sashimi, beef and broccoli, fruit, meat, and sushi rolls! I went back to the table and started to eat my first bite and it was absolute ass! It was basically rubber meat, expired salmon, the sushi was darkened in color:(. The fruit was dry. The rice was weird tasting. I spit everything out and hated all the food!! They even yelled at me to finish my rice before I could even get more damn food! What type of restaurant yells at you, oh yea Jasmine Tokyo does! The service is shit! That explains my tip I left them! $0.00 !! And they never refilled my glass of water . Overall, Now I'm shitting currently in their bathroom where I'm going to clog the toilet so they have to pay the plumbing bill as their expense for feeding me this shitty food! Enjoy the poop in your toilet Jasmine Tokyo! It's a big one! Don't waste your money everyone ! Such a ripoff as you can tell they buy in extreme bulk from China and serve you a plate of expired shit! And the atmosphere is themed of a camping cabin! Wtf does this have to do with sushi! Do you guys have any brains?? I hope you read this message so you can shut the business down and save everyone their hard earned paychecks to be kept in their pockets and not in your hands!! Good bye or should I say ZaiJian!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Arkansas, where all-you-can-eat buffets were invented and subsequently elevated to a kind of art form, I'm familiar with Asian buffets. They have a huge variety of food, and most of it sucks.  Jasmine Tokyo is not like those buffets.  I was completely unprepared for how good it was. I made the mistake of going there for a work lunch. I should have gone on a day when I was free to spend the day lying in anguish on the couch, wondering why, WHY, did I have to go back for the fifth and sixth plate of food? But no. I filled up my first plate with various salads ... and was shocked to find they were all delicious. Fresh, crisp, tasty ... just amazing. I went back, and got some sushi. Their sushi variety was far better than it needed to be. Again: fresh and delicious. I went back again, this time for some of the stir-fried options. And a pork bun. And some miso soup. And some chicken skewers. And every single thing was delicious. I didn't know what to do. I thought if I found just ONE thing that was sub-par, I could quit eating. But no. It was all incredible. Something like 7,000 calories later, I just gave up. I staggered, slowly, out the door, feeling disappointed that there were so many different things I didn't get to try.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Excellent. We drove over 30 miles to get here and it was well worth the drive. They have a variety of sushi, it is good. Usually I don't like buffet sushi, but this is good. They also have fresh peeled shrimp and yummy cocktail sauce. Ice cream for desert, yum!"}
{"text":"Gotta knock a star off for the service I received, last night.  Our waitress was strangely rushing us along, even though we weren't meandering about any more than any other time we've gone here. It's nice to talk while we eat, and there were plenty of open tables so it isn't like we were holding up service for other potential patrons.  Anyway, we got club sodas and the waitress put them on the bill as regular drinks. Having been here a couple of times and getting club sodas for free (like water), I presented to her that I had asked the very first time I came and they said it was free and that every subsequent visit they've been free. She informed me of the exact opposite, saying they have always charged for it and pointed to the owner. I said \"All right, well let me talk to the owner.\"   She went to the owner, came back and said \"She won't talk to you, but she says we have always charged for this since we have to pay for the club soda.\" I dunno about that last part, seems fishy, but then she said \"You were just lucky the other times.\" I joked \"Well, I guess my luck ran out!\" and she just gave me a rude stare; creepy, man.  Food was all right, as per usual, and I didn't even have to pay since my friend was treating my lady and me for our upcoming anniversary, but that kind of inconsistency and customer-blaming is bad service. I'm sure they don't care, as they get 20 bucks a head, but figured I'd mention it anyhow."}
{"text":"This place should be call Raba Tokyo. That is to say \"Rubber Tokyo \" cuz everything has the texture of rubber. The beef, the chicken , the sushi , the pot stickers , even the deserts. I stopped in cuz I really like Chinese food and thought a nice selection of food would be worthy. Oops ... Wrong. Lackluster flavor and chewy , rubbery food made this dining experience a big disappointment. It's a place for large appetites and no taste buds. Shoulda realized something was up cuz the place was only visited by working men looking to pack in the calories over lunch. I'm not a big buffet person and now I know why."}
{"text":"Ok so $20 bucks will get you access to a very large selection of very mediocre food. I was under the impression that the sushi selection would be bigger but the handful of rolls they had were average. We went early to beat the dinner rush and it looked like an awful lot had been sitting since the lunch shift. I'm not big on buffets to begin with but I've certainly had better."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place.  The food selection was so enormous you had to be careful you didn't miss anything.  They had appetizers, sushi, salad bar and any and all Asian food you can imagine.  The food was fresh and the place was so clean and neat.  We had a private room for our Holiday Party and it was perfect.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The quality of food does not reflect the price of admission. The staff prefer quick encounters to customer service and the restrooms were kind of filthy.  There are very little redeeming qualities in this place, feels like they just want to make a quick buck. Maybe come by if there's a discount, but it's a really bad dinner location."}
{"text":"After eating at Jasmine Tokyo buffet, I got horrible food poisoning.  Three days later I'm still feeling it.  I've eaten all over the world, including many third world countries and have never had food poisoning that bad.  I won't go into the details but let's just say it wasn't pretty."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat at buffets, but when I do, I prefer jasmine tokyo   think 20 dollars is a steal at this place.  Prime rib, oysters, crab legs, good sushi, good sashimi, all the other classic Chinese food at a buffet but actually worth eating.   Deserts here are all amazing 2. Gelato!!!!"}
{"text":"For a Buffet... You can't go wrong. Excellent selection of sushi, hot Asian dishes, a carving station, and a myriad of desserts.. Plus crab legs!! Best buffet experience in AZ by far."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and this is the best not just buffet but food I've eaten here.Thank you so much claim jumper for selling this place to a buffet gold mine!this place is good!I love it!if u like sushi I mean if u really like sushi come to jasmine Tokyo it's the bomb"}
{"text":"Went back to Jasmine Tokyo for lunch today. I went because I like it the first time that I dined there.  After today , I don't think that me and my daughter are going back. I will not recommend it to others either.   The sushi - were pathetic. It did not seem fresh and it did not taste fresh. Remember that we were there at 11:30. You would think that it will taste fresh. Second , it feels like you have to always wait for the chef to replenish the food bar at all times. This would include the TEMPURA BAR. They fill it with vegetable and you can count the shrimp.  Over all, I can find better place to eat lunch.  JASMINE TOKYO please step up and improve your food serving !   UN-HAPPY CUSTOMER !"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have fresh tuna and salmon. The sushi are absolutely great but just not authentic. They have been Americanized, which are still tasty. It is a good place to hangout with friends and listen to Asian songs!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big buffet fan, but this place changed my mind!  It's very clean, good service, lots and lots of amazing dishes, AND really good sushi!  Weekend lunch was $14.99, but during the week it's $11.99. Well worth every penny. One more comment, this isn't the kind of buffet where \"shifty people\" go. The kind where you need to Purell your hands and arms when you get back to the table : )"}
{"text":"Great service from beautiful staff, wonderful food selection and the sushi bar is excellent."}
{"text":"For a chinese buffet, this was the best one I came to so far... very good and fresh tasting food."}
{"text":"Quality really depends on the time of day that you visit. I have been here during slow daytime periods and busy dinner periods. During the day the service is much better, they will make you something on request if they are out or not currently serving it. The only downside is some of the items do tend to sit out longer than what I have seen during busier periods where they are constantly replenishing stock.  Despite the Tokyo name, there is a bigger influence of Chinese dishes than Japanese. This is NOT the place to go if you are expecting a high quality sushi. The sushi served here is satisfactory but not anything that you would specifically come here for.  Overall a great variety to pick from all at a great price. Not gourmet cuisine but certainly not trash."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because it is THE best Chinese buffet I have EVER been to. The selection is amazing! There is something for everyone, even those who don't like Chinese food. It's very clean, the food is frequently refreshed and the staff is extremely friendly. I especially enjoyed the walnut shrimp. I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Read some of the other reviews before going.  So many positives, I was really looking forward to trying this place, always hoping for a good sushi buffet, but always having been disappointed..  First, the good stuff.  Lots of variety.  Very clean.  Staff is friendly and helpful without being obsequious.    But ultimately, it's the food one goes to a restaurant for, and in this the place fails.  Food that should have been warm wasn't.  Sushi didn't look, taste, or have the texture of fresh.  Rolls mostly tasted the same - couldn't tell one from the other.    Desserts?  Again, lots of options, all mediocre.  Felt it was really a waste of money.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"For a buffet, this has a great selection of items.  The place is huge.  We go there for lunch, which is cheaper and I am guessing exactly the same buffet as dinner.  There are frequently discount coupons you can find at websites like valpack.  There is a senior discount if you are over 60.  So ok, all you can eat, not a date night, no canned music.  The sushi is not tip top to be sure, but there is a fair selection, and the tempura is pretty good.  Usually there is hot and sour and wonton and miso soup.  There are some American dishes, a carver who has roast beef or something.  It's a buiffet, so it is quick, no waiting to order.  For the type of place it is, a very good value, especially if you are hungry."}
{"text":"One of the better Asian buffets in the PHX Scottsdale area. They have a dozen plus varieties of freshly made sushi rolls, tempura, egg and spring rolls, a raw bar with shrimp, oysters and crab legs, some dim sum favorites and at least 20 hot Chinese entrees in addition to a massive desert bar, salads, fresh fruit and a Mongolian BBQ type raw fresh grill where you pick your meats and veggies and the chef stir fries it  for you while you wait. Everything is typically fresh and they keep the dishes full. Easy place to take a bunch of folks who all have different tastes and want something different because there's something for everybody even kids. It's a hell of a deal for 15 bucks at lunch. They charge more for dinner and throw in some extra items like prime rib. One interesting detail, it looks like a claim jumper restaurant inside because it used to be one. Antler chandeliers and all. Not quite as good as what you might find in LA or San Francisco but head and shoulders above most Asian buffets in Phoenix which tend to be nightmares of deep-fried meat, sweet-and-sour sauce and greasy noodles."}
{"text":"None of the food was bad, but none of it blew my mind either.  I served myself multiple helpings of the orange chicken, but I have had better (I like it crispy, but these chunks were kind of soft).  The miso soup was good as well.  The sushi rolls were only OK.  I think Sushi Brokers has much better rolls.  I did like the desserts (multiple chocolate chip cookies, chocolate pudding, german chocolate cake, and mint chocolate chip ice cream).  The Coor's Light on special was a little flat as well.    I'm not sure I'm going to be finding my way back here, not because it was terrible, but just because nothing was that great.  All of the waitstaff, especially our server, were really friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi as good as you find anywhere in Phoenix (not as good as the coast but still good). Hibachi as good as any teppanyaki place in town. Lots of std Chinese buffet fare but fresher and nicely done. Plus gelato and birthday cake for dinner. What else could you want :-).   Price: 19.99 for adults for dinner - still less than you would pay to eat sushi or hibachi plus everything else. To me that is a good deal."}
{"text":"I went at 11:30 for lunch and thought it was a very impressive buffet; food was good, meat tasted like it supposed to and had the right texture, it was hot and good. Great selection on desserts for an Asian buffet too! I am only giving 3 stars because upon my recommendation, my husband took his mom here. They went at 1:00 for lunch and said all the food seemed old and cold, so I felt bad for sending them. It may be because they open at 11 and the food was fresh for me and since my husband went later, it was the still the same food? A restaurant needs to be consistent in service to get repeat customers. I will probably try it again and give it another chance, especially due to the lack of good Chinese food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We have eaten there several times since we discovered it and can recommend it highly The staff are friendly and the food delicious. There is a large selection. Now if they would only offer green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Think of all the chinese and sushi dishes you like and chances are you will find it here. The Jasmine Tokyo buffet is a one stop shop for tackling your craving for noodles, mea, shrimp,  soup, sushi, bokchoy,dumplings. All in one go. Also works for moments when you would otherwise go to a restaurant and be indecisive on what you want or have to make tradeoffs. :)   The price is reasonable as well. The only thing I liked the least were the desserts which tasted quite odd. However, good overall."}
{"text":"Food was okay. They have an island full of sushi. They also have Mongolian stir-fry. I was surprised they had duck though! Their crab legs are very skinny..wasn't worth trying. They also have a salad, fruit bar. Dessert section is pretty big along with their selection of ice cream (isn't your typical ice cream machines seem in most buffets). Not sure if it's worth the price for this buffet."}
{"text":"I planned to give 2stars,my teens said that give another one for their yummy ice cream! There are about 5-6 favor of ice cream and they got very good verities of cakes. Their sashimi was bad quality,the oyster on the shell with bitter teaste.The prime rib was cold inside.Only the Chinese selection they made it good. $21.99/adult for dinner and weekends. $.99/yrs for kids under 10."}
{"text":"My hubs and I LOVE Chinese food and had a craving for a mixture - hence going to buffet.  We searched for a place on Yelp and noticed the high rating and good reviews.  I am giving a 1 star because the hostess was super nice and bottles beer was good.  Otherwise the cooked dishes were all luke warm.  The orange chicken had been sitting all day and was soggy/mushy instead of crispy. Peppered beef had a sitting all day flavor. Sushi was sitting out and down to few items on each tray. A couple of the sushi rolls were sitting in puddles of juice.   Flavor seemed bland. Spicy dishes had no spice.  I just hope and pray we don't get food poisoning. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"What a unbelievably classless place!! I was shocked that a mediocre at best buffet was nearly $80 for my wife, myself and my 3 small kids but the server actually followed us out to tell us that tip wasn't included. That was classlessness to the highest degree! I obviously filled out the receipt and knew the total I wrote. She didn't take our plates, we put them on another table, and they didn't fill our drinks. We ended up drinking water we brought while we waited. The sushi was old even though it had a wide variety. A wide variety of old sushi still isnt good. Half the food was empty and the place was empty. There were 3 cars in the parking lot. Overall, I will never go back and will tell everyone I know to not go there as well. The worst buffet I have had in Phoenix yet!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is SH#T! There is no way in the world they serve it fresh. My stomach is not sensitive but I had to go to their restroom and throw everything up!  First time in my life it happened. And on top of it they charge $5 for a sh#tty bagged tea. Seriously?! 1 teabag and a glass of a hot water is $5?!  For the same money I can go to the Talking Stick Buffet and get a much much better of a quality food"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this restaurant & he is a foodie!....I finally went there and it was no different from any all you can eat buffet slop shop... All the positive ratings are from idiots morons.. Take it from a person who knows food...Don't waste your money..Very dissapointed...My friend is a idiot!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Chinese buffet but also not the worst. When I came the front parking lot was under construction so the entrance was in the back, a little disorientating but it didn't stop us.  This buffet seems to have been converted from an old steak house as the ceilings were massive with some deer antler chandeliers, but that's beside the point.          It pains me to say this because of the other reviews, but the food was not all that spectacular.  There was a decent amount of sushi, all of which were deep-fried and/or stuffed with cream cheese.  A couple had some eel on the top, which was a plus.  The \"normal\" food was the usual Kung pao chicken or orange chicken so nothing special there really.  The dessert selection was pretty bountiful for a Chinese buffet and had gelato carrot cake and thick clans of brownies among other things.         Overall the buffet was decent and had a nice selection of sushi and dessert, though I don't think that the 16 dollar lunch was not justified."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night and again no hibachi... We used to look forward to the fresh noodles, vegetables and meat/shrimp on hibachi but no longer available. So disappointed in rest of food last night. Food was not fresh and sushi looked liked it was out since their lunch hour. Dried up and not fresh at all!! Should not have eaten the sushi.. Had bad food poisoning all night.. Not sure I will return to this place for awhile... We've been going here since they opened up years ago... A little too pricey for dried up food."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Asian buffets and I must say Jasmine Tokyo is among one of the top in Arizona (at least for lunch). Though, don't be fool by it's name, this buffet resembles a mix of Asian cultures food and not just Japanese.  I find that just the sushi alone is well worth the lunch price of $11.99. There's at least 10 different type of rolls (Inarizushi, Makizushi, fried sushi, and etc). And yes they do have eel sauces! A big plus for sushi lovers!  Now, the other food there are just what you expect from a typical Asian buffet restaurant (rows of veggies, entry of fried rice/noodles, BBQ Mongolian chicken, ice cream -includes mango/coconuts!, etc).  Overall, it's a nice place and if you're in it for sushi, then this is definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Two people came out to over $30 with waters to drink. A bit pricey for buffet. I've been to better places in the area"}
{"text":"I love buffets but not this one.  There was plenty of varieties from seafood to Korean bbq.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food was poor.  I would not recommend this place.  Very expensive for the quality.   Should have been $8 vs $20 something."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed. I can only assume that if you order off the menu it is astounding as compared to the buffet. I expected it to be expensive based on its Scottsdale location. However, I also expected the food to be delicious. The buffet is very mediocre run-of-the-mill Chinese buffet food. It took one walk around the buffet circle for me to realize I could have gotten the same food at a cheap China Star buffet. I went for dinner on a Friday night with three other adults and one child and the bill was $110. Nothing I ate was exceptional. The only thing I ate that was tasty was the tempura shrimp. We will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Wonderful, Wonderful, wonderful.  If you leave here less than fullfilled I think you have a food problem.  There is so much here you can't possibly complain about not having enough to eat.  Sushi lovers - this is the best place in town."}
{"text":"Buffet is pretty bad, don't know about the regular menu but I would only come back here if they overhaul the buffet quality."}
{"text":"Still excellent!  They haven't compromised the quality or variety at all since opening.  As a matter of fact it seems the variety may be even greater.  If you like to eat a lot of sushi and a lot of shrimp, this place is a must try.  Well worth the price."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today after driving past and noticing it for the first time, then checking out the reviews here..   Let's start with price.. It was $14.99 for Sunday lunch (but for checking in at yelp you get a 10% discount. Drinks (even iced tea) are additional ($2.25 for iced tea). So it was a little pricier than most Phoenix area Asian Buffets.  Decor--Yes, this building used to be Bobby McGee's and little has changed with the physical structure. One thing that I noticed (which is a pet peeve of mine) is that with many southwest inspired chandeliers throughout, there were LOTS of burnt out light bulbs. Sure, it was daytime and the place was well lit enough, but that many bulbs burnt out shows a lack of attention to the small details that make the difference between good and great. And, there were many ceiling fans as mentioned in prior reviews, but they were all OFF today.. It is over 100degrees and warm, why weren't the on??? The place was a little stuffy..  Food--    Sushi--There was a pretty decent sized selection of sushi for a buffet restaurant. It appeared to be fresh and the few that I tried were good. I will say that I am not a huge sushi fan. The sushi station here also included tempura shrimp and vegetables.    Seafood--Chilled shrimp--obviously not cooked fresh in house, but come in precooked and frozen (high water content). oysters on the half shell, marinated mussels. But surprisingly, no crab legs. This section also contained the aforementioned sesame balls. Yea, I like them too, but they are the same balls you can get at most other Asian buffets. They are a pre-made, pre-packaged item they buy, not some original creation.     Salad--There is a smallish \"American\" salad bar, but a few more unusual selections such as bowtie seaweed, chilled, marinated baby octopus, shrimp and apple salad, chilled snowpea and edamame..Also included are some fresh fruits such as strawberries, melon, etc..    Hot Selections--While the selection of hot food is not as large as many of the \"Mega-buffets\", what it lacks in quantity, it made up for in quality. Thai Calamari was a very nice fried calamari.. Surprisingly, it was fresh and tender, not chewy like most attempts at buffet calarami. Beef with green peppers had good, tender pieces of non-chewy beef along with green bells and onions. Beef was not an after thought in the dish. Even the old standard of sweet and sour chicken was nice sized portions of fresh white meat chicken in tempura, with sweet and sour on the side. They had some bite sized pieces of duck (I forget the sauce). The duck was tender and moist,but the small pieces made it a little difficult to eat due to the bones.  Other choices included Black pepper shrimp, fresh green beans, and coconut shrimp. Off to the side, they have a grill station that was featured bbq ribs and grilled sausage....Also included was a mongolian bbq station where you can create your own selection of proteins and veggies and get it cooked to order..    Desserts--Desserts are not an afterthought here. They do have the traditional \"Chinese buffets sheet cake selections\" that most other buffets have, but they also have small slices of cheesecake, red velvet cake, a delicious mango mousse, and 6 or 8 choices of gelato.. The mango and coconut gelatos were two delicious selections..  All in all, I say it is one of the better Asian buffets around town. It is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for. A little more attention to a few minor details could take this place from 4 stars to 5 stars in my book"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. That's about it. The desserts were cheap and ordinary fares you might find in an elementary school cafeteria. The duck was gamey. The sushi rice was dry and the neta (fish part) was thin enough to try out for a Paris runway. The sashimi was also very thin, although it was freshly prepared. They had lobster and crab but truth is I didn't get to  eat much of it since they didn't have any utensils available. The best stuff was the tempura and the egg rolls. It definitely wasn't worth the amount we paid. Plus my wife was throwing up all night when we got home. Not sure if there was a connection but it was not the best way for our anniversary to end."}
{"text":"My first and last visit: food was not worth the price, the service stinks, and the staff is very unfriendly.  I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Large selection of food. loved the sushi choices! Loved everything. Service was exceptional! You get what you paid for."}
{"text":"I had a few different experience with these kinds of restaurant. Overall, I liked it. I can tell their food is really well prepared and fresh. Entire atmosphere is also really nice. If they adjust the price little bit lower (even $1 less than now), they will get more customers. Overall I like this place"}
{"text":"All the food is very delicious especially sushi and Korean style bbq. And my server Rosemeir is very kind and make us very happy :) If she didn't tell me about overcharge, I don't know about that. Thanks to Rosemeir and maneger! :)"}
{"text":"The food is excellent here and it's never too crowded. Lunch prices are reasonable, but dinner is pricey.  We really enjoy ourselves here."}
{"text":"Love this place! I typically can't stand buffet restaurants, especially when they have sushi. Here though, the sushi and sashimi are just as good as any sushi place in town (there's even a sushi chef making it fresh!). All the Japanese style food is made so well! It seems like a steep price but for all you can eat fresh sushi it's a steal compared to ordering rolls or sashimi off a menu."}
{"text":"We went their for lunch and it was very good buffet food. I am going to try their dinner soon.  The dinner has more fish dishes and more Sashimi.  It is also priced higher.  The place is clean and roomy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet...period.  The food is delicious. The sushi is especially tasty.  I've been here many times and have never been disappointed.  My wife is not a fan of most buffets, but she loves this place too.  The ambience is bizarre, which adds to its charm."}
{"text":"Sushi is not fresh. Vegetables tempura is disgusting. Just a little food can choose. 22 dollars each is not worth. I won't come again. Nothing is good."}
{"text":"Our family came to this location several times with their coupon! Really nice buffet with good price, compared to others. All kinds of Asian food, large selections: shrimp, sushi, etc. Can't find anywhere else comparable in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I see my parents as the connisseurs of Chinese buffets, so when they said they wanted to bring me to Jasmine Tokyo for some good buffet fare I figured why not.  This place serves a mix of Chinese and Japanese food.  There's a variety of cold salads, hot Chinese dishes, roasted meats, dim sum, sushi, fruit, and desserts.  The cold salads and hot Chinese dishes were my favorite.  The dim sum was not so great because of the thick wrappers they used, and the sushi was just ok because of all the rice they put on them.  Overall, the food was pretty good, but I would just go for lunch.  I think dinner might be a bit overpriced for the quality of the food.  I wasn't as impressed as my parents, but I think it's one of the better ones in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Service was on point as staff worked tirelessly in the background, but what's with all the sushi rave? Even the bare shrimp and crab legs were tasteless, salty, and surprisingly tough, a bitter disappointment--I actually had to spit out my shrimp and toss the crab legs. Sushi barely qualified as such, mediocre rice with  barely any fish, often soaked in sauces or just deep fried. I want to give and A for effort as there certainly is a varied selection, but the quality and flavor isn't there.   If I could rate the seafood separately, this place would get more stars as the salad and hot food selection are all yummy. Spicy squid salad, chicken and mushrooms, orange chicken, ribs, it's all delish. Desserts were probably the most lackluster, dry cream puffs and freezer burnt cheesecake, but it wasn't the heartbreaker the seafood was.   In summary, friendly staff, great hot food, but don't come for the crab legs!"}
{"text":"Really awesome place!! The lunch buffet is a great price for what you can get (~$11.99)which ranges from fresh sushi and rolls to Salisbury steak and sweet ribs, udon soup, teriyaki chicken, stir fry, and even salads. To top it off, a heavenly dessert selection, cream puffs and cake and ice cream, even mousse! This is definitely my new go to spot for D.) All of the above."}
{"text":"This Asian buffet is a cut above most others. They have better sushi rolls and in general better quality items on the buffet. However they do charge more then the average buffet. Overall I believe it's worth the money."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I go here for lunch at least once a month. We make the drive even though we work about 15 minutes away.  My family of 5 go here on weekends every 3 months.  Best sushi selection and quality for a buffet in AZ.  Not just the usual California rolls or pieces with too much rice.  Website picture does not lie.  Lots of unique creations.  At lest 12 varieties. Tempura shrimp galore, too.  Chinese food is also above average.  Beef is actually cubes of steak, rather than the pounded beef slices.  Chinese BBQ ribs are excellent.   Salad selection is unique with seaweed, jellyfish and other interesting items.  Always has watermelon, cantaloupe and honey dew melon.  Seafood selection very good for dinner and weekends.  No one else has oysters on a half shell.  Service is excellent.  Drinks refilled constantly.  And Yelp App always has 10% off coupon when checking in!"}
{"text":"Not a real buffet fan---this place is acceptable. it's aight..food select and taste is..aight, place seemed clean but stuffy warm.  it is AYCE buffet...it isn't the   HALLE BERRY ([INSERT YOUR CHOICE] .....wherever you choose)    of cuisine but then it's an AYCE buffet"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here today. Pretty good variety of sushi (best i've seen in Phoenix) as well as decent offering of hot dishes. Included the usual suspects of a buffet and about 8 types of dim sum/dumpling. The dessert selection is better than most with the ice cream being the true highlite. As far as price goes $12 plus a %10 off coupon makes it worth looking into. Not my favorite buffet in Phoenix (my favorite/usual choice is Pacific Seafood Buffet) but for being closer to home makes a decent alternative."}
{"text":"Excellent food  Wished the service was little better but still nice place to experience"}
{"text":"Solid 4 Stars! Great customer service and food selection! Not 5 because the quality of food could be better but, you get what you pay for...& for the price-- Jasmine Tokyo delivers!! :)"}
{"text":"Finally an upscale Chinese buffet, where have you been all my life? Away with the mess hall atmosphere, since it is in the old Claim Jumper restaurant, the seating is nice and secluded. Sushi station has a ton of variety and the other choices are plentiful and high quality. The cream cheese wontons are the best and the fruit is cut up, ready to eat - even the oranges came out of their peel. Don't even get me started on the desert selection. Well, if you must, I tried the straw mouse and the chocolate mouse, both delish and even the mundane chocolate or tapioca pudding is served in appetizing little containers reminding me of the wicked spoon in Las Vegas. So much better than the piles you get at other locations. Absolutely my favorite Chinese buffet from now on, I shutter now thinking of my old digs."}
{"text":"A nice family-owned buffet with a great food selection and a clean, quiet interior. My family has been coming here for a few years now, and each time is a consistently positive experience. The owners are friendly, honest, and hardworking. The food is a step up from traditional buffet fare. Sushi is a plus!"}
{"text":"Perhaps no other eating establishment has such a wide swing in reviews as a buffet does.  And this is to be expected:  buffets rarely serve the best quality food; the spicing has to be near neutral to accommodate every taste and -- very important, but almost never considered -- we tend to appreciate and savor food less, when we have an unlimited amount of it and a huge variety.  That said, Jasmine Tokyo is no better or no worse than any other decent buffet, with the exception of providing more variety than most; having a very large amount of space, comfortably decorated; and not having that assembly-line feeling many buffets can't seem to avoid having.  Reading the reviews on Yelp, I can fully understand and agree with almost every opinion expressed from the 1-star reviews to the 5-star.  While it's absolutely true that this place probably has one of the best buffets in the Valley and has a much larger selection of Japanese food than Chinese, it is also true that most of the food won't blow you away.  The sushi is good, but not outstanding; the Chinese food is typical of almost every Chinese buffet; the desserts, the same decently acceptable food you can find in almost every cheap restaurant.  The big exception is the ice cream, which, while also not fantastic, is much better than you'd usually find in a buffet and -- MOST IMPORTANT -- is served to you by an employee behind the counter.  This might be inconvenient to people, who like to serve themselves or who might feel embarrassed about asking for seconds; but it's a very welcome change from the borderline, let's-be-closed-down-by-the-Board-of-Health policy of letting little kids with filthy hands and questionable hygiene scoop their own ice cream out of a communal bucket  (that, of course, doesn't apply to YOUR kids, dear reader ... everyone ELSE'S kids are slobs; yours, of course, aren't).  Service is fast, friendly and efficient.    So, in conclusion, this really is one of the best buffets I've been to in Arizona; that does not mean, however, that you should expect a lot for what you're paying.  It may be, that some people will not consider a visit here cheap.  Perhaps.  But considering the variety in selection and the fact that I saw a number of people in there with stretch pants and wearing striped shirts they should have thought twice about wearing, it can't be denied, that this place is a good value for the money."}
{"text":"I really don't care what other reviewers say! Every time I have been there myself, I had a good experience and felt I received a good deal for my money. Actually, this is probably the only Asian buffet I've returned to more than once. I took a good friend of mine there once (he's Asian btw), and he was impressed. Said he loved the fresh sushi and dim sum options, and would be taking his parents there for lunch too.  Besides their fresh sushi selection, they also have a good salad bar and dessert section. I love their tiny, tasty dessert treats. Perfect, so you won't overdo it! LOL  Btw, it's a good sign when you frequently see Asian families eating at an Asian restaurant.  ;-)  * I used to get their coupons in the mail, which was great. So, I always felt I got a good deal. Sometimes, after paying the bill, they would give us coupons there too. :-)   Bottom line: good value buffet deal, fresh sushi, comfortable yet eclectic atmosphere, and good, attentive service. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I moved here from San Francisco and have been on the hunt for decent Chinese food. We went to a birthday party at jasmine Tokyo and I loved it! It's the closest to the kind of food I'm used to. The variety is amazing! I've already been back and will go again! Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Good buffet. So glad I found you. Enjoyed the variety and space. Lots of food. It's a full buffet. Eat it! Yum!"}
{"text":"I generally don't like buffets...I'm lazy and like people to serve me food, but anyways. People I know were raving about this place so I checked it out. I was not impressed at all. The sushi rolls were mediocre, like the stuff you can get at the grocery store, the nigri didn't look so fresh, and some fat kid was taking all the stuff before I could grab anything. The restaurant used to be like a clam jumper and they haven't changed the interior up at all. The other asian food was okay, I guess comparable to panda express. I don't think I will ever go back unless someone makes me."}
{"text":"It had been a few months since I last ate at Jasmine, and I'm thrilled to say it's as good as ever!  This time the place was way busy, but fresh food kept coming out and it was all delicious.  I still think they serve the best spare ribs in the state."}
{"text":"I don't live in this area of the valley but every time I'm here. I'm coming to this place! The food was very good with an amazing selection of food. I eat a lot of sushi and I recommend this place."}
{"text":"$14 for lunch + $2 drinks for mediocre selections and bland food. Not really worth the price for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I am a long-time Jasmine Tokyo cater since its grand opening on 2011. Tonight, I brought my family for dinner again from 5:00 to 6:30 pm. I am not sure I went there early or what. Once the cooked dishes were empty, the cookers did not prepare new one. This happened included roasted duck, fruit (watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe.), and deep fried shrimps. I understand business may want to save some dimes for not bringing out dishes as frequent as possible to save its margin, yet it is unacceptable for Scottsdale buffet restaurant that charge over $22 per person to keep empty dishes over 15 minute's time frame in a non-rush hour. Inside the restaurant, there were at least twenty people in here.  I wish the management can make improvements on the food control and dessert table in the future."}
{"text":"The weekend dinner buffet was absolute tops, I don't think I can say enough, but I'll tell you what I want....... ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!! It's pricey, about $20 or maybe a little more? My friend sported me on his suggestion of the place. Their website doesn't tell you prices! It's totally worth it for what's on offer!  Anyway, this is the old Claim Jumper restaurant location, and they kept it pretty much the same with some slight decor changes. The cool belt-driven fans are still there as well as the high booths. Service is perfect and impeccable. Nuff said.  Now the buffet amazement! All you can eat sushi and sashimi!!! WOW I was in flavor heaven. Of course PLEASE take only what you can eat. There's a sign to remind you as well. They don't want you to waste food or the chef's time. Salmon, tuna, the works! Help yourself. I also recommend the tempura'd jalapeno roll. SCRUMPTIOUS! There are also tempura'd veggies at the end. Be sure to look at everything so you don't miss things.  There's a small area that has Oriental ribs, smoked sausage and.... PRIME RIB CUT TO ORDER from the big chunk on the block in front of you. I ordered a thin slice with au jus. I didn't want to fill up on that, I wanted to try a little of everything per my buffet custom. There's also asparagus, which was done perfectly. The ribs were a tad dry, but delicious anyway with that red glaze. They also have a Mongolian grill section if you want. Choose your ingredients and have them cooked for you there.  Cooked salmon, calamari (super yum!), little octopi, clams, crab legs, some of the usual Chinese buffet offerings, shrimp, mussels, oysters! So much to choose from.  There's also this amusing little treat on a scallop shell you should try. Cheesy and creamy. I say amusing because I compare it to a fun flavored thing at Hibachi Grill (currently closed, don't know when it will re-open or if it will). Gelatos for desert as well as a variety of pastries, and anything else your heart desires. There's also Hershey's syrup for drizzling.   This is the best buffet I've ever been to in the Phoenix area. On par with Pacific on South Country Club for me. Haven't been to Talking Stick yet, but this one is SUPERB!! I wonder what the lunch buffet is like, and what the differences are, but the Saturday evening dinner was OUT OF SIGHT!!! GO ENJOY!  ** Jedi Obi Wan hand-wave ** This is the Asian buffet you've been looking for."}
{"text":"Holy sh#t! For over 20 bucks a person this place is awful. Food is subpar. Poor selection. Soggy, cold food. The ambiance is lacking. The location is an old claim jumper and still looks like it. Gotta love looking at antlers while eating sushi. BTW sushi is the only redeeming aspect of this place."}
{"text":"Really sad they closed! This was the best Asian buffet in the area.   Review when they were open:  The best spread of Asian food ever! Quite expensive, but worth it. Their calamari is awesome."}
{"text":"I went on Saturday night because I was craving asian. It took a bit for us to get a table but once we were finally seated the server was nice and attentive. The sushi was good but half of their selection was fried rolls of some kind. The traditional asian buffet food was average with a medium sized area for non seafood. The seafood was by far the highlight of the meal. They have a decent select of raw and cooked seafood. They also have a nice sized dessert area with cake and ice cream. It is pricey for dinner unless you are my mom who can eat her weight in seafood."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best buffets I went to in Arizona.  I usually go to the pacific or hibachi grill for buffet (Don't ever go to Red Wok!!!!). The sushis are mostly stuffed with rice in a buffet so people get full real easy. (Secret Marketing). However their sushi has a perfect small size and it tasted great. They also have udon or soba if you ask the people on the barbeque grill.  I also enjoyed the mango icecream. Go for the mango really. Most of their deserts were amazing.  Their price is a bit high but its worth it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Asian buffets.  This one takes the cake, as it were. The variety, freshness, and overall food and atmosphere is amazing.  The price is a bit high, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm just really not sure how this place could be rated so highly. Everything was truly terrible. I was most excited for the Sushi rolls, sashimi, and crab legs, and oh my, they were not good at all. I figured I'd settle for the things impossible to screw up- crab Rangoon's, gyozas, soup, etc-- again, very bad.  I really do recommend you spend your money elsewhere. We will never be going back."}
{"text":"4.5/5 (rounded up)  Been here several times.  With a variety of people including my wife.  Great selection of sushi for lunch along with great entrees and desserts.  I always eat too much because everything tastes great.  Given the price of the buffet it's a steal for lunch.  I've never been there for dinner."}
{"text":"Keep in mind I'm picky about food.   First off, I didn't get sick by anything I ate, one star for that!  When we went here, we went for novelty. We wanted to try it all & see if it was all we hoped & dreamed it would be. I'll break it down.  You walk in to a river rock & antler'd interior because it's the old Claim Jumper, they seat you, ask your drink order & give you place settings. Then you go foraging.   We started at the sushi. There were traditional rolls, sashimi, and sushi. All of it was fresh. Then there's non-traditional; french fried onions on the rolls, some mayo, some spicy sauces.  It's all tasty, but I'm sure the quality of french fried onions and mayo are not the quality of the fish. There's no \"natural\" here. But again, we were in it for the novelty.  Next we moved on to oysters (raw & cooked), crab legs, soups & appetizers. All tasty. Boiled snails, NOT tasty, chewy & without flavor even with the sauce. There was a yummy seaweed salad, each piece was tied in a knot & tossed in a spicy vinaigrette, very good. Then there was jellyfish salad, gelatinous & crunchy at the same time...not a great texture for me personally.   After that we tried the meats. Everything I had was good & seemed quite traditional. There was hair on my pig feet but...I didn't plan on eating the skin so all was good.  The duck was more work than I bargained for, bones to work around. The clams were not very good as they were in a thick yellow chicken bouillon.  There was a shrimp salad too.   One thing that worries me is people with allergies. I don't know if there's cross contamination with shrimp or peanut oils & I'm unsure the employees know either.  If you have allergies, proceed with caution.  Desserts were sub-par but, eh, you're full anyway so who cares??   Here's the facts: The sushi is good, and can be fun.  The salads and soups are well prepared.  The roasted (BBQ pork for one) meat was great.   If you go in JUST for these items, it's worth the $21.99 (and if you can find a 20% off coupon online, even better). If you venture into the unknown (jellyfish, snails & clams) it's not.   Also, we arrived at 5:30 & it was empty. Upon leaving at 6:40 it was PACKED & mainly with Japanese tourists from two tour buses. Go early!  So our waitress was our cashier, kids are $1.20 per year of age until they hit 12. And the wait staff was helpful & cleared plates fast & filled drinks quick.   This is a japanese buffet, it's not perfect, but it's worth going to. I enjoyed myself & definitely over ate, always a good sign."}
{"text":"They need to rename this place Jasmine GOATyo....because it's definitely the greatest Asian buffet of all time in the Scottsdale area. If you want to eat yourself silly, this is your place. Also, it's in an old Claim Jumper building, and they basically kept the decor identical. It's amazing. If you dock it for that then you need to stop taking yourself so seriously.   I've been probably 10 times and I'm literally never disappointed. All you can eat sushi, prime rib, crab, shrimp, ribs, and other asian dishes like honey walnut shrimp, teriyaki chicken, etc. All for a pretty decent price ($23 for dinner at the time of this writing). Anyone rating it poorly needs to understand \"IT'S A BUFFET PEOPLE\", Emeril isn't back there bamming up pots and pans. It's a buffet, not Maestro's make your expectations accordingly.   You want to spend $40 on sushi, go for it. Or you can go here, pay less, and get the same kinds of sushi with all the other aforementioned items. Throw in that they always have coupons that you can use, and you have a 5 star rating from me!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Jasmine since it opened.  The food is GREAT!  One of my favorite dishes is the Seaweed Salad.   I don't know why.... it just tastes great!.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I like all the different selections of food that they offer and all are prepared to the highest level.   I highly recommend Jasmine Tokyo Buffett... Really an awesome choice for great food and its all you can eat.  Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"This place was okay....  The sushi was actually better than the Chinese food I tried (I tried the Walnut Chicken).  I also tried some Panko Chicken which was good as well.  The Tempura Vegetables were just a bit oilier than I like.    I was with a larger group and they all seemed pretty pleased.    I had some of the ice cream for dessert - small bits if green tea, mango and coconut.  That was delicious.    I might give it another shot - but typically for Chinese food I like it freshly prepared rather than on a buffet.  Can't beat the price and they give you a discount if you check in!"}
{"text":"An excellent addition to the neighborhood, taking over the premises of  the now defunct Claim Jumpers.  The buffet is splendid and includes a massive assortment of sushi made fresh to order.  The great variety of Chinese dishes leaves one stunned.  Deserts, including five varieties of ice cream, are a perfect topping to a topnotch repast.  And I write only about Lunch!  Prime Ribs, we were told, is a dinner- time addition.  You can't go wrong here!. Well worth a visit.  Even the service is excellent.  Lunch was $11.99, without tea or drinks of any sort other than water.  Seniors are given a 10% discount at all times.  A later visit, in the evening, found the buffet serving fresh, scrumptious oysters on the half shell.  Wonderful!  Our one reservation was with the temperature of the food.  Hot foods were too often merely lukewarm.  We hope this is just a temporary problem that will soon be solved."}
{"text":"This place deserves zero stars. I have celiac disease, and asked the kitchen staff what kind of noodles they were serving. They told me the noodles were rice. I sat down with my plate and began to feel sick. When we brought up the issue to them, they didn't seem to care. They just wanted money! Way overpriced and food was cold. Tried  acknowledging them on how the kitchen staff should know about the product they are serving. The waiter that we had talked about how the owner was there, when our issue was brought up the owner denied being the owner and didn't want any part of our conversation. All we wanted is to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else. A awful place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped at this place with my wife and 2 daughters and was pleasantly surprised with the variety, freshness and quantity of well prepared items that were offered.  Would most definitely come here again when I return to scottsdale. Crab, sushi, shrimp, cook to order, prime rib and desserts were very good."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our 12th Wedding Anniversary.  Food was pretty good. Good selection. Desserts need a little help for the price we paid. Very disappointed that we were charged a 15% gratuity for a party of 6. I've never had to pay gratuity at a buffet place. I usually leave a tip on the table for server for our   Regular drinks. A bit to pricey for a buffet $21.00 per person."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for the first time. Food was okay, but it was a nice environment and awesome service. Would try again."}
{"text":"As good as a buffet as you will get. Good entree dishes and sushi on par with RA. A little pricey that's why only 4 stars. 2 people will be $50 or so, just a heads up."}
{"text":"You know what, it is an all you can wat buffet. Not dinner on the Titanic. Calm down people. The food was fresh, the service was exceptional, (Mirian was my server) the place was very clean. The drink was very strong. And the price for the fresh seafood was beyond reasonable.  Was there anything I didn't like? Yes, but so what. You try it and move on. I can eat 80 $'s worth of sushi in one sitting (I know, I have issues), so this is a great deal for me.  I just moved here from Orlando and missed my favorite Asian Buffet, I now have a newone."}
{"text":"One of the best quality Chinese buffet style restaurants in the Phoenix area that I've found.  The service is great, the food quality and selection follow suite.  The prices are a bit steep for a buffet style restaurant, but fair considering the area and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This buffet is average. Not much selection and it doesn't really taste all that great. On top of that, it's pretty pricey for lunch. Only good thing was the service, drinks were refilled and plates were taken away quickly."}
{"text":"Quality of food was above average for AYCE buffet as long as you selected dishes that just came out and weren't sitting around.  Their heating system to keep the food hot I thought was insufficient.  $11.99 For Lunch is a little pricey for the selection, but with coupon for 20% off the price is right.  Service was surprisingly friendly and the place was very clean.    I'm a fan.  Haven't tried out dinner yet but will in the future.  With the name Tokyo, I was hoping this place was more a Japanese place with other selections, but I would say it's more of a Chinese place with some Japanese selections and other Asian choices.   I would rate this 3.5 stars but bump it up to 4 stars b/c of the friendly staff and manager.  Everyone had a smile."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Asian buffets in the valley. They have about the best selection of sushi of the buffets i have tried in the valley. Everything was good and I always eat too much when I come here. Service is always very good also."}
{"text":"So far one of the best Asian Sushi buffets I've been to since I moved to Arizona. It's the CLEANEST and the service is much better than others buffets in the Valley.  The restaurant is fairly big, so definitely great for large groups. They have a selection of Sushi Rolls, Sashimi (Salmon, White Tuna, Tuna, Octopus) and a small hibachi station. The also have a fresh salad corner with Romaine and Iceberg lettuce with other veggie toppings. The chinese food selection was great too including prime rib!  I would say the dessert selection was the best. They have ice cream (with a lady ready to scoop for you with a smile!) and individual served cakes (red velvet, chocolate and a couple of asian pastries)  For dinner $19.99 not a bad price! Plenty of parking too!  I had a $5 off coupon for checking in on google places."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night and was surprised it wasn't even crowded, though I imagine this place getting alot more business if it were in Chandler. They offer a good selection of sushi, sashami, cocktail shrimp, crab legs, and various Chinese stir fry for about $20 per person. It's definitely one of the best Asian buffets I've been to in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with fellow yelpers Robyn N. and Rand H. Well to start the place was built in an old Claim Jumper location and all the booths and decor were used again,it is very nice and comfy. The food was really good  they offer a couple of unusual dishes not seen at other Chinese buffets and a good dessert selection. The food here is displayed nicer then any other Asian buffet I have been at. But I still like a couple of the big super buffets better.This place is probably in the top 5 Asian buffets."}
{"text":"Food is okay, maybe it's time for a new menu?  Restroom floor is a bit sticky, not really sure why.  Price is still good.  $12 for lunch, which is not bad if you have the 10% coupon or if you are a senior, you automatically get 10% off from your bill.  Drinks are still extra and not included in the buffet price.  If you use Yelp app, you get 10% off, but you only get to use it once."}
{"text":"We ate there with the family, nice, cozy environment, it was kind of dead for a Sunday. At the entrance of the buffet it smelled like sewer, we were grossed out but wanted to give it a try. We eat sushi 15 times a month... no joke! This place is NOT grade A sushi at all.. you can compare it to Grocery store sushi... it was OK.  The variety of the buffet was really good, it would even be better if everything tasted good for that amount of money!"}
{"text":"Not as I expected...Dinner buffet for $21.99?  Totally not worth it.  The food quality is average and below but they charge you like a buffet in Vegas.    The Sushi are pre-made and setting on the tray, not fresh made per order.  Very limited choice.  The sashimi are thinly slice and taste not fresh too.  When ask for a sashimi, the guy give you a pile of sashimi and put them on your plate, no presentation or anything..(there you go...eat it!!)    The Oysters, some fresh some not.  Few of those are sitting on the ice under the light for a long time, I have some of those and they are warm, not fresh!  Salad and fruit bar, I believe the pineapple from the can, and the oranges are from one of the backyard, so sour.      The soup choice are Hot and Sour soup, Egg drop soup and miso soup...very basic and you could find them in any Chinese buffet for $5.99 AYCE.  $21.99, I expect better quality of soup.  Hot and Sour soup, not hot not sour.  Very disappointed.    The clams, almost every each one of them have sands in it.  After a couple of those clams, I don't even want to try it.   The mongolian grill (the noodle, cook per order).  The food choice are very limited.  The BBQ ribs, too dry!  The other food are average, you could find it in any Chinese buffet for half price or under $10 bucks!   This restaurant 1-2 stars the most.  I won't recommend other to try this place, even with a coupon...don't waste your money.    I would recommend go to Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet, same buffet style, food are better, more choices, taste better, fresh sushi (made per order), and lower price ($15.99), I vote that for 4 stars at least."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese buffet in the area in my opinion.  Of course, it does come with a price.  Dinner costs just over $20 and lunch is around $12 during the week, so it costs about the same as an Outback steakhouse if you just want a nice meal.  Their signature item is the all you can eat crab legs which draws quite a few people.  Their food is top quality and they have a large variety of items.  They also have a sushi bar which would be worth the dinner price by itself.  They offer sashimi and a dozen or so sushi rolls as well as tempura vegetables and some other unique appetizers.    They have a carving station as well with terrific pork chops, sausage, turkey or beef.  Their ambiance is upscale and they have really cool ceiling fans."}
{"text":"Spacious. Clean. Efficient & friendly staff!  Great variety of hot and cold foods! They  could display more sashimi! They cater nicely to large parties such as fifty plus people. The price is right!!!! Awesome Happy Hour drink prices!!!"}
{"text":"Great quality Asian food for a buffet. We try to visit Jasmine Tokyo as much as we can when we visit Phoenix. Location is a bit far north if you are visiting central Phoenix. However it's worth the drive because it's one of the best Asian buffets I've been to. The sushi section has a wide assortment of dishes. I can tell they take the time and effort to keep the sushi as fresh as they can for a buffet. It tastes like it was prepared for you at the bar. Japanese and Chinese dishes are available! I eat at many Chinese restaurants and the black pepper steak and BBQ pork ribs are the best I've tasted; both tender and has excellent flavor. You can find a ten-percent coupon if you hunt around online."}
{"text":"Well we spent 200 dollars on a meal for 8 of us the  3 year old ate maybe a couple ounces of food and I believe it's over charged for what you get. Alot of the food seemed like it was sitting out there in the buffet for awhile and cold and old..bummer"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, for the price I paid for lunch 11.99 Ordered a Diet Coke at the beginning of the meal, Never delivered.... Better buffet else where"}
{"text":"Poor food quality, overpriced, and certainly no Asian taste. My family and I will never go back. Why is there any positive reviews?"}
{"text":"Would give this place 0 stars if I could. The food is terrible and their manager is even worse. Absolute  joke doesn't know customer service and has a nasty attitude. We went in,I had a plate of appetizers it was terrible. I being straving and already there went back for a plate of salad and some chicken fried rice. It was also terrible figuring that nobody can mess up chicken fried rice it was my last ditch effort. It tasted like dog food. I told the girl I was going to leave and she got the manager who told me it would be 6.99 for a lb of food. We ate in total a few crab puffs, at this point  I was frustrated I told her charge me whatever I just wanted to get out of this terrible experience. She then at the cash register gives me some bs about how we would have known right away if it was bad and know she's charging us for one person 20 dollars. I payed while letting her know she was losing a customer. She didn't care. If you want eat at a restaurant who values you as a guest definitely do not eat here. You shouldn't anyways the food sucks."}
{"text":"I got a little nervous walking in when I felt like I was walking into a Claim Jumper.  I asked our hostess if this used to be a CJ and she said yes at the exact same instant the question became irrelevant - I saw the 'deer antler chandelier' that is classic CJ.  This place took over the restaurant and did ZERO to change the interior.  Uh oh....  I took the kids up to the buffet and after the first pass things got better.  They were in heaven.   Fresh fruit, noodles, many kinds of shrimp, miso, tempura, hibachi, mandarin chicken.  They can be picky eaters but we fully content.  As for me, I tried a bit of everything.  The crab legs were small and unsatisfying, but the warm bar was good, hibachi was good, but my favorite was the sushi.  They mostly have rolls but they were all good.  They even have a bottle of spicy mayo that you can add to you plate.    Unique pricing for kids....$.90 cents a year under twelve.  Very reasonable.  Overall we were impressed and satisfied.  Giving it 4 stars now because sometimes when your expectations are low you don't get the real picture until you visit again.  So we'll try it again."}
{"text":"The Korean beef steak thing and their sushi is good. It's a hit or a miss though, I think the price is slightly high for the amount of food choices and  quality."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we really enjoyed it!  We got there around 11:15 and I think we were the first guests of the day but it started to get busy by the time we were finished around 12:00. As a big sushi fan who knows better than to eat anything else until I've had enough, I really liked how the buffet was laid out: You can start at one end with the sushi and tempura, and then work your way down the line to the cooked seafood and meat dishes. Everything we put on our plates was excellent.and well prepared. Our server Pricilla was fast and friendly - it seemed like every time we left the table to visit the buffet we would return to find our drinks refilled.  If I was required to say something negative about it, it would be that the buffet selection was a little overwhelming - there is no way I could possibly sample everything in a single visit. As stated in other reviews, the ambiance is a little weird for enjoying sushi because it used to be a Claim Jumper - but who cares?!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 20 people on a Saturday night. Excellent service, the waitress was extra patient, on top of refilling our drinks, and clearing out dishes. There was a great selection of seafood, grilled meat, sushi, veggies, and dessert! They constantly brought out crab legs, oysters, and crawfish. I thought the sushi was good (there was a sushi chef putting out fresh rolls). If you like udon then definitely order one from the back. My family had a great time and will definitely return for another family dinner."}
{"text":"Nice selection. Good sushi. Very impressive. This was our first time and we definitely plan to come back."}
{"text":"I visited Jasmine Tokyo during my vacation in Arizona. There is not much to say about this place, but that it was good, very Good! Ive live in Miami and have never been impressed by a buffet like I was with this one. Everything was so fresh amd authentic from the noodles to the Sushi. I appreciated that there was real food instead of the usually fried food galore usually found in Chinese Buffets. Clean and welcoming enviroment  They even have a unique station to prepare fresh soups"}
{"text":"The best Asian food buffet I've ever had here in Arizona. Amazing fresh quality and preparation. . So much to choose from. My boyfriend and I really love this place. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I love this place and you can't ask for more for the lunch price. I love their dinner also but it's not worth twice the price. I love this place and regiment their lunch."}
{"text":"I like this place in that it has a large selection of dishes.  The stars of the buffet are prime rib, shrimp cocktail, sushi, oysters and crab legs - all pretty fresh.  It's about $22 per person and worth checking out.  Across the street is a krispy kreme.  Bonus!"}
{"text":"It's okay. Could be better. Went during dinner and food is a little on the cold side. Is over $50 for two people. For this price I would recommend going to a Restaurant instead. They do have prime rib and crab legs but the quality is sub par. If it were cheaper if say go for it."}
{"text":"We came thanks to the good reviews on yelp and are very glad we did. This is going to be our go-to place for Chinese buffet.  The selection of sushi was wonderful! And everything we had tasted fresh.  The pepper steak and Chinese ribs were tender as can be.   And the server was quick to refill our drinks. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This most recent visit was extremely disapponting. Got there around d 7:50 on a Friday evening.....the food was old looking and sparsely displayed......very unappealing. They were willing to make more food when asked but it was lukewarm. The price is expensive for quality that is no better th your average Chinese buffet.."}
{"text":"For ~$12, we had a good food in a nice environment with the variety of food choices. The desserts also were great."}
{"text":"Great selection of food , you get what you pay for .  I enjoyed the sushi , didn't try the other things . Overall happy and cheap !  Very big place , ideal for large groups or when alone . They have some wine , but don't Spend your money on it , had the Merlot , was not worth the 20 bucks :D   Friendly staff , check out the voucher for a 20 dollar discount"}
{"text":"One of the better Asian Buffets in town. I remember when this building was a Bobby McGee's back in the early 90's. Looks a little different and like others have said it was probably a Claim Jumpers as well.  Inside still has that old timey western kind of feel with deer antlers hanging on the wall and ceiling fans that appear to be powered by belts and pulleys. The music being played and the decorations are a bit confusing. Makes it feel more like a nice hotel buffet without the scent of an indoor pool nearby.  Giant selection of all types of food including a ton of dessert items. I like the way they use white oval plates in the serving area. It really makes the food pop. Sure beats the typical stainless steel bins that most of the other places use.  I really enjoyed the large selection of seafood dishes. Some of my favorites were the Walnut Shrimp, the Calamari on crispy noodles, several other interesting seafloor critters, and the really cool Sushi area off to the front of the restaurant. They also have a lot of the regular things that you would expect at that Panda dudes chain.  This is the kind of place that you just need to find the things you like and not expect to enjoy everything. Some of the meats or proteins seemed a little more chewy than I prefer. Best part is you can just choose not to eat it and go back for something else.  Don't forget to CHECK IN on Yelp and you will get 20% off your entire bill. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Best Asian Buffet I have found . Excellent sushi, crab legs, prime rib ... And a good choice of fruits and veggie options if your not a carnivore like myself"}
{"text":"One of the most impressive non-Vegas buffets I've been to. So many choices and great food!"}
{"text":"The worst food and worst service ever! We've been here a few times, it used to be better a few years ago, but now, absolutely Terrible! Food selection is so bad and quality is the worst! Not worth any money, and they charge more than any other Buffet I know! $22 a person!!!! Way too much for terrible food and horrible service! Don't make the mistake of going there!!! The worst!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to go to an Asian buffet that was affordable, tasty, and close to home. We found this place and we were EXTRA excited that they have an all you can eat sushi bar to!!' So we went in and tried it and we were not disappointed at all! The ambience as previous reviewers have said is a little different because it used to be a claim jumper but we found it a little more intimate than most buffets. We didn't feel like we were eating in some mess hall, we sat in a booth and felt like we were on a date which was very nice. The food was pretty good, we LOVE the sushi!!! We have gone here a few times and we are always happy with our visit. We go during lunch and, including a very big tip, we spend $30 total which, I feel, is a pretty decent price for what we are getting. The only thing I wish would change is the food variety. I like to to go Asian buffets and try new things and I'm running out of new things to try lol."}
{"text":"For these Sushi/Chinese buffets, I rate according to the variety, how often they replenish the food, and the price. They do have a good variety of nigiri including tuna, salmon, yellow tail, shrimp and many different rolls. So very good on the variety. I went at about 1:30pm for lunch and there were only a few salmon and tuna nigiri left and they never replenished them over the next hour. See the pictures for the different type of rolls.  The Chinese food was OK but less variety than Pacific Seafood Buffet (both) or Jogoya in Chandler."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I don't think it's worth full price but look online for some coupons or use the yelp check in that saves about $5/person.  At that rate, it's a little more expensive than Pacific buffet and comparable in quality. The place looks more upscale than the average Asian buffet and dishes ranged from bleh to great. Oysters were a little scary and tasted like dirty pond. I made my money's worth on lobster pieces, hot crab legs and crawfish. The sushi selection is better than Pacific but by no means great. The only dessert worth getting is the ice cream/gelato.  All the other options seem bought from elsewhere."}
{"text":"It has been two and half years  since I was last there. The selection was less there were several selections that were out. There was no duck. The fried rice had no meet. There was only one choice of noodles.the service was slow and they only came by once in an hour.  Several of the dishes were sitting for one hour on the place was overcooked.    The place was more like a 9.00 buffet.  The noodles we did have was not gre but did not have any flavor.  I tried to get ice cream but the line was too long"}
{"text":"This place is very interesting...  The food is alright. Lets talk about service first since that puts your mood into eating.   You pretty much a get that simple greeting and the hostess seated us right away. Our waitress (don't know her name) was eh... she was alright. She seemed really tired but come on....... I had to keep reminding her to get us our drinks. I needed water many times and I had to constantly remind her. She wasn't very attentive..   The food was alright. I first got some oysters and that was it... I didn't see them again until I'm done eating!!!Seriously?? They need to put out more oysters or anything in general if it's out. The sashimi tasted alright.. I didn't taste so fresh... :/ as for the cooked food allot of them tasted really old like its been out for a long time! Some food literally I had to spit it out... Anyways, for the price I payed... The food, I expect it to be allot better since they have a very large sushi area.. Kinda disappointed... I would come back again... maybe..not...."}
{"text":"Went there 5 years ago. Food was very fresh. Now the turnover is. It as quick. The selection  has been cut by about 30 %. Their Japanese food seems to be better than the chinese.  Their fried rice and chow me in were over cooked. Everything  was average. Price is 15 for lunch on the weekend 22 for dinner"}
{"text":"The first impression is the entrance knocking you down with above average volume hip hop...after that it gets much better!   12 bucks seemed a tad high, but staple buffet items are quite good and a Mongolian grill selection meets the price.  The standards of sesame chicken, orange chk, fried rice, veg spring rolls were all fresh and tasty.   Fairly large selection of sushi but for me any sushi prepared an unknown time ago is suspect so I passed.  With tea & tip, the lunch tab comes to $16.  The bar area had a flat screen or two and the happy hour drink specials were attractive.  A needed option in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"4 stars for what it is a Pan Asian Buffet - nothing more, nothing less.  Unfortunately, I have had my share of bad chinese buffets.  Even more unfortunate is that I typically overeat at them.  That is the risk of a buffet.  Here at Jasmine, the reward is worth the risk.  This place has several things going for it:  1. it is laid out nicely and has a warmer, less institutional feel to it.  I didn't feel dirty after having been there. 2.  There is a wide selection of items from many asian cuisines.  Kim Chi, sushi, dim sum, stir fry, twainese, thai, currie etc.  they are all represented. 3.  I thought the sushi was a nice mix of veggie only, fish, california rolls, even some hot rolls and tempura.   4. Wide selection of dessert options (though I typically pass on those) 5. many nice cold dishes/ salads. 6. for quality and selection I found the price to be reasaonable.  Is it priced to compete with the $6.99 special down the street, no, but there are reasons to pay more.  I have been five times now and will make it a regular stop for my asian cuisine loving family.    After five visits I have a new comment, curtesy of my brother's visit there with me recently.  There is no real taste challenge here.  Nothing that excites the taste buds.  everything is buffet safe.  Maybe this is a call to spice things up a bit.  Still four stars for what it is."}
{"text":"Visited the happy hour during the middle of the week. I think I'll have to go back and actually try the buffet to be able to give a full review of this place, but here's a review from the happy hour perspective:   We simply wanted after work drinks and sushi, however, the restaurant did not make it very clear how the buffet area and the bar area were designated to serve differently. The host also was unaware as to what was half-priced and what was not, he was probably new so it's not a big deal.    You can tell they've changed very little from the previous Claim Jumper decor, \"those elk horns must be from a Japanese elk,\" and the space just feels too massive for this type of restaurant. Our waiter did great, was comfortable to talk with, but did not seem to know everything about the menu when we tried asking questions. Most of these issues were not deal breakers at all.   The food definitely tasted above average. The spicy tuna roll and the dynamite roll were our favorites. The sushi was fresh was enough to satisfy. The prices were very good as we were able to get 5 rolls and two drinks for under $30.   If you're looking for a trendy ambiance and a mind-blowing dining experience, this isn't the place for you. But if you're looking for good food at a good price, Jasmine Tokyo's happy hour deserves a visit."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and they offer lots of variety from sushi, fried goodies, vegetables and stir-fry dishes. The dessert menu are great too. I would come back if i am in the area."}
{"text":"Jazmin Tokyo is the best asian buffet in Az, everything is so tasty, the sushi is amazing!! The gelato is pretty damn good too"}
{"text":"They have some of the best sushi I Town. They have a large assortment of Japanese food. So bring your family for a great time."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill the last few years. I don't know if there's a new family running it, but everything from the food to the service has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Very good service. Very good, quality food for a buffet. Even the fish and hot food dishes were excellent. Decor is interesting; my family told me it used to be Claim Jumper.  Sushi was so-so"}
{"text":"The buffet isn't fresh!!! They store uncooked/cooked foods together and when food isn't sold for the day they store it for the following day. The owner works kitchen because he doesn't want anyone noticing the horrible conditions. I used to eat here and knowledge is from state visit from health department and employee."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! Went for dinner, and everything was delicious. Sushi was fresh (I loved the Scottsdale roll), and there were a lot of seafood options. I especially enjoyed the Thai calamari, the walnut shrimp and dim sum. My companion had a ton of crab legs and oysters, both of which he said were very good. Large dessert selection, although we were so full that we didn't try anything. Service was very friendly, and I liked that they had people wandering around keeping the counters clean and checking the temperature of the food. I also thought the $20 price was very fair, considering the amount of crab legs, oysters, sushi, and shrimp that we ate. Buffets are sometimes scary to me, but this place was very clean and made me feel very comfortable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good with the 20 percent coupon  Offered on yelp.  Otherwise it's kind of expensive"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Wonderful selection of everything from Sushi and Sashimi to cooked dishes, salads, a carving board and an amazing selection of desserts.  We had a leisurely dinner and enjoyed every single offering on the buffet.  A real winner!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I've been beaten into submission. Yes, you can enjoy a wonderful dining experience in a restaurant that serves only buffet.  Jasmine Tokyo is that place!  Our merry little group included ring leader, buffet master extraordinaire Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C and myself.  As noted elsewhere, Jasmine Tokyo is located in the old Claim Jumpers space, near the corner of 70th Street on Shea.    Both the exterior and interior hasn't changed that much either.  The only difference you'll notice are the huge buffet stations that run down the middle of the restaurant.  On the right side, as you come in, they've re-positioned the bar to the back and added a huge sushi station. I have posted a zillion pictures online.  The food was extraordinary.  It wouldn't have been better, if it was prepared individually in the back.  Everything was fresh and served in smaller, more manageable portions.  This is one of those restaurants (buffets) where you can only take a small amount of food on you plate, because you want the opportunity to try everything.  According to Rand, they have nearly 130 different choices, including eight different gourmet ice creams.  The ice cream by the way, is the only food item that is served to you upon request.  My bill was $11.99 before taxes, less a \"20% Yelp Discount\" that came to $10.66 including taxes, but before tip,  Our server Mirian F was outstanding and always there refilling our glasses or cleaning our table.  Very nice.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Our waiter was incredibly attentive and even put my sons soda in a to go cup when we were leaving since he hadn't finished it.  The food was just ok. I didn't find the selection of hot prepared items to be all that big. There is a large salad bar, some prepared hot items, soup, a carving station, sushi, and the dessert. There was nothing that I thought was amazing but I also didn't try anything that was horrible. We are not sushi eaters so there is just no way to justify the price of this place for us. $76 for 3 for dinner is just too much for a Chinese buffet. Thankfully I found an online coupon to bring it down to $67.00 but even that was too much.  I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"if you live near chandler the best chinese buffet is the PEONY GARDEN BUFFET on chandler blvd a few dollars less. it is better than anyone we have gone to when we lived in new york and newjersey  for dinner or lunch. if in scottsdale jasmine's is the second best buffet. they need to update and clean up the restaurant to make it more appealing. with that said if i didn't have my first choice i would enjoy this restaurant buffet a drop less but i do enjoy the quality but less choices than the hong kong buffet. these are the only 2 chinese buffets i would go to. the other are yucky every dish tastes the same like they dump the same sauce on everything but the kitchen sink. hong kong buffet ask for the dinner and lunch card to earn free meals. jasmine's you need to search goggle for a 10% off coupon."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  You can get just about anything Asian, Chineese, Japanees, etc.  All good at a very good price."}
{"text":"Tried them with a  large group in attendance.  Very good buffet with nice selection of hot and cold dishes.  Sushi, tempura, Mongolian grill, salads  and desserts. Much better than many other buffets we have tried. Recommended for lunch."}
{"text":"What the heck have I been eating??!  This is hands down the best Chinese buffet in the Phoenix area, hands down!  First off this is by far the best sushi spread I've ever seen - including the buffets in Vegas!  Pretty much what you'd get at Stingray is included in the buffet - and we went to the lunch buffet so its not even just for dinner.  They had numerous rolls and unlike other places they don't try to cram a bunch of rice into them.  They also had 4 different nigiri selections and some tempura in this area.  Just this part of the buffet alone is worth the money!  The chinese food is actually legit too!  They weren't very oily or too salty and they aren't stingy with mystery meat - the quality of the meat is much better than other buffets.  They're also very good about refilling the selections.    The dessert was probably the most disappointing.  We didn't try the ice cream - though I really like the fact that its not a community system and there's someone actually serving you the scoops (WAY less gross!).  We had some fruit - strawberries were great and gigantic.  The German chocolate cake was weird and dried out.  Not only was it crusty, the flavor was kind of weird and it was very dense..  The cream puffs were also disappointing because the filling was whipped cream and not very much of it.    Speaking of stuffings - they had real crab rangoons with lots of cream cheese and some green onions and crab parts mixed into it to make the filling!  I thought nobody did it right anymore!  Despite the very few disappointments - this is still by far the best buffet in the Phoenix area.  This buffet makes Stingray pretty obsolete - for about the same price we can stuff ourselves with the same food and more!"}
{"text":"If this place had wi-fi I would gladly bring a laptop and camp out here all day while grazing on delicious food and bottomless mimosas. But they would probably frown upon that. Seeing as how this place opened up accross the street from my house recently, I'll have to settle for frequent visits and slowly getting fat over time."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience.  I can't blame the restaurant for me feeling too full when I left.  The setting is a bit peculiar.  The restaurant has not been updated since Claim Jumper was there, so it is not your typical Chinese Buffet.  Drinks are not included in the expensive price.    Tucked in the corner by the sushi is quite possible the best tempura broccoli I have had,  The sushi is pretty decent.  Tried some sashimi salmon and it tasted fresh, but the most of the sushi is covered in mayonnaise based sauces which I do not like as much.  The second trip was egg drop, but no wontons.  The soup was not hot and was not my favorite.     My third course was crap legs.  They were extremely tasty, but the were very flaky and a bit more difficult to remove from the shell.  Next was the mongolian bbq which was excellent.  That's probably where I should have stopped but I grabbed the prime rib as well which was game over.  Overall this place has very tasty food."}
{"text":"I was treated by one of my clients (found out later she goes there for lunch- I went at dinner time) who loves this Buffet & I did see some Asians eating here:  service was prompt, efficient & sweet. Nice that there was a 10% yelp check-in offer.  I'm normally not a Buffet eater as I my mom would attest to (saying I don't eat enough to make it worthwhile lol) because I generally like my food freshly prepared & piping hot or cold.   The fruit & salad areas were fresh. Some of the hot foods: like broccoli/beef, walnut shrimp, sausage & ribs at hot bar was good.  Udon or Soba noodle soup was made fresh & cooks was kind enough to bring it over to us because we already checked on it once but then forgot when eating. Sushi was so-so. Lots of varieties but mostly average tasting (wasn't bad but wasn't the best I've tasted) food.  Ambience was clean & nice because they integrated the old Claim Jumper decor with Asian influences. I like it when someone UPCYCLES.   Would I go again? Yes for lunch (since it's more reasonable-cheaper) if I'm in area but not for dinner as first choice because for the price though I can eat at W. H. Buffett for less on weekdays for far tastier food."}
{"text":"This is a very nice Asian emphasis buffet with a wide variety of excellent food from Asian dishes, chicken wings, pot stickers, edamame, a very wide variety of sushi, food selected for individual grilling, prime rib on the dinner menu, excellent and extensive salad selection, and a huge selection of deserts. We have eaten here several times and always enjoy both the lunches and dinners. Nicely done Jasmine Tokyo."}
{"text":"14.99$ for lunch was a great deal. There were many sides to choose from including kung pao chicken, walnut shrimp, chow mein, vegetables, etc. The more choices, the better! However, the sushi wasn't great, but that's to be expected at a buffet. The desserts were meh; stay away from the carrot cake, cream puffs, and mango mousse. But the cheesecake was good! Our server was sweet and helpful. Definitely check in to get a discount! If I'm back in town, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"My kids always request going here. They love the sweets. However last week my parents treated our whole family for my kids birthdays and my father and husband got bad food poisoning. Both were up all night with horrible symptoms, (I won't go into the gory details) and it took two days for full recovery. Buffets are always dicey but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Got a good meal for lunch, returned for dinner, but doesn't worth the $10 difference if the quality of the seafood not being improved for dinners. The flesh of the lobster pieces were \"black\" color! Crab legs were skinny and bland. I was very excited to try the dinner before going, but now I am afraid to go back or recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets but my sister wanted us all to go out to eat, so I thought I would try it out. The selection was ok, they don't make HUGE plates for the masses, more like smaller ones which means fresh food and often. I liked the place, nice selection and clean. The only thing I did not like was the price, $15 for lunch."}
{"text":"Really good food. Tons of options for everyone. Waiting staff is nice and refills your drinks fast as well as clears the tables. There is a very selection of sushi  at tadt great and is fresh. They have tones of different styles of foods across Asia for you to try. The mango cake and mouse are delicious.    We went on a Friday night ANC Thad cost per adult paws $21.99"}
{"text":"I can't believe they closed, it's very sad...hopefully they just relocated, our experience as family was always nice, I loved that we can always use the extra discount, the food was fresh, they offered good variety of choices, and the owners and staff were always friendly and attentive. Wishing you Good luck in any future project."}
{"text":"By far the best buffet I have ever eaten at. Quality food, excellent service, all food was fresh and it was very clean. I will definitely be back! A+"}
{"text":"It was much nicer than I anticipated. Tons of selection, even with sushi! They had everything- and the food portion and presentation was perfect. It's an amazing value for what you get.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant- I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"My family have been eating at This buffet since it opened,and today will be the last time for us, it has become a below average Chinese buffet,the sushi was at least a day old,all of the food was barly warm and also seemed like leftovers from the day before. The crawfish was terrible,and both Wife and i said \"hope I dont get sick from the warm oysters, the young manager was wearing a flat brimmed baseball cap,when he came to the table. This place has changed hands within the last three years,and should be straightened out before it goes the way of others of the same nature,and no crab legs on a sunday mid -afternoon? On the hunt again for a good quality Seafood buffet,Phx/Sctsdale area. Sorry to see this one ruined."}
{"text":"Hi: I'm back again @ sushi is fresh even better for knowing lunch is only 12 bucks! Lots of extras on the grill extras on fish cold salads, and many items from china, Korea, and all of Asia! Bring an empty tummy for all the fun foods here. Judy my lunch waitress is smiling and always very awesome so ask for her tables! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"one of my most visited restaurants in Phoenix area. Delicate food and nice environment. always have coupons."}
{"text":"I suppose if you aren't used to all you can eat buffets the thought of this is foreign and might not be appealing. However, I have been to many buffets and this one was clean, friendly, well stocked and delicious! The typical orang from chicken, shrimp dish, soups, and Chinese buffet was here PLUS SUSHI! It's about grocery store quality (don't go just for sushi) but it's a great addition to the place! We will be back for sure! We went on a week day during lunch and the price was fair for two people. Not sure about dinner."}
{"text":"Opening day, this was probably the best all-you-can-eat sushi buffet in scottsdale area. But after awhile, the quality went down. Now, the quality of sushi you get here is no different then most buffets. For 15 dollars though, I think its still a decent deal for decent sushi."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service ever!! Although only about 5 customers there, we had to walk around and track down our \"server\" 3x! Even better... We asked if we could take the bones from our ribs home for our five Rescue dogs. Server said OK, we wrapped them in napkins. Leaving the restaurant, the \"manager\" starts yelling \"you can't take those with you!!\" Even though we showed her they were only bones, & that our long-lost server said it was fine, she kept ranting that she would charge us $4.99 per pound for the bones! Hard to believe, huh??? But, who on earth could make this up?! So folks, if you want to go someplace to be humiliated, lied to, and made to feel totally insignificant, this is the place for you...I know we never will return, & will certainly warn others!"}
{"text":"This place is something amazing. Thank you yet again Yelp.  We ended up parking on the west side of the building and found that finding the entrance was really confusing. There are little signs indicating the entrance, but you end up walking into a dining area and, eventually, a second section of the dining area before haphazardly making your way to the front of the restaurant. Take my advice and park on the other side of the building.  Once inside, I realize that this place is massive. It looks like it may have been an old Shakey's pizza or some sort of family styled Italian restaurant. It has been a couple of Japanese inspired artworks drawn up on the wall, but it doesn't has the feel of really being Japanese restaurant.  But the space is really nice. The majority of seats available are booth style, which is wonderful. You get the sense of being in a private space without other diners crowding into your conversation.  Now for the reason why you're reading this review: the food.  There were two of us. With one buffet each and a glass of wine each and adding the gratuity, the tab came out to nearly $70.  Why? Because the variety is absolutely amazing and the food is wonderfully fresh.  Have you ever been to an Asian style buffet and saw that the rice was gorgeous -- all shiny and plump -- only to bite into it and nearly cut your tongue in half?  Not this place.  The sushi was being replenished regularly. Everything will time it went to the bar, the sushi chef was making new batches. The nigiri was near perfection. Not cut properly, but the pieces of fish were all wonderful. Each had amazing flavor and depth. And I was surprised to find that they not only had wide assortment of rolls, but also sashimi and mackerel.  I also tried a number of other items that I absolutely loved: the calamari, the broccoli with seafood, the prawns and the duck, served with no bones.  What a glorious place. I hope I'm able to visit again."}
{"text":"Food and selection was great. The service also was nice and the price awesome.  I will be back with my family. Great place to gather:-)"}
{"text":"Go for lunch on any given day rather than dinner. $21.99 compared to $11.99 isn't worth the prime rib and crab legs that distinguish dinner from lunch. Same sushi, entrees and desserts available for lunch as are for dinner.   Anyways, this place seriously is AMAZING. My boyfriend and I decided to go and look at Jasmine Tokyo as a last resort option, as many of our favorite sushi joints were closed from the 2-5ish times. We didn't expect to be impressed, so we decided just to take a look at the food and then see if we wanted to eat.   Upon walking in, we were politely greeted by what seemed to be the owner, and she didn't seem to mind us looking around before we made the commitment to eat there. The place used to be a Claim Jumper, and the owners/remodelers of Jasmine Tokyo either didn't care to hide that fact or didn't have the budget to, because the whole inside of the restaurant looks exactly like the Claim Jumper used to-- with the exception of the actual buffet areas (Giant antler chandeliers, same booths, pager return box outside). But the decor really doesn't take away from your experience at all, rather, it sort of makes it a funny topic to talk about during the meal. My boyfriend and I found ourselves laughing about it frequently.   When we first walked in, we gravitated DIRECTLY towards the sushi. That's what we wanted in the first place, so why not. It was beautifully presented, and looked delicious. We were in. We were seated, our drink orders were taken, and then we went to the buffet.   They had four types of nigiri sushi (salmon, red snapper, tuna, and another), a TON of fun rolls like crunch rolls, \"shaggy dog\" rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls. They had an interesting variety and some very creative things like a \"Scottsdale roll.\" They also had tempura vegetables, egg rolls, spring rolls, cream cheese crab puffs and pretty much everything you could think of when it comes to sushi. On our first visit, we didn't get a chance to try anything but the sushi, but, they have a ton of other Asian foods like chow mien, orange chicken, mushroom chicken, squid salad, and soups. They also have a salad bar, and an area for fresh fruit, but, really? Don't waste the room in your tummy at Jasmine Tokyo on Americanized salads and fruits. In about a month, we went there 4 times. We eventually got to taste about everything, and it was all really delicious. But if you're going to Jasmine Tokyo MAKE SURE TO GET THE SUSHI.   The service is pretty sub-par, but what can you really expect from a buffet. I don't really see the point in giving a decent tip at a buffet, let alone with poor service.   Overall, on a scale from 1-10   Sushi Quality- 9.5 (for Arizona)  Other Food Quality- 7.5  Dessert Quality 7 Service Quality- 5  Now that we've been to Jasmine Tokyo for LUNCH, we find that we can't reason to go anywhere else for sushi, because the for the price of one sushi roll at another sushi joint, you can get unlimited, great quality all you can eat sushi.   MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO GO HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Had reasonable expectations as I have been to many similar before.  Sadly I am disappointed.  The positive:  the ice cream is real and good with 6 choices.  The deserts are good too.  The hot food quality varies for nice baked salmon to half frozen oysters on half shell.  Shushi is average quality but fish sliced paper thin."}
{"text":"Went there at 12:30 because I was getting my tires replaced across the street. Every single thing was barely warm the heating plates are to thick I think so it doesn't keep anything hot. Not satisfied at all the waitress never asked how the food was either, probably because she knows! I won't be going back that's for sure, I leave everyone good reviews but this place needs some constructive criticism!"}
{"text":"A bit pricy for dinner but OMG it was good. Food was fresh and there was a great variety! The staff at the front as well as the wait staff was very attentive. Amazing! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not great. Won't be back. Bad service and just Ok food. Sushi was the best part. The Chinese all tasted the same and no noodles."}
{"text":"Good asian food selection, fresh fish, and desserts all for $15.  You really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch. The buffet has a lot of choices.  The service was great, a good 4 stars for that.  The food was ok. The sushi was more along the lines of 2 stars.  They had other things like orange chicken and udon that brought the final star rating to a 3 stars.  You will definitely leave with a full stomach.  I only would recommend this place if you are all about being stuffed for the money."}
{"text":"Wow! I've hit pretty much every buffet in AZ and this is hands down thee best yet! Clean, fresh, great service. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I was in town Feb 2014 and went here based on the yelp reviews. I have to say I was not disappointed. I went during lunch and found ample and very good selection of sushi rolls, very good hot food as well and great desserts and ice cream. The restaurant has nice atmosphere and the wait staff friendly and attentive. You couldn't beat the lunch price for what you get and the quality of the items. I was very happy I went."}
{"text":"Came in without knowing anything other than the Yelp rating and was pleasantly surprised.  At first, I thought I made a mistake when I realized it's an AYCE fusion buffet. I decided to give it a try since the ambiance and service was not at all what you would get at AYCE places.  I stuck with sushi, since that's all I was in the mood for. The fish was fresh. My only criticisms are that rolls aren't prepared upon order, which would make them even fresher but would defeat the business model, and that you won't find the selection you would at a mainstream sushi bar.  My four star rating is based on the pleasant surprise, decent sushi and nice service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I walked in and said to myself, this place looks familiar.  After looking around I knew I had been there a while ago.  Logged on and saw my review from 2012...5 stars!!  I was flabbergasted.  The sushi was not good.  As someone else had pointed out, if you go when it's not busy, I would agree that you are going to get old food.    The sushi seemed like if you had went out for sushi and took the rest home with you and then  tried to eat it a couple days later, it's what it would be - rice beginning to get hard, aesthetics have changed, etc.  The presentation on the plates was not good at all.  It just looks sloppy and not very presentable.  I didn't get sick, so that was good.    The crab legs were okay.  Asparagus tasted pretty good.  Butter pecan decent to okay.  The review would have been barely a 2 until the check came which was 46 dollars for 2 people, straight up buffet.  That drops it definitely to a 1.  When I told the guy at the front of the poor quality of the sushi, long story short he couldn't have cared less. Considering we could have went to sushi-holic instead and paid just under that for as much as I ate for really awesome sushi, I was quite annoyed.  Anyone who says this place is \"TOP QUALITY\", I have to look at as a suspect review from an owner or something, especially when the person has a low number of views (3).   Save your money and time and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"For sure Jasmine Tokyo is an above average Asian Buffet. After sampling a variety of offerings you can have a very good experience if you zero in on the dishes you like. The high lights for me were the spicy salmon rolls because they weren't the mayo upped kind you get at the budget places. The spicy fish on watermelon chunks was really awesome. I would have preferred the sushi to be smaller in size or with less rice but still the sushi was above average. I liked the great selection of fresh vegetables. The entrée I liked the most was the tofu stir fry with bok choy.  I was very pleased in general but since it's a buffet it can't be five stars in my opinion because proteins that I tried were a little chewy or overcooked but still much better than your average Asian Buffet.  I'd go back.  I think the dinner price was $21.99"}
{"text":"This is the best Asian buffet I have been to and it is one of the best buffets period. The sushi was fresh and appealing. The vegetables were cooked to perfection. I wanted to try everything, but there was too much to choose from.The $22 price seemed a little steep, but the quality made up for it. We did not even have the crab or prime rib which is a dinner only item. I will return, but for lunch most likely. With the Yelp check in, I received a 20% discount."}
{"text":"Wowzas, I'm impressed!  Like many other reviewers, I am not a fan of buffets, but when my family decided to meet up here for my Uncle's farewell departure, I sucked it up and tried out Jasmine Tokyo.   First of all, I love the fact that they kept the layout, with the tables, booths, and bar area the same. Second of all, they have sushi that is constantly being visabily made and set out! Win! Some of the rolls include: rainbow roll, caterpillar roll, fried jalapeño roll, a boring California roll, two other deep fried delicious looking rolls, and a few other maki rolls. They also have sashimi (tuna, shrimp, yellowtail, squid)! Aside from sushi, they have a Mongolian stir fry station, prime rib, Crab legs, salads, and tons of deserts, including gelato!   I would definetly come back!"}
{"text":"A great place to experiment if you are not familiar with sushi. The sushi here is tasty and fresh. Each one is unique in flavor. There is als Chinese dishes, several soups, stir fried food, and steamed vegetables like book choy, my favorite.   Everything is so good and excellent service. Don't forget to save room for dessert, there are many including ice cream."}
{"text":"The reviews I read here on Yelp pretty much sum up our own experience. It's a definite cut above most Asian-themed buffets. I've had better, but more often I've had worse. I tried 4 of the sushi varieties and they all were fresh and delicious (perhaps it helped that we came just 10 minutes after they opened). The hot entrees were hot, and there was a fairly diverse, large selection of items. The $12 lunch price seems pretty fair for what they offer, particularly in comparison to some Todai's buffets we've had in the past. (Admittedly Todai's has an even larger, more diverse selection, but it's also considerably more expensive and more hit-and-miss.) As my rating shows, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I grew up with Chinese buffet food and for most of my life avoided it.     However, I found Pacific Seafood (I tired it mainly because it was close to work) and realized Chinese buffets don't have to well ... be Chinese buffets.   And now Jasmine Tokyo joins Pacific Seafood as the only .. well, two buffets I will gladly dine.  They have a generous selection of sushi and dessert.     My favorite dishes were the ribs, coconut shrimp, and the sushi.  It doesn't look like an Asian restaurant with bright florescent lighting.    It feels more classy.   Another reviewer said it was an old Claim Jumper.  Website lacking a lot of info, so I'll give some info here.   At the entrance they had a sign that explained they charged 70 cents per year for a child less than 12.  (so a 10 year would be $7) but later explained the sign was wrong and it was actually 90 cents.  They also offer 10% off for Seniors.   I went to lunch and it was $14.99 per adult.  The service was wonderful.  Our cups never got empty.  I really like the place, and would consider giving it a 5 star.  But I'm tight with offering 5 stars until at least I have a sequel visit which I plan to in the near future."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place isn't busier. The prices are great for Scottsdale. The drinks are cheap for Scottsdale, the buffet is huge. The food tastes great every time I go there. I just wish they opened the bar on the weekdays. We need to get the word out about this gem. Places like this needs to stay open!"}
{"text":"Very nice buffet but waaaaay overpriced. $15 for lunch and $20 for dinner per person for a buffet. Are you kidding me? If their going to charge that much they need to have some good coupons out there otherwise I predict they won't be around for more than a year. Remember TODAI at the Biltmore, they lasted about a year. Expensive asian buffets don't work in Arizona. They need to lower prices or they won't last. Sorry..."}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi as well as cooked food, about $23 for the buffet. I would go again if hola, ¿cuánto es? in the area."}
{"text":"This place has really declined in quality and selection of food.  It's no better than the $8 ghetto Chinese restaurants you find in the rough neighborhoods.  The food seemed to be left overs from lunch and the sushi was far from fresh. The desserts were sugar cookies, sams club sheet cake and ice cream.  It's not worth the money."}
{"text":"This buffet had a very large selection. Most dishes seemed to be lacking in flavor and quality. I would go again for this price. $12 lunch"}
{"text":"This place is garbage, empty buffet and what's left is not edible. How they can afford the rent, tells you they aren't spending money on food"}
{"text":"In the universe of Chinese buffets, the Jasmine Tokyo buffet is one of the best I have been to, and I have been to a lot of them, which makes it a \"5\".  In the universe of all Asian food it is a good solid \"4\".  The food is fresh, of good quality, there is plenty of seafood, and the spare-ribs were really good for a buffet.  Although I did not partake, the desserts looked good.  It is a bit more expensive than most buffets, but as with all things you get what you pay for and the value you receive at Jasmine Tokyo is very good.  I will be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Definitely, one of the better buffet restaurants here in town.  High quality ingredients, except for the crab which is your standard buffet type snow crab.  I loved the super white and salmon Sashimi.  Honey walnut prawns are on par with any of the higher end places.  I enjoyed the Korean Beef and the roasted duck.  I have not seen this dish elsewhere but  the shrimp salad with granny smith apples was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Let me summarize this in 1 word = clean.  This place is probably the shiniest eat all you can that serves around the valley and I have been to alot of them. Too many in fact. Here's some of their best foods.  1. Sushi ( huge selection ) try the scottsdale sushi 2. Mongolian beef ( just the right flavor ) 3. Sesame balls!!! (Nuff said) 4. Dessert ( try their mango ice cream) 5. Noodles not the pre cook."}
{"text":"decent sashimi here for a buffet.   was enjoyable, have been here many times so that's a good thing.   The price is appropriate.  I like the oyster, crab, mussel bar.  good seaweed salad, and the desserts are good.  It's a good place if you want to pig out or find a sensible low calorie meal too.  I will continue to repeat."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed at the selection of items for the price. The buffet costs $21.99 for adults, which is pretty pricey for an AZ buffet.  The restaurant is an old Claimjumper location with uncomfortable chairs. The sushi selection they had was pretty good and much better than the usual options at a Chinese buffet. There was sashimi, nigiri, and plenty of specialty rolls to choose from. Besides from the sushi, they only had about two rows of hot food to choose from. Pretty much the usual Chinese dishes that are offered at buffets. They also had crab legs and oysters (which my friend said was pretty good). So overall the food was OK, I was just expecting more for what I paid. I probably will not come back, I'll save my money for when I go to Vegas and want a real buffet."}
{"text":"I was taking a friend out for a belated Christmas lunch.  She wanted to go back there and to show me the restaurant.  I was so dissappointed in the food. Everything was cold and the soup, I was looking forward to, was bad(cold)  I am sure if the food was hot it would taste good but I will not go back to find out. Bonnie"}
{"text":"Not bad for a buffet but not a good sushi buffet. I have been to many sushi buffets across the country and this one is not on the top of the list. Could have had a better sushi selection since they advertised as a sushi buffet. They had mostly rolls instead of raw fish. The spicy tuna roll was spiced up with the wrong type of chile powder so it left an aftertaste.   The cooked food was Chinese and it was good especially the soups. This is more of a Chinese buffet with some sushi so the price was not worth it. The coupon made it better but not real happy.  Not sure I would go back for dinner, maybe for lunch because it is cheaper. At least then I will be prepared for a Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Food was a 3.5, service and ambience were a 5.  Selection was a 4.5. Awesome to get 20% off for logging in with Yelp!"}
{"text":"I think this may be is  the best buffet in Phoenix . Those Chinese foods are really good. Bit far away for people who in chandler ,Mesa, Glendale. But if you really loves buffet you differently have to try it out. Even just once."}
{"text":"The food was old and had been sitting out for far too long! Our party of 5 all spent the night with sore stomachs and in the bathroom. This is not sushi of good quality, even for the price. Please skip this buffet, trust me! I would hate for anyone to suffer the way we all are..."}
{"text":"Been there numerous times since they took over for Claim Jumper.  Like everyone else, it bears mentioning that as far as decor, they hung a few silk scrolls on the wall but it's still a Claim Jumper complete with hanging light fixtures made of antlers. This pl;ace is owned by the same guys who run Hong Kong Gourmet in Chandler and it shows.  While the sushi is normally very good, the hot food is usually excellent as well.  I say usually (and dropped to 3 stars) because there is a HUGE difference between weekends, when they are busy, and week days, when they are not.  Went last night (a Thursday) it was completely awful because everything was old.  They put plastic covers over the sushi telling you it isn't turning over.  The normally awesome BBQ ribs were leather.  I grabbed a piece of fried fish but passed on the tarter sauce.  It was in a single serving packet which was warm and had blown up like a balloon indicating something was overly active inside.  This morning my dining partner is reporting stomach issues.  Normally, this is one of the best chinese/sushi buffets around, but stick to the weekends."}
{"text":"Best buffet outside of Vegas. And reasonably priced. Nice variety of Asian food with excellent prime rib tossed in. Service very pleasant and attentive"}
{"text":"Food not hot enough.  Decent sushi bar.  Raw meat for Mongolian bar looked pretty unappetizing."}
{"text":"WOW Yelpers!!! Looking for a good sushi buffet?? Look no more!!!!  I once went to a sushi buffet in Vegas and was so disappointed. I thought that if Vegas could not get it right..no one else could. Well, I was wrong!!!  The variety of sushi is amazing!! They also have a station with typical Chinese dishes and a small hibachi area. The dessert selection was vast. They also have this mango ice cream (gelato type) that is amazing!! I ate lunch there until I was full...all for $12 per person. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive. This place is so worth it!! You must try it."}
{"text":"Biggest Asian Buffet I've seen in YEARS!  Food is above average for buffet food as well.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to take the team for lunch. My team consists of five hungry boys still in their early 30's and they eat a lot.  Looking around on yelp, I found this place and decided to try after reading some reviews. One of the reviewer was on my yelp list and I find his recommendation to be good. If he is recommending it, must be good as I am not a buffet person either.  Lunch buffet price was $11.99 per person. The buffet price doesn't include drinks.  They have fresh salad section, huge Chinese section, meat/seafood section, sushi section and desert section. Selection was so large, no way I get to try every food, I hovered around first to make some assessments on what to try first.  I tried some sushi, seafood, Chinese, salad, and finished with desert.  I think my favorite was Xiaolongbao from Chinese dim sum section. It was made well, I thought I could just eat that.  They also have Kimuchi, and their kkakdugi Kimuchi.  Their ice cream looked so yummy but I chose to try several of cakes. Can't pick my favorite as all were good.  Needless to say, I ate too much and had to skip my dinner that day.  My team enjoyed the food, I think we all left thinking we could use a nap after lunch.  I would like to come back again for some food I didn't get to try this time"}
{"text":"As far as Asian buffets go, I think this place is as good as it gets.  It's in an old Claim Jumper restaurant and except for the very large buffet stations, they've left pretty much everything as is.  It's comfortable seating and feels most upscale than most other buffet places.  The food is fresher; it's served on platters in smaller batches as opposed to dumping a huge pile of food into a stainless trough.  There is much more variety and the food is better quality!  Some of my favorites, the calamari - lightly breaded in a sweet sauce, the tempura - huge shrimps and veggies fried just right, the dishes with beef had nice cuts of meat, tender and not fatty/gristly, and the snow peas and green beans were slightly crispy and very tasty.  They also have a better than average selection of salads, sushi, fresh fruits and yummy desserts.  The custard was awesome and tasted just like creme brulee.  The service is also 5 stars, they were quick to remove our dirty plates and kept my iced tea and water filled without having to ask.   They also set extra napkins on the table and wet naps, without us having to ask!  As Rand H said, this is the Wandering Horse of Asian Buffets!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good place that is competitive with Pacific Seafood Buffet. The biggest difference is that Pacific has better Chinese food, and Jasmine Tokyo has better Japanese food. I think the place and the food is great though.  Coupons: http://www.valpak.com/coupons/printable/JASMINE-ASIAN-BUFFET/42895 https://www.doubletakeoffers.com/jasmine-tokyo  Or as of today 2/8, you can check in through Yelp and have the 20% off offer."}
{"text":"A good Chinese buffet is hard to find. One featuring all you can eat sushi is even harder. But Jasmine Tokyo nails it!  The place is very large and the food selection is filled with a huge variety of fresh and delicious Asian dishes. The sushi and sashimi selection is just as impressive.   Prices are reasonable given the quality and selection. Service is very attentive and friendly.   I highly recommend Jasmine Tokyo. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the size of the buffet and their selection, but unfortunately they don't have enough turnover to keep everything fresh.  Came here on a Friday night - HUGE place but maybe only a quarter full.  Lots of sushi to choose from but I'm pretty sure it's been sitting out since lunch.  Shriveled with crunchy rice ain't the way to go - and oh my that kim chi looked like it dried out yesterday.    On the plus side, the stuff that came out fresh was pretty good - i.e., they cranked out some Korean BBQ ribs fresh out the wok and and that was fine.  Beef and broccoli was pretty tasty, and the crawfish were nice and spicy (a bit rubbery from being out too long though).  All in an average experience.  Would have been 3 stars, but at $50 for two people I expect things to be a bit more fresh.  Oh well, a good buffet needs high turnover and they just don't have enough traffic to sustain such a huge spread.  Hope I don't get sick :)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent chinese and japonese food. Sushi bar is awesome, lots of variety."}
{"text":"Brought my parents and we were all very happy. Huge selection of food that is prepared well. My dad really liked the ribs he said best ribs at a buffet. There is a large sushi selection that was all very tasty. I would have to say that it's the best Asian buffet in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We went late- 8:30 on Saturday night- but were pleasantly surprised by the friendly welcome and the full array of hot buffet and sushi choices.  The buffet foods were tasty and fresh, the sushi was pretty and delicious (try the Shaggy Dog!!) and overall it was a good experience (and my hubby was pleasantly surprised that the Kirin was only $3.50). The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the odd decor . .  the Claim Jumper 'lodge' look together with random Asian accents just didn't work for us!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Best Chinese buffet ever. BEST SUSHI, best desserts, even 6 kinds of GELATO!!!!!!!!So beautifully laid out. No ref raf just coming to eat piles of crab legs. Clean, great service, just wonderful. We were just Amazed at this place!"}
{"text":"Check the rolls before eating them!  I was in Jasmine Tokyo last Friday (june 26, 2015) for their dinner service. i started my meal at the sushi area. The sashimi did not look fresh and the roll I ate had spoiled rice. I thought it was just the spicy mayo that tasted off. Even my wife immediately knew it was spoiled and did not touch her rolls.   That roll gave me the worst stomach flu ever!"}
{"text":"Finally a reasonably priced great buffet not inside a casino.. Awesome food.  Sashimi, raw oysters, Chinese food, desserts, etc..  Totally worth it with great attentive service..."}
{"text":"As my fiance kept pointing out, this place has no immersion or ambience. Aside from the sign and a few decorative asian trinkets here and there there is nothing to make this place feel like an \"asian buffet\". There are faux stone walls and a huge stone fireplace. The thing that got me though was the antler chandeliers...  Antler... Chandeliers... The music they played was 90's soft rock. We mentioned it to the server but she said that she had no control over the music choice. The buffett itself was way too expensive in my opinion. We went for dinner and it was 19.99 per person that with one ice tea each came to a bill of almost $80 for three people! And if you don't like seafood (as I do not) then your selections are rather limited. 75% of the buffett was seafood and sushi. The other 25% was everything else so I felt like my meal was not as varied as I would like. The food I did eat was good. You just got that really hard, dried out piece of something every once in a while. For the price my dad joked that they should offer cots in back to sleep it off before coming back for another round."}
{"text":"Since our former all-you-can-eat buffet was shut down (for various violations including some that you don't want to be associated with a food-place, like human trafficking, illegal residential activities in a non-residential space, a couple of health-code thingys) my lunch buddy and I were on the lookout for a new go-to eat-til-you-puke spot...here's where Jasmine Tokyo comes in. It's close to work. The food is pretty darned good. The service is excellent. And I hear that they put together a mean dinner-time buffet...and by \"hear\" I mean I went to it a couple of times and I enjoyed the change of scenery from the lunch time assortment.   Oh...and they have gelato. Today I had the salted caramel gelato and a scoop of banana chocolate something or other...YUMMY! There is a little something for everyone and the food is nice and fresh. The sushi is even pretty decent and they have a good variety of it.   Bonus: I had a check-in offer of 20% off the bill from a previous visit and you can't beat that with a chopstick."}
{"text":"One of the better Asian buffets I have been to.  Heightened by being in the company of Rand H, Robyn N, Norm R and Mike C.  This was stop one in my eating summer vacation from work.  Not one to eat sushi they had some deep fried items I actually liked.  Instead of the pretty common steam and refrigerated tables the platters are much smaller so the food is kept fresher.  A couple of items ran short but only for a minute or two.  They have several folks running around that know what needs to be done.  Really 4.5 stars but folks that know me know I seldom round up."}
{"text":"I really liked the food, we came around dinnertime so the food was super fresh! The staff was very friendly. And for the price you are getting a great deal!"}
{"text":"This use to be a Claim Jumper (all the decorations are still there).  So it was a weird feeling seeing an Asian buffet inside a Claim Jumper.  Either way, it is all about the food!  A lot of selection of sushi, sashimi, and rolls; seafood; cooked food; desserts; etc.  I am not a sushi fan, so I skipped that selection.  I tried a baked scallop and after the first bite I had to spit it out.  It was so salty and fishy (not so fresh kind of fishy).  Yikes!  So I stuck with COOKED foods.  The prime rib was ok, needs aus juice!  The bbq ribs was dry.  The rest of the \"normal\" asian cooked food was ok (orange chicken, S&S chicken, beef & broccoli, etc.).  The service was great (that is why 3-stars); Food alone gets only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. However, nearly all hot foods were lukewarm at best. At 6:00 p.m. Many stations were empty. Crab legs always needed refilling. There was p,entry of sushi, which was wrapped.  For $21:00 dollars much to expensive for what was offered. Deserts were good but rationed in small pieces. Chinese food needs to be hot. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place, only been here for lunch twice.  It's bright and very clean, plus the assortment and display of food is awesome.  Always quick to refill platters when they are low, and the wait staff removes dirty dishes from the table immediately.  It's a high end buffet and priced accordingly."}
{"text":"I don't know how many reviews I've written for Jasmine Tokyo. I keep updating my reviews because we keep coming back!   However many years they have been open is however long we've been going.   To tell you how great the staff there is and I hope they read my reviews, once my son and I went to eat, he was soooo tired, after he got his food, he basically fell asleep at the booth while I ate. The waitress was so kind, she did not charge me for him not eating his food. Then we went and ran errands and he was soooo upset that he didn't get to have lunch at his favorite restaurant, we had to go back there for dinner- and I don't remember what happened- it seems like with kids things unexpected can happen, they came to the rescue AGAIN!!!!  Not only is this restaurant my son's favorite restaurant, it's become my favorite too since the staff is so great.   We've been coming here to ear for many years- aside from the sushi, I really look forward to their vegetarian selections. I think this place is better than many of the salad bars out there. Not only do they have a great, fresh salad bar, they have over 20 selections of vegetarian dishes to choose from. All delicious and freshly made.   I love, LOVE, L.O.V.E. this place and I'm happy to write that each time we've been there, it's packed with happy customers!!!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Tempe on Monday, because of the 4 stars rating. Most of the dishes are cold; meat are dry.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on a whim - very impressed! I haven't had Japanese in a long time, let alone a Japanese buffet, so I was pretty excitement. No big disappointments here. They have a pretty good selection of sushi, all of which was very tasty, with all the fixings - soy, eel, and spicy mustard sauce available (all very good!). Can't say too much about the rest of the fish because I'm not a big fish-eater other than sushi, though my friends seemed to really like the crab legs and tempura.   Lots of different selections, very good meat - the prime rib was honestly probably some of THE BEST I've had in a very long time, maybe ever. It was medium-rare, just how I like it, and literally melted in my mouth. I know it's not very \"Japanese\" necessarily but it was probably my favorite thing there.  All the desserts were cute and most of them were very good. Our server was very attentive and kind, which made the experience even better. Plus, $21 per person for all-you-can-eat dinner isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets in the city.   Oysters Shrimp Crab Legs Prime Rib. Great Chinese buffet and phenominal sushi rolls.  A must try for all restaurant goers"}
{"text":"If you have been to some of the Asian buffets in AZ, and you've liked them, I'd say you must try Jasmine Tokyo.   I'm 6'4\" and I get \"Do you play for the Cardinals?\" a lot, so I'm sure that when the proprietors see me darken the door of their establishment they're all like \"ohsh*t.\" Fear not, lil Asian lady, for I am not a glutton. I'm here for the seafood and the sushi and some green tea.  As far as the sushi selection goes, it beats anything AYCE in the Valley that I've seen. There were at least 20 types of rolls and it wasn't just surimi crab and tempura, either. The tuna and salmon and snapper nigiri were really good, too.  If you have room for some fried rice, this one is delicious and so are the Chinese sausages and grilled chicken. Even the raw oysters were good, and that has never happened to me in AZ before.  Service was pleasant, and from the way it's decorated, I'm guessing this was once a Claim Jumper. Anyhow, it's a huge restaurant with a huge selection of items and if you're a vegetarian, you will be in heaven here with more vegetarian offerings than I've ever seen at a buffet.   Seaweed is a vegetable, isn't it?"}
{"text":"Monday lunch.  Couldn't fool me with  the redundant puny sushi rolls stuffed with the same miniscule ingredients.  Tempura batter tasteless and the shrimp not cleaned well within.  The last time we went was when they first opened, I guess they've managed to stay in business by serving lackluster food somehow.   I've never left a buffet on an empty belly until now.  I'm going to top off somewhere else."}
{"text":"We were hunting for a place to eat on Xmas.  We decided a buffet could be a good decision.  We got the last parking space near the restaurant.  There were other spots in the lot with a slight walk.  We were greeted and immediately seated.  Since it was Xmas, they were serving s special dinner all day long.  Plenty of assorted sushi to choose from as well as salmon, ahi and red snapper, and white fish sashimi.  The fish was fresh and good.  The shrimp and veggie tempera were a hit as well.  You will find edamame, raw oysters, seaweed, fried calamari, shrimp salad, seaweed salad, lima bean salad, sesame balls, tofu, fried flounder, baked scallop, fried calamari, Jasmine shrimp, long green beans, Polish sausage, snow peas, beef with broccoli, mushroom chicken, roast beef, shrimp tempura, Jell-O, mango cake, coconut, Mango, butter pecan, vanilla bean, chocolate, and green tea ice cream. Cheesecake, chocolate cake, coconut cookies, carrot cake, creampuffs, chocolate and tapioca pudding chocolate mousse, strawberry mousse, mocha mousse, pineapple pastry, German chocolate cake, fresh mussels, fresh shrimp, baked salmon, Korean style short bibs, miso soup egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, crayfish, sweet-and-sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, chicken wings, fried rice, chow mein, shrimp, seafood scampi, Tofu, flounder, clams, black pepper beef, orange chicken, pigs feet, cantaloupe, honeydew, oranges, pineapple, grapes, mixed green salad, jellyfish, Kim Chee, king crab legs and beverages.  A discount if you check in through Yelp or if you are a senior.  Bins were filled reasonably quickly.  One of the better buffets around. Clean environment and used dishes are taken away quickly."}
{"text":"Probably the best Asian buffet I've been to. Interior is great and the food is excellent. So excited to have this right by work for lunch!"}
{"text":"Unless I'm in Vegas, I don't do buffets. So you should take my 4 star review for a buffet like it's an 8 star review from someone who normally goes to buffets. Like I said, I don't do buffets outside of Vegas, but when another food obsessed friend who also doesn't eat at buffets begged and pleaded with me to check out Jasmine Tokyo, I knew something was up. I opened my Yelp app, read the many positive reviews, and saw they even had a Check-In offer for $5 off. Sold!  Jasmine Tokyo is located near Scottsdale Road and Shea, where the old Claim Jumper used to be. It's $20 for dinner and I believe $12 for lunch. The Asian calamari, walnut shrimp, stuffed shrimp, chicken skewers, and beef dishes were some of my favorites. They were all seriously awesome and I went back up to refill my plate at least twice. Also very good were the many varieties of sushi (they even offered sashimi!).   For desert they offered a variety of cakes, such as chocolate, german chocolate, cheesecake, and I think lemon. They also had vanilla, chocolate, and rice puddings. Cookies, fresh fruit, jello and more!  I chowed down at Jasmine Tokyo and I am looking forward to my next visit! I didn't get to try the crab legs, Mongolian stir fry, and some of the other beef and seafood options, but I feel I had my share and left very satisfied. Check it out, even if you are anti-buffet like me."}
{"text":"TONS of food.  Great selection.  I enjoy coming here (second visit).  First time through is a bit overwhelming; so much food to choose from!  I usually avoid the sushi at buffets, because, well, you never know.  The selection of other foods is really impressive, and they have won ton chips, which make me happy.  A bit pricey, but it's Scottsdale.  And SO MUCH FOOD.  I also don't suffer from my typical MSG-laden-buffet-food-intestinal crisis after eating here...so I guess that's a good sign?"}
{"text":"Great buffet! 2nd time that I have been here. We went for lunch on a Sunday and it was $14.99 with a lot of seafood items.   - Oysters fresh, cocktail shrimp were deveined - Sushi unremarkable, except the unagi nigiri was good - Great selection of soups. Duck soup & black chicken soup were delish - Stir fried crab, thai chili calamari, gyoza, honey walnut shrimp, broccoli beef, kielbasa, ribs were great - Clams had little bits of shell; give this a miss if you go - Vanilla bean and mango gelato - the best ice cream I've ever had at a buffet.  Wide selection of items. Pretty restaurant. Servers nice and friendly. I wouldn't come here just for the sushi, but it will satisfy anyone's buffet cravings."}
{"text":"This isn't your stereotypical dirty Chinese buffet place, that being said it was expensive (duh its in Scottsdale). The food was pretty good for a buffett with tons of crab legs, sushi, desserts, salad, and chinese food options. The buffett was huge and the place was elegant looking for a buffett. I've been to other chinese/japanese restaurants that I've liked better for less money. I would go there again, but only for a special occasion b/c it's expensive."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian buffets I have been to. It's a bit pricey but that's to be expected with the shear amount of choices they have. Not to mention the all you can eat sushi. I am not a huge fan of sushi but I have a friend who is who likes it quite a bit here. You could easily spend just as much if not more on sushi alone elsewhere and get a fraction of the amount at the same quality."}
{"text":"All I can say is amazing!!  Great atmosphere, great service, the food was amazing WOW"}
{"text":"I'm rating this as an Asian buffet -- there's no use comparing this place to a highly regarded sushi bar.  With that said, the sushi is decent.  The fish isn't spectacularly fresh, but it's tasty enough for me to eat in unlimited quantities.  :)  The selection is actually quite good, and I do see servers turning the dishes every so often to ensure that only hot food is displayed.  The restaurant is usually also pretty full, which helps with that turnover process.  Their tempura is crispy, their soups are just what I'd expect, and they have a good selection of Americanized Asian foods, including orange chicken, chow mein, BBQ and other favorites!  The variety is impressive, so there's something here for everyone, even if you're not interested in sushi.  The ambiance is admittedly kind of strange because it used to be another western restaurant, but I'm here for the food, so that doesn't matter to me.  You can almost always find a 20% off coupon in the mail, which I end up using every visit.  It's certainly not a super high quality restaurant with top-notch service, but if you're interested in Asian buffets, this is an excellent place to dine."}
{"text":"I've been here any times before and the food has been great .. Until today. It is a Saturday so you would expect things to be fresh but that wasn't the case. Quality of the food is not what it use to be before. It is no longer worth $22. And don't even bother coming for lunch.    Let's talk about service... If you get a lady named Vickie you are going to have a bad time. She never came to ask us how everything was which I don't expect much since it's a buffet. But we weren't even eating dessert yet and she brought us our bill. She even lectured us about how much to eat! Seriously rude! I gave her the 10% off yelp check-in to adjust our bill and when she brought it back she pretty much threw the bill at us. This was probably the worst service I've ever had. We also overheard her complain to the other customers about why she didn't get a tip. They said the service was horrible. At first I thought that was rude but now I know exactly why!!"}
{"text":"For a \"higher end\" buffet ($21.99 Dinner per person), this has got to be one of the best AYCE buffets in town! Everything from Chinese, Japanese, real desserts, fruits, salad bars galore. Great customer service and clean restaurant. Just overall delicious, fresh food and great dining experience. Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Best bargain for Chinese and Japanese food! Especially for weekday lunch!! For weekend lunch, there's oyster."}
{"text":"You get more for what you pay. Surprisingly they have good sushi for buffet restaurant. We like this place."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. Last couple times the food has been not up to par. I feel like on the days when this place doesn't have enough customers, they don't turn over the food at all & just leave it out all day. The crab legs actually smelled awful.   I would only go to this place on the busy days when there are lots of people & they are forced to put out fresh food at a faster rate. Otherwise, food is going to be very old & disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is good and yummy. I got my hands on a fresh shrimp tempura roll. It was ok. Ambiance is super weird. Asian food in an old claim jumper. The cooked food is fantastic though. Tried a lot of it. The walnut chicken was to die for. Absolutely delicious! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was only ok, and considering the price, it was good that I got 10% off with Check-In through YELP.  The place was huge, very spacious and plenty of seating.  The buffet was extra big compared to most.  Lots of various dishes; however, many were only lukewarm and the Sushi was primarily rolls of various names/preparations.  Not a lot of sashimi or nigiri items.  The service was ok as well.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times over the weekends for lunch! Very good food; especially love all the different varieties of freshly prepared sushi! Another favourite is the green-tea ice-cream!"}
{"text":"Stopped by (VERY) for an impromptu sushi pick-up yesterday for dinner. I gotta say - wasn't really wowwed or anything. In fact, I felt the spices were \"off\" and sushi didn't appear too fresh. It wasn't horrid - I cleaned my plate, but ehhhh.  I didn't realize (until I got inside) that it was a buffet-style. Maybe that's why? I'll stick w/my other go-to places from here out. Spendy too!"}
{"text":"Dinner 21$ per person but everything is good crab legs prime rib sushi etcetera"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try, it is literally a 5 minute drive from our apartment. We got there around 5 and the place was pretty empty. While it is a big buffet with many different options, the food looks like it had been sitting out all day and it was not fresh. It is also very pricey for the quality of the food. Dinner prices are over $20 person. We were disappointed to say the least and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food, so much it's hard to try it all before you're full. Tonight we especially enjoyed the fried Calamari. They have everything from sushi, to Kimchi, to BBQ, and all the other Asian buffet favorites. The kids liked the custard, cakes, and ice cream for dessert. Not our first time here and definitely not our last."}
{"text":"Quality and variety has gone down. Old sashimi and hot foods were not properly kept hot in buffet tables Sad to say, not the same great buffet my family used to enjoy. ."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! Totally worth the cost of all you can eat. The sushi was my favorite and the entire reason I will return and recommend anyone who doesn't like buffets to give this place a try. It's definitely not the average buffet with hit or miss options. The spread was amazing with crab legs, oysters, tons of dessert. Kid friendly selections as well. Our waitress was very nice and we even used the $5 off yelp check in coupon."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times  and I like that it is very consistent, the food is good, and most importantly, the sushi is really really good. For buffet sushi, Jasmine Tokyo has the best stuff and it doesn't even feel like it's out of a buffet. All the other food is pretty good too, it's your typical Asian buffet. They also have Prime Rib and oysters which are both of the highest quality which is extremely impressive. Service is also great and the price isn't too bad considering Pacific buffet is around the same price.  My only complaint is that the desserts are extremely unimpressive. Only the ice cream is worth eating. Other than that, definitely come check this place out for it's sushi!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Fresh! The sushi is outstanding. It is a little pricey for buffet prices but they have quality food so it's worth the price."}
{"text":"Many selections. I always started with tempura plate and sushi plate. Then I would have rice, soup, and chinese plate. Sometimes I would have seafood or meat. After that it is fruit time. At the end I get ice cream with jello."}
{"text":"YUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!  I LOVE this buffet!  Like Paul, I don't go to many buffets, but this one was awesome!  There was Chinese food, Walnut shrimp, sushi, shashimi, salads, desserts, and much more.  My favorites were the Asian Crusted Calamari, Tuna Sashimi, and Walnut Shrimp. YUM!!  I'm getting hungry right now just writing about it.   I was told by the hostess that the desserts were delivered by restaurants in the area such as The Cheesecake Factory.    The only thing I didn't like was that there was a limited amount of sushi rolls.  They had a hard time keeping them in stock.  Also, I'm a huge fan of  crab legs, but they were pretty watery for my liking.  Besides that, this is a great buffet!"}
{"text":"A large selection of food at night - might be best to walk the stations first before deciding what to pile onto your plate. Doesn't happen often, but I was actually surprised at the variety and huge selection of protein. I actually wanted more veggie dishes. The crowd pleasing proteins included: crab legs, shrimp, prime rib, baked fishes, bbq, and stir fry dishes. The sushi bar had sashimi, nigiri, and rolls. For buffet sushi, it was pretty decent. Ice cream was better than I expected as well.   The waitress was attentive and came by often to check that we were ok. Plenty of seating and they are able to accommodate large groups with reservation."}
{"text":"It was so so we went because of the reviews. Very pricy for a buffet tempura items cold must have set all day. Sweet and sour sauce had no flavor chicken was very fatty. Prime rib was more like roast beef. Not worth the price deserts dry and flavorless. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! Horrible food. Small buffet for a gigantic place! Way way way over priced! I would be embarrassed if I were the owner! 21.99 for dinner? They had old food out that tasted bad!   We will never go back and chalk this up to most wasted money I have ever spent.   I thought maybe the dessert would atleast make up for the nasty meal. But noooo how do you ruin dessert too?   Blah! ZERO stars!   Go to a cheap buffet. More food and way way way better pricing!"}
{"text":"For a buffet this place is pretty good.   They had lots of sushi rolls to choose from and the tempura veggies were great.  I have to admit that it's a bit overwhelming to choose. They had a fresh/raw bar as well.   I tried a variety of the dishes (teriyaki chicken, orange chicken, beef with broccoli, green beans and sweet and sour). The only thing I say stay away from out of those is the sweet and sour. It seems very doughy.   They had a carving station with prime rib, ribs and polish sausage. I only tried the ribs. They must've been there for awhile as they were pretty tough. The chicken wings are really good though.   The food was better as it picked up a bit and the rotation was constant. It wasn't busy enough for any empty slots so that was nice. I'm not a big buffet fan but I'd go back to this one especially if I had to feed a group of hungry teens.   Staff was great and my glass was always full. Check in for 10% off (or that was the special when I was there)."}
{"text":"Maybe 2 1/2 stars.  The food is not warm but tastes okay.  There is a great selection.  The sushi had been sitting out for awhile so I bypassed it.  The staff all seem to not know what is going on, but that might just be because it's new.  Kid-friendly so I'm sure the hubs will make us come back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"For a dinner buffet that charges $21.99, I think it was ok.  I am also not a big fan of crab legs or prime rib, so that may have made it less enjoyable.  I have had much better at a sushi buffet for cheaper.  I would probably give them 4 stars for lunch though.  Sushi were pretty good but small.  Sashimi was good too but not cold as it should be. Tempura wasn't crunchy.  Lots of other foods to choose from though...from Chinese to udon noodles to all kinds of salads, fruits, and desserts.  Service was consistent and friendly."}
{"text":"Not bad for a buffet. But the way people follow you around and monitor your food intake, it kind of feels like prison."}
{"text":"only as fresh as however many people are dining. don't go unless the parking lot is FULL. you want that food to be MOVING! if buffet is your thing, this is a great value. such an assortment of dishes!  TIP: loiter at the line and wait until they bring out fresh food then swoop like a vulture. otherwise, you'll have difficulty swallowing.  * korean style rib. good flavor * hot and sour soup. * choose your own stir fry. Just make sure the ingredients are fresh  # rancid oysters, clams. argh. what was i thinking # old sushi. ugh. i'd forgotten what sushi tastes like when it's not made seconds before you eat it # most nigiri and sashimi is rancid. # skewered meat. don't know what kind of meat that was, but it was off.   i cut my teeth on buffet. when I was 3 and 4 years old my dad took me to buffet every day for lunch. whoa the memories!  more memories... they still have the ceiling fans connected by belts and pulleys from the bobby mcgee's days."}
{"text":"The food is good, and they have most everything one could want, but the price is a show-stopper.  For a lot less that $20, I can find everything available here, except the prime rib, for a lot less elsewhere.  There was the potential for a wide variety of sushi, except the platters were always empty.  There was gelato, but only three flavors since they were out of chocolate and mint chocolate chip.    With better prices and lots of coupon deals at Oriental Buffet, and a better selection for a few dollars more at Wandering Horse Buffet, this place seems to be caught in the never land middle ground."}
{"text":"We are frequent diners at this place (usually lunch time) but last night we decided to go there at dinner time (Friday night at around 530pm)thinking everything is going to be fresh. We even called them to make sure they have those seafoods like crab legs, oysters, sashimi etc that are only available during dinner time. To our disappointment , they were all present but they were NOT FRESH. We were so afraid to even touch them. Discolored sashimi, dried out oysters, low quality crab legs and even the sushi are left overs from we don't know when. On the hot buffet spread table , the food are all dried up. We are willing to pay $22.00 per person for dinner time as long as it is worth it. It doesn't have to be extra ordinary but we demand that the FOOD BE FRESH. Hope they do something about it."}
{"text":"Really nice great Chinese food it's always fresh always hot  only complaint I have is its a bit pricey but I guess because it's in Scottsdale but  you won't regret it when you leave. Great nice clean place  food awesome"}
{"text":"The buffet was huge with a ton of options but nothing I had was very good.  It was really expensive too for mediocre food."}
{"text":"It is the best Buffet I have ever been to. I normally do not like buffet style restaurants, but this one is awesome. The place is clean and beautiful. The food is fresh and delicious. Love this place."}
{"text":"Good food - reasonably priced - check in on yelp for 20% off your entire bill :) Lots of sushi options - clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"5* review based on comparing  Jasmine Tokyo to other Chinese /Asian/Japanese  buffet restaurants available in Phoenix Scottsdale area.  We went in for lunch it is $11.99 per person. I feel they had an amazing selection for a buffet and if you love sashimi and  California rolls this is the place for you. it will wow you with their selection. I cannot wait to try them for dinner"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. Cant beat the sushi selections and the clean atmosphere! I usually start with the sushi then get a plate of chinese.... their new soba noodle soup was pretty good too.  Love their dessert selections and cookies. I always leave with one in hand."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch twice.  I'll be back!  For some reason, and I have NO CLUE why, there aren't many great options for asian buffets here in Scottsdale.  This place works for me.    Great variety, traditional dishes, very well done.  They keep the food freshly rotated and will toss out the food that has been sitting.  They have a lot of sushi options as well.  I LOVE sushi, but can't bring myself to eat buffet sushi.  Though it looks great, I just need my sushi to be freshly made to order, so I will hit Stingray or Geisha for my sushi fix.  But that's just me.  Definitely don't let me stop you from trying it.  It's kind of pricy, but it's worth it.  Usually when a buffet charges more, it helps keep the riffraff out of the restaurant, which helps make the experience even better.  No one wants to sit down for a meal only to look across the aisle at Honey BooBoo.    Try this place!"}
{"text":"The sushi was great! The other food was so so. The quality was good just thought most of the dishes were too gourmet for me. The dessert was great. People that compare this to Vegas buffet have only been downtown."}
{"text":"I love their seafoods.. everything taste good. we keep coming back to this place especially during weekend."}
{"text":"This is a huge buffet with multiple cold and hot options.  We went here on a Friday night, and prices were $21.99 for adults, not including drinks.  There's a plethora of options that will please just about anyone that comes here to dine. These options include standardized Americanized Chinese food (Like orange chicken and chow mein), various salads, a carving station (They had pork ribs, kielbasa sausage, and prime rib when we went), sashimi and sushi (nigiri and rolls), hibachi, seafood (Such as crab legs, steamed clams, raw oyster, shrimp cocktail, and various Chinese seafood concoctions), and dessert.    The menu for the most part echoes a lot of the food you'll see at Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler or Crazy Buffet in Tempe, except for the carving station.  As for the quality of food, it's pretty good for the most part.  Out of everything I tried, I was most leery of the oyster though.  I took a tentative bite, only to discover it had a pond-like taste to it, and was very gritty.  The other seafood items were much better.  The crab legs were salty, but the meat inside was sweet and tender.  The sushi rolls seemed a little bland and were dry from age, but the sashimi was better.  They had thinly sliced pieces of white tuna, salmon, octopus, and snapper when I went.  The Chinese food was pretty good, on par with Pacific Buffet, and the prime rib was tender.  Dessert included various ice creams and gelato (Such as coconut, mango, and mint chocolate chip), mousse cakes, cheesecakes, carrot cake, German chocolate cake, custard, and cream puffs, just to name a few!  There is also a fresh and canned fruit section at the end of the salad section.  I tried some coconut gelato and various cakes.  The cakes were fresh and tasty, and the gelato had a nice refreshing coconut taste, although the texture had a weird gummy quality.  Service was very attentive.  Drinks and plates were refilled and taken away promptly.  At the end of our meal we got a coupon for the regular buffet, and for their happy hour.  We did get $5 off our meal total by checking into Yelp and using a check-in deal, which made the price a little more reasonable.    One other thing to note is the bathroom, while clean looking, does smell somewhat sewer-like, so keep your nose prepared!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations seeing as it has 4 solid stars with 181 reviews.  Maybe my high expectations is why we left disappointed, with $50 less in our pocket.  Went here for an early dinner last Monday, arriving shortly after 4pm (I believe when their dinner starts).  The restaurant itself was nice and clean, including the bathrooms.  The food, well it looked like the leftover lunch items were reheated.    How could I tell?  The ceramic looking hot plates only had a few servings in them.  And the food in it, or I should say the sauce on some of the items, had that look when a liquid sits out and cools off (think gravy) and it develops that skin on the surface.    Would I go back?  Not for $21+ a person for dinner.  IMO, its more worth maybe $10-15 per person for dinner."}
{"text":"The only buffet restaurant I will eat in Scottsdale. Period.   The space and seating are is huge and comfy. We even discovered a new area that is more quiet for group. Food are fresh and delicious. You can also ask for sashimi if they are not prepared already. Great services and price is also reasonable. You can easily find twenty-percent coupon online to print.   If you love seaweed, it's the best place to eat as much as you like. They also offer few special dishes over holiday. Such as lobster for Chinese new year, steak for X'mas etc."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, so much to chose from. Make sure to use the yelp 20% coupon if you decide to go anytime use because it will take a chunk off. I went during lunch and only spent around $10 for unlimited sushi (great sushi) and other dishes, along with dessert. I was stuffed but it was so worth it. :D"}
{"text":"Eating out with 3 kids who couldn't care less for chicken fingers, hot dog, kiddie burgers, Mac and cheese, and the like. This place hit the spot for us. A wide variety of food to meet everyone's preference is what can be found at this place. Definitely a place for the family and a hefty appetite. Hot foods, sushi, sashimi were prevalent and gelato to top it all off. If we lived local we would frequent this place. Thanks also to the very friendly rosemeiry :)."}
{"text":"Ok food wayyyyyyyy overpriced I'm not sure how a family of 5 should cost $125 at a Chinese buffet"}
{"text":"This place has gone south. We ate here a year ago and it was pretty good but the food this evening was not as fresh as it should be. I know buffets are hit or miss and tonight was a miss.  I love fresh sashimi and sushi but the fish here seemed to be sitting out a bit too long and getting dried out.  Maybe this buffet doesn't get busy enough for the chefs to bring out fresh food constantly..it was pretty slow for a Friday night. Please! Play some music! It was so quiet and weird ambience..the out door patio is nice but is just for looks, serves no purpose."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been here and was treated excellent!!!!! Our waitress was so kind and she kept checking on us and poured more wine when I glass was low and the food exceeded my expectations. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Hands down best Asian buffet in AZ!"}
{"text":"This was one of the cleanest buffets I've ever been to. The food was very good, definitely going to come back"}
{"text":"Worst place for \"to-go\" menus. I have ordered lunch on sunday afternoon by walking in for to go. When I walked in i saw 4.99/lb of lunch. I asked waiter and he confirmed price. I picked up more than 3 lb lunch. At checkout they billed me as 7.99/lb . Waiter was noob guy and manager came (chinese lady) and said menu prices was wrong!!!?!!!?? He said something in chinese to that guy and he quickly run to menu board and wiped 4.99/lb price and changed it to 7.99/lb . What a chinese way of serving people?!!?!? I hate this place and won't go anymore there since manager even five a s**t to apologize doe incorrect price."}
{"text":"Jasmine Tokyo's goal is apparently to be the gold standard of Chinese buffet, and it will cost you substantial gold, even with the Yelp 20%-off check-in deal or one of the coupons they send occasionally. Unlike some buffets in the region, the slight queasiness you may feel afterwards is from damage to your wallet, not to your stomach.  SUSHI The sushi section is huge, creative, and good-for-buffet-quality (so, better than supermarket, better than the second-best place on Thomas Road, but not so good as a serious sushi restaurant where it's made right when you order it). If your goal is to fill up on sushi, you will probably come out ahead here. They've also added little plates of sashimi, which in late afternoon were not at their peak. If you come when they're busy and refreshing this a lot, you will probably do better.  MONGOLIAN BBQ It exists. I resist buffet features that require interacting with servers, so I've never tried it, and I veered that direction only to obtain SESAME BALLS and those cheese-covered scallop things in shells. This place has the best sesame balls filled with bean paste. Should I ever decide to invent the Sesame Ball Diet, I will eat here regularly, 30 sesame balls at a sitting.  SALAD AND COLD THINGS Ignore the shrimp, unless it's peak period and being refreshed often. The little spicy squid in the other cold section, however, are excellent. BITE THEY LITTLE HEADS OFF, nibble on they tiny feet!  HOT FOOD The selection here is smaller than at cheaper buffets, so there was only one style of dim sum (pot stickers filled with BBQ pork, I think), none of the usual non-Chinese offerings (possibly not a loss, depending), and a limited array of main dishes. The up side is that the main dishes are mostly restaurant-quality rather than \"arrive in a dump truck from buffet central\" quality. So it's very non-gloppy, things taste like something other than sauce, and if a dish purports to contain meat, the meat is the major part, not something you have to hunt amidst cheap vegetables. The walnut shrimp is outstanding.  DESSERT Again, I refuse to interact with ice-cream scoopers (and, in fact, I've never seen that station staffed anyway). The serve-yourself selection contains many of the usual suspects and a few surprises. The mango pudding-cake thing is good, but avoid the pineapple cake. There are cheesecake bites! Have a cheesecake bite!  Heck, have another sesame ball! You know you want to."}
{"text":"The only reason this isn't a perfect 5 star review is because it's so pricey. Not that that isn't justified by the exotic selections available, but the price does inhibit our ability to eat here regularly, which we would happily do otherwise. The food is interesting, varied, cooked and presented beautifully, and the service is pretty good. The sushi is really a star, and the tempura is delicious. Definitely a good date place for a once-in-a-while splurge!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Asian buffets in Phoenix area. The food is prepared in smaller portions so it's fresh. It's very clean and the staff is always prompt and friendly. Overall, the food is good and plenty if variety."}
{"text":"Great variety and tasty food. Love oyster there! My friend and I are very enjoyed and the price met its value. I highly recommend to have a buffets as lunch in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"LOVE.   Unlimited sushi: YES Unlimited oysters: YES Unlimited everything: YESSS  Numerous dessert options, not all are good, some are from costco, but the food itself is so filling that it makes up for all of it. I do loooove the custard dessert (like creme brulee without the sugar topping) and the gelato is amazing.   My family loves coming here because of the great value and closeness to our house. Also, it's really clean. The ambiance is weird since it used to be a claim jumper, but who really cares since everything else is so good!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese buffets I've been to in years. The food seems fresh (given I went at 6:30 PM, but it was a Monday evening, so it wasn't super crowded). A few of the Chinese buffet staples are MUCH higher quality than I've ever seen. The Korean short-ribs and sushi in particular were well above average for a buffet. Oh and the dessert is spectacular. This coming from someone who usually just skips it because it's not worth the stomach space.   A few other notes: they've got crab legs every night at dinner, honey walnut shrimp, cream cheese rangoons, tempura vegetables, and sesame balls. Those are all things I particularly love, but not every place has. Something missing most do have: Chinese donuts. The little round ball of fried dough covered in sugar. I usually make that my dessert, but their desserts were good enough to make up for that missing."}
{"text":"Jasmine Tokyo is quickly become one of my family's favorite restaurants. It's definitely my husband's favorite. All you can eat sushi. He's in heaven. They also have wonderful walnut shrimp, sesame balls, crab puffs, and a million other things including these little watermelon tuna concoctions that are awesome. Live this place and hope it sticks around. For anyone complaining about the price - you get what you pay for. Go do the buffet at Sweet Tomatoes if you want a $12 buffet. This is well worth it for the extra $10 or so. Sushi is EXPENSIVE and that makes this a bargain. Oh, they also have good gelato."}
{"text":"Great service, had the dinner buffet @ $19.99 a person we asked if we could see the buffet first \"No problem, have a look!\" I looked at my wife for her approval and we decided to try it. Nice selection of sushi, soups, traditional Chinese dishes. They had  snow crab legs and prime rib also. Great dessert choices with several ice creams and cheese cakes etc."}
{"text":"Best buffet in Phoenix that I've been to. Their prices are a bit on the higher end, but still well worth it, especially their dinner buffet. They also keep the place pretty clean, the staff is attentive, and the food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"For those of you who have written good reviews about Jasmine Tokyo -- you've got to be kidding!  Although the dining area is comfortable and clean, and the people who clean your table are friendly and attentive, there is a big problem -- the FOOD!  I don't know what good a large selection of sushi does you if it isn't very good.  Of the eight types I sampled, one was decent (crispy onion tuna, despite having only a tiny morsel of fish).  The other seven were fair.  A big problem is that even at 6pm, when things should be really fresh, they weren't.  The tempura was very oily, the non-fish dishes (orange chicken, chicken with mushrooms, broccoli beef) were nowhere near as tasty as those you get at a shopping center food court.  And how did Jasmine Tokyo manage to make roasted duck with skin that was crispy and chewy at the same time?  (I'll tell you how -- it had been sitting around for hours).  Seasoning is not a talent of the food preparers (I will not call them chefs) -- the spicy tuna was not spicy, nothing had salt or other condiments that I could discern, and so on and so on and so on.  Don't save your appetite for desert -- it is pedestrian at best and has nothing to do with the Orient.  A few things were okay, namely those where good ingredients and decent recipes are all that is needed -- the plain shrimp, the custard, the hot and sour soup.  That's about it.  $22 for this?? Even with 20% off, it's still at least $10 overpriced."}
{"text":"Was here with a group and then back with my family for Mothers Day. Great selection of food.  I guess I did not get the right cut for the prime rib as it was fatty, and tough. Everything else that I had was quite tasty.  I even got brave and had some sushi that I was not familiar with. Good service."}
{"text":"I have read some of the other reviews.  Some people wrote a book.  Maybe if they focused on eating, instead of so much talking.  Serious foodies are more about eating than boring everyone with over typing.    This place is new and my waitress said they are working out quirks.  Everyone was very friendly.    Very comfortable setting.  What I love is that the food is cooked tasting Healthier.  Not greasy like some of those other buffets.  I loaded up 3 plate fulls.  Even though there was lots of sea food, I ate lots of perfectly cooked crisp green beans.  I am very picky about how thejy are cooked.  These guys did right.  The difference between this buffet and all the other guys,  Jasmine Tokyo's food is fresh, and a higher quality of  food.  I'm ruined for those other buffets now.  So if you complain about paying $19.99 for dinner with all that Quality food, then stay home."}
{"text":"This buffet came highly recommended by a friend.  I was looking forward to trying it and now I know I will not be coming back.  The sushi was okay.  Nothing special, just Ok. Salad bar was good.  Cooked food was nothing special and some of it had been sitting too long.   Desserts were just mediocre.  I didn't mind the atmosphere.   I still think Pacific Seafood Buffet in Glendale is so very much better than this place."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Hawaii, (home to the orient) jasmine Tokyo is where I recommend people for great sashimi, sushi, and fresh oysters."}
{"text":"I've never really enjoyed buffets, but my wife wanted to come here for her birthday. I never really felt like I could get a good meal at a buffet but I was wrong.   The sushi was really good. They had at least 10 different rolls and not just the basic rolls but stuff like Rainbow rolls and the likes. Tried them all and they were all very good. They had one sushi chief just throwing out rolls cause the sushi was going fast. They also had tempura which included lots of vegetables plus shrimp.   They had a meat bar with prime rib, Chinese BBQ ribs, & sausage. The ribs are really good. Nice and sweet. You have to try these ribs.The sausage is ok and didn't try the prime rib but looked good. Lots of good Chinese food with lots of seafood in it and I enjoyed it. There was also a cold bar with salads and fresh fruit. Lastly, they have a pretty good desert bar where they have a server scoop out the ice cream.   So overall, they have lots of selections of different kinds of food but most important it's all fresh. You could tell that none of the dishes have been sitting out there for a long time. Very fresh and hot.   Service was good. Picking up our dirty dishes and filling up our water glasses in a timely manner. All I can say is that the food is really good, lots of variety to satisfy everybody, but the best part is that if you Check-in you get a 20% off your bill.   Enjoy and have a really good meal."}
{"text":"Huge selection of food and it is all pretty good! I mean it's a buffet so of course it's not the best but they have just about everything, traditional and American style, tons of sushi, a carving station and seafood. Overall, one of the best Chinese buffets I've been to. The people are nice and it's clean so that's all I need in a buffet."}
{"text":"I had been anticipating the opening of this place, since I had been inside this location's previous restaurant (Claim Jumper) before, and knew that it would be a large buffet that is close to my workplace. I had a chance to try it today and have mixed reviews.  PRICE: $11.99 for the lunch buffet; uncertain as to dinner price. This is a bit steep for for a buffet but it does mean that they can serve a high quality of food. I had an iced tea, and with tip I paid $15 - a bit high for a buffet for my wallet.  SELECTION: I was a little disappointed by the selection of food. About 1/4 of the steam trays were empty; it's possible that they might all be filled for dinner, and the available portions of what they did have out was a bit small (I'd guess that four or five people hitting a single dish would empty it). They have fairly typical buffet fare: a decent salad bar; a few cold pasta selections; chow and lo mein; white and fried rice; roughly 10-12 entree dishes; miso, egg drop, hot and sour, and a spicy thai soup; a sushi bar with probably 5-8 types of sushi; and a few dessert selections, including a hand-scooped ice cream bar with 3-5 types of ice cream. They also have a full bar (which doesn't do me much good at lunch, but is a nice addition).  FOOD: I tried most of my typical buffet selections. One overall complaint I had was the temperature of the food: It was a bit on the cool side for my taste, but that is tough to avoid at a buffet in my experience.   I started with the hot and sour soup. It was both spicy and vinegary, loaded with tons of fresh mushroom, which I liked. It had a bit more black pepper in it than I liked, but was still very good.  In regards to appetizer-style dishes: The crab rangoon was very good, with a good balance of cream cheese and crab. Crab-stuffed mushrooms were flavorful and had a nice snap to the texture of the mushroom. The Chow Ho Fun (thin angel hair-style rice noodle stir-fried) had a good smoky flavor from the wok and had thin slivers of fresh onion and pepper.  For my entree dishes: The steak in black bean sauce was tasty, with tender, large chunks of beef and fresh red bell pepper and onion - and thankfully not greasy like some buffets I've patroned. The orange chicken was somewhat mediocre, with neither enough spice nor orange flavor for my liking. Sesame chicken was nice, with a good balance of sesame flavor and sweetness.   Dessert: I tried the custard and slice of cake roulade (a spiral rolled pastry filled with fruit and cream/cream cheese). The custard was more of a flan-style custard than I was expecting, but it was very tasty. The roulade was fairly bland and tasted like it was only recently from the freezer, as it was still somewhat frozen; it was drizzled with what I thought were strawberry and kiwi syrups, but those really had little flavor.  SERVICE: The server was friendly and kept my iced tea topped off, and (as is appropriate for a new restaurant, I think) asked us for our comments on the food.  Overall, I was impressed with the quality of the food; most of the dishes were much more \"crisp\" than a lot of buffets, with the vegetables retaining their snap and the coating on fried dishes still retaining some texture in the sauce (come to think of it, this might be why they do such small portions on the buffet). But with a price tag of $15 for meal, drink, and tip for lunch, I'm not sure that I'll be able to visit very often."}
{"text":"Super slick setup, not bad for a buffet, ultra friendly service!"}
{"text":"This was a good Japanese buffet. I did enjoy how great our waitress was with refilling drinks and checking on us. I had some sushi which was good. However the chicken I choose was pretty dry. If I go back I'll be sure to stick to the sushi!"}
{"text":"It now costs 21.99. Still worth the price food is not Asian but, it is good.  All food items were fresh and carefully watched to be sure they stayed fresh."}
{"text":"All I can say is\"  Yummy for our tummy\"  :)  Lots of different entrees -- my favorite being the sushi.  Good soups, amazing salads, and wait.. there is even more - the desserts.  Puddings, tapioca, cakes of all kinds, and gelato!!    Go in hungry - come out stuffed.  The food is of good quality.  Everything is hot and fresh.  I've been there for lunch, and for dinner.  Check online for coupons, that is what I did.  20% off (every little bit helps)."}
{"text":"It's a bit spendy for a buffet but once you see it you know why. The selection is on par with a Vegas buffet. Carving station had Prime rib, pork bbq ribs, duck, ham and more. There were probably 4 or 5 shrimp dishes from boiled to walnut shrimp(my favorite). The selection was almost overwhelming. Large sushi bar, raw oysters, snow crab and thai crab.Deserts were good, several ice creams, cake and believe it or not cheese cake. The one thing missing that I found odd was potato, no mashed baked or fried. With their carving station it seems like a potato is the natural side. It's in a former Claim Jumper location so decor is very nice and upscale. Service was great. We will absolutely return, hopefully before everyone figures out the value and it gets crowded, but they do deserve success."}
{"text":"Food not fresh it is stale and old. Fish and seafood is not fresh at all. Soups are watered down, egg rolls are hard.  Spareribs were pink & not cooked all the way, chicken was hard, fruit was bad, desserts were not fresh. Server do not clean floor & tables,also when ask for glass of ice servers get mad & they are rude, & refuse to give people their $ back, place should close"}
{"text":"Tell me why this place is less than 4 stars. WTF?   In the words of our President, \"This is SAD. No wonder why D.C. isn't working.\"   To give this place less than 5 stars is honestly stupid AF. What else do you expect from an AZN buffet? There a lot of food, good choices and it looks like a mothafckin Elks Lodge in here.   For all this haters out there, BE GONE!!!!  This is place is FIERRRRRR."}
{"text":"Better than your average buffet in town.  Excellent service and for a buffet, pretty good!!"}
{"text":"If Jasmine intends to continue, I would suggest they re-visit their prices--way to high for a buffet.  Would help if they posted the lunch and dinner menus on their website along with the prices unless Jasmine feels the pricing disclosure might keep people away."}
{"text":"I danced between 2 stars and 3 stars with this review.  I'll get to why I only gave it 2 in a minute.  My dad was REALLY excited to try this place out.  Asian buffets are his thing.  I like them too but I prefer upscale ones.  This one is upscale.  If you have read any of my other reviews you'll know I am a buffet junkie.  I love them and I will honor and cherish them as long as they take care of me.  First off, this is the cleanest buffet in Arizona.  Hands down!  It's nice, spread out with seating and incredibly nice decor.  The layout of the food is great.    With that being said, the dishes are your standard Asain fare with a twist.  You can tell the cooks take pride in the preparation and ingredients.  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS EVERYTHING IS COLD ONCE YOU GET IT TO YOUR TABLE.  All the food was incredibly luke warm.  If it was hot, it would have tasted better.  My dad went up to the manager and told them this.... Their response.....  IT'S THE A/C in the building.  That has to be the biggest crock of shit I have ever heard in my entire life.  I've been to plenty of buffets in the Valley and not once was the food cold.  They ran the A/C too. All the dishes were pretty cold, a health inspector would have a field day with this place.   Now that I got that out of the way... The sushi layout was OUTSTANDING.  The fish was really fresh and they had almost any roll I could imagine.  I would have liked to have tried the crab legs but there were maybe 10 of them sitting in a bath of luke warm water.  It was like that the entire hour I was there.  The oysters were great..  Please keep in mind... I NEVER EAT OYSTERS AT A BUFFET.  It's the one thing I won't trust.  These were cold and fresh and delicious.  If you can eat $20 worth of sushi on one plate, this is the place for you.. You will get your money's worth.  The bottom line is this place is worth trying once.  After that, I don't think you can justify paying $20 for lukewarm food.  Judging by the managers response, this is an issue that will not go away anytime soon.  Also, our server was a real ass.  I am not sure if he just hates his life or was having a bad day, but he was pissed about something.  He slammed my drink down each time I asked for a refill and he was pissed that he had to bus his own tables.  If I did decide to go back here, I would ask for another waiter.  Also this place was dead on a Sunday at 6:30pm.  I don't think this place is going to make it."}
{"text":"I Love their Sushi Bar! All the veggies were so fresh and food is Real awesome, I love the Raw Salmon and I think this is the best part of it for me! Dessert is great and can't help but keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food and service.the price for lunch was reasonable. The food that was supposed to be hot was hot and the food that was meant to be cold was cold. Egg rolls were on point and spring rolls. Not much of a Mongolian bbq but they tried. The food quality makes it not necessary to have a Mongolian like some buffets need."}
{"text":"I love this place, I've been here so many times, and each time I tell myself I need to write a review. There isn't anything I can say negative about this place. I am quite the picky eater, and it has everything I could possibly want or need. I love sushi, and I love shashimi. I love the fact they also have a little side area to create a small meal for you right there. the food is always fresh. I highly recommend this place for everyone."}
{"text":"15% service charge plus 15 % gratuity included in a bill. Really ?  We had a coupon for 20% off the bill for 4 people our bill came up 112$ after coupon . Really not worth the food .  Series was really slow , she was bringing our drinks one by one it took us to 20 min to get our drinks. Sushi variety was really small aseptically for me cause I m allergic to shell fish and almost all sushi had shrimp in them.  The only think that was testy is duck and mango moose ."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. I love Asian food and it was a buffet treat to everyone (even people who aren't crazy about sushi and are choosy). The selection of fresh cut meats, fish, chicken, dumplings, veggie rolls, desserts, fruit: took my breath away:)) I felt like I'm in a food heaven!!:)) even the green tea they made me is the kind I like best: Rich, powdery green hot tea I love!!:)) The service was perfect too: when the sweet lady saw I'm eating crab legs she got me the tiny fork and all the necessary utensils right away, and was super friendly and personal, not your average \"I'm doing you a huge favor\" face!!:) oh and we got a coupon buy one dinner get second half price and they accepted and we are so happy we have a new favorite place to eat at nearby:)) the interiors are very much like all American seafood or steak house but food is really ahead of the game: soups were so good too. Love you guys/ keep up this kind of quality dining:))"}
{"text":"Yes the buffet is huge, but honestly it wasn't very good! Especially for 22.50 a plate."}
{"text":"I would give it a solid 3.7. The food is good for an AYCE. Service is lacking but friendly. Fun for a group and good food. Papered beef was tasty. Veggies were fresh, particularly the asparagus was crisp and delicious. Sushi was good too. Go with the cold crab legs not the hot ones, they had no flavor. We go with family when we're in town."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch several times and the place has always met my expectations. First thing you have to consider though: this is a buffet. You should know what you are walking into. If you've been to other buffets in the area, I would definitely say this one has a great selection. Lunch will run you around $12 after tax, but if you're looking for unlimited food, this is the place to go.   The sushi has always looked a little iffy to me, but the other options more than make up for it in my book. I will say, I wouldn't bother spending $20+ a person for dinner though. But as a lunch spot, it's great."}
{"text":"I got there a little after 11am on a weekday.  Maybe 11:30am.  The place was clean.  This location used to be Claim Jumper.  Anyhow, I started with the hot items but they were not hot.  Maybe they weren't meant to be hot.  I think they were supposed to be hot.  Everything was cold.  Including fried tofu, fresh tofu, green beans, bokchoy, chicken wings...everything.  The flavor was decent.  Except for the chicken wings.  I didn't like that so much.  Surprisingly, the hot and sour soup was good....and it wasn't cold.  Next, I had the sushi.  The variety was good.  I got one of everything, except for the cooked sushi.  I'm not a big fan of cooked sushi.  What's the point.  By this time, I was pretty full.  So, I didn't get to try the mongollian bbq.  You know, the part where they cook for you.  That's okay.  It's not really my thing at an asian buffet.  I'll def go back.  But I'll start with the sushi first."}
{"text":"A decent price tag and plenty of selection. Unfortunately, the food is not as hot temperature as it should be. Steam table needs to be cranked up. Soup was hot but not the hot dishes. dessert was better than most buffets. Wine is only 5 bucks per glass."}
{"text":"first the place was empty went there for my birthday over priced but wanted to give it a wirl. the chicken was hard beef hard and burnt taste. the clams were sandy and oysters never tasted an oyster like them .. soup egg drop soup no taste watered down stringbeans limp. old food from day before heated up again. couldnt get napkins soukd of checked on us the waitress. asked-for wet naps she said there is a bathroom.. bad old food pastery cream puff hard muscles looked bad... bad experience never going back no people in there.. i see why"}
{"text":"Literally walked out after 3 bites. The sushi was disgusting and didn't want to chance anything else. A waste of $53. If you want to avoid food poisoning and/or parasites, stay away."}
{"text":"I really like this place, but ONLY for sushi. It's extremely good, and for $15 all-u-can-eat for lunch, you CANNOT beat it. I wish the cooked foods were on par, but they really aren't. Oh well, it works out since my boyfriend doesn't like sushi much but does like their Chinese food."}
{"text":"Came here today with my daughter for lunch celebrating her passing her driver's test and getting her license. Everything LOOKED delicious but the food was cold and 2 bites in I found a hair in my orange chicken. We told the lady that initially sat us down and she said \"I'm sorry do you still want to eat or leave?\" Why would we want to stay? We lost our appetite at that point. On our way out she went straight to the kitchen and was yelling at the kitchen staff. We will never return here."}
{"text":"Make sure you are hungry. It is a huge buffet. But $25 a person."}
{"text":"Here's what you can eat at Jasmine Tokyo:  1) All kinds of Chinese fast food dishes (chow mein, honey walnut shrimp, crab puffs, etc.... pretty unhealthy unless you skip the cream cheese-y, fried, and mayo-filled dishes. The sweet chili calamari was worth it, though.)  2) Mongolian stir fry. There's legitimately a tiny Ghengis Grill-esque section.  3) Over a dozen kinds of better-than-anticipated-quality sushi, plus sashimi (not all the rolls were identified, but they were tasty, so who really cares if it was Soylent Green, anyway...)  4) Something from the shellfish bar... the crab legs were meaty, but not flavorful... at least they're one step ahead of most buffets.  5) A smattering of Japanese delights, such as the surprisingly impressive squid salad, seaweed salad, etc.  6) Meat. There's a section with huge cuts of red meat for those who aren't ready to venture into Americanized Asian food, or just need a fat steak to accompany their Gyoza.  7) Dessert - a sundae bar with 6 flavors of ice cream, cakes, puddings, custard, jell-o, fruit, cookies, mousse, macaroons, cream puffs, etc. The cookies are awesome, especially a la mode, as is the Chocolate Thunder(thighs) cake with banana.  In a nutshell:  It's pretty apparent that there are a handful of ways to get your money's worth, but I'd say the best bet is just to try everything, then eat approximately 27 pieces of sashimi and 14 rolls of sushi. Even if you OD on sushi and die of Mercury poisoning, at least you were economical about it, right?"}
{"text":"Came back here shortly after opening and definitely still 5 stars They still have the 10% off coupon for checking into yelp, and service was great. So much sushi! Like 12 rolls both hot and cold to choose from as well as salon, tuna, mackerel, crab, snapper, and egg nigiri. They also had inari and seaweed. They had various hot dishes including several chicken, a few tofu, a beef, a pork, and a couple different types of fish. There were a few different salad dishes to choose from and the shrimp one was great. Besides the salad bar, they had a nice selection of fresh fruit. They had tempura, cheese wontons, egg rolls, spring rolls, and a few other fried dishes. Overall I did not have a bad dish, and everything was refilled frequently. The desert section was huge. They had a gelato section, where you rang a bell and someone would come scoop it out for you. The coconut, chocolate chunk, and butter pecan were great . They also had vanilla, mint chocolate chip, and I believe one other flavor that I did not try. For desert offerings they were all served in individual trays except for the cookies. They had cakes, mousse, mousse cake, cookies, and custard. The vanilla custard, chocolate mousse, mocha mousse-cake, and German chocolate cakes were all great. After that I paid and for $12.94 still a very great deal."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Got a full variety plateful of sushi and had to go back for round 2 for the sashimi! I enjoyed how they refilled everything quickly and the servers were attentive. Dessert is superb. :)"}
{"text":"Great Chinese buffet restaurant. One of the best I've been to and I've been to a lot!  Great cooked options and good sushi too. Would definitely come back again if I lived in Arizona.  Haven't even tried the amazing looking desserts yet."}
{"text":"Jasmine Tokyo is as good as it gets for Chinese/Japanese buffet in Scottsdale. There really is no other comparison in all of the valley that I know of.  I have been going to Oriental Gardens at Indian Bend & Pima for years, until it turned into a Hooters 5 months ago.  Cleanliness - food area was very clean.  Restroom was clean.  Dining area was average.  It is a converted Claim Jumper restaurant, without much conversion other than the food.  There are still antler chandeliers and fake stone decor is the theme.  Food - excellent variety of Chinese dishes, Japanese hibachi, an impressive sushi selection and an enormous amount of dessert.  The Chinese dishes were not very traditional Chinese, but more of the standard buffet selections we are all accustomed to seeing in any buffet, but the nice part about it was that the dishes were fresh, in small batches, rather than large trough style portions.  Hot dishes were well made and the sushi selection was well worth the price of lunch. Desserts were plentiful with a large variety of cakes, pudding, mousse and ice cream (not freezer burned either).  Pricing - $11.99 for weekday lunch.  $15.99 for weekend lunch.  Dinner is $21.99 every night.  Drinks are not included in these prices. I don't ever care for the crab legs or prime rib at any Chinese restaurant, so my recommendation is go for lunch.  Our server kept our drinks full and the empty plates were always gone when we came back with full plates, which is a huge plus in my book, so I had no problem providing a healthy tip.  Will definitely be going back for lunch often!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem at Shea and Scottsdale.  Spacious restaurant and great for large parties.  Lots of food options to choose from. The sushi was kept covered which helped keep it fresh.  Service was good as well."}
{"text":"The place is one gigantic buffet.  The best thing I can say about it was that it did look to be very clean however; it lacks any ambiance at all.   The food was terrible.  I went last night with my boyfriend and two kids ages 8 and 10. We ordered no alcohol.  The bill came to $71.03 (not including tip) for four sodas and the buffet for two adults and two children.  I'd be less offended by what they are charging if the food was even somewhat decent. Do yourself a favor and forgo this one."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best thing this place serves are crispy chicken wings. They're really excellent.  We were completely unfamiliar with the area but didn't want to eat at a mall, a chain or any place that had a sister location in Vegas. That basically gave us a handful of choices and then we had to weed out everything that was tapas and/or $$$. We ended up here on 09/20/15, a Sunday, for lunch.   Weekend lunch is $14.99 pp. It comes with all you can eat sushi & hot buffet. I filled up on walnut chicken, walnut shrimp, seaweed salad & chicken wings.   - Egg drop soup tastes like a weird plastic. - Deserts tastes like nothing.  - Nigiri had an old fishy taste.  - Rolls were OK. - BBQ tasted of food coloring.  Service was prompt & very good. Unfortunately, the food won't warrant a repeat visit."}
{"text":"This place is a great deal. The food is fresh and always tasty! I've had most of the items on the buffet. It seemed my favorite was the green bean :) I don't know why but it tastes to good here. They are a little under staffed during lunch, which can be a problem when you're in a rush. Either than that, this place is worth the try. Especially when you get 10% off for just checking in."}
{"text":"We were surprised to see our check had  a 15% gratuity already added.  We were a party of 5 and on the board in front it said 15% gratuity added to parties of 6 or more.  We used a coupon which was 20% off 2 dinner buffets.  And since we used that coupon we couldn't get a discount for my mother who is a senior(what is a senior discount a whopping 10% off).  The dinner buffet was expensive.  To top it off the 15% gratuity was added to the price before the discount.  I immediately took the check to the front to ask the lady why it was added.  Is that even allowed?  The manager came up and said she automatically adds 15% because they are so busy.  We came at 5pm when there were only a handful of customers. She asked if that was too much.  I replied that it should be my decision how much the tip is.     She returned the check to me after taking off the gratuity.  I went back to the table and the waitress asked me if I had already paid.  I said no and she replied, \"You pay me.\"  She saw that we had left a tip on the table.  When she bought back the receipt to sign she asked, \"Was the service bad?\"  We replied, \"It wasn't bad but the empty plates were not taken away and our table was full while were eating.  She replied, \"So my service was bad and stormed away like a child.\"  I didn't know employees could speak that way to paying customers.  I found it to be quite rude and off-putting.  Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment.  Obviously they didn't need or want our patronage."}
{"text":"TOP QUALITY!  Unlimited sushi, stir fry, deserts, ribs, salmon, anything you can think of!   Service was fast and always prompt, very kind waitress- found out she had been working with the same family for 12 years!   Been multiple times and will continue to dine in."}
{"text":"So understand, my rating is based on a buffet. This is not sitting at a sushi bar for an evening of wildly different sushi. But I was really impressed with how well they did what they did and how reasonable it was. I stuck to the Japanese side, mostly sushi and sashimi, with a miso soup starter. Very fresh. Thinly cut on the sashimi, but remember, they're fighting against the tendency to waste food by many at a buffet. And they did have some interesting specials, such as white tuna and small octopuses. Also fresh oysters and special mussels.  Reasonably priced - $22 for the buffet (and a 20% coupon was nice) and only $5 for 8 ounce sakes. Will surely go back.  And the P.S. - yes, it was weird that this used to be a Claim Jumper and still looks it!"}
{"text":"Usually I run for the hills when it comes to buffets, but this place makes me happy! I love a wide variety of food and Jasmine Tokyo provides just this. They have a nice selection of sushi rolls, crab legs, oysters, a meat craving station, noodles, fried rice, tofu, vegetables, desserts, fruit, and many other items. Great blend of authentic Chinese and Japanese food alike. Price is $21.99 per person for an all you can eat buffet, which contrary to some other reviews on here, I think is reasonably priced (for the quality and all that you get). Atmosphere doesn't really match the experience...kind of a rustic log cabin theme with a fire going in the winter (loved that!). Used to be an old Claim Jumper (ahhhh now it makes sense. Yes, I asked the hostess haha). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great seafood selection, I had crawfish, octopus, salmon, two kinds of peel and eat shrimp, bottleneck clams, and California rolls. Great selection of food, including pork, chicken and beef dishes. They have soups, crab Rangoon, pot stickers, fruit for dessert, along with cakes and cookies, and soft serve ice cream. Dinner is about $22 for adults, soft drinks not included."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with friends and it was the best decision I made for my birthday.  An all-you-can-eat buffet of Asian food and more!  Definitely worth every penny because you get an amazing ROI when you go to Jasmine Tokyo.  More people should be going to this place!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. One of the nicer buffets outside of Vegas. Clean, no msg overkill, cool offerings like edamame...  Not oversauced like PF Chang's and hits the spot if you're craving Asian in Scottsdale.  We went during a slow period so I was doubly surprised the buffet food was actually good, since I'm not a big buffet fan.  Would come again."}
{"text":"It was so-so.  The service was fine.  But the experience wasn't anything special, and the food was very hit or miss.  The sushi wasn't great, but some of the Chinese options were better.  Short ribs and fried rice were some of the better choices.  I wouldn't go back...  it was ok, but not worth a return trip."}
{"text":"I truly recommend this place!   For starters, I do not usually go to buffets but I really enjoy going here! My father took me and my grandma here for lunch today and it was amazing. Great for everyone and a very lovely environment. The food is very fresh and the staff is friendly and very attentive to our needs. I was actually trying to avoid shellfish due to a recent food allergy and there was still so much variety of things that I could eat that I did not feel limited at all. The food is fresh and not too salty. I can't even say what was my favorite thing I ate here was  because all of it was great! It was such a nice surprise to see that they offer 10% off the total bill for checking in on yelp too! That was a sweet deal! Thank you for such a wonderful lunch Jasmine Tokyo! Looking forward to the next time I am in AZ to come here again!"}
{"text":"Overall experience, sub-par food at a premium price.  We were really excited to try Jasmine Tokyo.  The other reviews (tons of reviews from Elites as well) really sold us on this place.  The pictures of beautiful sushi, hot dishes, fresh raw oysters, and the made-to-order Udon/Soba soups are really impressive.  As we discovered, looks can be deceiving.  As other reviews have mentioned, Jasmine's atmosphere is quite odd.  You'll feel like you are in a steakhouse, which isn't far from the truth because they have a carving station with over-cooked prime rib, sausage, and ribs.  You'll soon forget about the decor, once you pass the beautiful spread of sushi and an extensive buffet.  On to the food: Everything is cold, stale, and tasteless.  Cold sushi and salad bar items are good.  However, cold food that is supposed to be warm is off-putting.  The only warm food is the stuff served at the carving station, which was actually overcooked from sitting in a sunlamp for, what tasted like, weeks.  We tried most of the items on the \"warm bar\" and didn't like anything.  In fact, I've never spit out so much food at any buffet.  Next, we both tried the Udon/Soba soups; the soups ended up being half eaten, with the two of us trying a quarter of each.  Vegetarians might enjoy their experience at Jasmine Tokyo more than we did, because half the bar seemed to cater to cold vegetable/fruit options.  However, the intentionally cold carnivore items were just as bad as their \"warm\" counterparts.  The sushi, despite being beautiful, was horribly stale.  It tasted like it'd been sitting out since the night before.  I'm a huge fan of raw oysters, but couldn't bring myself to try them here.  They had a horrible smell with a white liquid that had congealed to the side of the mollusk.  The only good thing that we can compliment Jasmine on is their employees.  Our waitress was extremely friendly, checked on us often, and bused our half full dishes away without complaint.  Our guess is that a lot of the reviews are from patrons that ate during a busy time.  We visited at 4:30pm with very few people in the restaurant.  Maybe, if the place is busy, the food might get replaced quickly resulting in fresher, warmer (if applicable), and taster items.  However, considering the experience we had, plus the final cost of the meal (Even after the 10% Yelp discount, the buffet was twice what we'd normally expect), we would have a very hard time giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet..  everything you want even if you didnt think youd find it there, like prime rib, blue point oysters on the half shell... Crab legs and great sushi"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sushi is always fresh and tasty!  Service is also great.  Lunch prices are great and dinner/holiday a bit high.  If you like variety and fresh food, give it a shot."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Jasmine Tokyo Asian Buffet at the recommendation of my massage therapist who is in the neighborhood. She said that although it is a little pricey, the lunch buffet is reasonable, and she particularly enjoys the assortment of vegetables that they serve. I had just had my massage, I hadn't eaten yet, I wanted something on the healthy side, and it was just after their 11:00 am opening time - so I decided to go directly there.   I rejoiced at finding a parking space in the shade, and counted myself blessed at that point. As I entered, and waited to be seated, I noticed how large and extensive the buffet was. A friendly hostess greeted me and showed me to a table, where a friendly server immediately came to take my beverage order.   Before even picking up a plate, I walked the entire buffet twice, just to decide on a strategy. The selection was huge, including made to order Udon and Soba noodle soups, to assorted sushi (nori and rolls), assorted tempura, lots Japanese and Chinese dishes, assorted salads, vegetables of every description and with varied preparations, tofu dishes, desserts, 3 Asian soups, and more. There was LOTS of variety.   I decided to start with salads and vegetables, ease from there into slightly heavier fare, and wrap up with a sampling of desserts.   There was not a vegetable that I tried that I did not enjoy, although some of them needed a bit of additional seasoning. I had fried rice with my veggies, and while it was just ok, it was better than what I've had at other buffets, and was loaded with onions, and other tasty tidbits. On the first trip, I has stuck to very small portions. I would have been perfectly happy sticking with a second plate just like the first, but I wanted to sample additional items.  I loved the Tofu Lovers dish which was in a light but flavorful sauce with lots of delicious broccoli and cabbage. I also tried the mushroom chicken, the sesame balls, and red snapper, tuna, and salmon nori. I opted not to try any of the sushi rolls or tempura. I was tempted to have Udon noodle soup, but knew that there was no way I would have room in my stomach to do it justice. I got a bit more fried rice, and some more vegetables.  The nori was pretty flavorless, even with wasabi and soy sauce, and a bit on the dry side. Not odd for a buffet, but at least it didn't taste fishy. The other dishes beyond the Tofu Lover were pretty so-so. The beef dishes looked good, but I didn't really want beef today.  I should have skipped the dessert course. The cookies were heavy and didn't have much flavor. I tried four tiny pieces of cake (different kinds) and every single piece was soggy (wet) on the bottom. Once I discovered that, I gave up on the desserts and called it a day.  My server promptly brought me my check, and closed me out, thanking me for coming, as did the hostess as I exited.  Bottom line, lots of variety, lots of what I wanted - vegetables and lighter fare, decent basics, except dessert, and a price that is reasonable only if you eat more than you generally might (I know I did). I'll go back again just for the vegetable selection, but I'll stick to lunch since dinner is almost double the price.  I really don't like buffets, but for a buffet, this wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place it has a lot of good options people who give low stars shouldn't be looking for the best sushi at a buffet the staff is very nice the restaurant is very clean I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Fabulosa comida...el mejor buffet oriental, no sólo la calidad y presentación son excelentes, sino la atención y el ambiente, nada ruidoso... Incluye barras de comida china, ensaladas de verduras y frutas, sushi de mínimo de 10 tipos, etc. Nos gusta ir cada domingo, a la hora de la cena, que aunque sube mucho el precio (22 dlls), lo vale, por las opciones extra que tiene, como las patitas de cangrejo, el roast beef y el sashimi. Si no son afectos a estas comidas conviene ir de 11 a 3:30 pm, tiene muchisima comida y por 12 dólares, postres, nieves, café recién colado, si lo piden."}
{"text":"pretty yummy!!!!!! I like the orange chicken and the crab legs"}
{"text":"Yum. Food is really amazing here. The former claim jumper place. Food well I love sushi there and really great beer selections. happy hour 3-6 pm$3 house wines $2 dollar select drafts !!!!sake bombers and more. We have been here more then a few times"}
{"text":"Wow, I normally would not expect much from an all you can eat Chinese buffet, especially with sushi. But this place definitely exceeded my expectations. There was unlimited sushi and sashimi, and the quality of both were solid which is pleasantly surprising for a Chinese buffet! On top of that, the environment was wonderful and the service was great! The other food choices were good, with a good variety but not over bearing. Overall I definitely recommend coming to this establishment!"}
{"text":"This building used to be a Claim Jumpers but now is an AYCE sushi/Chinese restaurant.  I can say that it rivals Pacific Seafood Buffet.   Jasmine has an entire counter of sushi choices, a lot of them are 'fried' rolls - which from my experience working in a sushi restaurant back in the days, fried rolls are generally day old or two sushi that can still be eatable if fried:  ie: not fresh.  They also have sashimi: salmon and tuna.  And of course, the regular california rolls.  They also have great tempura.    Crab legs are puny but not bad.  They have cold crab legs on one counter next to the unpeeled shrimp and oysters and hot crab legs next to the hot dishes such as fried rice, beef and broccoli, etc.    Hubby had the prime rib - they cut it for you - and he said it was pretty good - medium rare.  They also have a mongolian grill type thing where you pick your items and they cook it up for you. I actually have never tried it.    Desserts are of abundance and my favorite is the flan and the tapioca.    And here's a tip - if you check in through YELP at this place, you receive 20% off your bill!"}
{"text":"As expected of an all-you-can-eat buffet, they really try to fill you up with as much rice and as little fish as possible.  The fish is sliced wafer thin and placed on top of a heaping mound of rice, making for a not-so-appealling nigiri sushi.  The rest of the food was OK.  The gelato bar is great, however."}
{"text":"I see this place has a three and a half stars rating on Yelp, and I disagree with this - categorically.  People set their expectations too high. Gotta remember this is Phoenix, city where baking like ham in the oven is what you consider a normal day. You gotta remember that this is buffet place that I am 99.9% sure was an Elk Lodge set that inspired Twin Peaks. And finally, you have to remember that any buffet that isn't called Golden Corral may not be what you expect.  It really doesn't matter when you go, each time I have gone it has had plenty of spaces to park and has been at about 15 to 20% capacity. They have a wide range eats like: cold crab legs, hot crab legs, ribs, sushi, carrot cake -  basically, to harness the Captain Planet in me, you have the power! That is to either lower your cholesterol or give yourself Type-2 onset diabeeetus. But I digress.  Every piece of food I've gotten has tasted good, and I've never gotten sick. The service is impeccable also. I was seated for about 1.6 seconds when a lady came and got my drink order.   Bathrooms are pretty pristine also. The mens bathroom is quite clean, which is telling since it's a buffet. Typically when you have a buffet or somewhere where people consume large quantities of food, things can go wrong, and bathrooms can be the first victim. But it's spotless just like Jasmine.  For Phoenix, this a great buffet place to hit up. If you are looking for a buffet of the caliber of the Bellagio Hotel, look elsewhere, mainly Vegas. If you are looking for somewhere to eat when you really don't know what you want, but wanna get out and have a wide array of options that won't disappoint, hit up Jasmine Tokyo."}
{"text":"Asian Buffet in the old Claim Jumper location around Shea and Scottsdale Road.  Good selection of sushi and Tempura. Depends when you go how fresh the sushi is. Go when it is busy and the sushi is fresh because of the turnover.  The meat area is very good with prime rib, chinese bbq ribs and sausage. Prime rib was actually juicy and very well prepared considered it is a buffet. Chinese bbq ribs are well prepared and very authentic.  There is a selection of shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs don't look like high quality.  There are of course the usual fried rice, chow mein, mayo shrimp, Chicken teriyaki along with an array of desserts and ice cream.  My favorite is the salt and pepper shrimp with the head. You have to tear off the head and eat the shrimp with the shell and legs where all the flavor is at.  Beverages are not included.  Overall pretty good food and will be back again."}
{"text":"Really good. Lots of good food and one of the cleanest Asian buffets that I've ever seen."}
{"text":"I just picked up to go udon noodle soup and it was very good! It had crab, big udon noodles, good broth, green onions and seaweed in it. Pretty cheap too so I will definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
