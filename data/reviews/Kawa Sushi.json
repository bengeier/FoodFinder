{"text":"We ordered dynamite and green dragon roll. The fish was not fresh, and they both tasted like tempura, mayonnaise and rice! not worth it at all."}
{"text":"We lucked out on finding this gem in what is generally a horrible strip for food.

(and doubly lucky that they had some fresh Toro in stock!)  

We mostly had nigiri, with very generous slices of tuna, well presented, and wow that toro was amaaazing.  The rolls range from standard to very creative as well.  And pricing is quite reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"nice restaurant! really good sushi and very FRESH sashimi at reasonable price. If you want their lobster sashimi (which is really good, I bring all my friends there just to try it out) you have to call in a day in advance and tell them you want lobster sashimi =) lasy serving was really nice, a highly recommend this restaurant, def worth a try!"}
{"text":"Been here several times now and it has never disappointed me yet. Love their salmon as well as everything else.

It's never packed even though its a small little restaurant but food is always fresh. 

Friendly service and great food!  My default japanese restaurant in my area."}
{"text":"I am a very big fan of sushi so I have visited many sushi places throughout Toronto, but I usually end up dissapointed by the quality, quantity, or both when it comes to the sashimi.

However, that is no longer a problem for me after I discovered Kawa Sushi. Earlier today, I ordered their salmon sashimi for takeout. I was immediately blown away by the portions. Compared to many other sushi places, the quantity was a lot larger for the same price.

Aside from the quantity, the quality of the salmon was very fresh. It didn't have a dry or grainy texture like many of the \"all you can eat\" sushi locations. It had just the right amount of fattiness and was an absolute pleasure to eat.

I am positive their sashimi reflects the rest of their menu as well and would highly suggest it to any lovers of sushi or japanese cuisine like me."}
{"text":"This is one of the best downtown sushi spots.  Lots of choice and great atmosphere.  In addition, open late so if you have the munchies this is the place!"}
{"text":"really nice place?they got high quality food and service and affordable price?highly recommend their combos like dinner for 2?weather dine in, take out, or delivery, go for kawa sushi, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, prompt service, and great prices.

Only complaint I have is the sushi rice was a bit too cold and rigid, like it was stored in a fridge before. Would be nicer it was slightly warmer."}
{"text":"Since my first review I must have forgotten that I was unhappy my first time. I reordered from them a couple of times since and was quite happy. However. Tonight. I ordered from them. Waited over an hour. Called, only to get that they are really busy and would START our meal at some point ! I am not a happy client at all!!!! Never again !!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just ate at Kawa Sushi for the first time and we LOVED IT!!!

The restaurant is so cute (but very small) ... great design, and I love the little vases with fresh flowers everywhere. Nice touch! 

I have a shellfish allergy, but I love the vegetarian rolls, and they ensured me that all of the cutting boards and knives would be washed and that my meal would not come in contact with any seafood at all. 
Hours later and I'm A-OK! =]

The food is delicious! Prices are great! ... and the service was A+++++++++++++. 

We will definitely be going back again soon!! =]"}
{"text":"This is a very small sushi restaurant, it seems like it's only operated with 1 server and 1 chef, who is managing both the sushi bar and the cooking in the kitchen. There are exactly 20 seats in this narrow restaurant. I think they mostly provide take-out or delivery service for the neighbourhood, that's why they don't need that many tables. If you do want to dine-in, they also take reservation.

However, I was kind of disappointed...the food is alright, I'll give it a 3.5 star, just slightly better than an average sushi joint. The service is super slow! (well, I'm not sure if that's a fair statement, but at least it was ridiculously slow when I went on Dec 31st new years eve) They gotta improve this if they want their customer to return. Unless, like I mentioned above, their target market is take-out and delivery."}
{"text":"Went for a 730 dinner on a Friday night.  Was empty when we arrived but filled up before we left.  Smelled like chlorine when we entered, as if the floors had just been cleaned.

Ordered the Pork Katsu Bento with BBQ sauce, a Green dragon roll and a Hamachi roll.  The katsu was battered appropriately, meat was juicy, bbq sauce was the authentic tonkatsu sauce.  They were nice enough to accommodate our request to substitute the tuna for salmon nigiri.

The rolls were alright.  The big issue was that the sushi rice was cold and not seasoned well, at least we could not taste any vinegar.  Another thing that stood out about the rice was that there seemed to be the occasional grain of rice that was harder (less cooked?) than the rest.  The rice that came with the bento box was long-grain, which also seemed odd.  Otherwise the other ingredients tasted fresh, including the hamachi.  

The miso soup had enoki mushrooms in it, which were a nice touch.  

Tea was filled consistently. Washroom was clean.

Would maybe return if in the area."}
{"text":"I have been a dedicated patron and the food is always fresh and made to order.
If you pay by cash you get 10%off your total bill when there.

They are always welcoming and really nice, I always go for the lunch specials which is from 11:30am to 5pm. 

You can choose of the Lunch Menu where you get Sushi with Miso Soup or House Salad. I like the Miso soup more so I always opt for that and it has a few Enoki Mushrooms added as well.

They always give you generous amounts of Soy Sauce, Ginger and Wasabi with orders. 

I have had quite a lot of their Sushi and only one of the Rice Bowls which was the Chicken Teriyaki  which comes with a soup or salad during lunch for 6.99$.

I really love this place, so does everyone I brought here. 

In short - \"The food is fresh, tasty and really good, and its priced really well\" head here for Food."}
{"text":"The waitresses were amazingly attentive and were so kind. They were patient the few times me and a few friends were indecisive.

The food is great too. I've never had an experience where the fish was fishy, or where I could sense the rice or other ingredients may have been not fresh. 

Prices are reasonable, perhaps even leaning towards the cheaper side of the average pricing.

I had their bento boxes, yakisoba, rolls, etc...the tempura is crisp, the sauce tasted okay and was a bit runny, but their rice and maki were spot on.

I recommend this place if you're looking for a nice, nearby sushi place to enjoy."}
{"text":"Loved the food! I ordered:
Takoyaki, Vegetable Tempura, Miso Soup, Caterpillar Rolls.
All were delicious. Friendly service. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Kawa Sushi is definitely a hidden gem. MUST TRY! I love the food here: both sushi and sashimi are awesome. Service is great: a cute family run place. And the hours are convenient: open until 11 pm."}
{"text":"LOVE.

On a recent visit to Toronto, after a couple weeks on the road, my friend and I were craving some sushi. We both eat A LOT of sushi, typically.

And while I won't claim I'm some crazy expert that can taste the difference in the rice/ vinegar ratio, I do know my fish.

TOTAL SCORE.

Charming atmosphere ( although small )

Stellar, fresh sushi ( no Hamachi - cause, you know, the whole unfortunate nuclear Japan bit.)

Excellent service. I wanted to take the owner home with me to the States she was so darn cute and awesome

In fact, I was relating a story to my friend over dinner and had a complete and utter laughing fit - which turned into crying-laughing, crazy- coughing 
( no snorting, thank god) fit and I couldn't stop for 5 minutes.

When I did stop, the owner came right over and brought me some tea -although I hadn't ordered it - to calm me and my throat down.

How sweet is that?

Eat at Kawa. The end."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Great sushi and maki rolls with just the right amount of rice! I usually gage Japanese restaurant my the amount of rice around the maki roll- this place has a very small amount (perfect for those watching their carb intake). Try the rolls based on chef's recommendation! I also recommend spicy crunchy salmon, dynamite, green dragon and yam & avocado! The veggie & shrimp tempura is a good app to start with! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"outstanding taste, fresh, creative and very reasonably priced. service and ambience excellent. hard to beat."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. We ordered two appetizers and kawa roll and sashimi boat, all are delicious. I recommend the beef with enoki mushroom, very fresh and juicy, marvellous. The sashimi are in good shape, not too thick nor too thin and arranged nicely. Overall great experience here."}
{"text":"Best a la carte sushi in the GTA. Quality is great, same with quantity. Owned my a cute couple with two kids -very nice and polite. Sushi is always fresh and presentation is flawless. Atmosphere is small and cozy. I would recommend Kawa to anyone looking for a great a la carte sushi place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The food was weirdly tasteless and clearly not fresh to a point that we gave up on eating it. We did order late on Saturday night though, so maybe that's why."}
{"text":"so I recently ordered from Kawa Sushi through their online ordering system. After the order was confirmed, I was informed that the delivery would take 90 minutes. I called and cancelled the order, and they assured that a refund would be issued, 9 days later and no refund has been issued. 

If you want a new and interesting way to lose $43.17, I suggest you try kawa sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered rolls for takeout.  This is my new favourite sushi place in the Church-Wellesley Village!  Their rolls were well made and delicious, their miso soup and salad were both good, and their prices were reasonable.  The only downside was that it took quite a bit longer than they originally told me to make the order."}
{"text":"Ordered the Shiitake Mushroom Avocado Roll, the Black Pearl Roll and the Red Dragon Roll for delivery. The variety of sushi rolls on the the menu is appealing, unfortunately, the preparation of the sushi was rather mediocre. The sushi rice was still warm, rolls were partially cut, the seaweed wrapping was soggy, soy-sauce was spilled all over the bag and the sushi was extremely rice heavy; thus, there is definite need for improvement on how the food is prepared and delivered. However, flavours were there, so I would recommend going to this sushi bar and giving it a try, but opt out if you need it to be delivered. 

P.S. Was extremely hungry, so couldn't get a chance to take any pics."}
{"text":"What a surprise!
Fairly nondescript on the inside and with lots of sushi places in the neighborhood, it would be hard to pick Kawa sushi out of a crowd, but excellent quality fish and highly creative rolls made this an amazing experience
Crazy good value for the price
I think it must be a new chef as I've been here before and didn't remember it this good....will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Kawa Sushi is officially my go-to sushi bar. Not only because I live nearby, but because the quality and presentation is unmatched. Ever been to Vancouver? That good. On my latest visit, I had the seaweed salad, miso soup, beef dumplings, salmon sashimi, green dragon roll, and spicy salmon roll. Everything was perfect, especially the sashimi. Next-level fresh. I left the restaurant with an apparent baby bump."}
{"text":"Great cost-benefit ratio :)
I visit there quite often.
Today I will visit there with my little brother!!"}
{"text":"Have been to the restaurant a couple of times, ordered in many times. The restaurant itself is a more intimate atmosphere but with two guests we get seated quickly. 

Sushi is pretty good quality-wise but the selection is ordinary.  They have the same stuff everyone else has (dragon rolls, eel roles, spicy rolls etc).  Sashimi is good quality and large peices. However the food is a little overpriced. 

The beef-wraped mushrooms are a good Appetizer."}
{"text":"I ordered blue fin tuna sashimi and pepper tataki. The tuna was very fresh and oily.  Very decent and quiet Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered from Just Eat, sushi was terrible, not fresh at all. Unfortunate, thought the 4 stars meant something. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Been here for dine in and take out. Food is good and same with service. Prices are very good and especially, for take out when you pay cash - 10% discount. I typically order a sushi roll. I will continue to visit since I live around the corner and would encourage others to give them a try"}
{"text":"Good sushi. Friendly service. Reasonable prices. I'm a visitor to Toronto, and I would recommend it to locals and to visitors."}
{"text":"Fantastic!

This small mom-and-pop joint on Church serves up some delectable sushi and sashimi. As others have mentioned, the space is small but intimate with nice Japanese murals on the walls.

The service was very good and super-friendly. I had a sighting of the owner's young son who was drawing caricatures of two men who were dining at a table in the corner of the restaurant.

Didn't get too adventurous on my trip here - ordered the beef teriyaki bento box ($14) and a side of salmon sashimi ($5). The fish was fresh, and the tempura was evenly-battered, crispy and well prepared. Given the freshness of the ingredients and the price, this will become my new go-to place for sushi.

Great overall!"}
{"text":"very clean and inexpensive. a great lunch option."}
{"text":"I've never sat down to eat here, just ordered take away. My only gripe with kawa sushi is that sometimes I'll be out running errands and need to order here so that I can finish, then pick up. More than once they haven't been open until 11:30-11:45. I know it's a trivial thing to pick at but it's kind of annoying.

Having said that, the quality, for what you pay, is excellent. I love ordering a bunch of rolls (rock n roll is my favourite) and watch kung fu movies at my friends place while grazing.

I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for my order which I think is pretty good. Service is nonchalant but not impolite. which i actually kind of enjoy!

Don't go in expecting MIND-BLOWING HOLY CRAP delicious rolls. It's very tasty with a price-point to match. That's why it's a good spot to eat."}
{"text":"Had high hopes because of the yelp reviews but I was very disappointed. I ordered the deluxe chirashi don. The rice that came with it was dry and brittle and the fish wasn't very fresh. Felt like a waste of a meal."}
{"text":"The 4 is for speed. I had to suggest something for about 8 people to go to with 1 hour for lunch, and this was the closest sushi place that wasn't a 3 star. Everything came sequentially in 15 minutes. Salmon wasn't too fishy, and I'm not even a salmon fan. The group was from Vancouver; no major complaints about the sushi, but not blown away either. They offer your usual cliché sushi pizza and philadelphia rolls too.

I was worried a gluten-sensitive coworker would be alienated, but luckily they had gluten-free soy sauce. The seared whitefish is good, but other rolls in the party tray and sashimi arrangements were pretty standard."}
{"text":"Kawa has been my go-to sushi place for years.  After moving into the area a couple of  years back, I found Kawa as a result of a serious craving for Japanese curry and I haven't stopped going since then. 

Deluxe Spicy Salmon Roll ($8/4 pieces), Deep Fried Potato Cake ($3), Chicken Cutlet with Curry Sauce Bento ($13), Kawa Combo for 1 ($15) and the Takoyaki ($5) are my regulars.

The service here is great whether you eat in, pick up, or have it delivered.  The food is always fresh and always delicious!"}
{"text":"My second favourite sushi place downtown. Great service and reasonably priced. Although the restaurant is quite small, they turn the tables fast and the food doesn't take too long to arrive. 

Try the pork cutlet with curry sauce if you feel like something different. Their salad has an interesting dressing with a bit of a kick to it.

A solid four stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing. No more like, ... AH- MAY-ZING!!! I Am a veg sushi lover and know when's it's good, and this is now my #1 ever...whoa."}
{"text":"Fresh sashimi, flavourful sushi at a reasonable price. Friendly service and at a nice location."}
{"text":"**Delivery review**

Great sushi, it's not the absolute best but quality is good enough. Prices aren't too too steep by Toronto standards. 
Ordered from their website where there is no delivery fee, just gotta tip the driver with a $25 minimum. Delivery came half an hour late. Everything was packaged nicely. Just slight spillage from the miso soup, which had lots of seaweed, tofu and enoki.

Chicken teriyaki bento box ($15): tempura was still crispy but lots of batter. I am saving the rest for lunch tomorrow so no comment on the rest of the box yet. 

Kawa combo for 1 ($18): large pieces of fish. The salmon avocado roll was stuffed with salmon which made me happy. Red tuna was fresh but had some chewy (impossible to chew) bits. Salmon sashimi had 2 bones in it sadly UGH. Shrimp and the seared white fish were good, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This is an excellent little place in the neighbourhood. Every time, the food is fresh and tasty.
And they give ample ginger and soy sauce too!"}
{"text":"This s my favorite sushi restaurant since I been moving to this area. They had very good potion of the rolls. And very less rice on the roll. My top picks are Crazy Tuna Roll and Salmon Sashimi , Blue Fin Tuna.

Don't need to look for a sushi restaurant now this s my new go to ."}
{"text":"Much like Chris P. below, I was keen on trying a new sushi place near me (see my recent review of Kokyo for some reasons why I've been craving a new perspective.)

Kawa was a step forward in terms of the quality of sushi I've had in Toronto! They lay out their menu much like other places, with a la carte sushi, teppan/cooked items and appetizers bookended with a number of combo/boat options and quite a few specialty rolls. 

The price-to-performance ration is dang good at this place! You can get a lunch combo with 9-12 pieces of sushi, sashimi and/or rolls plus crisp, gingery-dressed salad and flavourful (but not over-salted) miso soup for seven flipping dollars! They even offer discounts on takeout to save you an extra bit of cash.

I had a combo with the house creation Kamakachi roll (with chopped tuna and onion, tempura flakes and spicy sauce) as well as some salmon, tuna, white tuna and snapper nigiri (it would have come with yellowtail, but they were out and I chose to sub an extra piece of tuna.)

The roll was very nice- it avoided the major problem of most rolls with a spicy component, i.e tasting too much like goopy mayonnaise and sriracha and nothing else. It was tangy and bright but you could still taste the buttery tuna inside. One thing that I will remark about the rolls - they're not gigantic like at some of the other sushi places I've tried lately. I don't enjoy eating a huge roll that I can barely fit in my mouth, so I was pleased by this difference. It's quality over quantity.

The nigiri is also nicely done. A quality piece of nigiri should look the part even before it gets into your mouth - the pieces of fish were adequately sized, the salmon was light pink with bands of marbling, the tuna and snapper pale, clean and soft. Fresh, light and flavourful all around - no stale or vinegary flavours to be had. Yum.

Small, bright, clean, friendly, cheap, quick and good quality - what more can I say? I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Ordered a sushi boat with the boyfriend to share and found it very enjoyable! My favourite sushi place downtown is still Wow thus far, but I think Kawa is a close second. Although this place is Chinese owned and not authentically Japanese, they did have some fresh fish for the sushi boat, and also the maki rolls that came with the boat were delicious! The spicy salmon roll for example, didn't have the typical hot sauce+mayo mixture, but instead had some kind of sriracha like concoction? Not sure how to word it but it was quite yummy and worth a try. 

Also, although the owners are chinese (heard them speak in mandarin), they do not have typical nonchalant chinese service, and dining utensils were 100% clean! Bonus points for hygiene and good service! Will recommend you check out this place if you're in the area along with Wow."}
{"text":"Great sushi! I got the #5-S (veggie combo) and my date got the chicken fried rice tappanyaki. He said it was one of his favorite fried rices he's ever had. The sushi was so good, tasted really fresh. 

Try it out!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. Service is excellent and attentive, sashimi is fresh, sushi and rolls were well-made and contained an acceptable amount of rice, the decor is bright and there is a beautiful painting on the wall, no complaints. I thoroughly enjoyed my whole meal. 

If I lived closer, it could possibly be a potential regular sushi spot for me."}
{"text":"3.5 
Very friendly service. Our server was kind and bubbly. Fun atmosphere with some cool murals. If you sit by the window, you can people watch and see some interesting  folk! 
They have plenty of variety. We quite enjoyed the black pearl role, which featuref BBQ eel. 
We topped it off with some green tea ice cream.
Good experience."}
{"text":"Delicious. I ordered the Sushi Roll combo box ($15) for dinner (6 pcs each of dynamite, kamakachi and california) with house salad ($3) on the side. The bill came out to about $25 post-tax/tips. I was pleasantly surprised! Sushi rolls are pleasantly warm and the tempura bits inside the dynamite and kamakachi rolls were nice and crispy despite my having delivered the order. The latter roll contains smoked salmon with spicy mayo and crunch bits - tasty! I liked how the rows on the plate were arranged to alternate between the three types of rolls I ordered (a fairly inconsequential detail, but I appreciate the chefs having taken the time to put it together in this aesthetically pleasing way instead of simply placing rolls of the same type together as usual!). And I received a complimentary miso soup which I thought was a nice palate cleanser! Overall, one of the better sushi joints in the city without too hefty a price."}
{"text":"Lunch special bento boxes are decent.
Other lunch special menus are pretty small.
Food is pretty good but it can get pricy if you want to be full."}
{"text":"If I can give no stars I would've. The service was slow, which was the least of the problem of this place. The waiter had to repeatedly come back to my friend to clarify her order and tell her the item is no longer available (yet still on the menu??? Even though other items have already been whited out). They mixed up my vegetarian friends roll with one that has fish in it and although replaced it with the correct roll, after such a disastrous night maybe comp it? I left my chirashi mostly untouched and actually spat out the tuna after taking a bite. The server made the point to ask me how the tuna was and why I didn't eat it. When I replied that it was not fresh, he said he'll bring it up with the chef. Nothing came of it. Save your money, health, and time and go to another place in the area. For the same price WOW Sushi has better food and for a slightly higher price Mt.Fuji is a million times better (all within 10mins walk). Never. Ever. Coming. Back. This Yelp 4 star is such a sham."}
{"text":"Alright, a reasonable option, but never found anything really great 
Cute location

Sushi pizza is unusual with chopped peppers.... Ive got it once, didnt like it, forgot how I didnt like it, ordered it again and still didnt like it.
Reliable, generally good service."}
{"text":"I'm actually fairly disappointed with my takeout platter that I ordered from here. Judging by the high rating and the seemingly delicious looking photos, I was pretty excited to get the regular party tray (which contained sushi, sashimi, and maki rolls) so I could try a little of everything.

It was $45 for 45 pieces (plus tax), so essentially a little over $1/pc and let me assure you... for the quality of what I got, I would definitely not order it again. Albeit the rolls were fine (good salmon to rice ratio), the cuts of fish from the sashimi/sushi weren't that fresh, the variety was very limited, and I nearly sliced my mouth from a fish scale that I found in one of my pieces of sushi... 

Overall, the platter was just disappointing. Not worth the money. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Since I learned of the demise of Sushi 67 (*tear*), I've been hoping to find another creative sushi restaurant.  I'm not a stickler for traditional sushi, I love when they try something a little different.  And we found it in Kawa Sushi!

We unfortunately ordered way more than we could eat.  It was very, very sad.  Our eyes were simply bigger than our stomachs.  BUT, at least we got a taste of everything we ordered.  We started with edamame, which was delicious and salty.  We also had the Crazy Roll, the Green Dragon Roll, the Moscow Roll, and the Salmon Kamakachi Roll.  Moscow was probably my favourite, even though I couldn't fit it in my mouth in one bite.  I made a failed attempt, then had to bite it in half.  It stayed together though, and was absolutely delicious.  Most of the rolls didn't even need soy sauce!  

All in all, a great little sushi place that I will definitely be back to.  If only there was a place like this on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"AAAAAAAHHHHH! KAWA SUSHI! 
I'm just psyched from the menu. The Pedo Roll/Virgin Sunshine Roll looks both confusing and exciting. As it should be. 
The range of deep fried options make my arteries shiver with anticipation.
I have ordered:
Tempura scallops,
Eggplant sushi pizza,
Deep fried sweet potato rolls,
and apple cinnamon spring rolls.
(I'm eating with a vegetarian, which makes me keenly aware of the lack of bacon on this menu. Tempura Bacon ... *drool*). 

Review, it was tasty. I was happy."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me 4 years of living in the village to find this place. I haven't had fish this fresh anywhere in Toronto before. I've now visited twice, and both times the food has been exceptional and great value for money. It's great to find an affordable sushi restaurant where the fish tastes fresh and clear...not like its been sitting out for 3 days. I will definitely be eating here again and again. The space is tiny, and it's clearly a family enterprise (there's always little kids quietly playing in the corner) but that simply adds to the charm."}
{"text":"Have a delisious sushi dinner today. Super friendly personnel. We came about before close time, but noone rush us to finish!  Sushi were delisious and they have a really tasty miso soup. Will definitively came back."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place. After watching the Pride Parade today in the rain we realized we were all abit hungry and in need of some hot tea. 

We found this place on help and read it was one of the better rated places on church street. Let me tell you - it's amazing.

I got the takoyaki, fried calamari and the chicken cutlet with curry sauce bento box. All things mentioned were delicious and filling. 

The service was fast, food quite hot and everything was clean and cozy. Honestly a great place to eat. If I am in the area again I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was expecting Kawa to wow me just a bit more, but in the end while their food was good and worth the money ($15 for a sushi combo featuring around 8 or so different types of sushi and a hand roll) I was not a fan of of simple things like the fact that the food did take some time to get to us despite there being only 1 other table before us and that it didn't completely blow me away.

Make no mistake, Kawa is certainly miles above your average tiny sushi joint in terms of the quality so I would most definitely visit here once again especially given their convenient location to me. 

I was a big fan of their miso soup though because instead of having the same tried out formula you see in almost all other sushi joints, their miso soup tasted different and actually had a solid amount of enokitake mushrooms which I'm always a fan of. Their salad too was tasty and had a good dressing on it. 

A couple of things they could have done at their own expense to earn an extra star was to have brought me a glass of water as everyone else opted for water while I went for tea, and when one guy in our group didn't have soup and salad included in his meal they could have brought him over something at least. I know it seems a little harsh to criticise a business for not providing free stuff, but that sort of thing has happened to me in the past and could really enhance the experience. 

Overall, satisfied with the food, but they still have a few details to hammer out to be completely awesome in my book."}
{"text":"Best rolls I've had in most restaurants in Toronto.   The place has a small intimate feel and the walls have hand painted murals that are very beautiful. 

I'm usually a sushi snob and only go to Omikase restaurants, but this place could easily charge high end prices for the quality but the prices are quite low.

It can be a bit quiet / they could use some music playing but otherwise it's a really nice place. 

Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I really like it. It's one of the few sushi houses in this area that I find worth visiting. It's fairly non-descript and you could easily walk pass it. However, the fish is fresh and the service is great. You can eat in, pick up or get food delivered from here. It's not AYCE and the price can add up quickly, however, I find that there's a great selection of apps, bento boxes and sushi that would satisfy any diner."}
{"text":"Came in at 10:30, wasn't expecting anything good but it was surprisingly delicious. Ordered the sashimi boat with 5 different rolls. :) will come back next time"}
{"text":"Another great visit at Kawa Sushi

Service was quick and sushi was really fresh. We ordered a mix Sushi and Sashimi plate. Beef enoki roll was tasteful. 

We stopped by for a quick bit before heading to a concert, parked on the street, in and out within 45mins. Speedy service, just wonderful every time.

The owner recommended a new sparkling grapefruit jelly SAKE !!  It was unique and delicious for a hot day.

Go try it out, you cannot buy at LCBO.

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Popped in to the local sushi place that is always packed for a quick lunch. 

Ordered a Moscow Roll & a Deluxe  spicy Salmon Roll. Both were outstanding. Yummy!!!!

The place has about 9 tables and the decor is nothing to write home about. The place has a terrible echo - hearing everything that everyone is talking about is rather disturbing."}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is right.  This restaurant is pretty casual and gives out a diner vibe, nothing fancy.  Don't let that fool you, though, cuz the food is fantastic.  I came here for dinner on a week night and it was pretty empty.  We got a nice seat by the window that overlooked Church St.  The waitress was nice and friendly.

There were many options on the menu, including scallops!  Here's what I tried:

Seaweed Salad $4 - Pretty good and nice size.

Deep fried beef dumplings $4 - I would order these again.

Fire Cracker Dream  $5 - Scallop, tempura flakes, spicy mayo.  This was good, especially since I was in the mood for scallops. 

Moscow Roll - $8/5pcs - Salmon, tuna, hamachi, green onion, cream cheese deep fried w/special house sauce.  MAN, this was DELICIOUS!  The cream cheese thing is not for everyone, but I LOVE IT!  The texture was great (crunchy and creamy) and the sauce was fantastic bursting with flavor.  I would come back for these in a heartbeat.  Just for this, 5 stars.

Large Hot Sake - $7 - Drinkable :)

My vegetarian friend was happy because there were more vegetarian options than just salad and edamame.  They have several vegetarian sushi rolls on the menu (e.g. Asparagus Roll, Deep Fried Sweet Potato Roll, Shiitake Mushroom Roll, etc.)."}
{"text":"Ordered Kawa Sushi combo for one, which is basically an assortment of sashimi, sushi, a couple of pieces of eel sushi, and a salmon hand roll with miso soup and salad.  This was $15.  I wouldn't say it's cheap, but for the quality of food, it's very good value.   

When I was first walked into the place at 1 pm on a Wednesday, there was absolutely no one here. This scared me off. Luckily, when we saw some $6.99 lunch specials, this persuaded me to stay.    People came in after us and they all seemed to enjoy the meal.  I thought the salmon, snapper, and tuna were all very fresh and didn't have much of a fishy smell.  

However, what I really enjoyed was the eel sushi. It was BBQed to perfection. Definitely a hidden gem off of Church.  

So breakdown:

Presentation: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5
Service 3.5/5
Decor: 3.5/5.  
Pricing: 4/5."}
{"text":"3.5/5: Friendly service, and we got to use the check-in offer for some free sake! Overall, I would say the restaurant is pretty standard in comparison to other sushi restaurants around Toronto. Nothing outrageous that sets it apart, but still tasty for the price! We got the black pearl roll and I can't remember the other one - but it was fairly tasty! 

Pretty good if you can't figure out what to eat and you're in the area. Would go again for a quick fix!"}
{"text":"I am actually surprised by all the great reviews, pretty average tasting food. If you're in the area try \"daily sushi\" before coming here."}
{"text":"Wait staff were great and friendly but the chefs in the back need to step up their game. The food wasn't good. 

Tempura wasn't crispy or flakey at all. The sushi and tuna sashimi weren't fresh.

Price wasn't too bad. But then again for the quality of food, I would've spent that money elsewhere. 

I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I placed an order online for delivery from KAWA sushi and we did not hear from them for over an hour and 20 minutes. When we called in they put us on hold for 20 minutes and said that it was coming. We had to call them a second time to confirm and they told us the order wasn't on the way yet. The most they could do after 1. misleading us and 2. making our party wait for almost 2 hours was offer 15 % off which is ridiculous given the wait time and poor and rude service over the telephone.

Overall this was a really bad experience and I would not recommend (at least delivery and pickup)"}
{"text":"Quality raw materials, excellent chef, meticulously prepared delicacy, cozy enviornment, and a relatively inexpensive pricing."}
{"text":"I have been to Kawa Sushi twice, and it was always a great experience. The sushi here is consistently well made. The server is always friendly and provides quick service. I've tried their signature kawa roll and sashimi boat. The sashimi tasted very fresh with good quality. The kawa roll is my favourite here! Each roll is almost double the size of regular sushi. The crispy fried lobster combined with the tangy mango sauce comes together very nicely. 

The restaurant is good for both sit down and takeout. It's a must try if you are in the Church-Wellesley area!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Kawa sushi a bunch of times. The sushi is hit or miss - depending on who is making it that night. 

We have had a bad experience with their delivery guy - who takes over 1:10 min to arrive when we are only two blocks away. He also directly asks for tips before we even finish with the debit machine - he makes it very awkward. 

Overall I get sushi here for convenience, but not for taste or the level of service."}
{"text":"I was attracted by the lobster sashimi at the beginning. Now my favorite is \"Enter the Dragon Roll\"! The one with shrimp tempura+ roasted salmon& scallop and with goldleaf on top of it as decoration. Wonderful experience here! Also it's worth to try their special pepper tuna tataki."}
{"text":"Small, not too noisy (depending on the other patrons, of course), excellent menu selection, friendly and efficient service, reasonable prices.

We've both eaten here a number of times, and had delivery twice.  On all occasions everything was excellent.  No complaints!  ^_^"}
{"text":"Being in Toronto for the last few weeks and being a huge fan of sushi, I've done my fair share of exploring. This place popped up on yelp, and was just around the corner, so we decided to walk in and give it a try. It was not too busy on a Thursday evening, and we were seated quickly without waiting. 

I was pleased with the range of 'fancy' rolls available. Now don't get me wrong; I'm completely fine with the usual tempura/teriyaki chicken/red dragon roll combo. But once in a while, I do enjoy being adventurous and sampling the more strange and inventive. I've found that in Toronto, places that offer these weird rolls are less common.

We ordered the Moscow roll, the fire kamakachi, a seared salmon sushi, and some spicy salmon rolls. The fire kamakachi was definitely the best roll, but the seaered salmon was an interesting twist on a traditional sushi, and we enjoyed it too. We wrapped up the meal with a tempura appetizer, and paid about 18 bucks each. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some inexpensive sushi near Welsley and Church.  Yelp recommended Kawa and I was not disapointed.  Their menu is typical for the \"better than all you can eat\" but not super high class sushi either, very Canadian-sushi.  Their are veggie options for vegetarian and vegan eaters.

My boyfriend ordered some vegetable tempura and chicken teriyaki and I went with the chirachi.  The chirachi came with a hot bowl of miso soup, which was okay but nothing memorable, and a typical, terrible, iceburg lettuce sushi restaurant salad.  Both of our meals were delicious; everything was fresh and well seasoned.  Our whole meal was 23$ with taxes, for dinner, on a weekend.  If you're looking for cheap sushi in the Village, Kawa Sushi cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Love it here! Great sushi with fast and friendly service. We mainly order maki rolls and sushi pizza. It's delicious and we eat here quite often!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews on Yelp I was hesitant of ordering from this place... it was 10:30 and unfortunately this was the only place that was open that had higher stars than the other restaurants. I took a chance and ordered salmon sashimi, Philadelphia roll and spicy salmon hand roll. Delivery was only 20 mins and the food actually tastes pretty good! I am really satisfied and is glad I took a chance with Kawa! I will definitely be ordering from you guys again. 5/5 for the quality of the sashimi"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for the ayce lunch. Although they're slightly more expensive but it's worth it. Everything was well prepared and consistent. Will definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good sushi meal."}
{"text":"The food was great! Love my curry pork bento box. The only issue was they forgot to put our order in and other guests who ordered after us were getting their orders way before we did. We were pretty hungry waiting the extra 20 mins for food. They did apologize and give us 10% off which sort of made up for it."}
{"text":"Unremarkable!

My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new sushi place tonight and after reading the review here, we decided to go to Kawa Sushi. We ordered a maki combo and spicy salmon. Both were terrible. Each roll in the set tasted exactly the same of tempura and mayonaise. The spicy salmon was smothered in red hot sauce, the tabasco type. Very disappointed. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place. I decided to give it a try tonight. Unfortunately, they undercooked their rice which is the essential in sushi. I tell the waitress to inform the chef but didn't seem care. Well, definitely would not coming back again."}
{"text":"So glad to find a Japanese restaurant open late! My friends and I made a day visit to Toronto and were super hungry before getting drinks at Woodys. Ordered a sushi combo #1 and agedashi tofu. The sashimi cuts were so good, fresh taste, fatty when bitten into without that tendon-like texture. Agedashi tofu was freshly fried too, without the watery microwaved texture you get at other places. Service was fast, friendly and watered refilled. Prices were very reasonable. Best of all, it's good Japanese food for late dinner at 1030pm!"}
{"text":"Ordered a sashimi combo, it was gross. The fish smelled 'fishy'  and half of it was actually still frozen when I got it (tasted awful), and really bad presentation, the cuts of fish were stringy at the edges and jagged (maybe they forgot where all the sharp knives were??).

I wish I could give a more detailed review, but honestly the look and smell of the fish convinced me one bite was enough. 

This isn't a premium susholi location but it's also not a bargain restaurant or an all you can eat, way to expensive to be serving people that quality of food.

Easily some of the worst fish I've had in the city...

I will say the service was prompt and courteous though"}
{"text":"Love this place, for delivery or to eat in. Good food and reasonably priced. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very poor food preparing and delivery handling. Part of the sushi isn't cut though which leaves a very thick piece. On the other hand, the soy sauce was spilled everywhere, on the napkins, the chopsticks and on the sushi. The overall presentation is a total disaster. This is unbelievable. It's the worst takeout experience that I have ever had so far. 

PS: I will post the photos."}
{"text":"We were the first customers for lunch yesterday and it felt nice to have the restaurant to ourselves since it was my boyfriends birthday. Small, clean, bright blue wall but nothing to write home about.

We both got a lunch special with some additional things. The miso soup was more flavorful then most spots I have been too although I can see some people thinking it might be on the edge of being salty. The salad and dressing were pretty basic. My BF liked his shrimp spring rolls but didn't care for the dipping sauce. The chicken teriyaki was a thin chicken breast with sauce drizzled over. It also comes with way too much rice and sat on top of a bed of bean sprouts with two baby pieces of broccoli. They could do better with their side of veggies as suggested on the menu.

The Avocado Cucumber role was fresh and ordinary. You can't go wrong unless you don't use fresh ingredients. We also got the Fried Sweet Potato roll which was different but we both ended up enjoying it. The sweet potato was fried in a tempura batter before being rolled. The BF really liked his Dragon roll which I can't comment much about because I don't eat seafood.

The only thing I didn't like was the hot sake which wasn't there fault. I know I don't like sake in general but wanted something warm.

Our total for everything came to about $45. Oh, no free refills on juice. I wouldn't trek across the city for this place but if your somewhat in the area then check it out!"}
{"text":"The service was fast & efficient, very friendly! They have delicious sushi! We tried the rainbow roll & the enter the dragon roll. Both were superb! The rainbow came with fresh fish on top, very delicious! The \"enter the dragon roll\" was made with tempura shrimp, topped with spicy mayo, eel sauce, salmon & scallops that was torched to stay on the roll. Very good!! The place was clean & in a nice neighborhood. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Having been back to Kawa Sushi seven or eight times after writing the last review, I have to say that I've noticed a definite decline in service. The food is still great, the prices are still good, but the wait time for food has noticeably increased. I've never seen more than one other table seated when I've been there, but for some reason it takes forever for the food to come lately."}
{"text":"The service was slow even when the place was almost empty. I spent nearly $20 for a bento box and it didn't really fill me."}
{"text":"The place is so small, but it's clean and the servers are great! Sometimes the food took a while to come, but it is so tasty and the portions are big.
The price is good if you see the portions' size.
I do recommend to try the specials that they have sometimes, I tried twice and it was always so nice combinations!"}
{"text":"Good service. Decent sushi rolls--definitely not the best I've ever had, but certainly not horrible. Their seaweed salad was good. I wasn't impressed by their miso soup, which was much less flavorful than I am accustomed to. It's a pretty small restaurant and has more of a lunch ambience in my opinion. I thought it was relatively inexpensive, and I was impressed by their selection of special rolls in particular. Overall, I would say it seems like a great option for lunch or delivery and a good one for dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped by the place because it was close to the hotel. I really enjoyed the sushi and the service was quick and attentive.

I'd suggest going there!"}
{"text":"Slow and hot. Not concerned with dine in customers at all. Mostly concerned with Uber Eats guys coming in. Service was really slow. Food was mediocre at best. Tuna was chopped and fatty and light in color. We won't go back again."}
{"text":"Decent sushi and a decent price. Although the quality isn't amazing, I would rate it higher in relation to the area. 4/5 if you only wanted sushi in the church and Wellesley area. This area isn't generally known for quality sushi. If you don't want to travel far this place is a pretty \"safe\" bet."}
{"text":"My name is Kate. And I am addicted to Kawa Sushi. 

I remember when I first moved into my apartment my landlord mentioned Kawa. \"Oh that place is good! It recently opened so it's nice to see they have business,\" he casually stated. Little did I know, this was only the beginning.  

Fast forward a handful of months. Kawa Sushi and I are now the best of amigos. Am I feeling lazy? Craving sushi? I can simply call and place an order and in 10 min it's ready. I have become a regular and the adorable staff laugh at my love for their salmon sushi pizza. Now and again they'll even throw in a free miso soup, because they're just that delightful. 

Care if I list a few more reason why I love it so?
- The price! $4 Salmon rolls! $7 for a giant (and I mean giant) Green Dragon roll! Yummy combos! 
- The staff! They are so so nice! It's a family business, and sometimes you'll spot they're young lil son (who is basically twins with that kid in Up) playing on his game boy. When my friend Amy and I stopped by for a snack on Halloween he even shared some of his Halloween candy with us. And he was dressed up as Buzz Lightyear. And it was so cute.   
- Did I mention the sushi pizza? Sushi pizza.

Kawa makes giving into my sushi cravings way too easy. And delicious. Go."}
{"text":"Delivery service was fast and food was good.  I would recommend it if ur stuck in a hotel n craving for some sushi"}
{"text":"Kaka. What should I say, I guess there isn't much to say because simply we are not welcomed. On a Tuesday early evening, the restaurant is already booked up. We went kindly but was greeted by a shockingly rude and condescending woman. We asked for a table of three. The only reply we got out of her was the restaurant is full. She gave us an impression that they are closing soon and wanted us to leave.  The time was just 6 pm on a Tuesday. We believe that it would be courteous to at least offer us a time to return for table.  We left with a disappointment.  I am surprise that this restaurant is still in business. People, there are a lot of equally good restaurants around the area. We definitely do not need to be treated as a sub class."}
{"text":"This place is run by a former chef at Ginza, so the menu is very similar. He does use better rice though, so the sushi tastes richer. 

Standout dishes:
Sushi Pizza
Kamakachi (tuna or salmon)
Black Cod

Just short of perfect. It's a 4.5 star place. The only drawback being that it has one sushi chef, and one server. But if you're not in a rush, then the great prices and fresh food will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"THE WORST RESTAURANT EVER!!!
I wrote my phone number wrong, and I admit that its my fault. I could accept if they asked for extra delivery fee, but THE LADY YELLED AT ME!! SHE YELLED AT ME LIKE I SLEPT WITH HER BOYFRIEND!!!   20min later I got my order.I only took the photo of terriyaki, which is the MOST DISGUSTING ONE!! I also ordered    shrimp tempura udon and spicy salmon roll and everything is THE MOST DISGUSTING FOOD I HV EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE!! The salmon and shrimp are both STINKY! And the tempura still has shell!! Shrimp with shell all over it!!!!!!!!!i am not gonna order it again and i hope the store would shut down tomorrow! the food is just disgusting!i hope no one would ever order it!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Spurred by the great reviews, I ordered a tempura rice bowl and a crispy calamari and brought everything back to my nearby hotel room. I was disappointed by the calamari, which is a favourite treat (not something I eat too often) - it was soggy (possibly from the 5 minute walk) and a bit over seasoned - not awful, but I've had much better. Avoid the miso soup - a bit too concentrated/salty (and white onions, not green?!?), although not inedible. The other items were quite good though. The tempura was perfect (sauce is delicious) and the side salad was a surprise highlight - their dressing is divine. The service was awesome."}
{"text":"We went in for the sushi, there was the of us, two of us ordered the deluexe chriashi don and the other had the Bento. There was an order error and the servers were able to correct the order. 

The sushi was good but portions for the chirashi don were smaller than expected. The Bento's portion were really big. Overall I had a great time other than the little issues we had. 

I would recommend  anyone getting a Bento from here if they're  in the area looking for sushi."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, awesome prices and stellar service! I come here frequently and I've never been disappointed. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a different sushi place close to home so I gave these guys a try. They were very friendly and offered me a seat and some tea while I was looking through the menu to place my take-out order.

The sushi was really good and the prices were reasonable. I probably won't stray from my normal go-to place but these guys are a good back-up option."}
{"text":"Great sushi! We got here on a hot summer Saturday. It was nice and cool inside. Friendly waitress, prompt service. Food was amazing! 

Try the spider roll if you like tempura rolls. The salmon sashimi was very fresh."}
{"text":"Not happy. I ordered delivery several times from this establishment. They sent me the wrong roll, not even close to what i ordered. I called to complain and they did not offer to correct it. There was no teriyaki sauce or onions in the roll like there was supposed to be. It was just mostly rice, cucumber, and a very small amount of tuna. I attempted to explain this to the lady on the phone. She was very unhelpful and told me sarcastically that she would tell the chef, and then hung up.How is it that they can just  give me something that I did not even order and not even care? I wasted $35.00 because I did not receive what I wanted. I AM NEVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"The kamakachi rolls here are amazing. The avocado rolls were fresh too. The soy sauce I'm not a fan of- oddly salty and bitter. Thankfully I got take out so I just used old soy sauce packets from other restaurants. The salad is awful as well. The miso soup is typical but they do put in some enoki mushrooms, which is a nice touch. The kamakachi roll alone makes this a 4 star sushi spot."}
{"text":"Paid 60 dollars for take out for 2 people. Sashimi are all paper thin, despite the fact that is super expensive. Delivery took 1.5 hours, no discount nor apologies and they promised 45 mins. 0/10 would not recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing staff!!! Really great and friendly!!! We're excited to come back here to dine in next time. :) we ordered the Moscow roll, spicy salmon, and dinner for 2))"}
{"text":"Ordered some vegan rolls as a post workout snack on my way home, they were awesome.  They tasted great and gave me that needed energy to get home pkeasently before my protein drink.  Keep it up KawaSushi, you are a go-to in the back of my head! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered pickup and the rice was so gross I don't think they even used sushi rice? Maybe it's because we ordered towards the end of the night but that's no excuse to serve old sushi. The salmon sushi was nasty and not fresh at all and now I have food poisoning! Never again."}
