{"text":"The food was terrible. We Ordered soup dumplings and had serious diarrhea afterwards!!! Also we tried the soup dumplings in Kungfu BBQ. It's really authentic."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.. I went to grab some lunch with a friend and there were only two tables including ours. Took them 25 mins to get our orders while both of the servers were on their phone. We didn't want raise our hand or call them out cuz that's simply rude but we were starving so my friend went over the counter and asked if we can order, they said ok give me one minute, why? I don't know. Maybe they had a rush hour before we came it  and were tired? Maybe they thought they wouldn't get a decent tip from us? Idk what the deal was. But anyway, if you've been there and got good a service, good for you, but if you were in the same boat as me, sucks. Don't think I'd ever coming back but if I really do crave their food, getting a takeout would be a better choice for me."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Chinese food in CU area and the manager is super nice. The xiao long bao (soup dumplings) is by far one of the best I have tried. I've lived in NYC and been to SF, LA, Vancouver where there are huge Asian populations, and their soup dumplings are definitely among the top 3 best soup dumplings I have had in the US. Their other dishes are all very good and authentic. Definitely try it if you are around the area!!"}
{"text":"Something embarrassing about me: I've visited this place four times. Each time, I left saying 'never again.' This time, I really, really mean it.

The final nail in the coffin:Lao Sze Chuan, famous for its authentic handmade Chinese dumplings, HAS STOPPED OFFERING DUMPLINGS. 

SERIOUSLY, NO MORE DUMPLINGS AT LAO SZE CHUAN.

The employee on duty when I visited told me the \"dumpling ingredients are no longer available from Chicago.\" 

This same employee sat at the bar playing on his phone while half the tables remained soiled, covered in half-eaten plates of food, untouched since their occupants had left sometime earlier in the evening. That's been typical every time I've visited. 

I think 'prior restaurant experience' was a disqualifier when Lao Sze Chuan hired its staff. No one knows or cares about what to do to run a restaurant.

The menu has items with no English description, like \"Xia Lao Bao\", but when you ask the waiters, \"What is this?\" they say, \"I don't know, I'm just a waiter.\" 

All in all, Indiana Jones 4 was less disappointing than Lao Sze Chuan."}
{"text":"F**king hell waited for 2 hours, contacted customer support 4 times and they said they're gonna put my order on top priority but it never f**king delivered. The restaurant isn't bad but the delivery can suck a dog's toxic di*k"}
{"text":"I've been to two of the locations in Chicago and was happy to see they opened a spot in Champaign. Was in town for work and headed over for lunch. Was seated promptly and there were only a few tables at around 1 so I figured a quick bite and down the road. Someone dropped off a glass of water and was gone by the time i looked up from the menu. Seriously , I might have hallucinated the whole thing but a glass of water was left so it had to have happened. Ordering was a bumpy affair, so much that i wondered what i might actually get to eat. On to the food! First thing to arrive were the dan dan noodles . Not the usual spicy concoction I'm used to. Still very good but without that kick that makes you put down the chopsticks to regroup. Potstickers were next, I know how pedestrian but I like pot stickers!, six jumbo sized gyoza that were pretty standard fair. The sauce that came with it was homemade from what I could tell . It had too much of something, rice wine-vinegar- Windex? Couldn't quite put my finger on it but it didn't stop me from eating it. Then the show stopper arrived and let me say I think a different person brought every dish cause somebody would walk by slide food on the table and keep walking . I still don't know what happened. Anyway I got Tony's 3 chilli chicken, again, and this is seriously a narcotic of a dish . If the building caught on fire Im walkin out with that plate. Absolutely Heavenly!! Again , not the spice I'm used to maybe they are  toning it down a little. Who knows. After stuffing my face I'm lookin for a check but think my waiter must have left for the day cause he is no where to be found. Actually got the guy that seated me to get the check and a carry out. Went to pay and the guy workin the register starts askin for a tip. Was it my waiter? Who knows, I only saw him for 10 seconds an hour ago. For the record I left the tip on the table and told the guy he better hustle the bus boy picked it up. Let not mince words the service sucks. But it aint much better at the Mich Ave stop either. Chinatowns service is fine btw. Food is five starts. If you go prepare for shite service. But order Tonys 3 chilli chicken and i double dog dare you to share it. Like they say in Canada , Peace Ooot!"}
{"text":"My friend and I each ordered noodle soups and neither of us came close to finishing them because they tasted so bad. And my friend is not a picky eater. He ordered the glass noodle soup and it was basically a bowl of noodles drowning in chili oil. Mine wasn't my as oily but what little taste was overpowered by the numbing spicy oil they used. I asked the waiter if we could order a another dish to sub for my friend's and he let us. We ordered a stir fry noodle dish, which was slightly better in terms of taste. We both left hungry and out about $13 for a bad meal. Plenty of other better Chinese places and probably at least a couple of Szechuan places in town. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The atmosphere is simple and clean. Food is great love the dry spicy chili chicken and garlic pea pods. The host also checks in and was kind both times. Overall experience was pretty good. I'm"}
{"text":"Worst service, was ignored for 20 minutes after seated, had to walk to the counter to order. What's better is that I had to ask for rice 4 times before finally receiving it 30 minutes after I received my dishes."}
{"text":"I visted my friends during the Christmas and my friends took me to Lao Sze Chuan, recommending that this is the most authentic Chinese Restaruant in town. Having tried it several times and it never disappointed. My favoirate are Chef's special dry chili chicken, Crispy Shrimp with lemon sauce and Xiao Long Bao. The atmosphere and service are also pretty nice. I would recommend Lao Sze Chuan!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food in Champaign. We ordered frog, beef tripe, pan fried pork ban and beef wrap. All delicious"}
{"text":"Even though we have a lot of Chinese food on campus, I'm glad this place opened because it's great. The portions are huge and the food is really good. The only complaint is that the servers seem a little understaffed."}
{"text":"Love this place! I used to drive to Chicago for this and now they are open here in Champaign. I read many negative comments on the service and was skeptical going there but service was good. Food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Lao Sze Chuan prides itself on being the \"number one Chinese restaurant in the USA\". It's a chain restaurant with about nine locations, most of them being in Illinois, and has an impressive menu of Szechuan dishes. This specific location in Urbana Champaign is one of the newer locations and just opened at the end of August 2017. 

If you are unfamiliar with Szechuan cuisine, just know that it is really spicy. The Szechuan province in China has weather that is perfect for growing red peppers and therefore food that comes out of that part of China usually includes a lot of garlic or chili peppers. A special type of spicy called \"Ma La\", also known as numbing spicy, is really big in this kind of food and comes from Sichuanese pepper corns. 

I've been to that part of China and the food here is actually really authentic. The green beans and twice cooked pork were my favorite dishes that I tried. The pan-friend meat buns were also good and had a very nice crispy bottom. However, I do wish the buns had more meat inside. Other than that, I have no complaints and I enjoyed everything from the soup dumplings to the mapo tofu to the pepper chicken. 

I think the poor service other Yelpers mentioned could have been due to the fact that this location was very new. So, the management and servers were definitely working out the kinks and familiarizing themselves with the menu. I had no problems with my service when I was there a few days ago and my food came out relatively fast despite my 20+ person table ordering 30+ dishes at one time. In fact, the servers handled my large group's appearance really well and catered to us by moving tables together / apart based on our preferences."}
{"text":"Great food, large portions, friendly and personable servers. Sometimes service is a little slow when it's busy, but servers make sure customers get everything they need."}
{"text":"The food is pretty nice, and is as authentic as it gets. Despite the hype, their food quality is comparable to other local Szechuan restaurants imho. 

However, it just takes too long to get food here. The waiters here are overwhelmed with customers. For example, I was here to get some noodles at 1 pm last week. There's a still a queue for getting a table, and I had to call my waiter to get a menu, and call him again to order, and call him again in 30 minutes because I'm still waiting for it. Not the place to go to if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"One of the fanciest Chinese restaurants in town. Nice seating. Definitely on the pricey side, but comes in large portion too."}
{"text":"The food is alright, but it not as authentic as I would want. It seems to be more american to my taste. However, that being said, it is not that bad. However, the service can really be improved. I waited so long for my food. Would give this restaurant a second chance, but there can be much more improvement to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Extremely bad delivery experience. Ordered 3 dishes and two of them were SUPER SUPER salty. The cook prolly double/triple added the salt while cooking. I contacted them and they said the only thing they can do was giving me a 10% off discount on my next order. Will not spend more money in this place."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely great. Service is mediocre. Not enough staff so food usually comes out kinda slow. But once you eat the food you'll forget about the service (hopefully)."}
{"text":"They have a truly traditional Chinese food. Best Chinese restaurant around campus!!!!"}
{"text":"I'v eaten at the Chicago Chinatown location twice and thought I'd take a couple of colleagues to lunch on Friday, September 8, 2017 at the new Champaign location. We asked about one dish and the server's response was: \"I am not very familiar with the menu.\" 
Seriously?
So we ordered: three entrees and one cold cucumber salad.
15 minutes later, during our lunch hour, the first of the 3 entrees is brought to the table.  Another 10 minutes and the second entree is brought to the table.  At that point we tell the server to cancel the cold cucumber salad and it is only then that he tells us they are out of the cucumber, so we were never going to get our salad anyway.
Fast forward another ten minutes and the first of the 3 of us has eaten all he cares to eat and requests a \"to go\" box.  Since it is now 12:35 and one of us is done eating and my food has not yet been served, I cancel my boiled fish order and return to work without having had any lunch.
The food may be very delicious, I'll never know.
I wonder if the \"Celebrity Chef, Tony Hu\" has ever visited the new Champaign location? So much potential, but apparently management is absent or just phoning it in..."}
{"text":"Overall a very positive experience. The staff seems much more capable than some earlier reviews indicated and the food overall was pretty good."}
{"text":"I ordered take out through GrubHub and the food was fine overall. My girlfriend ordered the sesame chicken and we both though the sauce didn't have much kick to it. The vegetable fried rice and chicken egg rolls were pretty average. What brought this rating up to a 4 was the chef's special dry chili chicken, which was exceptional. Definitely spicy but packed with chicken and mouthwatering flavor and complimented with some onion and scallions. I would highly recommend getting this dish if ordering here."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Foods are not too bad but their service is awful. Won't visit there anymore."}
{"text":"I ate here last weekend, in the mid-afternoon. Let's start with the good stuff: the food is excellently prepared and properly spiced. There was enough food for the money, which is good too. I had the mapo tofu and it's just dynamite...the food is every bit what it is in their main Chicago location. The decor is also nicely done, which is a welcome break compared to some of the counter service Chinese joints in town. 

So why a two-star review? It wasn't exceptionally busy when I was in there, but there were about eight tables at various stages of their meals. After my entree was delivered, all of the servers sat down with kitchen staff at a table at the far side of the restaurant and started eating a meal. I'm not a total purist, so while it irked me a little bit, it's not the end of the world. However, after about twenty minutes of not seeing my waiter at the table (I could see him on his phone with his back to me sitting at another table, though), I finally got up and flagged down kitchen staff to help. I wasn't alone in this, as another table noticed what I did and did the same. My server, when notified, didn't even get up, preferring to send another server over to print me my check. Additionally, none of the tables that had gotten up since I sat down for lunch had been cleared of dirty dishes. If I'm going to pay a premium over the plethora of Chinese restaurants in town for sit-down service, my experience was totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"As an international student coming from Szechuan province in China, I can say this is the most authentic Chinese restaurant in Chambana area. My favorite dishes are Dry chili chicken and grilled pork ribs, which are very flavorful. The ambience and service are also pretty good. Every time I go there, I have pleasant experience. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times to the point where I don't need menu to order. Last week I went to Lao Sze Chuan again at 11:05am and from outside the OPEN sign was on. After I entered the restaurant, I could tell I was the only customer there. I sat down and ordered ????. I assumed that since I was the only customer there and nobody was in front of me, my food should have come quickly. That didn't happen. Around 11:10am, I saw a bunch of Lao Sze Chuan employees started eating at the back of the room. I kept waiting. 30 minutes have passed and my food was still nowhere to be seen. No waiter ever explained to me what happened so I had to stop one to ask. I was told that the chef and the employees haven't eaten yet so they had to eat before they could cook for me. I'm really pissed. They should have eaten before 11am since that's when they open for business. If they are not ready, why did they turn on the OPEN sign?  Even if they are actually not ready, how can they kept a customer hungry for 30 minutes while they eat first right in front of me?  Even if they have to eat, why nobody ever said sorry while I waited there for 30 minutes? Even if they had to eat, why couldn't they eat in the kitchen? Instead they ate right in front of me. They could clearly saw that I was waiting but they just didn't care. This experience is so wrong on so many levels that I just can't believe it's happening. I ended up leaving since I couldn't afford keep waiting any longer. To sum it up, a customer entered its door during its advertised business hour yet he got nothing in 30 minutes except watching restaurant employees eating in front of him. This is unprecedented. I will give them zero star if Yelp allows."}
{"text":"Fantastic Szechuan cuisine! Delicious, fresh, hot food and very attentive service. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Lao Sze Chuan is known for its lunch specials on Monday thru Thursday. The lunch dishes cost $9-11 and they also come with rice, soup, and an egg roll. I've gotten the Mongolian beef and pork with garlic sauce, and they're pretty tasty. The only problem is that the wait to get the food is usually at least 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Couldnt complaint more on food, and they are just really good! The spicy beef we ordered is actually not that spicy meanwhile the savory stands out really well. The golden tofu is by far my favorite, just  because spicy had never been my thing. Have to appreciate their service, if is only couple Chinese restaurant do care about service, food are quickly served, a great place to eat in if you just want something fast as well as quality!"}
{"text":"This place is a good place to have a banquet meal.  We had a group of 13 people and reserved the private room.  The room wasn't ready for us when we arrived and things started off pretty slowly as our group waited to be seated.  Right now the place is BYOB and it was bit frustrating to get glassware and openers for our beer and wine but eventually we got this taken care of too.  I think they have some work to do with service but things were generally pretty good for us in the private room once things got started.

Our food was preordered and came out pretty steadily without  issues.  Overall our food was excellent.

Salted duck egg soup with tofu - Never had this before, very interesting!
Pan fried meat buns - excellent.
Steamed Shanghai soup dumplings - excellent.
Cold spicy beef shank - excellent.
Pan fried bread - excellent.
Cumin crusted spareribs - excellent.
Fish fillets in chili sauce - good enough.
Boiled beef in chili sauce - good enough.
Mongolian beef - meh.
Crispy shrimp with creamy sauce - good enough.
Stir fried Nappa cabbage - good enough.

Any place that has great soup dumplings and pan-fried meat buns is A-ok by me!  Loved the spareribs, beef shank and fried bread too."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the price is by far the best in the area for a sit down Chinese place. Very authentic and great service. I'm assuming the less than stellar reviews are probably from them adjusting from opening recently and definitely do not do Lao Szechuan justice. Highly recommended for authentic Szechuan food in the CU area!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here tonight wanting to try Lao Sze Chuan for the very first time. We never had Szechuan food before but coming here was the best first time experience we could have ever had. Our servers Jeremy, Joyce, and Jay were fantastic and very attentive to us when we needed anything. The Sheng Jian Bao was crispy on the outside and the pork was so juicy on the inside. The Szechuan Wontons had a very nice texture, the pork was very tender, and the chili's were not too salty and strong. What blew me away the most was the Mapo Tofu and Glutinous Rice Ball in Wine Sauce w/ Osmanthus and Goji Berry. Not only was the Mapo Tofu delicious and amazing, the portion was at least two times the size that you would get at Cravings. It was only $11.95 and it was one of the best dishes I have had on campus. Finally, the Glutinous Rice Ball in Wine Sauce w/ Osmanthus and Goji Berry was the best dessert to end the fantastic meal. Not only was it a big portion that could easily feed 4 people, but it was also cheap (normally $7.95 but our servers gave it to us for free!!!!) and very light. In total, everything came up to be less than $40 for 2 people and I will definitely come here next time with more friends to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after seeing it on yelp. I was going to order from grub hub but the website didn't have a menu I could find. So I headed down there for lunch. Couldn't quite figure out where to park for free but used the coffee shop spots. Don't worry hammerhead, I had a tasty cup on the way out!

After checking out the menu and finding no real lunch deals I decided to try Tony's chicken. The place was filling up quickly and I received my food pretty quickly. I like my yardbird spicy and Tony's chicken delivered. Small to medium sized pieces of crunchy chicken with lots of peppers all over. Broke a good sweat and had to get more water, very tasty!

I wish fried rice was an option and that they had a lunch portion for a little less money. I will go back and sample some other goodies soon!"}
