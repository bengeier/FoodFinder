{"text":"The outside doesnt do this little place justice.  The food is good and i can never leave without two watermellon drinks.  The big one!  It nice to have a freshly and fairly health meal place as well.  Wife and Son also enjoyed it so I got smiles for picking it."}
{"text":"I ordered the menudo, it was well served and very good. And the price wasn't bad. Definitely recommended if you are looking for menudo, they serve it daily."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever!! The tortillas were homemade everything was homemade and the Service was fast and the food was delicious and fast!!! I recommended this place to everyone and anyone!!"}
{"text":"Mexican \"Breffus\" is its own unique art. It is so very different from other Mexican foods. This restaurant is best I have had for Mexican Breffus.   Hand made tortillas? Check! Chorizo? Yes!  If you are a Mexican Breffus connoisseur, you owe this place a visit."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. though testier the same for most of dishes there menudo is good very friendly staff there salsa need a kick to me it taste like dirt."}
{"text":"Great food!  Delicious hand made tortillas. Good salsas and good service.  This place is automatically \"home made\" food. I had the huevos rancheros. Plate was served just like I used to have at home."}
{"text":"Very limited menu Salsa suck, good spice but tooooooo wateryyyyy. Ice tea was not clear liquid and tasted funny. I asked what is wrong with tea, she said don't know, do you want water... Ordered breakfast, it was ok, but I expected more from \"true\" Mexican family restaurant. I added salsa to huevos to feel some spice . By the way, when they will bring you a bill, there are no details, just total . So for coffee, ice tea and two breakfast meals$27.21, no details and she said she took off tea from a bill.... You count if you be back for $30 for limited choices .....without drinks...."}
{"text":"Best hand-made tortillas ever! I love their tacos and quesadillas. Did I mention I love their tortillas? Family friendly place and the staff is very welcoming. Love coming here at least once a month. My husband and I have been eating their food since they were a food truck over on Thomas and 35th Ave. The only downside to their new location is their parking."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. Don't expect to get seated if there are two empty tables and you come with a group of 5 or more. They will not push the tables together. They only have two large group tables that seat 5 or more. I have never seen a restaurant that will not do that. That's a poor business modo and they were unapologetic about it. No customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place on the way in to work to pick up some fresh green juice for breakfast.  I was really happy that the juice which included a lot of greens did not taste bitter but sweet.   A small juice ran me about $6.00 which is a decent price.   I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the food."}
{"text":"I had the Bistec Asada which was very good. 2 long slices of skirt steak well seasoned. Rice and beans. Sides of avocado and cucumber with a small salad and 2 roasted jalapenos. Lots of corn tortillas. Delicious.   My sister had the red menudo. She said it was also very good.   They also have some fantastic looking desserts but was too full to get dessert. Very friendly staff.  Definitely a place to try for some very good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Amazing food salsa is very hot food is amazingly cooked took my mother here and she loved it this place was shown to me by my girlfriend and I'm glad I came with her to try this food and fell in love with it and I try to come every chance I get"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few months now and i have tried their mole, quesadillas, tortas, tacos, bistek and birria. I have been pleased with everything. My favorite has been the mole and their watermelon drink. I love their prices and the attention the servers provide each time i go."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came in on a Friday night to have dinner. The place was pretty empty save for us and two other couples. They bring you free chips and salsa, both looked great when they brought them out but I actually added salt to the salsa because it was so bland. I ordered the green enchiladas and my fiance got a quesadilla with pastor. My enchiladas came out and once again everything was just blah- the beans, rice, even enchiladas. The quesadilla was so saturated with the fat from the pastor he could barely hold it up with his hands because it was so soggy. And yet, drowning in a copious amount of cheese and pastor fat it still tasted bland. Mind you, I am from Baja and have high standards for Mexican food but also happen to be the kind of person that will quickly lower those standards when she gets hungry. We left our plates pretty much just as full as when they brought them out. Two stars only because the service was good. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Muy mala experiensia..  lo unico rescatable son las tortillas. Servicio tres estrellas tienen que ser mas paciente en tomar La orden.  Restaurat normal presio economico  comida super mal. Regrese mi orden me quisieron cobrar ordene Chile Verde para llevar me salieron tres cabellos hack me dio si lo hisieron am proposito que mal plan.  Se Los dejo De tarea sean mas eficientes."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the agua fresca from the juice bar and the homemade white corn tortillas. The salsa was good as well. The food was ok. The beans and rice where bland. Service was ok. Overall underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Based on my order of the green sauced chicken enchiladas served with rice and beans, I give the food a solid 4 stars for the following reasons:    1) tasty! - well seasoned chicken and green sauce, tortilla was fantastically meaty, served with cotija cheese, avocado and lettuce scattered over the top.  2) quantity - 3 enchiladas! with beans and rice. I took half of it home.   Service was really great. Friendly, fast, and she checked a few times to make sure we had what we wanted and that it was to our liking.   Price for the combo plate, a Diet Coke (can), and the tip (20%) came to $13.   If it's busy, parking could be an issue.  The ambiance inside is clean, comfortable, and pretty.    If you are used to chunky style salsa, you'll be experiencing a new kind of sauce... Hot sauce, really. Spicy hot sauce.  I hope they add a chunky salsa to their chips and salsa service."}
{"text":"We had a simple pap√°s and chorizo with some homemade corn tortillas delicious!! A must try for everyone!!"}
{"text":"Love what they done with the place food is delicious chips are free salsa hot. The home made tortillas are always a fan favorite. Halambre Out (mic dropped)"}
{"text":"Delicious quesadillas, which are stuffed with cheese and chicken or your choice of meat.  Salsa was not what I have found in other Mexican food restaurants, but is flavorful and spicy.  The rice was average, refried beans were super tasty.  Prompt service and clean restaurant. Would recommend."}
