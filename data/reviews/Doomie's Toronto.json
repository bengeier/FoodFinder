{"text":"Great place to go if you're a vegetarian and hungover. I tried the doomies \"Big Mac\". It was a great choice, but the patties are quite large so I'd probably only get it with one patty next time, as the burger seemed to entirely fall apart quite easily!"}
{"text":"Okay my fellow Vegan friends this is a must.  Cool old school retro 80's/90's vibe with a Nintendo first generation when you walk in the doors.   Now let's talk about the food. The Mac n cheese balls are great to start.  Then the must have the Big Mac Burger it is incredible if you're craving a \"burger\""}
{"text":"This place is disgusting and very expensive. My bill came to over 100 bucks for three shitty drinks and two shitty meals. They outsource their veggie patties. Which seems crazy to me as a vegan place. Shouldn't you know what's going into your food?   We ordered a Big Mac and a Philly Cheesesteak. I took a couple bites and couldn't even continue eating. We both felt really sick and bloated for the rest of the day. This food is so processed and unhealthy. We would have been better off eating at McDonalds... And it would have been a fraction of the price and less processed."}
{"text":"Synopsis: this is hangover food. It's not meant to be nutritious! It's gluttonous vegan \"junk\" food. And it's goddamn gloriously greasy and excellent! Stay away if you have no sense of fun or are religious about what goes into your stomach. Ha ha.  I thought Philly had the greatest vegan \"junk\" food. Doomies is a destination for vegan travelers with a sense of adventure. Good job. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here and ordered the mac and cheese balls they were unbelievable! Then we tried the Big Mac with buffalo fries both soooo good as well as the new chicken parm sandwich. Very thing was so amazing! The perfect cheat meal for a usually very healthy vegan! We were so full but still couldn't leave without trying the deep fried Oreos and of course they were awesome!"}
{"text":"Entire menu of fake meat (assuming all soy based from the soy-free menu items being pasta) and bread/pasta.   Loud spot. Young crowd. Mostly uncomfortable metal stools for seating. Server not the best (reluctant to answer questions and poor timing throughout).   Food took a long time to come but was pretty good in the end, tasty enough and filling. The BBQ pork tacos are soy and mushrooms - I don't know why the menu doesn't say that. The tacos' design flaws is that the tortillas get saucy and then start to fall apart. The beans they came with were flavourful, but I didn't know what to do with them (they didn't seem to belong on the tacos).  Overall, this seems like vegan food for non-vegans.  Other details: two steps to get inside, washrooms in the basement (many stairs), all gender/single user washrooms."}
{"text":"Went hear spontaneously since I have read it was always packed but we waited for the hype to die down. So we went here last minute on a Saturday even...yes a Saturday evening in T.O...and even got a good spot to sit....I don't know what we were thinking lol Anyway we got the typical vegan big Mac and chicken & waffles .  The Big Mac was on point...boy was that on point!!!!...better then McDonald's. The chicken & waffles was tasteless and greasy ....not flavourful at all but the kickin maple syrup was AMAZING and gave all the flavour you need. All in all great portion for the price and the service was great even with a small child. I will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan Big Mac was pretty solid - A little bit pricier than I expected."}
{"text":"After reading a few of the \"dissenting\" reviews, I went expecting some type of issue, but honestly, everything was great! I went on Tuesday at 7 and was seated immediately. I ordered a classic w onion rings instead of fries, and the awesome server offered to dress it as a big Mac without the extra burger patty at no extra charge - cool! I haven't had onion rings in at least 10 years, and I haven't had a big Mac in well over 20 -- this was going to be a food adventure!   The food arrived quickly and I had to eat fast b/c mayo and cheeze was going everywhere, haha! I loved the onion rings but couldn't eat them all. The idea of dessert was impossible, so I happily paid my bill and -- due to the pouring rain outside -- the server kindly said, don't feel rushed to get out there... which was so nice, and not the crank 'em in and out attitude others have described.  Re the seating and other issues raised... it's fast food, not good to linger over. Grab, nom, and go. I think it's great for what it is -- tasty and fun. If you need somewhere to sit and chat with friends all night over drinks, this isn't the place, just like McDonald's or whatever like restaurant wouldn't be the place.  I'm not someone who has ever craved burgers, so I couldn't imagine returning frequently, but for those moments this would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Easily the best vegan restaurant in Toronto. Vegan or not, their Big Mac and chicken burgers are outstanding, even better than the real thing. The Oreo milkshake is also a must-have. And don't even get me started on the animal fries..."}
{"text":"Long time vegan who greatly anticipated this L.A. original coming to my beloved city, but I and my husband have been consistently disappointed.   Although we both adore the decor, the music played, the comics and the Gary L. Francione quote...the food just does not hold up.  The first visit was on a Friday evening a few weeks after opening, but it was mediocre at best - to be fair- the air conditioning was broken and the staff might have been exhausted due to this circumstance. However, my husband ordered the 'big mac', I ordered the tacos and we shared the creme brule.   The big mac had great flavour, but was very poorly constructed (soggy/falling apart before it even got to the table). The tacos were very bland, but also topped with way too much chilli and nearly inedible for this reason. The creme brule was the only enjoyable part of the meal, but nothing to write home about.   The second visit, was on a weekday shortly after opening for lunch. We only wanted a small bite to eat and split the nachos and had some drinks. We had read good things about the nachos and wanted to give Doomies a second try. Sadly, the nachos were awful. Not because of the ingredients or the construction, but simply because the nachos were stale. Seemed as if they has been re-fried from the previous batch (perhaps from the evening before?) and chewy and not enjoyable because of this...  Sorry Doomies, but The Hogtown Vegan has our vote for the best vegan comfort foods and junk foods in Toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  This is a high quality vegan burger.  You wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  Try pesto fries for something different"}
{"text":"Waited over 2hrs for a table for 6.... The hostess didn't do anything to accommodate us. They let the people just hang out at the table without ordering anything! Very bad service! I will not return there..."}
{"text":"While I'm not vegan, I have to say this place is fantastic! I've been twice, and if no one ever told me this was vegan food I'd never know the difference. Highly recommend the mac n cheese balls...absolutely amazing! Everything I've tasted was really spot on, but I have to say I'm a fan of the classic burger :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Doomies twice. Each time I dove gleefully into the greasy goodness of vegan decadence. I've attempted to bite into the Western Burger with one fell swoop, spooned up the toppings on those Animal fries, and swam in the cheesy deliciousness of the Philly Meat Mac 'N Cheese bowl. Even when I'd get a dirty glass, it didn't hinder my love of all things Doomies.  Working late one night, I decided to explore what UberEats had to offer and lo and behold, there was Doomies listed - shining like a beacon of comfort food, exactly what I needed for a late night of working like a champ.  I hyperventilated with joy as I ordered the Philly Meat Mac 'N Cheese bowl (one of my faves). I practically screamed I was so happy when it was delivered, gleefully nabbing my warm, toasty delivery bag from the courier's hands. And then I opened the bag. Talk about a deflating experience.  There my Philly Meat Mac 'N Cheese bowl was not. It was on my order form. I'd paid for it. But in its place was an oily plate of plain noodles and some watery strings of green pepper mashed in for good measure. This was not my cheesy goodness. This was not my Philly meat. This was totally inedible. So away went my inedible slop to fill my garbage can while my stomach growled.  On an up-note, UberEats was awesome at handling the situation and refunded me for the swill that had made its way into my office. So I guess there's that. But no dinner."}
{"text":"After hearing the hype about the new vegan restaurant that opened in our neighbourhood a few of my friends and I decided to check it out.  After waiting for an hour to be seated we walked in to a very small and crowded back area, where we got seated into a big booth with other people. A bit weird but a good way to make new friends I guess?? The server was absolutely amazing but the food was absolutely horrible 3 out of 5 of my friends ended up puking  I don't recommend this place unless you plan to feel sick afterwards"}
{"text":"Hopefully not my final review. I was eagerly anticipating this experience, but was met with some disappointment. I ordered my server's highly recommended Xtra Fun Philly Fries. I get that I didn't exactly order a kale salad but the fries on its own seemed to be coated in extra grease or light batter. Definitely not my preferred fries, but ate with open mind. Few more fries in, I noticed it was bathing in, what my server confirmed, was a large puddle of grease.   Although I'm not eager to return, I'll keep an open mind that it was the wrong recommendation for me, avoid that dish and perhaps their fries altogether."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Doomies makes up for the fact that I need to take a nap after eating here! The music, the staff, the overall setting is great! The menu is great and I have tried a lot of things from it. I originally tried the Big Mac at their Los Angeles location, it was good, but it wasn't the best \"Big Mac\" version that I had, but still good.   The jalapeno poppers are excellent and I love the fries and all of the combinations that you can have here. ALSO, having regular soda/pop here like Pepsi/Coke, etc with free refills is good, most vegan places are selling over priced organic pop at overpriced prices! There are a ton of items on the menu that I haven't tried yet, but I am up for the challenge!"}
{"text":"The food was just plain awful.  Bland, soggy, weird tasting, lack of imagination.   The chairs are terrible and hurt our back.  Service was bad and disjointed.  Staff eating and drinking in our site.  The drinks were ok but we did have to send one back due to being too sweet and just not good.   When we left, we felt like puking.  Our bodies could not digest the crap that we had just consumed.  We left the food and won't be back.   It's not worth the hype, and not worth the prices they are asking.    I'm not usually this negative but felt I needed to speak up!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I popped in for a quick lunch and had a great experience! Our server was wonderful and very welcoming. We both have food sensitivities and she was very informative and helpful.  My boyfriend got the Big Mac with garlic fries, he is a meat eater and he loved this! I had the bbq pulled pork with fries and omg it was so good and filling! I would highly recommend this place to vegans and non vegans!"}
{"text":"Fast food that doesn't do take out? Officially been there 3 times and haven't even been able to try a thing! (2 times they were closed...mid week and last time was told that I could not take my food to go). Will not be going back for a 4th time. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Helen provided amazing service; great energy!! The Big Mac Daddy burger was fantastic, the Mac an Cheese (w/ crumpled Ritz crackers) was awesome!! Love the text msg reserve seating!! We'll be back = )"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews, but I had to for this one. I went here twice. The first time I had the fried chicken sandwhich with animal fries. The sandwhich was crispy but lacked flavour. The animal fries were SO heavy and greasy but I thought that was my bad. It's to be expected with fries topped with 1000 island dressing - right? My friend got the Big Mac and it was hard for her to eat. She said she left feeling disgusting.  People working there were lovely though, so I decided to give it another chance. To keep it short, we're both not going back. It was so greasy - there was a pool of oil at the bottom of our plates. I had the Philly Cheese steak with regular fries and all I could taste was oil and onion. So gross. The cheese sauce was just oil city. Needless to say I feel like I need to take a shower after all of it.  If you want amazing vegan junk food that won't make you feel oily all over - go to The Hogtown Vegan near by. 100% better."}
{"text":"Sooooo great! Exactly what it is supposed to be. Fun and delicious. Estimated wait time was accurate and their system works well. Food was amazing. The skillet cookie was to die for. Love and appreciate how unapologetic it is in its vegan junkfoodness! Service rocked  and the atmosphere was awesome.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had burgers and fries and I was pretty blown away knowing everything is vegan. Great service and cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is an updated review, seeing as how the first time around, I wrote it in a hurry due to the fact that my bowels were trying to Ridley Scott out of my body.   Went twice with my two friends, who will in the future be referred to as Friend A (who is in my review for New Tribe) and Friend B (who isn't referenced anywhere else, for now).   The first time was great! I had their classic burger, Friend A got the tacos, and Friend B got the secret menu Big Mac-esque type thing.   It was lovely! The burger tasted like any old veggie burger, but the secret sauce made it real tasty, and their fries! UH! Their fries are awesome!   The second time.....Hunh, lemme tell you about the second time.   The second time, we were led to the booth in the back.   It was hot as all get out back there, and they had to bring out an industrial fan to cool down the entire restaurant, seeing as how they don't actually have any air-conditioning.   Okay, cool. That's fine! We could deal.   When the food came was when the game changed.   Friend A and I got the nachos and cheese-steak-sandwich-thingy. Friend B got the chicken burger.   Friend B was fine. Perfectly normal.   I, however, was trying to prevent a LANDSLIDE from happening. I had a horrible stomach ache, the downstairs washrooms were half-broken, and Friend A got hers when she got home!   Then the next day, when were trying to go to Value Village, we had to call it short because we got hit with a stomach ache again!   We think it was the nacho fixings on my fries and her nachos.   Maybe because there wasn't any air-conditioning, all the veggies got all swampy and stuff. :(   Anyways, fun while it lasted. :(   Probs wont be coming back here again unless they have better quality control over their food.   xoxo from the banyo."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype around this place. The patty on the vegan Big Mac tasted like a below-average frozen soy patty that you would buy at the grocery store. It was covered in so much sauce (clearly to compensate for the almost inedible patty) - and the vegan cheese was runny and not cheese-like at all. Fries were soggy. Everything was oversalted. Obviously this restaurant isn't catered towards healthy eaters, but at most vegan comfort food-type restaurants in Toronto (think Hogtown Vegan, Grasshopper, Cosmic Treats, etc.), you at least know that your meal will be fresh and largely unprocessed (even if not exactly \"healthy\"). Not at Doomies. This place is gross. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was greaaaat and the staff weren't that bad either. Some of the cutlery and cups were dirty though"}
{"text":"Great food but the servers must be from Mars.  Service is supposed to be enthusiastic with a smile!!"}
{"text":"It was a cold Friday night and there was a thirty minute wait for a table so we sat at the bar, it turns out that was the best outcome possible. The bartender was excellent! She was helpful without being pushy and very attentive. For example when I finished my potent but absolutely delicious cocktail she offered another one and when I declined instantly gave me a glass of water without me having to ask. In terms of food the burger was actually very comparable to a Big Mac not sure if that is a compliment or not. The patty was flimsy yet satisfying. All in all the star of the show had to be those fries. I would come back and not hesitate to just eat a whole pile of them as a meal. They were skinny and crispy. The skillet cookie aka cookie pie was yummy and warm. I suspect the vanilla ice cream was made with coconut of some sort which wasn't to my liking but my friend was happy to finish it up. All in all it was a good experience one I would be happy to repeat. The downside is now I feel like I need to eat all the salads. Next time I will take a selfie outside the bathroom instead of just noting how nice the lighting was."}
{"text":"As a meat eater, I'm usually skeptical about vegetarian, vegan places.  If you're ever in the Big Smoke, stop in here.  They have an unadvertised item on their menu (rhymes with Big Nac) it is much bigger than its Golden Arches counterpart and tastes very similar.  It's a cosy little place, very busy.  It's like a fast food place for vegans and vegetarians.  We had to wait a bit for our order, but it was worth the wait.  I recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"I was disappointed! the hype is SO misleading. NO AC, they have a big fan which only points in one direction of the crowded restaurant. We were facing a window and didn't have any AC. The combo of no AC and the EXTREMELY OILY food caused me to have a physical reaction I've never had to food before. I had the \"vegan Big Mac\" burger and the animal fries. the animal fries tasted good but the \"cheese\" was a pool of oil. nothing has any particular flavour or texture that I enjoyed. This upset my stomach so much and I eat fried and oily food a lot. DO NOT ORDER THE BIG MAC BURGER the \"patties\"  are legit Yves veggie cuisine burgers and those taste like old farts... the worst brand for veggie burgers. After eating 1/4 of the burger and 1/2 the fries I felt extremely dizzy, had abdominal pain and and upset stomach. I almost fell down the stairs to go to the bathroom and I puked out everything I had. I had chills and was sweaty, also a huge headache. Safe bet, I won't make it back to doomies. I'd reccomend HOGTOWN vegan, fresh restaurants, BLOOMERS and apiecalypse!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The fries are great, Big Mac and tacos are winners. Makes vegan food accessible but it's filled with over the top vegan propaganda (aren't you preaching to the converted-even of you aren't -comic strips aren't the way to convince people).  Floors are dangerously slippy too, just hold on to the bannister rail!  Edited: second time I went service was terrible, I found wire in my burger and they didn't take it off the bill.  Fries were cold and floor was still slippy"}
{"text":"It's great that there is a Doomie's in Toronto. I've been to the LA location a few times and the Big-D keeps me coming back for more!  The Toronto Big-D is way bigger than in LA - good and bad!   A bit more hipster/trendy than LA, but it works!   If you're vegan or if you just like junk food, eat the Big-D!"}
{"text":"Service is tremendous. Food is a bit tasteless but give the vegan Caesar a try. Friendly group of customers."}
{"text":"My friend recently converted to Hipsterism so of course we had to come here.  Kidding. She's just now a vegan.  As a non-vegan, I have been dying to try this place for months after seeing pictures of their Big Mac.  I must say that the wait was totally worth it.  We got here around 1pm so the place was packed, so we had to be on their waitlist which surprisingly, wasn't all too bad.  We waited for just about 25-minutes and with the area, you can really easily kill time elsewhere.    Avocado Fries - One of the best things I've ever had.  I mean, I looked at it and said, I can probably make this home as it looked pretty simple enough.  It was really just sliced avocado dipped in tempura batter and fried.  It also came with some sauce which was also very good.  I could eat this pretty much everyday for the rest of my life; it was THAT good.  5/5.  Big Mac - I love McDonald's and I looooove Big Macs so this was one that I obviously had to try.  I must say that it tasted pretty much just as good as a \"real\" Big Mac.  I think what does it is the sauce. Difference between the 2 places is that the Big Mac here is huge.  Mind you, I still almost had the whole thing but that's only because I didn't have much of the fries.  Not that it wasn't good because it was.  I'd definitely go back just for this sandwich, which by the way, is not on their regular menu so you'd have to order it specifically.  Chances are, if you're a first-timer, the waitress will tell you about it.  5/5.  Animal Fries - Speaking of burgers, my most favourite burger is an In N Out Burger.  My mouth salivates just thinking about it! And with a burger, I need to have with animal style fries.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, just imagine crispy fries topped with \"mac sauce\", fried onions and cheese.  Mmhmm.  This isn't as good as In N Out's animal style fries but it is very close it. It was a little on the greasy side but it was still very good that I'd order it again. 5/5."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing! Two weeks new to Toronto and an hour wait to get a table was totally worth it.  I had the \"Big Mac Burger\" which is not on the menu however if you ask for it they will make it for you.  It was amazing! I've been Vegan for just over 7 months and can honestly say that this Vegan \"Big Mac Burger\" tasted like a REAL BIG MAC! It was sooooo good!! I read up on the burger and they make the \"mac sauce\" in house using cashew cream. So if you have a sever allergy to NUTS I would say maybe ask the server or avoid the Burger. I gave my BF a bite and he loved it. I didn't know about the cashew cream until the next day. He has allergies to NUTS however he was ok with just the one bite, but I wouldn't take any chances. He had the Chicken and Waffles which were also amazing. We didn't have room for desert otherwise we would have got one for sure. They have Dairy free ice cream with most of the deserts and one came with a chocolate chip cookie which sounded really good to me. They also had some really great looking shakes that I will try next time! Looking forward to going back. The services was great (even though it was busy) we didn't find ourselves waiting around, it was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Best Vegan food in all of Toronto Canada, Big Mac is the bees knees and the animal fries are why I live my life."}
{"text":"Love me some Doomies! I'm not a vegan, but I can't get enough of this comfort food! The crispy chicken burger is my fav. It comes topped with a yummy cheez sauce. I sort of wish this place did salads, but that's not their shtick, so fries it is!"}
{"text":"Doomies is so much fun! Let me update my review:  I love the Big Mac. It's huge and it's taste great. In my opinion, better than the real deal.   I love the crispy Chicken Sandwich tossed in Buffalo sauce. Crispy, tangy and delicious! Next time,  I will get the Crispy Chicken sandwich dressed like a Big Mac!   I really like the 'Peanut Butter Burger' that comes with a side of grape jelly. That might sound weird but it tastes good! It's peanut-y, salty and sweet!  I love the 'Chicken Parm' sandwich. It's not what you would expect. The texture and taste are so close to the real deal. The cutlet is thick and rustic and has a delightful crispy coating. The sandwich is topped with a thick, flavourful tomato sauce and parmesan that is closer to a thick, creamy Alfredo sauce. It's so good! Pair this with 'pesto fries' for a dream team!  I can't remember why I didn't like the 'Philly Cheese Steak'. I have had the 'Philly Cheese Steak' sandwich and on the Mac and Cheese bowl on two other occasions and totally enjoyed them! So cheesy! I think that the texture threw me off. The steak is chopped up and I was expecting strips. Now that I have gotten over it (lol), I love this dish!   I like the 'Beef Asada Tacos' for a healthy change. My suggestions would be to add a green tomatilla salsa to boost the spice factor and to add a creamy vegan mayo drizzle.   My partner and I are addicted to 'Animal fries' which are french fries topped 1000 island sauce and caramelized onions. It's bold, tasty and decadent! It's also large and filling.   The 'dark and stormy' cocktail is a hit if you like fresh ginger.   There are so many more dishes left to try! Can't wait! Stay tuned for my next review!  Let me not forget to mention the AMAZING service from the lovely Diana!"}
{"text":"It's so hard not to order, or go into Doomie's every day. They satisfy every vegan/meat craving I have ever had!  The fries are definitely unhealthy, but the best. The sauces that come with meals are also fantastic! I always go for the Classic Burger or Chicken Fingers - They just can't be beat.  My only criticism would be how uncomfortable the seating arrangements are in the restaurant - but it does fit the fast food atmosphere and works with the theme overall."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely delicious!! Hugeeee portion!!! If you feel for a great fast-food this is itttt!!! You'll feel full!!!! :)))"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here, but nothing really wowed me. Everything looked and tasted delicious and was their take on pub food, but with a vegan twist. Nothing wrong with that. I had come here for dinner before a concert that we were going to at Molson Canadian Ampitheatre. I love the fact that you can have a great meal, completely vegan and not feel restricted as I feel vegans are stereotyped that way with the 'limited' amount of food they have to choose from, which is definitely not the case, nor have I ever thought that.  A friend of mine is vegan and wanted to come here after reading reviews about it. We spent the day in Toronto just walking around, being the tourists that we were and thought that we could walk all the way up Queen Street West to get here; we were dead wrong. Called a cab to fetch us and finally made it to the restaurant. We walked in and were greeted and promptly seated. Our waitress came right away with menus and asking us our drink order. We stuck with water because of how hot and dehydrated we felt.  The menu was a bit deceiving, and freaked out my friend for a moment thinking that we were not at a vegan restaurant. Everything looked really tasty and I ended up getting the Chimichanga, and we had jalapeno poppers as an appetizer. The poppers came out first, we're super hot (in both senses, temperature and spiciness) but were deep friend to perfection and tasted delicious. My Chimichanga was huge! I was able to eat half of it, didn't know that it came with olives, I'm not a fan so I picked those off, but happily ate the rest.  The washrooms are located downstairs and the hallway leading down to the washroom is filled with comic strip type art regarding veganism, which are funny (and serious) if you can take a joke. One word of caution, I found the stairs to be super slippery and took my time going down, I didn't want to trip on anything.   The prices for the amount of food you got was amazing for it's value. Worth the penny I spent. Next time I venture into Toronto I hope to come back, the food was decent, the ambiance was mellow and the service was great, overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"First time trying Doomie's today, I had pulled pork and garlic fries both were super tasty. The pulled pork had an amazing texture and it was tangy and smoky. I was told it's made from mushrooms. I thought it was seitan maybe, the texture was just so good! The fries had fresh garlic on them and were crispy and fresh. My partner had the fried chicken sandwich and regular fries. I tried a bite, batter was tasty. \"Chicken\" also had a good texture. But the pulled pork was definitely where it's at. I knocked off one star because seriously, the stools they have are the most uncomfortable things ever. I don't say this lightly as I normally don't nitpick. But like the back was digging in to me, I was half sliding off the seat, it was really bad. Sort of forgot about it once the food came. But while we were waiting, it was almost unbearable. Seriously Doomies! Your food is awesome! Please change the stools. The bums in all the land will thank you! :)"}
{"text":"I ate an embarrassing amount of food in one shot, and while my waistline has a few regrets, my tastebuds do not.   We started with the nachos, and I have to say, they put both Sneaky Dees and Hot Beans (RIP) to shame. The star of the meal, they were totally kickass, and better than any vegan nachos (and probably non-vegan nachos) I've ever had. For once, we weren't left with a pile of naked chips at the end; this beauty was perfectly layered from start to finish. The cheese sauce was tasty and the chips themselves were divine.   I had the crispy chicken burger with fries after that, and it was everything I hoped it would be. I'm gonna try the Big Mac-style burger next time.   Hearty, delicious comfort food that's cruelty free = Total fast food heaven!"}
{"text":"I would've given the restaurant 5 stars if not for a small incident that happened at the end of our visit, more on that later.   I got their famous Big Mac burger with animal fun fries - absolutely incredible. Best burger I've had probably ever, vegan or otherwise. The fries were delicious. I'm usually not a fan of vegan cheese due to the nutritional yeast, but this cheese is amazing.   My friend got the Wild West burger and that was also really good. She got nacho fries with that, which she absolutely loved.  Our waitress was super nice and friendly, but her shift ended halfway through our visit so we got another waitress.   Another friend joined us as we ordered the incredible skillet cookie (would highly recommend). The hostess then proceeded to let us know that we should tell her that we have another person coming, even though we told both waitresses. I told her this, and she rudely corrected me again, even though we weren't using an extra seat or table.   And then before we even finished our dessert the waitress gave us our bill and didn't ask if we wanted it split. She also took away our water and didn't give us another bottle. Clearly she didn't want us there.   In conclusion: the food and atmosphere is awesome. The music was really cool, lots of 90s pop that night. Service is okay, depending on who you get. But I'd still go back for the Big Mac."}
{"text":"One reason to be in Toronto is to have a big lunch at the Doomies Toronto restaurant on Queen Street.  This is a quaint neighborhood that is buzzing with unique stores and cafes.  People here seem unhurried and just want to enjoy life.  We entered Doomies and were seated at the back corner enclosed table seating area.  Wow, this place is great and we had to wander down the stairs to see more and take pix of the wall art.  So clever to have these telling cartoons remind us of why.  The place was clean and the staff we met knew what to do to make our visit a pleasurable one.  We ordered so much and what we had was really good.  I had the Mac and Cheese sprinkled with crunchy crackers and it was abundant and cheesy , but I made it all the way down the big bowl.  Then it was a heavenly peanut butter shake for dessert.  Oh so decadent and filling.  Let's just say that Doomies Toronto did not disappoint.  It was a fantastic lunch with good service. We feel really fortunate to finally meet and greet and eat at Doomies Toronto and would definitely like to come back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I (vegetarians all our adult life) are often looking for new date night spots to enjoy Vegan food (both comfort food and health) and decided to give Doomies a try. We walked in, and were seated at the table closest to the door at a hightop with incredibly uncomfortable metal stools. We sat down for 5 minutes and between the white hospital lighting, the music so loud you can't hear yourself speak, and the awkward table by the door, we decided to leave. I didn't give this place a try in terms of cuisine but I didn't want to stick around any longer. After reading other reviews, it doesn't seem like we missed out on anything. We ended up at Hogtown Vegan and had a great experience there (as usual!)."}
{"text":"I've read so many good things about the vegan Big Mac here and man were they right! It was HUGE and super good. Make sure you have lots of napkins though. It's a messy one lol. For desert I ordered the cookie pie. It was to die for. My non vegan husband loved it. Probably the best vegan desert I've ever had. 5 stars all the way! I wish they could open up a location in Michigan!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely phenomenal! We got the jalapeño appetizer and couldn't it's vegan!!! We got the chicken sandwich and philly steak sandwich and they both tasted really good. Fries were also crispy and fresh. Server was really nice and helped us make choices by recommending different items!  Pros:  - Amazing variety of vegan comfort foods. - Chicken burger tasted and had the consistency of real fried chicken. - Customer service great! - Pretty affordable. - Great selection of drinks.  Cons: - Everything is fried, hard to find low calorie options."}
{"text":"Vegan Big Mac was surprisingly good and similar to the real thing! Massive portions and a touch on the heavy/greasy side. You can share an entree with an extra order of fries between 2. Cool spot."}
{"text":"Yum!! As a vegetarian and glutton, I often find myself resenting the healthy spin to veg options at other restaurants. This is the kind of food I crave, so it was a special kind of satisfaction to find that the food was as delicious as I expected.  I had a ceaser to start, my first ever (!!!), which was spicy and salty and sour and amazing. Vegan Big Mac with regular fries was messy and delicious (according to my non-veg husband, the burger does NOT taste like an actual burger). My hubbie had the pulled pork with Mac and cheese with a side of Buffalo fries. He said it actually tasted like pulled pork and loved it.  We also had the pumpkin pie milkshake, which was so thick and sweet it doubled as dessert - yummy, eat with a spoon.  Good service, fun atmosphere - love the 90s music.   Will definitely be back, but not too soon or I'll need a new wardrobe"}
{"text":"I am far from a vegan! I have heard the buzz about this place for awhile and was curious to see if it's worth the hype...  All I can say is, BELIEVE THE HYPE!!  I tried the highly talked about secret menu  Big Mac and the animal fries. The Big Mac is real deal !! Absolutely delish, great variation of the meat version. I loved the patty (I had my doubts but was totally wrong) and of course the Mac sauce was heavenly on the animal fries.   I also tried the mac n' cheese balls, these are a must try! These small concoctions are filled with cheesy love, they're perfectly crispy on the outside and inside filled with mac n' cheese goodness."}
{"text":"This place was pretty fun. The music and general atmosphere were a bit loud for me, but the vibe was friendly and open. My friend and I started off with the nachos which were quite tasty! The\"sour cream\" was incredibly light and tasty. Better than any sour cream I've had before. The \"cheese\" wasn't amazing but everything else was. The beans and soy were great. The chips themselves were a bit inconsistent.. some were perfect, others were lacking the right crunchy texture. My main dish was the infamous faux big mac. I've never had a McDonald's big mac but this certainly looked the part. The soy patties weren't impressive, but the rest of the burger was messy and delicious. Good cheese, sauce, and toppings (plus a tasty soft bun). The fries on the side were decent but I didn't eat many because I was so full. They were a bit too oily, but I feel like that's sort of the style. Speaking of oily... My friend's pesto mac and cheese bowl looked like it was swimming in oil. I didn't taste any, but honestly... It didn't look appetising.  I would go back again. Stick to the apps, sandwiches, and desserts from what I could gather! The drink menu looked good too, but we didn't partake. Worth another visit!"}
{"text":"We went to Doomie's on a Friday around 3PM. It wasn't busy, about 3 tables including us. I ordered the deep fried avocado, and the crispy chicken burger with animal fries, and a water. My boyfriend ordered the Mac&cheese balls, the same burger as me but with buffalo fries, and a beer. Unfortunately the avocados weren't ripe, so the waitress suggested something else to try.. but I decided to just share the mac&cheese balls, which were sooo good! They did add on a few \"chicken\" fingers for not being able to have the avocado, so that was nice. Their soy based stuff is made in house, it resembles chicken quite a bit, in texture, which was nice for my meat eating BF.  We were done our apps, and we still didn't have our drinks. So we asked again. She brought his beer, but forgot mine again. I asked again. Also, when our cutlery was brought to our table, the fork was covered in something that looked like peanut butter. She grabbed a new one, but even that one had something on it, and I noticed food on my bf's too.. we didn't need the cutlery anyway, but still kind of gross.  Overall, the food was really good! The fries were the best fries I've had in a long time. We probably could've shared one burger and fries, because the portions are kind of big. We brought the rest home, and I ate the leftovers the next day, which were still yummy. We were too full for dessert, but we'll be back sometime for the deep fried Oreos."}
{"text":"I've eaten a few times here and the food and service has always been pretty great (for a hipster restaurant) but I have a real problem with the fact that they have no phone number listed.   In addition to this, the website says no take out, but they do and they will. But now I understand why take out is simply not a good idea. I can't call in advance to save time and more so I can't call afterwards when I need to tell them my order was wrong. I ordered the chicken and waffles and there was no waffle. I got the syrup..so that's something.   In the grand scheme of things, it's just not worth it to travel all the way back with my food while my family eats theirs. I'm annoyed because I just paid 16.00 for half a meal. Despite the fried \"chicken\" being probably the best I've ever had.   In Doomies defence, I should have checked my food before I left (as this seems to be a common occurrence for restaurants to not pay as close attention to their take away orders).  Next time Doomies. I'll check my food before I leave if you promise to get it right.   I hope someone got to enjoy my waffle."}
{"text":"I had already eaten lunch upon arriving at Doomie's and knowing it was all vegan I pre-judged and thought \"it's ok, I'm not usually down with vegan eats, I won't be missing out on anything\" - WRONG-O Kris.  I never thought that vegan food could look, taste, smell so damn good. Reading the menu I was filled with FOMO, watching food roll out of the kitchen to other tables that FOMO increased by a factor of 5x. I was full but had to order something!! My Yelp pals had ordered a fried chicken sandwich, a cheese burger as well as some Jalapeno poppers for the table. I ordered the Pumpkin Donut holes with ice cream - because it's the EVERYTHING in PUMPKIN FLAVOUR time of year!  The server came back and let us know that they didn't have ice cream anymore (boo) and were all out of ice cream (booo x2). I begrudgingly went with my donut holes sans the a la mode and had them with jsut whipped cream instead. And instead of the poppers we swapped them for deep fried macNcheese bites.  In case you forgot... this is still the same Vegan restaurant. Yep. All the delicious junk food things that are bad for you but taste good exist at Doomie's.  Everything came out and it was fantastic. My friends LOVED their mains and while they didn't love the MacNcheese balls I was obsessed. As for the pumpkin balls..... OH EM GEEE. If that's what being vegan tastes like.... sign me the EF up!!! I will get so fat but it will be so worth it. I definitely blacked out and killed my dessert before I could offer it to anyone else (sorry...  not sorry).   My fiancee is all about not eating meat, while I'm normally of the opposite frame of mind. That said, I would come back to Doomie's anytime as a compromise between not eating meat but also eating delicious noms!  One might say that they can \"Doomie anytime\". Does that make me a food whore? Because if it does I don't care  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Unbelievably overrated food and rude service. Completely in shock at the experience. Rarely are both service and quality of food unpleasant. If the food was more than white macaroni pasta mixed with watery pesto sauce, then I'd forgive poor service (maybe the server is having a busy/stressful night). But to have both was really unpleasant."}
{"text":"Holy Hannah!! This place, there are no words. If you are craving for some epic edgy BBQ or fried foods - Come here!! From the staff, service, food and more - There's nothing like this experience. I would definitely come back hands down. I came with 3 other friends who are carnivores and they absolutely loved Doomie's and have been raving about the food since their visit. They consistently have told me that had I taken them here without telling them that it was a vegan establishment, they would've never known the food was plant based. Everyone should check this place out if you're in town. Well worth the visit and food, trust me!"}
{"text":"I came back to update my review after visiting doomies last night.   The wait was expected for a Friday night at 8pm. Really efficient to leave number and they text when table was ready. We got prime seating by the window - well done.   Insert wonderful waitress super perky and eager to please.   By the time our food arrived the crowd had died down.   The reason I've reduced the stars is because the food was a disaster on this occasion. Jalapeños poppers were awesome. The Philly cheesesteak was the first time I ordered it and boy did I regret it. The very DNA of doomie is to end the terrible Vegan alternative atrocities we had to tolerate for so long. Yet this Philly cheesesteak was flavourless. We did not finish it. We upgraded our side of fries to the animal and nacho ones. Both were so incredibly salty so we left the whole lot as well.   Only thing we went right on was the Big Mac which I still enjoyed but my friend who came here for the first time did not finish her half at all.   To top it off our waitress must have paid us a visit 13 (exaggerating of course to exhibit how much it annoyed us lol) to see if we were done with our plates or if we wanted a box or if we were still working on it. There was no one else waiting in line to be seated so we found that quite odd but I suppose it's better than being ignored.   Not sure if I will come back unless like child birth I forget about the ordeal and decide to have another one."}
{"text":"Doomie's was a mixed bag for us!   Food:  Big Mac - YES. This lived up to the hype, simple as that. Patties aren't wildly amazing but they're slathered in a delicious mess. You can't put it down, literally - it will slide apart otherwise.  Regular Fries - YES. crispy and hot, in a bit of a batter. Srry if you're not about that.  Fried Chicken Sandwich - NO. The texture is too dense for me, friend agreed and actually liked it even less. There was too much oil soaked in the batter and it was just a disappointment after the big mac.  Buffalo Fries - HECK NO. God this was the soggiest hot mess ever. It was like they were sitting for 10mins waiting before the burger was plated with it. The ranch was good, but I love fries and this was a crime 2 all fry-kind.  Chocolate Peanut butter Milkshake - OMG YES. Sweet, salty, everything we needed to make a comeback from the buffalo fries. I will have dreams about this milkshake.  Service: Hostess seemed super confused/rattled as to what was going on when we first got there, but super nice. It was unbearably hot halfway through because the wall unit AC turned off. Bathroom area smelled unpleasantly weird."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place an was disappointed. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles ($16) and it took 20 minutes to arrive and didn't taste as good as I had hoped it would. I was here for my lunch break and was told my food wouldn't take long to arrive; I ended up packing up half my meal.   The \"skin\" kept slipping off the \"meat\" so I ate them pretty much separately. The skin was crispy but some parts were really hard, and the meat was nothing to write home about. The fries were fine sans too much of the sweet sauce pre-drizzled on it. My favourite part was the waffle but I was also here for the chicken.  I would come back to try the \"big mac\" if I had plenty of time and I would lower my expectations based on my experience here."}
{"text":"What can I say, if you are vegetarian or vegan, why haven't you eaten here yet? To start out with, you don't go here for the ambience (kinda divey) you go here for the most delicious and creative meat-less food you will ever eat! I started out by trying their signature meal, the Big Mac rip-off. But lately I've been ordering their chicken sandwich. So crispy and delicious, it's so simple with just a few toppings and just hmmmmm so good. Parking is easily found on the street. Can get busy, totally worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich tasted like an actual pulled pork sandwich. People would be fooled if they didn't say it was a vegan restaurant. Nachos were layered and somehow kept there crunch all the way to the bottom. My guest had the wild West and wasn't as satisfied, but I would definitely return. The menu was great and breaks the \"salad\" only vegan stereotypes. Oh and the fries are money in the bank."}
{"text":"Love it! Some things are not in the menu like the Big Mac.   Omg, it's even better than the real thing!"}
{"text":"I had the \"Big Mac,\" which was good, but so huge I couldn't fit it in my mouth. Service was good, staff were nice, music was way too loud. I do love the idea, but mediocre (but well intentioned!) food and a terrible atmosphere don't do it for me."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try doomies for quite sometime now. I ordered off of foodora...  when I first tried the food it tasted great! (I got the vegan Big Mac and chilli cheese fries) it was incredibly greasy though and I couldn't even come close to finishing it. Later that night and the next morning I have been sick to my stomach. Because of this I will probably never be eating there again."}
{"text":"this place isn't all that bad, a little too small and difficult to get seated, which means if you are hungry and want to eat right away, be prepared to wait. Aside from their lack of seating, their food was pretty good for vegan fare, the faux big mac was excellent for a vegan burger, as a non vegan i was fairly impressed with it, It was tasty and filling. I did enjoy my meal, i've never been so full from vegan food before either. Would i return??? sure, but withe some planning. Maybe one day they will find more space to accommodate their demand."}
{"text":"Service was good as were the discounted cocktails. Food was average. I've definitely had better vegan food in this city."}
{"text":"If you're not vegan but you appreciate a well-made plant-based burger and décor that features clever tofu jokes and cute cartoons that aggressively question your morals, then you will LOVE this vegan burger joint that is staunchly anti-salad and famous for its cruelty-free Big Mac that actually tastes better than the ground beef version but it's not listed on the menu so you have to ask for it, which is what you did last time, so this time you're gonna try the peanut butter and 'bacon' burger because it sounds so peculiar it just might be mind-blowing and your prediction was correct because it is delicious AF and you slather on the side of jelly and take a bite and realize that you maybe shouldn't have ordered the super garlicky garlic fries because by god it is a lot of garlic but then again the menu provided fair warning so it's your own damn fault that you could be charged with attempted vampire murder because your breath is def a deadly weapon now and that's not very vegan is it."}
{"text":"fun fact - there are NO salads here! this restaurant defies EVERY vegan stereotype! the design, the food and even the dessert was absolutely amazing.  we went for lunch so the line wasn't very long but it was still very packed. the wait for food is around 15 minutes. i would REALLY recommend getting the mac and cheese balls - they were super delicious. the burger was equally great but nothing too spectacular. the sauces this restaurant makes are also super unique and awesome. compared to mythology diner, this one is a bit more on the unhealthy side but it is definitely a better bang for your buck. definitely coming back and getting more of this yummy place! yep"}
{"text":"Of course I had the Big Mac, and it was a hit! I generally don't like vegan burgers so that is saying something. I wasn't a fan of the vegan bacon at all, but it didn't take away from the delicious experience. I had some kind of cider mixed drink, very delicious as well.  Now, it is NOT healthy just because it's vegan, but great overall experience."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are a good amount of negative reviews on here because my experience was amazing! Went around 7PM with my boyfriend on a Saturday night and it was packed, was told it would be a 30 minute wait and they'd notify me by text message when a table/bar space would be available- they did in a timely manner and the waitress and staff were nice & polite the whole time. I got the Big Mac with regular fries and my boyfriend got the BBQ pulled pork burger with the animal fries- he devoured his plate. I was honestly shocked at how similar the Big Mac was to a McDonald's Big Mac but waaaaaay better. The burger was pretty large- I was only able to eat half of it but I do get full easily. I would definitely go back and highly recommend- especially for anyone who is not vegan. I hope the store can expand or move to a larger space because it seems like there is demand for their food since it was so packed- not sure if it's always like this or it was just the time I went. The music they played was really good and I felt like dancing the whole time I was there- could've turned the volume down a little bit though, a little hard to have conversations with the music blasting."}
{"text":"I am not vegan but I am lactose intolerant, and the friend I went with is vegetarian. I was BLOWN AWAY by how good the food was here since vegan meat can be really good or not good at all. We both got the chicken burger and my friend was actually worried it was real chicken because it looked and tasted so real. I could tell is wasn't chicken but it was still reallllly good. They have a vegan Big Mac that looked delicious. I regret not getting the milkshake, it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!! Came here with a friend around 9pm on a Saturday night. It was packed, so we were put on a waitlist and we got a text as soon as there was space available. The wait took about 15 minutes. We were greeted by the friendliest waitress I've ever had! She made some recommendations on the menu, and told us about each meal with great detail. I chose the Big Mac meal and my friend chose the crispy chicken sandwich. Overall; the food tasted amazing.  I'm not vegan; but I will gladly eat a Doomies Big Mac over the McDonald's kind. The only complaint I have; the food was UNBELIEVABLY FILLING!!! Do not be fooled by the photos!!!! The portions may look small; but they will leave you full for 6+ hours. My friend actually puked afterwards because he was so full.  Just take it easy with how much you actually eat, and you're bound to have an awesome time here  10/10"}
{"text":"While everything was delicious, it was very, very heavy.  I'm no stranger to fried and 'comfort' (i.e. non calorie conservative) food, but it hit me like a punch in the gut.  I'm not going to sugar coat this, but I was physically sick after eating here.  It's good, but I don't think it's for me.  The vegan Caesar was amazing, and probably the first time I've had one since I became vegetarian!"}
{"text":"The food was delish! It's def more of a junk food place though, just cause it's vegan doesn't mean it la healthy. Left feeling like I ingested a lot of unnecessary fat. Cheat day quality meal. Hangover meal! Not an everyday meal."}
{"text":"As a non-vegan I have to say that this is comfort food at its finest. If you're expecting to find salads and humus you're most certainly in the wrong place. Doomies is about a hearty vegan experience that entails so much more for your tastebuds. I most certainly did not miss the meat when I was inhaling (because that's the only way to describe eating as quickly as I did) my chicken and waffles.   Side note; they have fried Oreos so, you know...GO!"}
{"text":"Amazing is an understatement. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, great vibe and unbelievably good food!"}
{"text":"First.. Love the decor! Its dark, neon signs, and the selfie room is covered with comics!!  The staff is super friendly and helpful. And we were seated at the front window seats! Perfect for people watching and awesome lighting for photos.  We ordered:  Fried Avocado: Super crunchy with creamy avocado. It wasn't seasoned enough but the ranch and sriracha definitely helped.  Jalapeno Poppers: Crunchy and cheesy with a kick from the jalapenos. My favourite! Good with and without the ranch.  Mac Daddy: Off the menu so fulfilling. 2 soy patties, soft toasted buns, lettuce, onions, pickles, with a Veganaise Big Mac sauce and house cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was delish! It wasnt like fake cheddar or daiya cheeze.   With a side of Fries: We upgraded to the garlic fries. Their desciprtion was right on point! Garlic, garlic and more garlic. Made with garlic oil and topped with a garlicky paste/crumble.  - Also tastes great between the burger layers :)  Definitely can't wait to go again and try other things on their menu!!"}
{"text":"Quite impressed with all the flavours in fake meats .. it was my first time to Vegan spot, and I was surprised. The place is small, the service was quick, and burgers we ordered startled me. We had their crispy chicken burger and the big Mac. I will go again to make sure, that what I had was a great non meat but vegan meaty stuff."}
{"text":"So overwhelming with the options but had their nachos and cookies and cream shake and was amazing! Would definitely go back to try more of the mention items."}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place would be a good vegan junk food option...but it is just really gross. We had the big mac and fries and the big Mac was messy (like you can't bite it without it falling apart) and way too bland. The cheese was really too much. The fries were 10x saltier than junky mcdonalds fries and were an effort to try to eat. There is way better vegan comfort food around."}
{"text":"Sorry to be the dissenting voice here but the burger I had today didn't justify the hype or the over hour long wait which accompanied it. I had more time on my hands than was comfortable to peruse the menu and it is unoriginally vegan comfort (read: greasy spoon) food set in a trendy, highly Instagrammable space (note the de rigueur neon light signage; ironic \"no salads\" sign; the basement with wall-to-wall cartoon art, which screams \"take a selfie now, pee later\"). Don't even get me started on the uncomfortably loud music. I'm trying to eat lunch, not pretend I'm at Coachella.  Now onto the real meat, pardon the pun, of this review. The standard of a veggie burger is often how good it tastes with the reference point being that of an old fashioned ground beef patty. Well, Doomie's succeeds in making a wheat- and soy-based patty taste quite \"meat-like\", but it is still a pretty bland patty, seriously lacking in umami and has that rubbery texture many faux meats have. I couldn't believe how long it took the kitchen to send out something so dull.   Overall, I was quite disappointed. It is only hitting me know how ironic it is that after almost a decade of vegetarianism (more mediocre veg burgers than I can possibly count), this trendy LA burger joint got me to pay nearly $20 for a sub-par veggie burger that took over an hour to no doubt be \"crafted\".   They say, \"This ain't your nana's vegan restaurant\", but I think I would prefer to eat at nana's."}
{"text":"The best place to eat a nice vegan meal! I came here with my friends last week and I must say, we were impressed. Doomie's puts every other vegan restaurant in Toronto to shame! Everything looked and tasted superb! The portions are huge so you'll feel pleased and satisfied with one dish per person. My favourite items here include the fried Mac N Cheese balls, the Vegan Big Mac and the Pesto Fries. All were cooked to perfection and made you forget that the food here is actually vegan. I will definitely be coming back! Sure, the food is a bit expensive but it is totally worth the price given that every menu item here is vegan."}
{"text":"Tried Doomies for the first time yesterday!   Amazing for vegetarians and vegans!   I went with an off the menu item, veggie mac, animal fries and a coke to wash it down.   Atmosphere: the place was packed. I managed to get their and the bar seating was empty, but, filled up quickly.   Food: The veggie mac was delicious, although next time I'd order a classic with the \"mac sauce.\" Two patties was too much to eat (i still managed to scarf them both down). The animal fries were delicious and reminiscent of In and Out burger animal fries....I'm vegetarian but my wife eats meat....I can definitely see her enjoying this place!  Overall, amazing food and atmosphere! I see a return in the near future!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend to treat him to dinner.  We're both omnivores but lean more toward reducetarian.  Food was dry and heavily soy'd, it didn't live up to the hype.    The atmosphere, I found, was pretty hectic.  We were seated next to the service station.  We both work in the industry, and appreciate good service, but these servers were just plain needy.    What bothered us the most though was the at offensive \"artwork\" on the walls, shaming anyone who doesn't have a vegan diet.  As an omnivore, it made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in this establishment.  It also lacked in any artistic value whatsoever, but that's my two cents!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way over after hearing alot of good things from different people. The overall vibe of the spot is awesome as there is good music, an arcade gaming machine, simple decor, and friendly staff and patrons. I tried the mac and cheese bites followed by the chicken and waffles. I loved the mac and cheese bites while I was slightly disappointed by the chicken . While the texture for a something that isn't chicken was a very close, the batter in general was too doughy and bland. It was fried perfectly; I just wish there was even some pepper at a minimum in the batter for flavor and taste. If it was topped with even a spicy maple syrup, that could help as well if the batter can't be fixed. All and all, it is wonderful to have more diverse vegan options at a place like doomies that doesn't make you feel like you are missing out too much.  I will likely go back."}
{"text":"My favourite vegan restaurant! Must try the jalapeño poppers, if you like spice that is! Quite spicy! Mmmm..."}
{"text":"Pros: I ordered the big Mac. Not on the menu but recommended. Food above average Bartender friendly  Cons: little tight Pricey"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this place!  Amazing vegan junk food. One less star for all if the oil. Took the kids there for lunch..holy moly I'm in trouble. They'll be begging for it all week. Yum yum"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try here, all the hype and the appeal of their menu, who wouldn't be? I came here opening weekend with my friend and we were both so delighted with the menu. I got a Caesar and she got the peanut butter milkshake. We both loved them! We ordered burgers (I got the big Mac) and she ordered the chicken burger. We each upgraded fries and would share. I loved the atmosphere.  My only problem was out wait for for, people arrived after us and ordered their food and left before we ever received ours. It kind of ruined our excitement. I would have completely understood since it was opening weekend, however we basically watched a full turnover, and we orders right away.   However the food was great, I loved the big mac (although I couldn't finish it) and my friend loved her meal. We both loved our fries as well.   Hopefully next time service won't be so slow so we can truly enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"No animals were harmed in the making of this review.  Ever thought about going vegan for the animals / the environment but you didn't want to miss out on all the filthy bar food so you decided to become a \"flexitarian\"? Or maybe you switched to humane, free range, (insert feel-good buzzwords)? Well you surely need to check this place out!  This is a 100% vegan bar, mainly serving bar foods prepared with meat & cheese substitutes with the taste and the texture of the real deal. If you are expecting a grass juice or a kale salad in here then you are going to be extremely disappointed.  I asked for the chicken & waffles but they were out of those, sad! The waitress recommended the vegan version of the Big Mac. Portions were Huge, something rarely seen in vegan restaurants. Burger is filthy in a very good way and you will need napkins.  Update: I finally tried their chicken & waffles. They are amazing! tastes better than the Big Mac if you ask me. I absolutely recommend it. Oh and don't upgrade to \"fun fries\", not worth it if you ask me.  In case their tasty food didn't convince you to go vegan, there are plenty of vegansidekick.com comics on the walls that should do the trick.  This place is 30 min drive from my home. Totally worth it. I hope more vegan bars like this one open all around Toronto and GTA."}
{"text":"Food is super greasy, fun fries are great, bigmac is not so good, the peanut butter and bacon burger is great, but the lettuce and onion on it don't work well. The chicken sandwich is also great. They recently learned that a Dark and Stormy is made with black spiced rum and not Jameson, so maybe they deserve 3 stars instead, but wait times for food are brutally long, even when it's not busy."}
{"text":"Had bookmarked this place for a long time after hearing of its opening. Finally made the long drive.   The restaurant itself has minimalist signage out side and easy to miss. Parking is bit of a problem as well. Green P a short walk, but was full.   Anyways we came in at a right time. Got seated in about 5 minutes. The music loud, the decor minimalist inside as well. The server was pleasant and attentive. Small restaurant and hardly seats 35-40.   Ordered a Chick'n Fingers to start and the four of us ordered a Crispy Chick'n Burger with Mushroom fries, a Beafly Tacos, South in yer Mouth with Pesto Fries and a Big Mac with Regular Fries.   Haven't ever been to one, but the plates are third world prisonly!! It goes well with theme. The fingers were nice and hot. Crispy outside and nice and outside. The coating on the out side was perfect, but the chick'n needed some seasoning. The BBQ Sauce and Ranch (cannot still get over that it was vegan-it was so close) were top notch.   The Crispy Chicken was good, served with mayo on the side. The burger perfectly fried with crispiness on the out and soft inside. The Mushroom Fries came with a lot mushrooms but all in spot rather than spread over evenly.   The Tacos were a surprise. Filled to the brim with fixings and beefly. The side of retried beans were a bit too watered, otherwise tasted great. The fresh corn tacos were breaking apart by the the we got to the last one.   The Pulled Pork Sandwich with Mac Cheese was another surprise hit. The pulled pork filled enough and topped with even more mac n cheese. The Mac n Cheese could not have been vegan. My daughter who is die hard mac n cheese and cheese fan loved the sandwich and her opinion that mac n Cheese was one of the best she has ever had including the non vegans she has had. The fries with pesto sauce were not ready and we were asked if we could wait for a few minutes and have them together or have the fries delivered a few minutes after. We opted to fries to be delivered later. The fries were good, but drenched with pesto. Perhaps they could halve the pesto sauce and it would be perfect.   And finally the Big Mac. As most of the reviews this burger is huge and amazing. The cheese, the patty, the size and toppings just perfect. Perhaps even better than the original. Warning - Make sure you are hungry,'otherwise you will not be able to finish it. Also make sure you have lots of napkins around. It will be messy!!  Overall nice little restaurant, a bit pricey but good feel guilty food. Almost felt as if I cheated on my veganism."}
{"text":"Doomie's is so cool. I visited on Friday afternoon at about 1:30 for lunch with a friend and we were seated immediately by a super nice staff member there. We ordered the South In Yer Mouth (BBQ pulled pork on a roll topped with mac and cheese) and Peanut Butter and Bacon burger, and they were both really good. I absolutely want to go back to try the famed \"Mac Daddy\" vegan big mac. This time they did not have milkshakes available, but I would also like to go back and try a milkshake when their machine is up and running :). Loved it!"}
{"text":"Big Mac burger was an absolute mess - in terms of sauce. Fun place! Fun decor and washroom/selfie room! If you like meat, the burger will surprise you."}
{"text":"I wanted to give 5 stars just for the vegan part but I'm not sure if they do it for the veganism and what it represents.  The first time we went there it was amazing, I was shocked to find vegan burgers that actually taste good. But after that the quality was dropping.. take out or dine in you could feel that your stomach was dancing. They just throw the food on the plate and that's it. Like a pop up restaurant that will close soon. I don't know, products expired? Too many chemicals? Never changed the oil on the fryer?  Bad quality food. Really bad quality food. And what's with the salad? No profit there? Seems like Mac Donald's owner opened a vegan restaurant because it's a booming industry. Not eating there again."}
{"text":"Seems like more and more people are crossing over to a vegan lifestyle. Who knows if it's the right or wrong thing to do. But I do know it's trending and I'm all about pleasing the palate. I decided to venture to this Vegan style burger joint. Yes I said it burger joint LOL.  Now let's be clear there is not one animal product in this establishment so no real beef, chicken or cheese here folks! I started with fried Avocado's that's was different.  There was enough for three people to share. I opted for the grilled chicken sandwich as it seemed like the healthier option in my head. I paired it with good ole American fries.  The meal was delicious overall despite being vegan. Did my chicken taste like chicken? For the most part it did. I'm not going to question how they achieved this flavor.  Nonetheless I was full after the experience surprisingly, I had no room for dessert.  This is a cute little spot located in downtown Toronto. Trendy and hipster. Cool place for brunch! They serve a variety of wine and alcohol. I'm assuming all beverages are vegan as well. Ps no salads. Think burger joint with no beef. Yes they serve milk shakes!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, nothing  nutritious if that's what you're looking for.  Friendly staff. The grease needed to be changed it made the place smell not great and the fries did not taste that great either.  If you come with kids the music might not want be what you want them to be listening to-lots of swearing!  They absolutely need to clean better, the floor under the ice machine was really dirty and there were food stains on the surface and we were the first customers of the day so that mess was from the day before. Because of the cleanliness issue we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Good for one visit, you probably won't be back. As a vegan for many years I was glad to visit on a recent trip to the area. The decor is interesting and noteworthy.  The service is good. The food is so oil-ladened and fat filled that it is almost inedible, yeah it's vegan and not health food but this is just too much. I'm glad I went but will not return."}
{"text":"Doomie's is awesome. \"No Salads\" sign is funny as nothing here is healthy. However, the \"Big Mac\" and Mac and Cheese rocked it!  The BM here is a little different than the Los Angeles location. I think they use Gardien party's in LA. At any rate very good. Service outstanding from Diana was excellent with a nice smile. Cool bar area with good selection. See you in LA."}
{"text":"Nice spot! Was my first time here after hearing and reading great reviews so I'm glad I took the chance and tried it. It's so refreshing going to a restaurant and not worrying about if there's anything on the menu I can eat (I'm vegetarian). But anyways, it's not too big of a spot, but a decent size with a bar area as well.   Anyways, unfortunately the day I went they ran out or \"chicken\"...womp wompppp. It sucks because I really wanted to try the chicken parm (maybe next time). Instead, i got the nachos which were surprisingly good! I haven't tasted a vegan cheese thus far in my life that I actually like but the cheese on the nachos tasted good. The only thing I didn't like is that some of my chips were undercooked (tasting really chewy and hard to bite in to). The mojito I had was also decent. My date--who is an avid carnivore--had the tacos which he enjoyed as well.   To sum up, I'd go back because I enjoyed the food I had."}
{"text":"So amazed this place is 100% vegan everything tastes just like the real thing! Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Wife has been vegetarian for 30+ years, I'm an omnivore with plant-based tendencies. Together we've eaten A LOT of vegetarian food over the years and I can say that our Doomie's experience was probably some of the worst veg' fair we've ever had.  Cold, greasy, and unimaginative would be the kindest words I had to sum up our experiences.  Jalapeno poppers, were cold, had a 1cm thick hard batter on them and the jalapeno's tasted like they'd been previously pickled.  I had the pulled pork tacos, my wife had a veggie burger with garlic fries.    Tacos were oil-slicks. Veggie burger was cold and tasted like elmer's glue The garlic fries were also cold and had the strangest flavour (maybe the processed minced garlic on the fries was packed in rancid oil - dunno)  We sent back the burger and fries.  Worst ever.  DOOMies is appropriately named."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to eat here, and was not disappointed! Well, maybe a little disappointed at the tepid fries. Our server was fantastic at making us feel welcome and suggesting the best options on (and off) the menu.   My friend and I both got sandwiches to split and share. I decided to order the pulled pork sandwich since I've never actually eaten pulled pork in real life. It was ok, but I wasn't thrilled with it. It was a lot of BBQ sauce and small pieces of fake meat in a sandwich, but still pretty tasty.   I upgraded my fries to the Buffalo fries and the sauces were fantastic, but the temperature of the fries had cooled significantly by the time they arrived.  My friend ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and it was the absolute best fake chicken sandwich I had ever crammed into my mouth. The texture and crunch were spot on and is the absolute closest thing to the real deal, even way better than I remember.   He upgraded his fries to the bacon cheese fries, which were a bit of a let down. The bacon was just scattered, firm little pieces of fake meat and there wasn't a whole lot of cheese on there, but tasty enough.  There is a Big Mac option that I am dying to try, especially since I've never eaten a real Big Mac and would love to ethically experience what the fuss is all about. But my friend reminded me of how much I dislike feeling like a fat ass after I eat too much food, so I'll just have to get one when I'm especially hungry and he's not with me to experience my revolting gluttony."}
{"text":"Who knew vegan food could taste so good!  I have more recently been interested in trying vegan food, and this place has won me over! I went here with a friend while visiting Toronto. I had the BBQ pork tacos and the animal fries. Both were amazing! The BBQ pork actually tasted like BBQ pork even though it was made with mushrooms. My friend had the pesto fries, which were also amazing! I wish I could find more restaurants like this!"}
{"text":"Woo, veggie restaurants!  The food: - Pulled pork sandwich: Holy geez, get this if you go; it was our favorite part of the meal. - Crispy chicken sandwich: A solid chicken sandwich. - Chicken fingers w/bbq & ranch: Not bad! The chicken fingers were -perfectly- crispy. The BBQ sauce was tasty, but honestly was necessary to make up for the lackluster flavor of the \"chicken\". I'd still eat them again. - Plain fries: I'm partial to crispy-on-the-outside, mushy-on-the-inside fries, and these fit the bill wonderfully. - Buffalo fries: My companion was in love with these fries and compared their flavor to buffalo wings.  The good: - The food! So good! Like most vegan food, if you're going in with the mindset of comparing it to \"the real thing\", it may not live up to your expectations-- but it can still be damned enjoyable! - The staff! Very friendly and accommodating. They checked on us just the right amount. - The decor was, I quote, \"fun\", according to my foody friend. I especially loved the no-frills \"NO SALADS\" sign behind the bar. Freakin' salads.  The bad: - The music was WAY TOO LOUD, and the bar/kitchen area produced a lot of noise as well. It was difficult to have a conversation over the din. - The seats were tall, narrow barstool-esque seats with tiny backs. I'm more or less an average-sized person and I had trouble stopping myself from sliding out of my seat when I leaned forward over the table. - Tiny table made it difficult to shuffle food around and find a place for my personal items, but that's par for the course for trendy, cram-as-many-tables-as-possible-into-one-place type joints.  In conclusion, I'd be happier if they turned the music down and got more comfortable seating, but the food's worth it anyway."}
{"text":"Overrated. Fried avocado wasn't that great. Wasn't crazy about the coat of breading, too heavy. I got the pulled \"pork\" tacos. The filling itself was delicious and the sauce it was coating in was good. However, they served it with iceberg lettuce which is sacrilegious. the refried beans were way too watery. Very odd. Not sure why they didn't think to just put better toppings with the taco. Why not a pineapple salsa and maybe a purple cabbage slaw? What about guacamole? Super unimpressed."}
{"text":"I have only amazing things to say about Doomie's!   I have been dying to go since I first heard about the original location in LA. I have probably spent hours on the Instagram geotag for Doomie's Home Cookin' salivating over all of the delicious-looking photos. So I basically had a freakout when I heard they were opening in Toronto.   My foodie friend and I made the trek to Doomie's a week after opening. I was immediately impressed by the fact that they have their own geotag on snapchat :D. We put our names down for a table, which they said would be about an hour, but the wait ended up being only 45 mins. They have a text system, so we were able to go down the street to a tea bar and wait for the text to come.  It was SO hard to choose what to order. We finally decided on the Oreo Kahlua Vodka milkshake and the fried mac and cheese balls to share. I got the crispy chicken burger and my friend got the grilled chicken burger.   The mac and cheese balls came first. They were amazing and we both loved the barbeque sauce that came with. Then came the milkshake. It was so sweet and SO thick that we had to eat it with spoons instead of drink it with the straws. But it was literally the best milkshake I've had.   Then came the burgers with fries. They definitely had that fast food flavour, which is kind of nice because, as a vegan, you hardly get to indulge in fast food anymore. I also loved how crispy the fries were - definitely better than average thin fries.   The service at Doomie's was pretty quick and our waitress was super friendly.   My only complaint would be that the restaurant was a little bit hot inside, but not hot enough to take off a star.  I will be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my Vegan aunt and I was truly amazed! I normally am iffy about trying vegan things because of past traumas :p But the burgers were really great. To anyone you would not be able to taste nor detect that the place was vegan until someone told you. I loved it! Plus eating vegan cheese made me feel better about being lactose intolerant. I'm not sure if Oreo's are vegan, but their fried oreos were just crispy enough for me."}
{"text":"Looking for vegan fast food? Doomies your spot.  Open late for all your burger and fries cravings. Bf and i came around 9pm and got seated quickly but had terrible service from the waitress. Rude attitude and while we left seem to be wanting more tips.   1. Big Mac (Mac Daddy) with fries $16: Delicious huge burger with a side of fries. The patty had good flavor, tasted just like beef. The burger had enough toppings but not enough sauce. The fries was a bit oily and overcooked but you are eating \"fast food\" style.   2. Fun fries with toppings of vegan meat, cheese, onions, mushrooms $10: Not worth the money. Big portion but not enough mushrooms and cheese on the topping. The fries was extremely oily for me. I was expecting more flavour from the \"meat\" but the onions and mushrooms didn't help, so I ended up using ketchup for most of the fries.   Overall, great joint for vegan fast food, get a burger with fries instead of the fun fries."}
{"text":"This vegan spot is all right I expected a lot more because of the reviews that I've seen on social media  The cheese on the mac and cheese was flavorless the pesto on the fries were flavorless the pork in the pork sandwich tasted really good the barbecue sauce was excellent  The fries were alright the sangria tasted really good and the Pumpkin shake tasted like Thanksgiving and a glass jalapeno poppers really good  Overall it wasn't a horrible experience but I would not go out of my way to try this place if you're in the area then definitely go ahead it is very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"I couldn't even believe everything i was eating was Vegan. I got the buffalo crispy chicken sandwich. It was amazing and I really am so happy i got to eat here. Definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"Vegan comfort food at its best. Totally impressed by the variety. Unique that they have a \"soy free\" section of the menu also for those trying not to overload on the almighty soy.   Jalapeño poppers - unbelievable! A hefty portion, entire jalapeños oozing with cheddar style cheese. I don't normally eat vegan cheese because it tastes far too artificial, but I have to say that these tasted like the real thing. A welcome surprise after 15 years of no dairy.   Crispy chicken sandwich - you could easily fool a meat eater with that sandwich. Holy moly! The taste and texture were spot on.   Buffalo style fries - really yummy. Again, cool to eat buffalo flavour when you're a vegan. Was a welcome flavour adventure.   Pulled pork tacos - yeah, we really went overboard with the comfort food. We couldn't finish the huge portion of tacos but they made amazing leftovers. The texture and flavour were great. Sweet and smoky, just how they should be.   Can't wait to try the Big Mac and animal fries next time!"}
{"text":"My first time in the restaurant and my experience was beyond my expectations, I love this place and ask for the Big Mac."}
{"text":"It was my first time at doomies and i really enjoyed my meal. I am in customer service and have been for over 10 years and i cant believe how i was treated. I came was told to sit at the bar( i was by myself) and not explained a thing on the menu! Another young woman came in shortly after m and the server was friendly to her, explained the menu and provided her friendly service...i was not treated fairly and i will be telling all of my friends about this experience and will not be returning there."}
{"text":"Food? EXCELLENT. Service? Friendly & knowledgable, but slow...  I went here with a friend and we arrived shortly after 8:30 PM on a Friday night, there was a waitlist but was told it would be about a 30 minute wait- they were true to their word we were seated within 25 minutes.   I originally wanted to order the \"South in Yer Mouth\" which is barbecue pulled pork sandwich topped with mac & cheese, and my friend ordered off the gluten-free menu but however much to our dismay they no longer had the pulled pork. Unfortunately for my friend who tries to avoid gluten, this was a disappointment as it meant all four options on the gluten free menu were now unavailable. Understandable, but unfortunate that the gluten free options only offered pulled pork.   Luckily, they did have the secret menu option of their \"Big Mac\" and so I ordered that. My friend ultimately ordered the crispy chicken sandwich & fries, and we got the deep fried mac & \"cheese\" balls. I loved the deep fried balls, they were pretty hard on the outside however absolutely deliciousness awaits inside. The BBQ sauce complimented it really well.   The burger- mainly the sauce, was excellent. Tasted incredible and I was definitely not let down. I'm also picky and hard to please when it comes to french fries, but they were great too. Tried some of the crispy \"chicken\" sandwich and it tasted incredible as well.  If the rating was based on food & atmosphere alone, it would be a 5/5. I had no complaints when it came to the food and it surpassed my expectations.   The music was great, staff was friendly. Shame the service was incredibly slow, and once we got our food we didn't see our waiter for a long, long time. Even the initial round of ordering took quite some time prior to the server checking on us. Seemed liked she was the only waitress working in the place."}
{"text":"Big. Fat. Yes.  I've been wanting to hit up Doomie's for AGES and finally got the chance with my vegetarian pal.We came around 6 on a Friday and were seated immediately. Interior is clean, modern, and very instal-worthy. Think classic black and white colour scheme n attractive wood-top bar.   Their daily drink special knocked $4 off cocktails from 5-7pm - my friend and I both drove but otherwise, great to know. A $5 caesar is hella rare at a place like this - let alone on a Friday.   We both ordered crispy chicken burgers with regular fries and they came out super quickly.Presentation was great. Not stingy w the fries in the slightest. Might have been some of the best fries I've ever had to be honest. The burgers were a world of their own. We both took a bite, looked at each other and literally said, \"Oh, we're coming back.\" THAT good y'all.   Make sure to stop in at the restroom before you leave! Lots of really cool vegan-themed cartoons down there. Good for a little read or a little selfie - your call."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I really like the idea of vegan junk food. The vegan bacon was a bit of a miss for me, but the desserts are amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing, I'm not vegan but I couldn't even believe I wasn't eating meat! I went with a group of friends to try it out after following them on Instagram for a while and we were all very impressed. None of us are big on meat and one is a vegetarian and she also felt like it was meat. Definitely check it out if your in town...we had the mac n cheese balls, chicken sandwich with fries, pulled pork sandwich and a mac n cheese burger.  All recommended! The chicken was the only one that you could kinda notice it's not exactly chicken but it was still good."}
{"text":"A vegan friend and I were the first through the doors when this place opened on a recent, sunny June Saturday. The place filled up almost instantly. And the strain showed: our food took almost 45 minutes to arrive, long after people around us had been served, even though they'd arrived after we did.  That was fine. I had time to sip a very good virgin Caesar (no booze). It was well spiced, with some foliage to make it more interesting.  My friend perused the menu in great detail, and was frustrated that she couldn't find the signature faux Big Mac. We asked the server, who said it's not on the menu, although it's definitely available. And it's HUGE.  I had the pulled BBQ pork with mac & cheese on a bun. Nothing even remotely healthy about any of this. It's just pure, unadulterated vegan decadence. I also upgrade my side to the Fun Fries, which meant sweet potato with buffalo spicing and ranch drizzle. Soggy, but good.  The same could be said of my sandwich. The BBQ pulled pork lacked the chewiness you might might expect, and the novelty of the mac & cheese topping didn't really add much, other than calories and fat. Not a bad thing, I suppose.  Amber, our server, was friendly without being smarmy. She apologized for the delay in our order, and offered some helpful suggestions along the way.  The new Drake album was blaring very loudly, and the kitchen staff seemed to be enjoying it quite a bit. And there was a giant, industrial fan strategically placed by the front door to create some circulation. The combination of fan noise and musical volume made conversation very difficult, which detracted from the experience.  I also knocked a star off the score because there was some kind of greasy oil on the floor around our table and on the first chair my friend was given. There's no reason for that, especially when we're the first customers of the day.  Some of this I'm prepared to chalk up to growing pains. We'll give it another try when the place has had a chance to find its groove."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.   No wait, seated immediately, food was out in about 10 minutes.   I had the pulled pork. I thought it looked small when it arrived but I could barely finish it. Of course I also had one of my wife's tacos.   All was good. It's not fine dining and not intended to be.  It's tasty burger-y food.   They have a couple of nice beers on tap and the staff is excellent."}
{"text":"What is this place? A cool place to grab Vegan Junk Food! Now, I'm no vegan - not even vegetarian but because I love my friends, I decided to meet them at Doomie's.   I have to admit, it is a very cool concept. The decor is really cool, there's little cartoon vegan comic strips with vegan humor around the restaurant. Also there's a Mini Nintendo that you can play with at the front of the restaurant.   We waited for about 15 minutes for a table (it's a small space), we were seated towards the back and the server took our drink orders. I had a lot of trouble deciding what to order. My friend and I settled for the Big Mac & the Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwich with fries. We upgraded both orders of fries to Animal Fries and Garlic Fries.   The food came out probably 25 minutes later. I personally have never had real Big Mac so I can't compare but it honestly didn't taste like anything. The pickles, Onions and sauce is where the flavor was, the soy patties had ZERO flavor, it honestly tasted like rubber. I wasn't a fan of that. The garlic fries that were paired with that were good, it was real bits of garlic and the fries had a great crispy coating.   Next up was the Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwich. This is what I liked, I guess fake chicken tastes more like chicken then fake meat does to real meat. I liked the crispiness and the buffalo sauce was great. The Animal Fries were amazing, fried onions and some secret sauce made for a great topping.   We obviously had to order dessert so we ordered the Creme Brûlée & the Cookie with Ice Cream. The Creme Brûlée  is one of the worst I've had, I think the base was some uncooked tofu, with burnt sugar on top. It wasn't creamy and had no flavor. The Cookie skillet was really good! The ice cream was surprisingly creamy - the cookie had a nice crunch around the outside and a warm center.   So all in all I enjoyed my experience here as a non vegan. I probably would not come back, if I had the option of eating a real burger and real chicken then I obviously would. I like the taste, whereas this doesn't really have a taste and is masked with sauces. I guess if I was meeting other vegans, I wouldn't mind coming back. If you have not gone, then check it out and let me know how you like it.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"This place is a vegetarian's paradise and a foodie's dream. If you have a soft spot for junk food (think Five Guys, McDonalds, etc) and are looking for something juicy, delicious, and guilt free (I mean, not in terms of calories, but in terms of animals.)   Never in a million years did I think that I could eat a Vegetarian Big Mac (not on the menu, you have to ask) and a 'Crispy Chick'n' Sandwich and not be able to tell that it was a vegetarian meal. It tastes the same (even if your eyes are open!)   The fries are excellent. I am fussy about fries (I hate thick cut, except for from St. Louis's) and these ones are the eat-every-last-one-on-the-plate good. Thin and crispy. I would highly recommend upgrading your fries to something special. We got the pesto fries, which were are good as I was hoping they'd be, and the 'bacon cheese' fries, which blew me away. The bacon was tempeh (I think) and saltier than regular bacon but still delicious. I wouldn't ordinarily order bacon so this was a real treat.   The atmosphere of the place was cute. It's small and nothing totally fancy, with vegetarian posters along the wall. The location was a little off the beaten path (Dufferin and Queen West, so far!) but well worth the trip.   Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Love the place, It enforces the vegan food culture which is so good for the environment and save animals rights. This have a tremendous impact to the environment People should eat vegan food more often. The good part about this place is that you can have all the meat food as a vegan product without causing and death for animals. I came to this place and ordered the chicken burger and actual tested link chicken with crumbs. Also they have vegan cheese. I donot know how they make it but the food was great and could not believe how vegan food can taste soo good. They have a free arcade machine which is soo much fun and on saterday they have 10 shots and beer which is a good price.  The washroom is a bit confusing cuz of the writing and the mirrors but service is great and place was nice will recomend people to give it a try."}
{"text":"\"You're a vegan? Are you going to eat a salad?\" Not at Doomie's! No salad here.  First of all, don't even try driving to this place.  Parking was stressful and scarce. My girlfriend and I decided to come here for a Friday night dinner.  Amazing experience! The people were very friendly, super attentive and very accommodating.  They made sure we had plenty of water, napkins etc.  For food, we started with Mac and Cheese balls.  So so so so good. It came with 2 types of sauces.  Ranch (?) And a bbq sauce; both of which added great flavour to the already flavorful starter.  My girlfriend had a \"Big Mac\" which I ate half of :3 and a chicken pesto Mac and Cheese. Everything tasted amazing.  The washrooms were cool too. They had little comic strips on all the walls to add some vegan humour.  This place is pretty small but very clean and the kitchen is open so you can see everything.  Would 100% come back."}
{"text":"I hate to be such a Debbie Downer on a place that has received so much hype, but I was pretty disappointed. I've been a vegetarian 7 years and had some tasty veggie burgers--unfortunately this was not one of them. My boyfriend and I have been dying to try this place and the famed vegan Big Mac, so when we went that's what we tried--$16 for that and fries.  The fries are pretty good, but the burger itself left a lot to be desired. I mean a lot. In fact, I've had similar or better burgers from the freezer section of the grocery store. It didn't help that it took us an hour to get in (no take out orders, despite that they do have take out containers), and another 45 minutes for the food to actually be delivered. After paying $16 each for food that was pretty mediocre, I feel saddened to say I probably won't be returning here."}
{"text":"I don't like using the word \"overrated\" but this place is overrated. Greasy unappetizing food. Only mediocre thing was the fries. The mac and cheese balls were cold inside."}
{"text":"My partner and I went to Doomie's for dinner. Neither of us is vegan, but we live in the neighbourhood and decided to try something different.   For drinks, we had the vegan Cesar and a cocktail from their list. The Cesar was ok- it was maybe missing the kick from not having clam juice. The cocktail (I forget what it was called) tasted like a Shirley Temple. Would have been better with less soda.   The portion sizes were generous. We had beef and pork tacos. Definitely better than the popular taco place down the street. The flavour was good, and the veggie toppings were generous.   If I was a vegetarian who craved meat (?), I would come back. But, for us, it just wasn't special enough to make a second trip."}
{"text":"Great Food let down by an amazingly-crappy service!  Good: The food is very different and tasty. Being a vegetarian, it is awesome to have a whole menu to choose from. They should commend themselves for creating such unique \"meat-less meat\" dishes. It is truly one of a kind.  Bad: The place is quite cramped, the wait times are long usually, they somehow cannot effectively estimate their demand. They almost always run out of some dishes. (Chicken, or Pork)  Ugly: I have been to Doomie's three times to date. I have had acceptable, non-complaint worthy, service every time. Last night was one of the worst services I have encountered there. I raved about this place to my coworkers; I took four of them with me. We were told it will be 25 minutes wait and we agreed. Even after 45 minutes, none of the tables got empty so we couldn't be seated. We all decided to sit at the bar instead and told the hostess that we would like to be switched if a table clears our before our food arrives. Like predicted, a table cleared out and I asked my bartender if she can put us there. She went and checked with the hostess and I overheard the hostess say, \"well they already sat there, so I am not gonna bother changing them\". The hostess knew of our intention to be seated at a table instead. But she ignored our request and gave the table to someone else (who just walked in and asked for a table). The Bartender came back and told me that the other party arrived before us so we couldn't be seated. I told her \"that's not true, its ok, you don't have to lie to me. we will sit here\". The Bartender got super offended and started trying to tell her version of the story, but stopped telling in the middle, threw down the glass cup she was cleaning and walked out on us like a teenager. She refused to serve us or even look at us from then on. we had to get the attention of another bartender so we could get our drink and food.  PS: sorry for the long review, dont let my experience define this place. Please be watchful when you visit Doomie's"}
{"text":"I had been recommended Doomie's multiple times by several vegan friends in the Toronto area and had yet to make it over ... but when I finally did I was not disappointed.    If there's a long wait, you put your name down and they text you.  This is good because there's no place inside to wait.  I've eaten at the counter, at tables, and at the window ... by far my favorite place to sit is at the window, but all options are great.  Note, everything here is soy based.  Soy allergies beware, this is not a place for you.  THINGS I HAVE TRIED THAT I LIKED: *CHICKEN BURGER: Mmmm, this is by far my favorite thing at Doomies.  I am a huge fan of fake Chicken (you guys don't have Morning Star Farms here, do you?).  I have never had good fake chicken out in the real world, so I am happy to say that this chicken burger wins.  It's fried, crispy, and just oh so good. *BUFFALO CHICKEN BURGER:  My dad got this and liked it.  I however am not a fan of their Buffalo sauce.  This didn't have so much sauce on it though. *ANIMAL FRIES:  These are my favorite version of their loaded fries.  They don't get soggy and have just the right amount of grilled onions. *GARLIC FRIES:  These fries are good but VERY garlic-y.  Don't get if your date doesn't like garlic.  They reheat very well though. *BIG MAC: My dad got this and said it was literally like eating an actual Big Mac.  Huge, but great.  Side note:  The fake cheese here is really good, I usually do not like fake cheese.  THINGS I HAVE TRIED THAT I WOULD NOT GET AGAIN: *FRIED AVOCADO:  Tasteless. *BUFFALO FRIES: So much sauce that it just is overwhelming and mushy. *NACHO FRIES:  They weren't my dads favorite but they were good.  Must eat with fork.  I just wouldn't get these again because of how great the other fry options are. *CHIMICHONGA:  It's HUGE and mostly filled with peppers.  Not so many beans and fake meat.  Needed more of it.  Doomies is great because even the meat-eaters at my work think it looks great ... I can't wait to come back and have it again."}
{"text":"What a terrific \"junk food\" experience. The Mac Daddy was a great representation and almost too much. The poppers and Mac n cheese via were terrific. Staff was friendly and made the experience fun"}
{"text":"The Big Mac lived the hype. It was definitely big and definitely tasted like a mac. The fries was good and crispy as well. Had the jalapeno poppers on the side. It was great. Although one may not have been stuffed as well as the other, it was still delectable. The space was well decorated. The wall art was hilarious. The service was great. Not intrusive and very friendly. Ambiance was very chilled. It was a good dinner experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Doomies a few years ago, way before becoming an avid Yelp user, and my experience back then was far better than the experience I had this time around. The last time I went, I think I ordered one of the burgers with fries and the meal was really good. However on my most recent trip to Doomies, I ordered the Chicken Pesto Bowl, and I couldn't finish it due to how much I disliked it. It started off ok; it's basically a macaroni pasta bowl with chunks of tomato and \"chicken\" covered in a creamy white sauce. The pasta was good but the chicken and tomatoes were not. The chicken had a weird, spongy texture and the tomatoes were too much for the dish, in my opinion. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles; he is not a vegan, or vegetarian, or even a pescatarian, just a good friend willing to try something new, and he told me that his \"chicken\" was too dry. I realize that it's all vegan products imitating real meat so of course we can't expect perfection, but I just really can't get past the weird texture of the \"chicken\" on my bowl.   On the plus side, the place itself is great with a Street Fighter game free-to-play at the front of the store (if you're waiting to be seated, it's a fun way to pass the time), great service, and a cool washroom area for taking pictures. And considering that the last time I visited Doomies, the food was satisfactory, I think I just chose the wrong thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is really tasty and the service is really great (attentive and friendly). Had the Big Mac, which is messy and big enough for two meals (brought the other half home for lunch). It's not in the menu - have to ask for it specially. Be warned: Place is super loud - music is cranked and people are shouting over it. Don't come here if you like hearing your dinner mates. ;)"}
{"text":"After SO many months of waiting to try this out, I FINALLY got into the restaurant!  I nearly wept tears of joy when I saw that there was no line and the place was relatively empty.  I ordered the Big Mac burger right away, this was a no-brainer for me.  The food was messy, big, and super delicious.  I couldn't even finish it myself and had to gave 1/3 to someone else (who VERY happily accepted)!  The menu looked amazing and I definitely will want to try out some of their other items.  Special note regarding service: we ordered a chocolate peanut butter shake and the kitchen never got the order, in response, we were given two of them instead!  Thank you very much for that!  Definitely recommend!  And it was especially good news for me to see that Uber and Foodora do delivery for them.  Hibernation season is around the corner after all..."}
{"text":"Hi Doomie's! Welcome to Toronto!  I say that because Doomie's is a vegan restaurant from our neighbour south of the border. Los Angeles specifically. They are know for their #whatveganseat movement. That they don't just eat salads and raw foods.  Their menu lists items similar to what you would find at your everyday pub. Burgers, sandwiches, and a whole bunch of fried stuff - except everything is vegan!  I love avocados and was immediately drawn to fried avocados as it was the first item on the menu. My friend and I also ordered \"fried chicken\" and waffle and mac & cheese. Everything was delicious! Other items on the menu I'm tempted to try: pesto chicken mac & cheese, \"pulled pork\" burger and their assortment of desserts including doombits.  They have quite the cocktail menu as well!  One slight issue I had was with their ventilation. I'm not sure whether it was because it was their grand opening and they weren't able to get the issue sorted or not, but my friend and I sat right by the door, and at times when they used a hot sauce, it was so concentrated that it caused a lot of my friend and I to cough a lot, even the hostess had to open the door to air it out.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'll admit I haven't been to a whole lot of vegan restaurants, although I have eaten a lot of vegan food and I thus know that it does have the potential to be almost as delicious as regular food. (Let's face it, meat will always be tastier than soy.)  We arrived at the restaurant right at noon on a blisteringly hot Saturday and were immediately told that the air conditioning wasn't working. I do believe that it was hotter in the restaurant than out.  At any rate, with all the ballyhoo over their imitation Big Mac burger, we knew we had to forge ahead and deal with the heat. (As an amusing aside, the burger isn't on the menu and when we asked about it, we were told they weren't allowed to refer to the burger by name but that she knew, with a wink, what we were asking for.)  The food arrived shortly after and it was an intimidatingly oversized portion. (It probably didn't help that I upgraded to chili cheese fries.)  It really did look like a Big Mac, admittedly. And the sauce is incredibly similar to the special sauce on McDonalds' most famous offering. It's not surprising, then, that I did enjoy eating this thing until I got about halfway through, after which point the taste of the patties became more and more prominent.  I've had plenty of veggie patties in my life and this is definitely one of the worst. It's got this undefinable, funky flavor that leaves a horrible aftertaste. I don't know what's in that thing but it's a trainwreck, pretty much.  The fries didn't fare any better, sadly. The fries themselves are fine, but the \"cheese\" and \"chili\" are nothing short of disgusting. I ate the fries on the edges and left the soggy mess in the middle.  I wonder if maybe my opinion of Doomie's would be different if I were a vegan. Those meat substitutes are just too foul to overlook, ultimately."}
{"text":"I had the crispy chicken sandwich, fries,and chilli mac. The sandwich had really good crispiness but it was bland. The mac did not have much cheesy flavour at all, kind of bland considering we even ordered the chilli version. Fries were really good.  To top it off..something did not agree with me and i got sick that night. So, sorry Doomie's but i don't think I'll be back.  My boyfriend on the other hand enjoyed his food and would go again (pulled pork sandwich)."}
{"text":"I had the off-menu \"Big Mac\" and some Animal Fries and it was FANTASTIC. A mess to eat, dripping down my sleeves, and better than an actual Big Mac.  Almost too much food, but what a vegan experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere with good vibes.  From the outside looks like your average pub however the staff were great and welcoming, food was amazing (most of the food you can't even tell if it's meat or not). Would highly recommend it to veg and non veg folks out here to at least try it ! They also have dark humor comic wall which is highly entertaining if you're sitting in front of it haha."}
{"text":"Wow, well what can I say about Doomies? My friends/family and I went there for my sisters birthday celebration. My fiance and I were the first to arrive before the rest of our party (honestly we were about an hour early, wanted to have drinks and chat with one another etc). They sat us right away even though our table number was going to be 5 the waitress didn't make us wait at the door which was super nice. I can't imagine standing for 1 hr and thats exactly what happened to us at Hogtown Vegan. Boo! It's more about personal kindness at Doomies and respect. Needless to say we finally met up with the rest of the group and our waitress served everyone super quickly and she filled my beer RIGHT UP! None of that half full crap you usually get at cheap places that only care about saving a buck. It was a hot day too so it was nice to have cold brews after commuting on the ttc in the blasted heat - the second we sat down we were refreshed!  We informed her it was my sisters bday in conversation and she brought everyones meals very quickly and was really awesome about it. The food was bloody fantastic - may I suggest almost everyone in our party got the MAC DADDY - it tasted exactly like a big mac and it was DOUBLE the size with a huge side of fries. I am so happy they don't skimp here - after all its all vegan. The prices are fair for the amount of food you get too.  At the end of the meal she was super nice (the waitress) and brought our party Doomies bites for free so my sister and us could sing happy birthday. Our waitress had slightly pink hair - I wish I could've remembered her name but she was super sweet! Previously from Richmond hill (if that helps). Just wanted to leave her a great review and say we will all be back very soon for more Doomies."}
{"text":"After almost 15 years of being veg, I was able to remember what a Big Mac tasted like. And let me tell you, it was heaven! I'm so glad I made the drive down (50 mins) to get here.   I had the deep fried avocado, Mac Daddy, and animal style fries.   The Big Mac was the biggest hit. Exactly how I remember the original tasting, but more fresh.  The deep fried avocado was ok. The breading tasted exactly like fried chicken, which was weird, but my veg husband loved. Animal style fries were ok too. I found the grilled onion a bit overpowering, but that's my fault. I just skimmed the menu, because I was ordering based on Recommendations online.  I would 100% go again and that Mac will haunt my dreams, until I do. I would just get the regular fries next time, and the mac and cheese bites. My friend got those and said they were amazing.   I'm so happy this place exists."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! Vegan big could've been better if the soy patties weren't so thick."}
{"text":"A nice rustic vegan pub. We came on a Wednesday evening with a party of 5. Although it looked super busy we were seated within a few minutes. The music was on the high side but its a pub with a great atmosphere. The waitress was quick and super nice. Most of us ordered the Big Mac and one Mac and Cheese. Everything was fulling and the flavors were bang on. This is our new go to vegan dinner spot, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Quick catch up with a long time friend who I hadn't seen in a while. Neither of us are vegan but we wanted to give this place a shot.   I had their \"Chicken\" burger with all the yummy toppings and a side of Sriracha fries! It was a bit pricey ~$20 for a burger and fries; BUT it was worth it! As someone who likes to discover vegan eats.. this was a great pick. They have all the pub food like burgers, fries, mac n cheese etc and everything is vegan. So not \"healthy\" per say, but good for once-in-a-while burger for a vegan that actually tastes like one.   The service was amazing - friendly, attentive and courteous.   Will surely go back sometime soon with some more friends to share some of their apps!"}
{"text":"The place is way too small for the seating demand. They have one spot where more than 5 people can sit so if you have a few large groups, the wait could be hours. We waited almost 2 hours for seating. Food was okay. We had the Vegan Big Mac with fries. My fries were cold and the food was super greasy, but it's a comfort food joint so I can't really say much about that. The smoke detector kept going off because it's near the kitchen, which kept startling me since it was so loud. The waitress was great. Unfortunately I can't remember her name but she seemed like the most outgoing and talkative out of all of them. She is the reason why I'm giving this review 3 stars. This place has the potential to be an amazing vegan restaurant but not a lot of people will be willing to wait that long for seating. I don't think I will be going back any time soon unless they move to a larger location."}
{"text":"If you're vegan, this is a must visit in Toronto. If you are looking for healthy, vegan food, try up the street. This is more like messy, delicious, vegan junk food. We heard about their vegan Big Macs and my date really wanted to go and yes, it lived up to the hype.   The restaurant is small with a neat retro game vibe on the inside. My date ordered the vegan Big Mac and I got the Elvis burger (vegan bacon and peanut butter) and animal fries. My burger was really good, but the Big Mac was better. Animal fries were so good and messy.   We ate way too much food, but left so happy. 100% worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Why have I never thought of putting maple syrup on my fries before!?   Fun atmosphere & good selection of vegan food, which I'm definitely going back to try more of."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. I got buffalo burger with buffalo fries, and creme brûlée last time I went. It was delicious. The creme brûlée is something I've been wanting to try veganized for so long but only now had the opportunity to. It was surprisingly realistic. I've found recipes for it but it's a little too ambitious so it's cool that I can enjoy it at Doomie's whenever. The service is always friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. All vegan, but traditionally-styled Foods, including chicken and waffles. I was so impressed, and the drinks were great as well!"}
{"text":"Finally visited Doomie's and exceed my expectations. It was quite busy on a Thursday evening and we had to wait about half an hour. I love that they are able to send you a quick text when your table is ready. We took advantage of this and went over to a pub for a quick drink. They give you about 10-15 mins to arrive after the text.  We were there around dinner time and despite it being busy, we were attended quickly. The tables are a little close to each other but it tends to be a cool crowd in there. The music is really good too.  We got drinks and the Mac and cheese balls to start, they were hot, fresh and amazing. We both got the \"Big Mac's\" with fries. Mine were regular and my bf's were garlic fries. If you're a garlic lover those are great, the garlic taste is definitely present. I haven't had a Big Mac in yearsss and if I was given this without knowing, i'd think it were the real thing. The \"mayo\" was so good too ! Only downside is I did find the big mac's a little pricier than I would expect to pay for.   Overall, good atmosphere and music, friendly and efficient service, delicious food when in stock.   I'm vegetarian, and my boyfriend is quite the meat lover, but we would both return."}
{"text":"Great food but not worth having to endure the music that they insist upon blasting at you.  It's a restaurant, not a nightclub!  Both times I went I literally could not have a conversation without standing up, leaning over the table, and yelling into my friend's ear.  When I asked the staff to turn the volume down they just shrugged me off and stated the obvious; \"oh that's just how loud we play it\". It was a relief to leave, just to get away from the racket.  NEVER going there again."}
{"text":"This is not a place that serves low calorie, low grease, no guilt, dainty vegan food. Oh no. No sir. This is messy, good, hearty vegan food joint that will leave you completely satisfied, greasy, fat and happy.  I've visited Doomie's 4 times this year and I'm definitely a big fan. My partner and I love to visit Doomie's whenever possible, which unfortunately for us, is not often as we don't live close to the city.  We have tried the pulled pork mac n' cheese, the philly steak bun, one of their burgers, different variations of their fries and their skillet cookie! (Next on my list are their milkshakes and any of their chicken dishes, which always seem to be sold out when we arrive). It's all delicious and SUCH a treat. I don't find this place to be very inexpensive but I think the price is definitely worth what you're getting. Make sure to search the internet for some secret menu foods that they offer (*cough* vegan Big Mac *cough*).  Overall, big fan. Their pulled pork can be a little too salty sometimes for my taste, but am I reeeeeeeally complaining ....? Nah."}
{"text":"I never would have thought that the best burger in Toronto is vegan, but Doomie's proved that to be the case.   Even thought being a vegan burger joint is Doomie's \"claim to fame\" I would have definitely come here had I known about it, before I was a vegetarian. Their burgers really are damn good, and I say that comparing it to beef burgers at places like the Burgers' Priest and Hero Burger. They do an off-menu Doomie's version of a Big Mac-like burger that you really gotta try. It is messy, in no way dignified but oh so good! I was barely able to eat a quarter of my fries because I filled up completely on that beautiful creation. That said, we also ordered a Crème Brule to try and it was as good as a Crème Brule that I've had at Cluny's before which really is saying something.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention that I really enjoyed the ambiance and service as well. Diana was our server and her attitude and knowledge of the food made our first (of what will probably be many) visits to Doomie's pleasant and fun. The ambiance is like that of a slightly hipster bar thrown together with an industrial loft. Balanced, albeit a bit loudly with decent top40's type hip-hop music on in the background.   All told for two people including a beer and a mojito with desert it came to $60+tip, which is really quite good for the quality and amount of food. Its also almost exactly what you'd pay at a place like Fresh for the same type of food but done, in my opinion with better quality recipes and a much more fun atmosphere. If you're looking for good bar food and a good bar you gotta check this place out, yes its vegan but that doesn't change that it's a bloody good place to go."}
{"text":"Walked in to this narrow restaurant with three friends, and was shown to a table right away. Ordered a peanut butter chocolate shake to start, which was mind-blowingly good. We waited eagerly for our mains... I got the mac and cheese, and stole some of my partner's sriracha fries. Both were really good. I also stole some of my friend's garlic fries, which are INTENSELY garlic-y. Do not be fooled - it's a bit much even for a garlic lover like me.  The food was honestly amazing, but I don't know if I will be back. This place could be fantastic if not for the subpar service (our server became extremely unpleasant as soon as we asked for split bills), gentrification vibes (trap music with [at the time] all white staff... in Parkdale), nasty walls (I assume the paint job is intentional, but I don't get it and it looks gross) and the holier-than-thou vegan messages posted around."}
{"text":"Made my way over on the second or third day after opening and ordered the Vegan Big Mac with fries. The presentation was exceptional...the mock McDonald's containers were clearly a huge hit. While it was not the best vegan burger patty I've ever tasted, it was still good and their big mac sauce was delicious.   Trying to eat this burger was truly a messy endeavor.  This burger is huge, you definitely get your money's worth. Brought a non-vegan friend along (who loved the burger more than I did, by the way) and halfway through our meals we were wishing we had shared.  Overall, very pleased with my experience. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"The fries are generally delicious. The garlic fries, especially, were so simple but yummy. The mac and cheese was absolutely terrible. It was so bland. It literally tasted like Kraft Dinner. No, Kraft Dinner is actually cheesier. The burger patties are okay, but I've definitely made better vegan burgers at home on my BBQ. This place = hipsters + hype."}
{"text":"First time going to doomies.  I tried the big mac and upgraded to animal fries. The big mac was drenched in sauce. The food was good the patties were better than I expected. Lastly, the animal fries that was drenched in sauce too was okay.   I enjoyed the layout of the store the room downstairs was amazing and unique. I would definately go back to doomies if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Was very unimpressed and underwhelmed. Made me feel sick. Thought the food was over salted and unappetizing. I dont think I will ever ba able to get behind vegan food attempting to meat ( something that it isn't) meat. The atmosphere was alright. Slightly over priced. Would not ever go back"}
{"text":"Came here with my friends who say bug meat eaters, and we all left extremely full and Happy. The two were almost convinced that they were actually eating meat.   Although the wait seemed long, it was worth it. I can see people coming to try the vegan big Mac, but I believe the best items on the menu are the south in yer mouth (pulled \"pork\") and the pesto fries"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a vegan version of Tim Bits my entire adult life and inally found it here. The Doom Bits come with ice cream. I'm done."}
{"text":"Parking: Paid - Nearby Green P parking  Venue: Small - aisles are narrow too. They have 1 special booth 2 side tables with wall couch and about 4 other tables I think. Also a bar where you can dine. Don't show up with a large group, this is a place where you and 3 or 4 friends would come to due to the space of the area.   Washrooms: Very cool! It was interesting. There are A TON of little comics to read on the wall when you're down there!  Experience: They implement a cool and high-tech queue system where you're put on a waiting list on a tablet. Once you give them your name and phone number they will text your phone when your table is ready. So you could actually walk around the Queen Street area and explore instead of just standing inside the venue waiting for your name to be called out. You're given 15 minutes to return and claim your reservation.  They play awesome music at this venue too!  How's the food?  Food was superb! My friends and I tried many things on the menu, the \"chicken\" burger, with upgraded fries (buffalo and nacho fries), the \"chicken\" fingers (which we didn't really enjoy) and a dessert. Best of all everything is vegan so \"No Animals were harmed in the making of this food\" Hueheuheuehue!"}
{"text":"The food here was great. I had the philly cheese steak ($14.00) which tasted amazing even the fries that came with it were delicious. I am not a vegan but I honestly could not tell the difference. We did have to wait a bit before being seated, which is expected for Doomies. It was nice that you could just leave your number and they would text you when the table was ready.  The prices were pretty reasonable, you could really pig out without emptying out your pockets too much. It was worth the hype!"}
{"text":"Mind-blowing plant food served with very little enthusiasm in a mediocre space.  I've been excited about trying Doomie's since the company announced their Toronto location.  Even as a city with a ton of diverse vegan options, TO's been lacking a good pig out (fake-pig out?) joint.  Doomie's has all of the junk I love - fries, stuff on fries, hot sauce on stuff.  I was fully prepared to have a new favorite restaurant.  I'll talk about the food first because it really is a standout.  This is the most convincing faux meat and dairy I've ever had.  A friend ordered the classic burger, of which I tried a bite, and if I'd bitten into it anywhere else I would have been totally freaked out that they'd apparently served me real beef by accident.  Many of you are probably familiar with the supermarket Beyond Burger; this tops even that.  Chick'n is a little easier to pull off, but that was impressive too.  My hot Buffalo sandwich brought me right back to my days of Jim's Steak Out chicken finger subs, and the bleu cheese dressing was tasty with the awesome, crispy fries.  Even the macaroni and cheese - a dish that's particularly difficult to pull off a plant based version of - was pretty fantastic, and the portion was enormous.  What we didn't like was our service.  They had two people on the floor at peak lunch hour on a weekend, both of whom seemed uninterested in helping us in lieu of texting behind the bar and repeatedly straightening the coat rack.  We saw our order come up and sit on the counter between the kitchen and dining area for a solid five minutes.  Despite having a secret menu (from which one orders the famous Big Mac), they were unwilling to accommodate off-menu requests.  Be aware that they don't serve coffee and will be a little rude to you if you ask for it.    Get takeout."}
{"text":"The food was delicious a bit expensive but we worth it.  Customer service was good its a pretty chill place, definitely check it out!  Great vegan option"}
{"text":"Uh-mazing. Funky little place, with vitriolic but funny vegan comics all over the walls and a dive diner vibe that fits Queen West well.  It hails as vegan junk food (emphasis on junk, so anyone who thinks vegan = health food or gluten friendly or whatever is in the wrong place), and hugely delivers there. There are TONS of options to choose from, and nearly everything was great. A few small pointless items (like the deep fried avocado) are plain and tasteless, but things like the Buffalo \"chicken\" and their \"Big Mac\" are worth it alone, and satisfied even the most skeptical carnivores at our table.   Deep fried Oreos were another big hit with the group.   Overall the portions were huge (for the mains, anyway), so you leave full but even the meat-eaters commented that they didn't feel \"sick full\" lol.   I am veg, and love the places that are popping up all over the city... This one is another great, and I truly believe worth it, even for the meaty types."}
{"text":"A crowded, dark restaurant in Queen West area, but we love it. Their Big Mac is absolutely amazing. It looks just like the real thing. Their chicken fingers are also really good. We always get both dishes whenever we go.   Last time we were there, we got the nacho fun fries and the chilli cheese fries. We didn't like the chilli cheese fries too much, but the nacho fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"Doomie's is a cute little vegan spot in Parkdale serving up all kinds of guilty pleasures. Reliable favourites are the animal fries, the buffalo fries and the Big Mac (literally EVERYONE'S favourite). The Oreo milkshake is also a decadent treat - especially with a cheeky splash of booze in it  Stick to these for a good time. I've tried quite a few other items on the menu and was a bit disappointed. The service here has always been attentive and super friendly. My only \"beef\" would be that it's quite expensive for a burgers and fries joint and maybe just a bit too heavy on the grease tip for my liking, although I do realize this is simply a personal preference. I've found myself uncomfortably full, if not ill after most of my meals here.. yet I keep coming back? The food is tasty but if you're not used  to chowing down on greasy grub too often, it could very well upset your stomach."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place? Vegan... Tasty... Inexpensive and such a cool vibe! I'm personally not vegan but this Resturant can turn you... The cheese in the Mac and cheese balls ... So FRIKKEN creamy and delicious. Honestly the only negative thing I would say is if you are to order the Big Mac get it \"light on the Mac sauce\" or just get  a regular  burger dressed as Mac. The BigMac is super messy and gets soggy fast, you can't finish it.. Maybe you can.. But everyone I was with couldn't. The fries are delicious, crispy AF!!  ice cream and fried Oreos are a staple dessert. The staff are super friendly and willing to tell you what your meal is made out of if you're interested. This spot is a solid 10/10 for me... Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My favourite vegan restaurant! The fries were amazing and as someone who is anaphylactic to milk, I have never had the option to eat a pazookie (chocolate chip skillet cake), but the one here is amazing! Even my non-allergic/non-vegan friends loved it."}
{"text":"Meh... Overall this place is just okay. The best way to describe it is that I think I love the IDEA of what Doomie's has to offer more than how the food actually tastes. I think it's great that as a vegan there's a place to visit that offers an entire menu of fun varied junky items and nothing on the menu is off-limits. I was however disappointed with the taste of my burger.   I will say I enjoyed my animal fries a lot, those were great. Absolutely love that they offer fun items like vegan fried Mac and cheese balls which tasted okay --  The bbq and ranch sauce they served with it was really good though.   I had a bacon cheeseburger and my friend had the Wild West burger -- we were both disappointed. I didn't like the bacon at all (the waiter said it was a mix of soy and wheat). The patty was one of those burgers that has a strange strong taste of too much textured soy protein... I've had much better tasting vegan patties that could pass for beef. My friend liked the onion rings on her burger but again didn't like the taste of the patty or bacon.  My verdict is:  Fries/fun snacks - yes I would return for these  Burger patty/bacon - definitely not... There are better tasting options out there.   Maybe I would give their chicken burger a try if I come back."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out so stopped for dessert and a drink after dinner. We had a great \"Crème Brulee\" and the rest of their all Vegan menu looked awesome!"}
{"text":"Doomies does it again! Danggg I love this place! My sister and I were originally intending on going to Mythology, but it wasn't open yet - so we headed next door to Doomies.  To start we got the mac n cheese balls. Do yourself a favour and order these little balls of deliciousness. They are amazing. They come with a ranch dip and a really awesome, really smokey BBQ sauce. And if you don't finish the dips, keep them to dip your fries in when your main dish arrives. Fries + BBQ sauce = heaven.  I ordered the buffalo chicken burger, I don't remember seeing this in the menu last time - so maybe it's new!? It wasn't crazy spicy but it had a nice kick to it. I would definitely order this over the regular chicken burger."}
{"text":"A solid three. Only some things on the menu are decent. Allow me to elaborate:  The good: The vegan big mac. Gross in a good way. The oreo milkshake with vodka and kahlua. Ya you can't mess that up. Cocktails : all good. Wine: all good.  The bad: Deep fried Oreos. The server even tried to talk me out of them (should have listened), but I LOVE oreos! They are too thickly breaded in batter that fish would be breaded in (not sweet) So its like oreos wrapped in bread and deep fried, gross and not edible.  The pesto mac n cheese. I was hoping for some creamy yummy vegan version of a mac n cheese, but instead it was just pasta with lightly flavoured cheese water and a few bits of green and zero flavour. I could drain the water cheese off in a big watery puddle. I was given more sauce to correct this, but still too watery. Mac n cheese has to creamy and cheesy and tasty. This is not any of those things  All the \"special\" fries are a rip off as you are just paying $4 for sauce added onto fries. Just get the regular fries."}
{"text":"The precious, precious gem from LA that has graced us with their presence. There was A LOT of hype surrounding this place and I really wish it lived up to it. I was super excited to try their food. I even wanted to try the secret big mac menu item. I never even liked big macs before being vegan. That's how big the hype was.   Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.   The atmosphere is amazing. Love the retro game in the front. I have no doubt that they have amazing drinks at their bar. Had I not driven there, I would have ordered something from the bar. Love, love, LOVE the selfie room. I don't like that it isn't accessible. I have no need for an accessible restaurant BUT I'm really disappointed as everything should be accessible.  There are many complaints about it. But also the fact that their restrooms are downstairs makes it no better. Don't bother contacting their Facebook page, as they most likely won't reply. Don't worry, they'll read your message, they just won't respond. Had I not asked a question on a Facebook post in a vegan group AND had an employee not been a member of that group, I still would not have received an answer to my question I asked monthsss ago.   The food. The hyped up not so amazing food. I decided to go with the classic burger as it was the closest thing to the big mac without the extra toppings. The burger was nothing special. It tasted like a frozen veggie burger I would buy at the grocery store. The kind I couldn't bare to finish because it tastes so weird. Or alternatively, drown it in ketchup to try to mask the flavour which is what I did. My mistake was adding the mayo to the burger. The mayo itself was good. But adding it to the burger made it worse. The fries were ordinary. Below average. I was really expecting better fries. They're probably one of the worst fries I've ever had. Don't get me wrong, they tasted good but they aren't great and I've definitely had better. I really like the cranberry-orange juice mix I ordered though.   Even though I was really disappointed, I'm curious about the crispy chicken burger which I was told was popular. Also the buffalo chicken burger sounded appealing. If I decide to go back, I would try one of those but more leaning towards the buffalo for flavour. But if I wasn't feeling adventurous, I would definitely try a dessert, the mac and cheese and something from the bar. I heard good things about the bar and the dessert plus I don't think the mac and cheese would be so terrible."}
{"text":"Gave it some time and went back with different friends. They wanted Macs, I got the Philly Cheesesteak with bacon cheese fries. We shared deep fried mac and cheese balls and chicken fingers.  So much food, but nearly no flavour anywhere. The chicken fingers were the only enjoyable part of my meal - and most of that was from the sauces. The mac and cheese balls were crusty balls of gooey blandness, only discernable flavour, again - came from the dipping sauces. My gooey meaty philly cheesesteak? soft bun filled with mock meat, sauteed onions and peppers doused in cheese sauce? So much potential for flavour and there was NOTHING! Bacon cheese fries - how could they get this wrong? It looked good, but they forgot to put the flavour on as well. Have I mentioned that nothing had any remarkable flavour? For the record, I went out for lunch today and at a vegan burrito from Wilbur - and that thing had a ton of flavour - so the issue is not my tongue.  Feedback from the friends on the macs - never again. Impossible to eat without dropping it everywhere and way too much work for something lacking of flavour. Pattie was decent though. Mac sauce was far off base (verified from a big mac eater).  Anyway. I can cross this one off my list now. I've taken it down a star because this place is a wasted opportunity. Service was still super rad though. Helen was great!"}
{"text":"- The hostess texted us when our table was ready, therefore we could walk around the neighbourhood instead of wait in the restaurant. - I ordered the VeganBig Mac: So delicious while its warm :) It tastes like a Gardein type veggie patty. Burger is BIG. Enough to share between 2 people. - My boyfriend ordered the Philly Cheese steak. I was not a fan of the way the \"meat\" tasted. We both preferred the Big Mac. - We both had fries on the side which were delicious.  - We had the deep fried oreos. Oreos were yummy, but i prefer a different tasting Vegan ice cream.  - We were very happy to play their Arcade machine. We played Bomberman and Street Fighter!!! The machine was free, you just got to figure out which buttons do what. -I would go back to try more things off the menu :)"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan at all and came with a friend that was. I was confused because the menu looked like real meat options. We split 3 different dishes. Pulled pork burger was the best IMO. The sauce was great and the texture was extremely real. PB & J burger was good as well. The bacon wasn't very real and it didn't taste smokey like traditional bacon. Lastly, the buffalo chicken was good but you can taste the soy in it. I would highly recommend this place even to non-vegan people.   They play great music as well and the distance between tables were comfortable."}
{"text":"First time I tried Doomies was in Hollywood 6 years ago and fell in love with the Vegan Big Mac so you could imagine how excited I was years later when Doomies showed up in my hood. Great fun place to eat & hang and to eat a burger without feeling super guilty. Vegan comfort food, like hello, yes please."}
{"text":"Vegan comfort food that will leave you feeling extremely uncomfortable.  I came here with a group of 6 on a rainy Saturday. The servers were very rude, had no patience for any questions and were extremely short with us. They stood at the front chatting amongst themselves for about ten minutes before coming to our table. When we finally got to order, here's what we got:   Jalapeno Poppers - 8/10: the only reason this restau received one instead of zero stars. These were actually quite delicious, but I wish there was less 'cheeze' sauce, oozing out of them.   Pulled Pork Nachos - 8/10: again, these were pretty good. The pork was mushroom, which was delicious. Otherwise they were your standard nachos, some of which were soggy which made me question the overall freshness of the food.    Chicken Fingers - 2/10: very MEH, not at all worth the cheat.  Big Mac - 0/10: This was disgusting and nearly impossible to digest. The patty is made from tofu and wheat, which is then sandwiched between more wheat (bread), for an overall horrible experience. I couldn't finish my burger, which was too dry to eat anyways.   Overall, this restaurant seems to try very (too) hard, and their staff need to lose the attitude. We had a waitress roll her eyes at me, then walk away mid-sentence. I'm not sure if it was the rain or just a bad day, but overall a mediocre to bad experience with mediocre to bad food.   Would go to Mythology, Grand Electric, Guu, or Chantecler every. single. time."}
{"text":"I was hoping a vegan restaurant would offer a selection of gluten friendly options, which led to my disappointment with Doomie's. If only the menu was as gluten friendly as the staff were people friendly. Ironically we ended up eating at The Works."}
{"text":"Brought a veggie friend and omnivore here last weekend. Both were quite impressed. The vegan Big Mac uses a couple of gardien patties which are thicker than the actual 10:1 patties used at McD's, but presentation was decent, so many fries(fry?) choices.   If you're trying to convince someone to \"go vegan\" the pulled pork tacos are an easy sell.  Hilarious decor/cartoons to make your eating experience feel a little judgy but it's always good to laugh while you're eating.  Definitely wouldn't put this on the healthiest places to eat from a veg. perspective but a lovely treat when you want to indulge in some fast food cravings without the guilt of frequenting one of the chain restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"ALWAYS a great time to visit this great vegan spot in a great neighbourhood. The menu is expansive and full of fried and delicious appetizers such as mac n' cheese balls, sides of fries in a dozen variations, and mains that range from PB&J burgers to chick'n and waffles. My favourite dessert is the Doom Bits option! Deep-fried doughnuts infused with pumpkin spice goodness. There is also a great menu of cocktails and shakes! You'll find gluten-free options as well, if that's your jam. And, when all is said and done, you can hop on the old-school arcade machine."}
{"text":"Once the food cools down it does not taste good. Everything was over salted and it became really hard to choke it down. The burger patty also had a weird bitter burnt taste to it. We felt pretty gross after our dinner here and pretty gross the next day too.  I was super excited to try it but it's all hype as far as I can tell...  Also, I don't know if their AC was broken that day or what but it was uncomfortably hot and they were out of milkshakes :("}
{"text":"Believe the hype! The saucy big Mac on the secret menu is amazing. Also, Mac and cheese. They use List   which has an app to track the waiting list. Worked well. Staff at the bar was fantastic."}
{"text":"Really awesome food, not just awesome vegan food but just great food full stop. My girlfriend is vegetarian and I'm a full blown meat eater and I really enjoyed my meal. The \"off-menu\" Big Mac is HUGE.. easily enough for 2. Fantastic service, great music and a nice laid back atmosphere. Really chuffed to have discovered this little gem, will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"First off, let me just start by saying I am NOT a vegan but this place is absolutely amazing! I love it!  Was here with my boyfriend (who is also not a vegan) and we were told it would be 30 min to and hour wait, but we were seated within 15 min of waiting which was great because we were hungry!    My boyfriend ordered the infamous Big Mac burger with the Pesto Fries and it was amaaaazing (being the great girlfriend that I am, I just had to take a bite out of his food lol!) Tastes just like a real Big Mac except I feel it tasted much better, has more flavour, and is a lot larger than the normal Big Mac.  The fries were great as well.  I ordered the Peanut Butter n \"Bacon\" burger with the Shroom fries and let me tell you my burger was the bomb.com!  Although, the bacon appeared burnt and black it still tasted like bacon.  The peanut butter added great flavour to my burger and I just absolutely enjoyed it!  The Shroom fries however, were average.  I'm not going to lie the name of it caught my attention and I was intrigued to try it.  Once I received it, the fries weren't anything special as it was only regular fries and diced mushrooms on top.  Nothing extravagant about it.  For dessert, we both decided on the Baked Cookie with Ice Cream on top.  As we were ordering, the waitress had told us they ran out of ice cream and instead she'll replace it with whipped cream on top.......nooooo what's a baked cookie with no ice cream?!  We ended up ordering it anyway because it just looked so damn good to pass up.  Although the baked cookie was warm, soft, gooey, chocolate-y and delicious, it would've been 100x better if it had the ice cream on top which is why I knocked off one star.  Oh well, hopefully next time I visit (yes, there will definitely be a next time!) they will have my ice cream :)  All in all, food was great, service was good, and the experience was awesome."}
{"text":"If you brought someone without telling them that the whole menu is vegan they probably wouldn't notice. I had the chicken and waffles and it really was like the real deal. Having known in the back of my head that the \"chicken\" was vegan I sort of could tell the distinction of the particular taste that wasn't actually chicken. But it really did resemble it, from the texture to the crunch and colour it's just mind boggling. The pairing of the syrup and fries is great. And the whole meal really did stuff me. It's a bit pricy just because of the extra prep that goes into making vegan food resemble actual meat/ animal product is probably the reason why (or to my understanding at least). All in all the restaurant is quite instagram worthy for pics (very cool washroom setting) and the vintage arcade game was probably my favourite thing there. Oh and the music was bumpin' (if u like a 2010s and older pop playlist)."}
{"text":"I had the \"big Mac\" which, from my recollection, was way better than the meat version. The fries are even amazing.   I also tried the chicken and waffles that came with vegan butter (that also tasted better than the real thing) and maple syrup*drools*  The only negative is that the stool seats are so damn small and uncomfortable. It can also get packed on weekends, with a 1 hr wait."}
{"text":"coming to this restaurant you should not expect superb service, healthy vegan food or swanky interiors. this place is all about greasy, stodgy but damn DELICIOUS vegan comfort food! their now famous big Mac meal is a must try, together with everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and great menu selection, definitely a must - try for vegans. That said, I was a little disappointed with my $16 vegan Big Mac. Yes, $16! There wasn't enough sauce and the patties tasted like lame Boca burgers. The fries, which I upgraded to have 1000 island dressing and fried onions were really good though. I also had an order of jalapeño poppers, which were pretty decent. I appreciated the homemade cheese filling but think Tofutti would be better. I also sampled the mac and cheese which was pretty good, nice and creamy."}
{"text":"I went back to Doomie's and they had the jalapeño poppers that I missed out on last time. I was however given yet another list of things they were out of (ie any \"chicken\" dish except 2) which begs the question... why doesn't Doomie's just either plan deliveries better or have daily menus? I'm looking at several reviews from this week and other people mention the lack of \"chicken,\" too. They should have this down by now, so I don't get it. The waitress was so nice, I couldn't be cranky. Plus, hello, poppers!  They are fucking incredible. Like so good, I'm sitting here right now with my mouth watering just thinking about them. They are huge, like 2.5 bites big, super crispy and if you cut one out, it's like a volcano of yellow cheddar-style cheese oozing out of a delicious real jalapeño pepper. Normally I hate ranch anything, but the vegan ranch they come with ain't bad. It's an appetizer that I wish I had just made my meal because the asada tacos, unfortunately, are a bit of a miss. Super dry and tasteless. On the other hand, those refried beans that come with? As delicious as those tacos were disappointing.   So, I have mixed feelings about Doomies. The things I have loved (poppers, jalapeño fries, refried beans) are out of this world. The things I have really not loved (or even liked enough to finish) give me pause. But I'll get it right eventually and keep Doomies on regular rotation for vegan comfort food when in Toronto. Also their waitstaff is just the loveliest."}
{"text":"Ahhh man!!!! Doomie's is the sh*t! I had their 'Mac Daddy' w/ animal fries . BRUH 100% coming back, I'm craving it again just writing this . Finally, a vegan spot where the food actually taste good!!!"}
{"text":"Doomie's is the vegan answer to late-night, post-bar guilt food that carnivores flock to in droves to satisfy their desire for greasy junk food.  The restaurant is not large and was boisterous on a Wednesday evening. There were a mix of ages and groups when we visited.   We initially wanted to each have the off-menu Vegan Mac Daddy (aka the vegan Big Mac). Our friendly server said it might be worthwhile to split an order and see how we felt afterwards - the advice was much appreciated as we both agreed that having an entire order to ourselves would have been overkill. The sandwich was everything you'd expect; sloppy, greasy and exactly the kind of unhealthy food this place is selling.   We also had an order of the fried avocado which was decent if lacking in bold flavour. The vegan caesar and cool cucumber drinks were both fantastic with the sangria being not quite up to par as the first drinks.  An order of the Oreo Vodka shake was also very good if a touch on the expensive side.   I can't see Doomie's being a regular spot for dinner mainly because of how unhealthy it is but it's definitely a great place to grab a bite with your vegan/veg friends if you're craving junk food but don't want them feeling left out when you go to McDonalds!"}
{"text":"Short version: great food, slightly weird vibe. Would go again.   Just had dinner here with two of my other vegetarian friends and we all agreed.   Want the longer version, read on.  Great food: I had the crispy chicken sandwich with a side of regular fries. I opted to not upgrade to any of Doomie's many varieties of fun fries, e.g. buffalo fries or pesto fries. I figured they'd make me too full, and I think this was wise. I left stuffed and satisfied. My friends each ordered the classic burger done up Big Mac style* - which is an off menu item - and they left similarly full. Besides, the fries were also delicious and crispy and needed nothing else besides ketchup.  Weird vibe: The fluorescent lighting is a little harsh and distracting. It seems like a design choice, but I'm much more comfortable in a more warmly lit space. Also, the wall leading to the bathroom and kitchen, which was mostly visible from my table, is covered in pro-vegan cartoon strips. Part of me was like, \"Yeah! These are all making great points and are totally conversations I've had with people!\" and another part of me was like, \"Even as a vegetarian, I don't really want to read about how awful it is to kill animals while I'm eating my fake meat.\"  I'll be back though. I was too full for dessert and I really want to try their deep fried ice cream sandwich.   *Note that getting the classic burger Big Mac style is different than getting the, also off menu, Big Mac. The former comes with a single patty and the latter comes as you would see at McDonald's, with two patties and an extra middle bun. The patties here are almost twice as thick as McD's though, so its quite a lot of food. Beware."}
{"text":"FAVOURITE VEGAN PLACE hands down. It is such a mission for me to get there, but it is always worth it. Staff is phenomenal, food is out-of-this-world, decor is absolutely beautiful. My two top orders here are the Big Mac, and the Pulled-\"Pork\" sandwiches. And of course, the comic strips by the washrooms are so cute and funny. Will always return. Love love love."}
{"text":"I hate rating this place 3 stars because I really loved the food - as in I would DEFINITELY come back. However - my experience in the bathroom afterwards was borderline intolerable, to the point where both me and my boyfriend vowed to only eat salad for the rest of our lives. I personally have been too nervous to go back, but keep in mind that my boyfriend and I both have painfully sensitive stomachs, so it could have been that we were a little sensitive to some of the food, but I'd recommend it to anyone who has access to a toilet after. (I had the big mac, which tasted amazing)"}
{"text":"I realllllllly liked Doomie's.  The restaurant is a ***** to get to, if driving, because I think M and I spent like 20 mins alone looking for parking.    When we got to Doomie's we didn't realize that mythology is literally right beside (they kinda even looked connected). The restaurant is long and narrow and we were seated at the bar. The wait staff are super friendly and were really on the ball (she made sure we had sufficient napkins and even brought out water when she noticed we were finished our first bottle. M and I shared the Mac and cheese poppers! The dip that they came with (I'm assuming ranch) was like unbelievable. I could have had a bottle of that to myself. It was sooooo good. The bbq sauce was just meh (I'm also not a fan of bbq sauce regardless of where I am). Now for the mains M had pesto chicken Mac and cheese and it was really really good. I'm not a fan of ordering pasta but this was really good. I on the other hand got the Big Mac with fries and OMG it was soooo good.  We shared a white wine sangria but it was lacking bits and pieces of fruits. It only had lemon and lime (I thought that was strange).  I thought we would have enough room for dessert but we couldn't even manage to finish one of the mains.  I would definitely come back here and try something else...and of course leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting to get flimsy, insipid food. Nothing in the menu is boring. The food is fattening as heck. The service is bubbly and friendly. The music is loud. Everything about this place is amped up to eleven.   Went with 2 friends on a Wednesday night and the place was jumping. Wine was 50% off by the bottle so we had a couple. Battered fried avocado? Yes please. Mac and cheese bites? Got it. Jalapeño poppers? Yes yes yes.   Portions are generous. The wait staff will enable your cheat day. \"Oh you're full? Take a breather. We're still here.\" So we drank more wine, took the breather, and kept eating.   We ate our fill and more. This was well worth the hike."}
{"text":"There is so much to like about Doomie's.  They absolutely get you with the great location, the diner decor (the hallway/staircase collection of vegan comic strips are spot on), the welcoming staff, and the familiar diner/comfort food menu.  Like many, many of the reviews state, the first thing the server told us was that they were out of all \"chicken\" items.  As a former server, I feel for these workers, that have to continue to inform customer after customer this news (it's an entire section of their menu).  My advice (for what it's worth) - change the menu or prep your purchasing/ordering.  Customers read these reviews, and then walk in and hear the same news . . . which leads them to believe they didn't recently run out, however, they keep talking as if it's an option at times. Luckily, we didn't come for the \"chicken\" items to begin with.  We came for the \"Big Mac\" and Jalapeno Poppers.  I know this sounds crazy, but as a vegan, the ONLY thing I miss is Jalapeno Poppers.  I've never seen vegan ones offered, and I couldn't believe this place offered them!  They were large, fresh (you can tell they aren't some frozen, pre-packaged, daiya option), and amazing!  In all honesty, I could've just made my meal about 20 of these and called it a day.  The \"Big Mac\" was very good as well.  The taste was spot on, and it makes one wonder why fools would continue to eat at McDonald's if the exact taste could easily be imitated without causing harm to anyone.    Mix the great food with some unique beer options and this place has it all.  I'd absolutely come back next time I'm in Toronto - but if the first thing I hear from the waitstaff is that they're out of all \"chicken\" options, I might just laugh out loud."}
{"text":"A vegan colleague was in town, so I thought I'd take her for some good ol' fashion comfort food. Poor vegans, always saddled with salads. That's no way to live. Enter Doomie's.  People are hating a bit on the no take out and lines, but, we were happy to eat in and we went at 1pm on a Tuesday for lunch and we didn't have to wait for a damn thing. I loved my burger, their fries are crispy, salty goodness and their cocktail list looks good.   I'm not a vegan, so this probably won't become a staple for me. However, I will recommend to any veg head who will listen."}
{"text":"If you're looking for vegan comfort food then yes, this is your place. However, if you're looking for HEALTHY vegan food, keep looking. This place is built on the unholy trinity of gluten, corn and soy. I find it shocking when there are so many healthier substitutes to choose from. There was nothing we could order that our bodies wouldn't react to. My son and I cheated and it wasn't worth the cheat. But if none of those play a factor in your life then go indulge.  Everything looked good if you're down for a vegan Mc Donald's."}
{"text":"We tried the vegan Big Mac and it was unreal. Better than McDonald's without question. For dessert we tried the fried Oreos, doom bits (like timbits, made with pumpkin purée) and the creme brûlée. I'm not a dessert guy but these were still all really, really good.   The fact that the food is vegan (I'm not even vegetarian) is secondary to the fact that it's delicious. Totally worth a visit."}
{"text":"By no means would I ever deter someone from visiting Doomie's. It truly breaks the mold when it comes to vegan establishments bar the actual food and I think that's important, particularly when you're in the habit of visiting a lot of vegan restaurants that tend to all look the same (typical vegan chique: untreated wood accents, plants everywhere, etc.). This spot definitely has it going on for the decor, space, music, and above all, fantastic service (as everyone else has noted).  The food, unfortunately, fell seriously short for me. My partner's burger (the wild west) really impressed both of us: seldom do you encounter a vegan burger that's so stacked for flavour and texture. However, the mac and cheese I ordered had less flavour than a box of kraft dinner. I really don't think anyone in this day and age has any excuse to serve something so bland and charge $10 for it. Constructively speaking, I think if Doomie's took the time to have some serious menu R&D they'd have a five star establishment on their hands.  Also, as everyone else has noted, they were all out of chicken products for the night (?)"}
{"text":"*unbiased opinion because I am a vegetarian who eats vegan food 99% of the time*  How to make a doomies burger 101: buy a pack of frozen yves burger, take a slice of daiya cheese and melt it with plastic, and put both things between a white bun.   ...in short, DO NOT EAT HERE. The food is actually terrible. It's overly oily, I didn't even finish my fries and sometimes I order double fries just because I love fries so much. It's honestly the whole vegan hype why this place is so popular and beloved. Save your money and your stomach by avoiding his disaster of a place. Vegan food does not have to taste bad and often times it doesn't proven time and time again by other amazing vegan restaurants in the city like Apiecalypse Now, Hogtown Vegan, and Fresh. To everyone who gave this place a good review: you are kidding yourself by thinking this is good vegan food. Honestly just go to Harvey's and get a $5 veggie burger with vegan add ons.   Service: good and fast but that means nothing when the food makes me want to throw up."}
{"text":"We went to Doomie's for my birthday and few weeks ago and I will definitely be back soon. My husband, an omnivore, had the famous Big Daddy- vegan version of the big mac - with fries with onions in top and I had the chicken and waffles. The burger was amazing! Big and delicious... hubby loved it! But the fries with the onions were too saucy in my opinion. BTW the burger is off the menu so ask for it to the waitress.  The chicken and waffles were ok but let's say I will not order it again. The un chicken and waffles from Hogtown Vegan is much much better.  We ordered the chocolate chips cookie pie for dessert  and it was DELICIOUS! A must try! Warm cookie with melting chocolate chips and a scoop of vegan ice cream on top!  The service was amazing and loved the washroom.  My only not favorite thing is the seats were not comfortable but not a deal breaker at all."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a weekday night. The place was quite busy, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a place in the booth at the back. The best thing about this place is the choice of music; 90s hip hop music blaring through the night. I thought that was very unique and interesting and brought a cool dimension that you won't see very often at vegan restaurants. As for the food, we ordered the chicken and waffles, the veggie burger, and the soft tacos. The tacos were the best. The staff was very friendly. The only strike against is that the food is a bit pricier than it should be, but it's good experience overall."}
