{"text":"Look no further, Modern Proteins is hands down superb. The quality of food is phenomenal and comes conveniently packed for quick, easy meals. Beyond the food, the customer service was exceptional. Adam responded to my many questions with promptness and professionalism. The attention to detail and accommodations were above and beyond what I ever expected to receive. I will definitely be continuing business with Modern Proteins."}
{"text":"Just amazing is the short version of my experience so far. Prior to ordering my meal plan I emailed quite a few questions which were answered kindly and promptly.  The food itself is terrific. I.have tried everything from steak, salmon, bison, chicken, ground meat and turkey and all are grade A.   I cannot recommend enough and if you are the fence jump over"}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Las Vegas I gain 5 pounds and spend at least $1000 on food. So the last time I visited I looked up healthy meal delivery in Las Vegas and found Modern Proteins. They delivered directly to my hotel in individual microwaveable packages. They included really fresh, delicious sides like avocado and roasted salsa. The proteins were cooked perfectly and it ended up costing me a quarter of the price to eat their food during my stay. I'm very particular when it comes to organic food and I was impressed with the high quality. Thank you for amazing service and healthy meals delivered! It made my vacation so much easier!"}
{"text":"I signed up and got my first delivery. I just tried an awesome egg scrambled with asperagus and yams. It was so tasty and included slivered almonds. I can't wait for lunch, I think I'll try the tilapia, or maybe, the ground turkey.  All the entrees look awesome. What is even cooler is since the meals are gluten free, my teenager can eat them too. I can't wait to try the other meals. I was worried 21 meals wouldn't fit in my fridge (as so much is dedicated to others, but all the meals fit on a little more than one small shelf.  The delivery was on time and came with a smile. I think I've found the healthy eating answer"}
{"text":"I enjoy having flavorful and nutrition packed meals delivered to my door. I used to cook professionally and am quite critical when eating out but I was pleasantly surprised when my first delivery arrived. Food is well prepared and flavorful. Meats are par cooked just right and after heating is not overcooked or dry whatsoever. Variety in the menus is good.   Modern Proteins has a better choice of options than other services I have had experience with. Their desserts make a great addition to the meals, helping me to stay focused on my fitness goals and avoiding falling off course.   I have eaten a few meals on the go when I had no means to heat and I suggest you cook the meals prior to leaving for the day so that it will be fully cooked, again only necessary if you have no method to heat for lunch.  Having had an opportunity to compare to other meal delivery services. The quality of Modern Proteins meals is above the rest. If you are looking for help in achieving your fitness/health goals don't hesitate to sign up for one of their meal plans."}
{"text":"Awesome food and even better service! Modern Proteins has really saved me a ton of time with my meal prep. I recommend ordering one of each of the meals to test them out and see what you like best. I did that, then ordered weekly service, then upped it to twice a week. No more shopping, cooking, or clean up!  So far they have been very accommodating with requests, and Mina is great about getting back to you with any questions you might have."}
{"text":"The best part of living in Vegas!  I'm never cooking again. I love  the food! I now have more time to work instead of cleaning and cooking to maintain my healthy ways."}
{"text":"I'm going on my 4th delivery and I cannot say enough good things about this service and the food.  As a busy nurse, it's hard for me to find the time and motivation to prep meals and keep it clean.  Modern Proteins takes away all the guesswork.  Personally I get 2 meals out of 1 meal because I try to eat every few hours to keep my metabolism going.  The egg scramble, turkey, ground beef, and ground bison are my favorite.  They have the perfect combinations of protein, carbs, and fat.  They also have the perfect flavor and texture combos that keep me satisfied and full.  The nutella protein brownies are a perfect snack, or a great breakfast on the go that is super quick and easy and very filling.  The delivery drivers are always right on time.  The owner, Adam, gets back to you quickly with any questions.  Overall I am very pleased with these meals and service and plan on continuing it as long as I can!!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this! I am traveling for work and this saves time and money and prevents me from overindulging in restaurant food. I was so impressed with the variety of foods....and grateful too because I am pretty indecisive! I ordered the Modern Proteins Classic Weekly which comes with 14 meals and 7 appetizers/snacks. There's a 20% discount on all meal plans right now (code 20MPOFF) so it came to $206.97 which is $14.78 per meal--I used mine for lunch and dinner. There were 2 of each protein (5 oz lean oven baked): chicken, ground turkey, ground beef, bison, steak, salmon, and tilapia. Green veggies (3 oz) in each included perfectly flash-steamed asparagus, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, squash, etc., and whole carbohydrates (3 oz). I feel so great eating healthy balanced meals! They taste delicious (the one I got included gourmet toppings including things like cherries, cranberries, nuts, pesto). I have already reordered the 21-meal plan for the next 2 weeks of travel and will also be trying the red velvet protein cake, Nutella protein brownie, and banana nut protein bar. AND THEY DELIVER TO HOTELS!!! The entire order came packaged in a box with the individual FRESH meals in microwave and freezer safe plastic containers with labels on exactly what was in each one. It was beautiful and just made my heart happy to see such organization and standardization!! I am staying in a condo with a full kitchen so make sure you have access to a refrigerator (and freezer if you won't be eating within 5 days). So if you want a healthy option that is super convenient and saves time and money this is MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Very happy with Modern Proteins!  I was a little nervous ordering but it came right on time in a well packaged & chilled box. The food is fresh and delicious. This is exactly what I've been looking for in Vegas. It has the right balance of macros for training with enough variety of proteins and sides to not get bored. Plus it's so convenient. Will be ordering more right away!"}
{"text":"Sounds like a good concept, tried ordering online with 4 separate credit cards and their website won't accept.  Sounds like a good concept if they fixed their website!!  Oh well!  BYE!!"}
{"text":"Stumbling upon Modern Proteins was, for me, the answer to all of my problems. I require a high protein diet due to my constant, racing metabolism. I was desperate to find a healthy, long-term solution to my weight gain endeavor and I finally found it!  First things first, their gorgeous, easy navigation website. With tabs like \"What's Inside a Meal?\" and \"Delivery Process,\" I was able to gather all of the information I needed on what expectations to have regarding service as well as any concerns I had in mind about quality of food. And, I will say, I was pleasantly surprised with one piece of information in particular: during high season, I should expect to receive my delivery at least 30-60 early. Wow!!  Without further-a-do, I immediately began to place my order online. The selection was huge, and I was happy to see that the prices were fair. Here's a tip: You can find ALL of their options ranging from individual items to full-out diet plans by simply clicking the \"Click To Order\" tab.  Finally, the best part of all was the delivery. I was greeted on-time by the owner herself at my doorstep and welcomed to Modern Proteins. So sweet! I found Mina to be professional and friendly, and was invited to connect with her via email about further ways to tailor my diet according to my needs. The food was INCREDIBLE!! My body feels good and I feel like I have the right amount energy to carry out my day. I am so excited to receive my next delivery and thank you so much Mina for all your help!"}
{"text":"Modern Proteins is one of the best tasting meal preparation services that I have had. Not only that, but the meals are prepped in conjunction with my needs. I don't have the time to prepare my meals and for them to be able to make what I need and it actually taste good is amazing. I need specific portions of different types of lean proteins, non-starchy & starchy carbs, and fats so not just anybody can prepare my food.   I highly recommend using Mina and her services from Modern Proteins for any of your meal preparation needs. Nothing but good things from this kitchen!"}
{"text":"I am very pleased that I found Modern Proteins. I have bought meal prep from other businesses here in Las Vegas and this is by far the best. I am very busy and don't have a lot of spare time. So, meal prep has allowed me to eat yummy and nutritious Vegetarian food on the go. Thank you Mina for putting love in your meals. I can definitely tell you do."}
{"text":"Very quick to respond and accommodating for my very particular order. I won't have to pack all my meals for my work trip to Vegas and still can stick to my prep for my competition. So amazing! Thanks for all your help."}
{"text":"With a schedule that was prohibitive of consistent meal-planning, I decided to give Modern Proteins a try. The only problem I had with my initial order, was that it was delivered half an hour after my requested delivery window. Not really a big deal, still there with plenty of time for me to get to work.  My most recent order, however, has been a complete nightmare. At 8:15 AM, there was no sign of my delivery, nor was there at 10:15, or at noon. I saw a couple of boxes on my neighbors porch, but I'm not through type and I don't go through other peoples mail. It turns out I should have. Mina finally got back to me, and said that the delivery driver told her that the packages have been delivered. I replied back, that there was nothing on my front porch and that had been home since 6 AM to see nothing delivered eight hours later. She then replied to me and said that her delivery driver returned and confirmed that the boxes were there, this time with a picture. By no coincidence, there was some shuffling outside of my door about five minutes prior but unfortunately I was in the bathroom and couldn't catch the delivery driver in the act. I attempted to call no less than two dozen times, but the number is automated and no one ever actually picks up. So I drove to the address listed on Google and on their website, only to find out that they haven't been there for sometime. Naturally, I have not received a reply by email since I informed Mina of the situation, and I am now left with a weeks worth of spoiled food that is ineligible for return."}
{"text":"MP has been a huge time saver and helped me to focus on eating what is right for me and in the proper portions.   The food is ALWAYS fresh, and it's real food:  Steak, chicken, fish.....real food, and not processed.  It does stay fresh for me in the refrigerator for the whole week.  I would highly recommend MP for anyone who either doesn't have the time and/or energy to devote to thinking about what to eat."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is easy and convenient. This is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I've tried numerous food prep services here in Vegas, as well as frozen food delivery, and ready-to-cook services like HelloFresh. Modern Proteins combines the best features of all of these types of services with competitive pricing, top quality ingredients, time savings, and packages it all together professionally with on-time delivery and good customer service. I'm glad to have finally found what I think is the perfect solution to eating healthy when you are too busy or simply too lazy to shop for and cook your own meals."}
{"text":"Thank you Mina for your service! I started a new corporate position and also work as a freelance dancer/model/actress for multiple talent agencies in town. I've been working 7 days a week for a few months now, and simply don't have time to spare. I'm exhausted! Their website is easy to navigate, and was able to find an option that suited exactly what I was looking for. The meals are well proportioned, well sourced, flavorful, and I was given plenty of options to keep my tastebuds happy! It was the perfect way to get me back on track with my healthy eating habits without having to spare time prepping myself. Mina also delivered my meals right on time to my office without any problems. I will be using Modern Proteins throughout the year when the busy times hit hard."}
{"text":"Customer service is outstanding. As a figure competitor who didn't expect to still be in prep while on vacation in Vegas, a large amount of stress fell upon my shoulders. Modern proteins, however, helped to ease my concerns as communication regarding customized delivery and optimal nutrition options has been outstanding. This is in reference to the timing of my visit as well. So far, my experience with this meal prep service is one I'd recommend to anyone looking to stay on track while in Vegas......  *Update: meals received on time and to my specifications! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and exceptional customer service. This food tastes fantabulous! I have been on the basic plan and I was surprised at how good it tasted. I have already dropped weight and am considering increasing my meal plan. The best part is that it's super convenient. Thanks Modern Proteins!"}
{"text":"Food comes exactly as described -- in convenient microwaveable containers.   Food quality is on point, lean, low sodium, low fat. Convenient clean healthy food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a professional athlete and loves the meal prep from Modern Proteins. His favorite dishes are the salmon and stuffed bell peppers. Everything tastes good and he is very satisfied. The prices are also reasonable. The meal prep saves time from him having to cook for himself everynight and money at be grocery store. It also gives him more choice and variety every day. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Have had a great experience with this meal prep service so far! Customer service is really good and we really have been enjoying the food. It's healthy but still tastes great (the meat is seasoned incredibly well) and they are very affordable compared with the other services. I like their paleo option (which is extremely hard to find) and the meals, although basically being the same, have a lot of little variations so that you don't get bored"}
{"text":"I just recently tried Modern Proteins and the food was absolutely delicious. For being healthy it was definitely made fresh with great quality and flavor. I had the meatloaf with asparagus and brown rice along with the Chocolate Oreo Protein cake. The meatloaf was very flavorful and not dried out and the asparagus were giant size and really tender. The Chocolate cake was amazing for being a protein cake, even my 4 year old enjoyed it. As a working mom it is always hard to prep my meals and Modern proteins provides a service that is not only convenient but also keeps my diet on point. I have tried other meal prep places and have been disappointed by the quality. With Modern Proteins I was impressed with the quality and will definitely be ordering from them again. Thank you for the delicious, healthy meals!"}
{"text":"Extremely well thought out service that exceeded my expectations.  Perfect for the road warrior with an all week conference and they delivered to the Cosmo bell desk on time with ice packs and silverware.  Just needed to request a microwave for my room and I was set. Made for a very cost effective and convenient way to stay on track with my meals.  Each meal was delicious, fresh and well accented with things like blueberries and almond slivers.  I should have asked for some hot sauce condiment packs but I found some at breakfast in the hotel.  Thanks for a great week of meals!"}
{"text":"Happy new customer!  Just ordered yesterday and my week of meals arrived right on time this morning at 8am.  Everything looks amazing and my breakfast (egg scramble, asparagus, walnuts, beans and hummus was excellent.  Looking forward to enjoying the remaining meals this week and beyond."}
{"text":"Food is exactly as described - very tasty, healthy and high protein meals. We tried the service and we are going into the next week. I haven't had a bad meal from the filet to the tilapia. It was delvered as scheduled and all meals were well prepared. I was a little skeptical that the freshness would be preserved after microwaving but the food tastes great and definitely fresh. After a week, I feel like I'm seeing some results."}
{"text":"Subscribed to Modern Proteins three weeks ago - absolutely blown away. The food is phenomenal, the service is excellent, and the deliveries have been on point, thus far. Thank you!"}
