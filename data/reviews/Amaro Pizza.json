{"text":"This pains me to do. I do not usually write bad reviews. If you look at my history, I only decide to write a review when the food wows me or somebody has gone above and beyond service. However, this is the worst food I have ever tasted. It was so bad that I feel the need to warn others.

I first want to say that the people working there seem very nice and they were accommodating when there was a slight mix up with our paypal. That was nice and I thought a great start. The delivery guy was very nice and had a kind smile. I have no issues with anybody at this place as far as service goes. 

Now the bad part. Our wings were horrible! They were very overcooked and came with a side of spicy ketchup. ???? What is that about? Ketchup? Okay, so we were disappointed with that but we had had worse wing before, so we weren't going to judge them by their wings. Other places don't know how to cook wings but the rest of their food is okay. We figured this was the case here. Boy, were we wrong. The wings were actually the best part of the meal, if you can use the word \"best\" there. 

We moved on to our chicken parmesan and in the first bite I tasted nothing but bread and mush. I looked closely at the sandwich and realized that the breading on the chicken was soggy! It was disgusting. The tomato sauce had absolutely no taste to it at all. I didn't even know that was possible. The focaccia bread they use was also somewhat soggy and that did not help things with that sandwich. It was horrible. Neither one of us could finish it. That chicken had to be cooked at least 5 days ago, if not more. 

So we were extremely disappointed so far, but at least we had tiramisu! It's pretty hard to screw up tiramisu, so we thought, that would give us some pleasure for this most disappointing meal. Again, we couldn't be more wrong. It was the worst part of the meal! And let me tell you, that is saying something pretty big. That tiramisu was the absolute worst desert I have ever had in my life. The cream tasted stale and dehydrated, the lady fingers were soggier than our chicken parmesan and there was only a flavor of coffee and nothing else with that horrible soggy texture. It had to be at least two weeks old, if not more. 

Please heed our warning. I don't understand the good reviews unless we are the lucky ones who were chosen out of a hat to be given their most disgusting food of the night and everybody else got good, fresh food. I don't know how that happens but if it happened to us with these guys, then it could happen to you. The food they sent us last night was a nightmare and they really need to reevaluate if they should be in the business."}
{"text":"Placed an order online and it didn't get filled. Called to ask where the pizzas were and eventually convinced them that my credit card had been charged. The food eventually arrived, but the order was wrong. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Great pizza and very friendly staff. I was helping my sister move and looked on yelp for good pizza places. I picked this place and was not disappointed. Two large pizzas and 20 wings for under $40. They have great topping selection, the crust was yummy, and it was not greasy at all. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Reliably good and fantastically priced local pizzeria with great takeout specials (the large with a topping or two is very cheap). They will also deliver to The Only who welcomes outside food. Only downside is you should stick to the popular toppings as some of the more obsure meats I've had were not very fresh. Friendly, hard-working staff."}
{"text":"Wow!  I am impressed.

I had an Amaro pizza pie delivered tonight via http://www.just-eat.ca/
I ordered the Atena pizza (oregano, black olives, red onion, red peppers, garlic, Amaro tomato sauce, mozzarella, tomato).  The toppings were good (I would have liked more garlic and peppers), but it is the crust that makes the Amaro pizza stand out.  If you are a carb lover, particularly a rustic sourdough bread lover - then this pizza crust is for you!  

The crust is not too thick or too thin - it is just right!  It really reminds me of .a rustic loaf of artisanal bread.  It looks almost like a sourdough bread, but doesn't have the sourdough tang.  

I am looking forward to trying a pie in house!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Their pizza is a perfect combination of homestyle and gourmet.  The sauce is rich, crust is perfect and the cheese gooey.  Tons of fresh toppings, and they offer some nice specialty pizzas.  Our favourite is Quattro Stagioni(ham, salami, artichokes, mushrooms).The calzones are incredible however we suggest asking for a side of marinara for dipping, we like ours extra sowsay.  The price is amazing ($7) considering its size. 

Pizza joints' wings usually suck but, surprisingly, their wings are actually really good.  We're not huge fans of breaded wings but theirs are tasty, and their medium sauce is zangy.  We can't  give the place five stars because we have yet to try the whole menu.  But, from what we have eaten everything has been delicious and super well priced!  Plus the staff are good guys."}
{"text":"Yay for local pizzerias and a big NAY to chains like Pizza Pizza and Pizza Hut.  I had read good reviews about this place, and then a Groupon floated on to my radar.  Like Elaine M. I also purchased a $25 voucher for 2 large pizzas, 20 potato wedges and 20 wings.  

I ordered the Pollo Basilico and the Carnivore.  I found the Carnivore to be a bit on the dry side (which is surprising considering the amount of fats that should be pouring out from the ground beef, pepperoni and bacon).  The Pollo Basilico was amazing.  I love the thin crust on both pizzas; they were crispy.

We ordered the BBQ wings - but I think they gave us the wrong kind.  Our wings were just battered and deep-fried with no bbq flavour at all.  I also think they were day-old wings as they were clearly re-fried.  

The potato wedges were quite tasty, and neither wings nor wedges were greasy which is a plus.

I would definitely recommend the 'zas at Amaro's.  

Ordering was fast, delivery was flawless.  I was in and out in mere seconds."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place for a few reasons.

1. Quick delivery time. My pizza arrived in about 40 minutes.
2. Great crust. The dough was fluffy and nice golden brown.
3. Delicious sauce on their Marguerita Pizza.
4. OK price for a large pizza and a pound of wings = $30 with tip.

I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"1. Delivery took an hour and a half
2. Ordered hot wings. Received unsauced wings with a side of ketchup. 
3. The pizza was overcooked and bland. The crust may as well have been cardboard, the sauce tasted like watered down tomato paste, the cheese was burnt... the basil in my salad was not fresh, wings were also overcooked and fried in beer batter. A large pizza, 10 wings, 2 soft drinks and a salad came to $45. NEVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN!

PS John S, the pizza is garbage in Vancouver. I spent 2 years there looking for good pizza and the only decent place is Nat's New York Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Picked up a pizza and wings at Amaro Pizza on the Danforth yesterday.  I placed my order over the phone.  They can work on the phone manners.  They wouldn't substitute artichokes for olives on my pizza.  I never understand businesses like that, especially when olives are cheaper than artichokes.  Pizza looked amazing, gourmet, cheese right to the end of the crust.  Taste was okay, not as good as it looked.  But still a good pizza.  Wings, not good.  Overall I would recommend the pizza."}
