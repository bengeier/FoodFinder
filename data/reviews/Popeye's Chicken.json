{"text":"This Popeye's is located right by my dentist's office (Dr. Stainback - she's awesome, read my review) but I've never been able to go because you can't really eat right after you get your teeth cleaned, now can you? So, each time I would pass by it, arms outstretched, just reaching in longing.    My chance to sink my teeth into some golden, fried, well seasoned chicken that I've been craving for so long finally came a few days ago when I went to see Dr. Stainback for a follow up appointment.  She didn't have to do anything so as soon as I left her office I raced down the street to the Popeye's.  I ordered what I always do when going to Popeye's, the 3 wing combo with lemonade and also decided to give the beignets a try since they were only $1.  The service was quick, good, and friendly but my food was just ok.  My chicken and fries were pretty good but my biscuit was hard and the beignets were even harder which also tasted like they had been fried in chicken grease.  It will probably be a long time before I have Popeye's again because I don't think I'll be coming here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food chicken chain. Finally, those of us in the north side of Charlotte have something to be grateful for: a monopoly on Popeyes chicken! Thank you chicken gods!   I always get the popcorn shrimp with a side of corn on the cob and a biscuit. I usually order a 2-piece (spicy chicken wings) to compliment my meal. Who can choose between fried chicken and popcorn shrimp?  I also like the Cajun fries and the sweet tea. The food is so good here that I could easily eat here every week. But in an effort to protect my arteries, I exercise self restraint.   Regarding this location, I've always received good service. I was fortunate today; I was the only one in line! This is a rare occurrence. Frequently the line is wrapped around the building. But it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This weekend my husband picked up 2 shrimp meals and when he got them home there were 6 pieces of shrimp in each order! 6 PIECES for $6.35??  The drink that came with the meal was not even filled up half way. I took them back and got my $12 and some change back. The assistant manager showed me a small cup they scoop the shrimp out with to measure. I wound up ordering from the Mayflower right beside Popeyes. I got 2 shrimp plates with LOTS of shrimp, baked potato, and hushpuppies for $2.00 more!!  I don't recommend this place to anyone!!! You do not get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We liked this location better than the one inside Concord Mills. The crew here is pretty green, yet try to offer good customer service. A few of  the patrons had some problems with their orders. Which made us think they were rushing so that they started having lots of errors. I rather wait one extra minute to get it right versus 10 to completely remake the order. One our sides was cold which they quickly fixed for us. We appreciated that service.  I understand a rush, but moderate flow should allow for someone to come tidy the dining room-our only peeve. All in all, it was a typical Popeye's which we would return."}
{"text":"I used to be a manager of Popeyes in Maryland in Washington DC. For some reason the chicken at these locations is not up to par with what we served up north. Ways to marinate or chicken for 48 hours before it was served and I'm 100% positive that this is not due to the fact that there is little to no flavor. The staff was very unprofessional as they all sat around giggling and playing on their cell phones ignoring customers. The store was filthy even though it was brand new with every trash cans overflowing and debris floating around the floors. The The store was filthy even though it was brand new with every trash cans overflowing and debris floating around the floors. The bathroom with the smell of feces and urine in the air permeating through the door. This is a model location for what not to do. I'm actually saddened and ashamed. I have to explain that this is not the same store even though it's the same name"}
{"text":"So this Cajun  place is pretty tasty service is good and the place is clean. Associate  are quick to take care of customers serving  crisp moist  spicy (if you like) chicken. Beans  and rice could use  a little  seasoning. DO not take my word.I have never eaten chicken before. HUH?"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Popeye's I've ever been to.  They didn't know their own menu, charged for more than one sauce which I've never had happen before, gave us half the food I normally get, it wasn't cooked well, the drink machine was broken, need I go on?  I had to keep asking them to refill drinks because the machine was broken, fix the order they messed up, and every time they gave me an attitude.  Believe me try another one!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting in line, already paid for my food. Waiting on my tenders (will be ready in 4 minutes) 20 minutes has gone by. Now I'm late for work. Not really sure what's going on here but it needs to change. I love Popeyes."}
