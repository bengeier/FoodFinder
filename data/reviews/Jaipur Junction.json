{"text":"The best Indian food i have ever had! I have eaten indian food many places and jaipur is truly superb. I always make it a point to go there whenever i visit cleveland.  Utterly delicious!"}
{"text":"Taste is okay
Nice place
A little expensive if you order
Cheaper if you go on buffet time"}
{"text":"Dont confuse this place with the one in North Royalton which is excellent.
First sign something was up was when we walked in and man enters restaurant zipping up his fly? Hmm did he wash his hands???!! 
Got there at 5pm they asked us to wait in cold lobby while they swept the floor with stinky vacuum.
Food was terrible we were the only ones in the restaurant. Could not even eat it!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have wanted to try this restaurant for a while, and went to the buffet lunch today. It was disappointing. The selection was small and most of the food was cold and didn't have much flavor.
Perhaps ordering off the menu would have been better, but I'm not sure we will be back to try that, as there are other Indian restaurants we prefer."}
{"text":"God, I wanted to love this place.  We went for the buffet and there were were very fewitems.   Most buffets we go to have a ton of options...  This one was tiny.

I live nearby, wish there was more."}
{"text":"I started coming here on recommendation from a friend who was raised in Queens. He said that this was the best Indian food he has had outside of the city.  I grew up near Ithaca, NY and regularly ate really good Indian food either made by friends or at Diamonds.  Jaipur is my go-to in the Cleveland area.

We've eaten here a few times.  I'm not into buffets but I love the one that Jaipur Junction serves because I get to try everything--a wonderful selection.  The restaurant is clean and service is usually very friendly.  Tonight we got take-out.  Samosas were perfect.  I recommend them.  The garlic naan is fluffy, buttery, and savory. There are no hints of crispy edges anywhere.  Delicious.  Jesse always gets the chicken vindaloo which he talks about for days afterward and I have tried a variety of their veggie dishes.  Everything has been excellent.

My single qualm--I wish they had more veggie options, fewer with potatoes and cashews.  I used to get this spicey mushroom dish and a bunch of sweet potato or garbanzo bean ones in NY that I totally miss here.  They have a lot of meat options but I find the veggie ones to be a little bit lacking.

So good. We love eating here."}
{"text":"We stopped into Jaipur about two weeks ago for dinner on a Saturday night.  The first thing I noticed was how friendly the staff was.  The menu was very impressive, so much to choose from!  I don't like pop and get tired of drinking water all the time in restaurants because the drink choices are so limited to either Pepsi or Coke products.  That is not the case here, they had many different drink (non alcoholic) selections.  The food we ordered was served hot and delicious.  You can choose how spicy you'd like it so, both my fiance and myself were very impressed.  I have to admit, we have not stopped talking about Jaipur's since we've eaten there so, it's only a matter of time before we stop back.  Also, I have to mention that they play traditional Indian music which really added to the already great atmosphere.  Great restaurant, fantastic food, give it a try!"}
{"text":"We've been back lots of times over the past year. The owner has corrected all of his logistical issues and the service, speed and food are wonderful. So happy they turned it around. We love this place."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I ever been in my life, I went there in 2012 the owner is a miser even for a paper plate, at that time the place was like a devil house and owner used to charge money even for extra paper plate. I asked him for an extra paper plate and that owner told me that I need to pay a dollar for that. The food was worst and it smelled like hell. See how crazy he was and later I went last month and I thought he changed but he didn't actually I ordered chat and asked him to make it hot, he replied me back that they won't make the items hot. Man I been in almost 7 countries and went many restaurants all over the world but I never had the worst food and worst hospitality to a customer like this, please friends better avoid to go there."}
{"text":"Went to this place after visiting the nearby temple and was not disappointed. The weekend buffet was well organized with a small assorted food menu.  The roti was soft and the curries  were medium spicy, just the way i like them..Ambience was just average and the only issue i could really find was that the tea(chai) was not upto the mark, and the samosa was just ok, but for a 10 bucks buffet, u cudnt ask for more. All in all would rate it 3.5 to 4.0 on 5 depending on your hunger quotient ;)"}
{"text":"Simple ambience but great food! We had dinner and ordered  Papri Chat, tomato soup, Paneer Tikka Masala, Mutter Paneer, Naan and everything was super awesome! Exceeded our expectations. Our dal and vegetable entrees came with complementary Naan! Spice level was good. Quantity is on the lesser side but it's not an expensive place so no complaints there. Taste was easily one of the best I've have had!"}
{"text":"Very delicious with dishes that are not typical. Lights are obnoxiously bright, though."}
{"text":"Stay away from this restaurant. They use too much food color in their curries. Food coloring is carcinogenic. Save your health......."}
{"text":"Very solid Indian food this is  the second best Indian food in NE Ohio you should check out the best Cleveland Tiffin"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed. I love this place. So many vegetarian options. The portions are pretty big, and if I wasn't such a glutton for this place it probably would last me two meals. The naan is sensational- we particularly like the garlic naan.  Don't pass up the samosas so delicious!  

This place is also a great takeout option."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and we were craving for some good Indian food. To our delight we found this gem on Yelp! 

Had to do a review to also make sure I remember this for the next time in town. Some of the most authentic, delicious dishes we've ever had! Coming from Chicago, who would've thought we would find even better Indian food in OH!??

I had a samosa, chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, and mango lassi for my drink. All of it ... amazing! To top it off, the owner (I think) brought us a complimentary dessert, gulab jamun."}
{"text":"one of my fav Indian places in Cleveland area :)"}
{"text":"JJ was excellent at the other location at the other end of the strip and is even better at the new restaurant a few stores up.. The rice is amazing simply on its own- just build on it- a favorite for many years of my family. The soup is amazing - best Indian cuisine around- very friendly, helpful staff. If you want spicy- just ask- they will make the food as spicy as you want it. A must go!!!!"}
{"text":"Every meal I have had here has been wonderful. If my Mom was Indian, she would cook like this! You can just tell the food is prepared with care, cooked with skill and made from well selected fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I love this place. If only we made it out this way more often. The naan is sensational, the lamb saag was some of the best we've had.  Also tried the chicken vindaloo which was a hit, even with our six-year-old son.  My only complaint is that I felt like the service was a little inattentive. Still, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I don't understand the wealth of positive reviews of this restaurant. I'm assuming these customers order carry out. 

I stopped here when I was passing through the area and had a craving for Indian food at lunch time. The food here is very authentic. But unless you're in a city like New York, LA or Chicago, you can expect most Indian restaurants to be pretty authentic. I had the lunch buffet, which consisted of three curries, tandoori chicken, naan, rice, raita and samosas. The samosas were great and the chutneys served with them were fresh. Everything else was just OK. The vegetables were mostly potatoes and there were no greens.

So, the food was passable (I don't care if it's \"authentic\" ... it has to have green vegetables!) but not a deal breaker for a lunch buffet.

The downside is that this restaurant is a little more than dingy. There were flies near the buffet and instead of plates and silverware, there are styrofoam lunch trays and plastic forks and spoons. I actually expected to see sporks! 

I'm sorry, I don't care how \"authentic\" the food is. Styrofoam is simply a turn off for me."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Indian food int he Cleveland area. I am brown, and I am picky... so that says a lot. It's not much for ambiance, but the food can't be beat. I used to use this place to cater my events back in college and I used to go here back when it was not much more than a dive joint... well, it's still kind of a dive joint, but now they have sit down service, so I guess that's an improvement :) 

Some of my favorite menu items are the papdi chat, tandoori chicken tikka, mastani palak, mutter paneer, chicken vindaloo... eat it with a side of soft, buttery naan or fragrant saffron rice, and finish off with some masala chai. Go home happy :)"}
{"text":"We just had the most unusual dining experience I've had in a very long time at Jaipur Junction. We arrived towards the end of lunch and didn't want the buffet, we wanted to order off the menu. As other reviewers have written, the initial experience of the waitstaff was distracted/indifferent. She took a long time to get to the table. When she did, it was a bizarre, disjointed conversation about ordering our food and how. She poured tepid tap water (no ice) into our glasses and prepared to walk away. 

After too long she came back to take our orders. We asked for a variety of dishes including spice levels. At this point we couldn't help but notice she was in the weeds, as other diners had empty water glasses and were looking for her to come close checks, clear tables, etc. She was also very confused when a to-go order came in tor pick up. It took about 10 minutes at the register for her to get him paid out, while everyone else in the restaurant sat, waited and watched. Several times I could hear her talking, thinking she was on the phone...well, she wasn't (more later). The owner did come out of the kitchen, kept asking her if she needed help (loudly - AWKWARD!) and still nothing seemed to help. 

Finally the manager came over to ask us what we had ordered. We told him and he walked away mumbling. He came out immediately with garlic naan and our tomato soup. The Naan was good but the chopped garlic was raw and overwhelming. The soup was delicious with just the right amount of coconut milk. Our meals followed, which were rather hit and miss. My dish was very good while my fiancee's dish was 'meh'.

As we ate, the other patrons were finally addressed and filtered out. I did notice that one person who came in apparently didn't see any service during the aforementioned fiasco and he walked out. It was when we were the only ones in the restaurant where things got really weird. The server, who we had noted to be a little out of it (honestly, I thought maybe she was just stoned or something), kind of started yelling at herself. I had first thought that she had a bluetooth headpiece in, but no. She was having a full on argument with herself, including f-bombs and ranting, walking in an odd, herky-jerky manner in the restaurant. We finished packing up our leftovers and scooted out the door.

I am very sensitive to those who suffer from mental illness and do hope that, whatever she was going through, she gets the help she needs. Its just hard to deal with that when you just wanted to drop in for a quick lunch.

Bottom line: the food is actually pretty good, but the management needs to understand you can't come out and yell at employees in front of your customers AND your front-of-the-house staff really shouldn't fight and curse...especially with themselves. Until they figure this out, I would order take-out and pay cash when you do.

Oh, and put some damned ice cubes in the water pitcher/glasses."}
{"text":"Went to Jaipur Junction for dinner tonight and as usual was not disappointed. For the most part, I consider this a takeout restaurant as the service can sometimes be slow, but tonight we ate in and dinner moved very quickly. (There is a buffet option during special hours, but I've never eaten at that.) For dinner tonight, as I have a gluten allergy, I didn't partake in the samosa appetizer, but my family loved them. They were freshly fried, warm, and crispy. I sometimes get the tasty tomato ginger soup as a starter, but decided to skip tonight. Our main dishes consisted of the alu gobi, chicken saag, novratan korma, and chicken tikka masala. Sides of saffron rice and naan come with every main dish (plain naan comes with your dinner, but if you want the special flavored naan, you have to order them). Apart from the naan which I couldn't eat, everything tasted amazing. I choose the medium spice level, but you can customize your dish from mild to spicy (and extra spicy if you ask). Really you can't go wrong with whatever dish you choose. If you need to cool down, try a mango lassi. If you want a dessert that not overly sweet, give the carrot halwah a try, really, it's excellent. If you don't feel like eating in, don't worry, they have carry-out. Either way, this Indian food deserves a try."}
{"text":"One of best Indian restaurant in Cleveland. Must try.
Clean and calm place to eat food.
Samosas, Spinach Chickpea and chicken tangdi ... Yemmy ..."}
{"text":"Drove 20 mins to get it and it was definitely worth it. Finally found a good authentic Indian place we can keep going back to. The chicken and lamb vindaloo were good but their garlic naan was fantastic. We should have ordered more."}
{"text":"I would not come back for the buffet lunch. The last time we came was excellent but this time the lunch buffet was only mediocre and limited."}
{"text":"I have dined in and ordered take out from here multiple times.  The food is ALWAYS delicious and the service is always helpful and friendly.  When dining in, the food is served in styroform, but honestly the food is so good it doesn't matter.  A few times I've called to order take out and they haven't been open (around 3 pm), but I've just waited and called back around 5 pm and they've been open.  The menu is also very vegetarian friendly.  I love baingan bharta with a side of saffron rice pilaf.  The naan it comes with is incredible too, very fresh."}
{"text":"Chana saag is good and Kashmiri naan is a must have, do yourself and favor and order Kashmiri naan. The buffet is small, but well stocked. I have been here more than 3 times. The atmosphere and service is good, but could use an extra touch to excel."}
{"text":"Always have a great meal! We order take out here at least once a week and I think it is the best indian food in the area. Portion sizes are a little inconsistent and atmosphere for dining in is not great but the food is top notch! Veggie tandoori and chicken tiki masala are our favorites!"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and were looking for Indian food. This place offers great food for an affordable price. The big complaint is due to the fact that they serve everything in disposable plastic wear, i.e., not very eco-friendly!"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of the best, if not the best Indian food places I have ever been, and I've been to multiple places around the world.  The selection is decent, but the favors are amazing. Try the Kakori kabobs!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here 4-5 times, both buffet and from the menu.  Food and service have been outstanding.  I like my food spicy, my wife prefers mild -- no problem with that here.  And the portions are sufficient that i'll have 1 or 2 lunches from leftovers.  Compared to many other Indian restaurants that we've visited, prices are about average.  And they now have additional space, for overflow or large parties.   Will definitely be recommending this place to anyone interested in good food."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a good Indian buffet lunch. The butter naan with chicken tikka masala was delicious.The food was not spicy. I liked it ."}
{"text":"Indian food is my favorite and Jaipur Junction is one of the best around. Can't go wrong with this one. Papdi chat and samosa chat are amazing and almost everything is fresh and full of spices."}
{"text":"I used to visit this place a lot a few years ago not necessarily by choice (this was the only game in town). The decor grew old on me and the quality of food nose-dived. 

After a few years away, I ended up in JJ last weekend. To my surprise, the decor and layout has improved (no more direct view of the Restroom from the Dining Room and no more graffiti wall). The guy at the register greeted me with a broad, toothy smile that warmed my heart. I soon forgot about the stinky trash bins right up at the entrance. 

The buffet spread was limited but visually very appealing. The Naans were soft and steaming and Daal just right on the spice scale. The sauce in Mutter Paneer could have been a touch more creamier. The Kheer was exquisite.

Stepping in the right direction. But still some ways to go."}
{"text":"Terrific take out.  Reasonable prices.  Our favorite Indian food in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Had an expensive and mediocre take out lunch.  Chicken vindaloo was okay, biryani better, but chicken was dry in both.  Naan so so tasty. Mango lassi was undrinkable with bits of crusty dry yogurt.  Unlikely to return.  A shame, because this is the only Indian spot in our area."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after reading reviews here and elsewhere about it, so I took my friend for her birthday. The decor is nothing fancy but it looked clean and was decent enough. We ordered chicken tikka masala and palak paneer spice level hot. The food was very good and the spice level was perfect. The rice they served did not have the aromatic smell that basmati usually has and the portion was small. The naan was good, typical stuff. They had absolutely no air circulating in the place and it was hot inside. I know I had swamp ass about 10 minutes in. No fans, not ceiling fans, nothing. A little air would've gone a long way towards our comfort, but it didn't ruin our experience. 

Here's where things got weird... On our way out, we saw a man and a little boy get out of a minivan and open up the trunk. On the floor of the car was a large aluminum foil pan, with foil over the top. He went into the restaurant with it and appeared to be heading for the kitchen, though I can't say for sure. I'm sure there is a health department violation somewhere in this story. 

For my money, I will stick to Saffron Patch in the Valley or Bombay Sitar in Canton if I want really good stuff."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices and friendly service. Overall i would say this us a solid choice if you want Indian food."}
{"text":"We've always had the best service ever here.. and the food is amazing! It blew all the other Indian places out of the water. You get a lot of food for the price. I cannot say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"I love Jaipur Junction. I dream about the chicken makhani, and my one-year-old son cannot get enough of it. The naan is also so tasty! I got the sampler, and I was so sad when it was all gone. Will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! I've been eating here for the past 10 years and it never gets old. I love spicy food and these guys now how to make it when I tell them \"make it EXTRA SPICY.\" The prices are fair and for $15 you can get naan, an entrée, and rice. This combo usually is enough for dinner and lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"We saw 4/5 reviews and decided to go to this place on our way to Sandusky. The place started to get on my nerves right off the bat. We entered the restaurant and no one came to assign us a table. The closing time was one hour away but some of the food items from buffet were already empty and they never refilled them. Buffet items were fewer compared to other Indian restaurants and none tasted good. Okra was not even properly cooked. Plates were not refilled for a long time and had to ask for water. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch destinations.   I love the lunch buffet.  It's always different and a good selection.  Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Heavenly! The lamb with spinach spiced just right. Friendly, fast service!! Highly recommend. We'll be back. Shrimp and scallops incredible."}
{"text":"Absolutely a terrific value and quality food. Their buffet is the best deal. Don't expect to be served, just walk in, grab a plate and enjoy the food. Damn, if the place gets packed now I can only blame myself;-)"}
{"text":"Got there a few minutes before 11:30 and they were just putting out food for the buffet.  They greeted us warmly and told us to sit anywhere.  Food is spicy and so good.  The naan was the freshest I've had, warm and soft....so good! The spinach and chick pea is my favorite."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites for takeout or lunch buffet.   Maybe it is because it is different in Hudson but I love the food.  Weekend lunch buffets are great and very diverse.  For takeout, butter chicken and naan... you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I first found out about this place when my job ordered a few items from them for a holiday party. I was impressed with the food and decided to try them out. I had some time to kill so I decided to order at the restaurant. I didn't know what exactly my job ordered so I described it to the worker and he was able to pin point exactly what it was and was so patient and kind to me. While I waited for my food, the gentleman gave me a smoothie and appetizer free of charge and was very tentative even though I was ordering to go. Every time I order to go he gives me a free snack for the road. My favorite dish of theirs is the chicken makhani with rice and it is so amazing. Amazing food and customer service!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD!
Best Indian food I've had in Ohio. The Palak paneer and garlic nan are amazing. And try the raita (sauce) on the side."}
{"text":"The food is great and the prices are good. I've driven 35 minutes several times to dine there. Do not go there for atmosphere. Also, unfortunately the person who seats you is also the person who takes your order and brings you your food. He doesn't bother to check in with you once your food arrives and acts annoyed when you try to flag him down for more food or a check. We were actually intimidated to ask for more napkins and order more naan. I'm willing to put up with that from time to time for the food but would go there more often if the service was better and at least a LITTLE friendly."}
{"text":"You know this place is legit if the restaurant is full of Indian people. They have authentic Indian food with a nice kick to it. Great portions, good atmosphere. There was a really nice Indian women that was dining next to us that told us what we should try. Very casual place, but worth a stop if you love Indian food. The staff is very accommodating and friendly. The restaurant is very low key, everything is served on plasticware. Overall I give it an  A."}
{"text":"Decor is dated, but the food is fantastic. My favorite is the chicken masala and the samosas. They have many vegetarian dishes as well."}
{"text":"Indian food doesn't get better than this, but i do wish they would get some real dishes instead of the disposables.   But I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant. I've been to a lot of Indian restaurants in the Akron-Cleveland area and this one is by far the best. The Chicken Tikka is one of my favorite dishes. If you can handle spicy foods, I  recommend getting level 2...delicious!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  After eating Indian across the country (literally drove from Cleveland to Los Angeles) I can safely say the five stars is warranted as described \"..as good as it gets\"!
This place consistently rocks the Indian grub! Ive been here three or four times over the course of a couple years and I have yet to have a bad experience with the food. In fact I find it hard to order because I KNOW it will all be good. You can tell everything is made in house including the samosas and the bread, a big plus for me. I wont go back to a restaurant that I feel like the food is \"off the shelf\".  Furthermore, its QUALITY eats. The flavors are rich and balanced. The portions are adequate, which is another nod to the quality.  I hate when restaurants load you up with a ton of food to hide sub par quality. I have never been unsatisfied with a meal here.  The rating is a solid four star, as I said the food is excellent, because the atmosphere is lacking, entirely. Don't get me wrong, I go to a restaurant for the food. I don't expect impeccable service or fancy appointments to enjoy a meal. This location has paint on the walls, that's it, no music, nothing. I will say this though, they recently moved into this spot (a year ago).  The old location (same shopping strip different space) had a mural on the wall.  Perhaps they have similar plans for the new space. 

To sum it up: Get there, immediately, with an empty stomach and a bunch of friends!"}
{"text":"We got takeout from here last week.  The food we had was good, although there was some confusion as to whether we got the food that we ordered.  I did not personally do the ordering or the picking up, so I can't speak to that process, but I would definitely get food from here again."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service. 
Often we have tried their buffet or gotten food to take home. 
The quality of food over the years has never changed. Always amazing Indian food. 
Try their palak paneer ( spinach dip with paneer an indian cheese served with naan bread ) or their lamb curry or their samosas and mango lassi drink. 
This place is great for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover type place.... I have been searching for anything better than mediocre Indian food since I moved up from Columbus, and defiantly found some. This aptly described \"hole in the wall\" is pretty accurate when it comes to the dining area, but the food is really good, and the people there seemed very friendly. 
I like the heat scale, and as I am not a mild fellow, I only payed attention to the hot and Indian hot levels, but there are others, I assure you. I got a samosa, which I read on yelp were very good, and big, I totally agree, thanks Gen! On Indian food, I really like the left overs as much as the meal, so ordered two entrees. I got their chicken curry which was downright amazing, and the Chile Paneer (Indian hot). The paneer tasted a little off to me, but as I am no connoisseur, it might have been great, just the texture seemed off compared to what I've had in the past.  The rice that comes with was very good as well, and can't be overlooked, as it is a big part of the meal.  I didn't they their naan this time just because I was trying to sample a lot of other stuff.
It was on par for pricing of Indian food goes.  It wasn't the cheapest I've ever had, but I actually will go back because it was so good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the buffet was perfect with a little bit of everything. The owner is also the chef and all the staff is super friendly. I will revisit many more times."}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to eat. My favorite Indian place. Everything is always hot when ordered. The rice is seasoned perfectly. The bread is amazing. The curry is spicy but you can still taste everything. I go here once a month. Please eat here. Please do yourself a favor. I get the tikka, and the lamb curry. Also the dish with cauliflower I forget the name is delicious."}
{"text":"Jaipur junction is one of those small but authentic Indian restaurants that might not be the best taste if you are looking for something that is modified for american palate. The food here is awesome because it is prepared in traditional Indian style. The amount of spices is adequate and mostly faithful to the regional cuisine. I ordered the thali, which was very filling. 
Most of the menu items are a little expensive for Indian restaurants and also because the interior of this place is not so good. I think this place needs some help in terms of interior and service. It is my personal bias against most Indian restaurants that they try to save money on these things. May be they don't care but many people do. I will like to see the same quality of food in a nicer place to sit and enjoy with a server who knows  English and communicate well with the customers. 
Location is nice and there is plenty of parking around this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite casual Indian restaurant to partake during the lunch hour.

Set in a strip mall in North Royalton (where they recently moved several storefronts down), this is a simple buffet-style place with fresh dishes and wonderful tastes. The curry dishes are amazing as well as the Tandori chicken.  Their Naan is spongy and perfect for mopping up all the sauces on your plate. The Samoas are wonderful, especially mixed with the two side sauces they offer.

Never had a bad meal at this restaurant...which is why we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This was a nice trip. I would say that the food lacked flavor which is something I cannot say that I run into often, maybe due to the Parma people and their lack of cultured taste or personal preference of the restaurant but it was not as flavorful as other places within the surrounding area. I went for the lunch buffet with some people and the issue is that I have to be 'that guy' and ask about nuts in the food but as destiny as it, I am allergic. Not severe but it will ruin my sunshine. We sat and waited, and waited, and waited, until we said F it and just went up. This did not help me however, as I still have to inquire about which foods contains nuts. Finally someone appeared and I asked and they told me that non of the food contains nuts. Hooray. So then I got my selection which was the A-typical lunch buffet items. Chicken Tikka Marsala, a Goat Curry, salad, rice, samosa (veg), Naan, and a few vegetarian items. The taste was not there, it had a mild spice but lacked favor that you can find elsewhere. That was a shocker. The items seemed to taste fine and where heavy so either cream/ghee heavy or it was baking soda to fill you up. Overall, this is right around the corner from where I live so I am bound to return at some point however I am not running here. the crowds were impressive though, it was busy on a rainy Saturday afternoon. I did not use the lavatory and I cannot even say if I saw one for sure. Overall, not a bad gig but there are better to be had."}
{"text":"We have had carry out from this place, and it was delicious. However, the quality is inconsistent. Once, we had the best aloo gobi ever, the next time it was not so good. We tried to go today for the lunch buffet, and the place was packed. Because they do not have a sign that says \"Please wait to be seated,\" there was a problem with people walking in and taking open tables, jumping the line, and the fellows who run the place were too busy in the back to know what was going on up front. If you can't afford a sign, write it on a piece of paper and paste it on the door. \"Please wait to be seated.\""}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet. What I had was good, except the samosas were very bland.  The tandoori chicken (legs or wings), chicken curry, palak paneer, carrot halwa and kheer were all great.  Its a very tiny place, no decorations anywhere.  Basically its  a hole in the wall.  
When we entered, they just said sit anywhere, there are about five booths on both sides with two sets of tables to set 8 people down the middle. They didn't even hand out menus, just said go ahead to the buffet. The buffet in the back has about 14 items.  Only two things were labled so I didn't try most of what was there.  Everyone in my party was happy with the food, only we all ate the same stuff.  
I'll diffenatly be back. 
When we left, all the booths were taken and the place was half full when we got there.  It seems like a popular place."}
{"text":"Okay I must say that I'm biased when I make reviews because they're usually places I like enough to review or absolutely terrible that I can't stand the service or something about the operation...

If you like Indian I mean if you love Indian this is the best place to go in northeastern Ohio near Akron to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great food at the lunch buffet and wonderful service too. Partial because when I went in with blue hair the owner called me a flower ;) however they have good naan and quick service. Always a nice meal"}
{"text":"First off, Indian food is my favorite food in the world--when it's good. And I've eaten loads of poor-to-average Indian, from Cleveland to Prague to India. The good stuff can be challenging to find, but is always worth it. Got that craving for Indian last night, so we decided to try somewhere new. We missed it the first time, tucked away as it is in a strip mall behind some other buildings, and once we entered, we were a bit shocked--it was small, kinda dumpy and way more casual than we expected (yes, plastic ware and styrofoam.) The menu had many of the usual choices, along with a lot of snack-type items that don't usually make it onto U.S. menus. We ordered onion kulcha, makhani chicken and saag chicken for the two of us to split and hoped for the best. And the best was what we got--all three dishes were wonderful. The kulcha was light and fluffy and delicious; easily the best we've ever had. Both of the entrees were wonderful, with a great balance to the flavors and subtlety to the seasonings. Both also came out moderately spicy, just as we'd ordered. Even the ample orders of rice that came with the entrees were great. We left feeling totally satisfied and this dinner set us back a whopping $28. Yes, a more pleasing atmosphere would have been nice, but you can't eat atmosphere; ditto for the serving ware. There are enough white table cloth Indian restaurants in the area that charge $4-7 more per entree; sometimes you just want really good, cheap Indian food and this place is perfect for that."}
{"text":"The food was incredible! I never thought I could find good Indian food in northeast Ohio! The service was so great. They were very sincere and gave us free rice pudding at the end of our meal!"}
{"text":"Great place!!  So friendly and always able to meet our group needs. Food is always authentic and super delicious. We go often!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on 7/27 for dinner and had a great time.  The owner's daughter was our waitress and she was great.  The food was described in detail with recommendations.  
This place has been open only a few months, the earlier reviews described timing problems in the kitchen.  These must have been fixed, as our food was prompt for both the appetizer and the entrees and looked great!  
The taste was to match, easily the best masala I have had in the area.  My wife was debating just drinking the Korma sauce it was so good.


Updated: April 2014
I have been picking up takeout about once a month for a while now.  It used to be more frequent.

About half the time the order is wrong, but the food is more often flat than flavorful.  When it is good, it is awesome!  But that is too rare.  Will give the one in the valley my business for a while."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. We have eaten at their restaurant  for a quick meal, we have had a group of friends there for an impromptu dinner party and catered our home party from them. The food is consistently excellent, our friends enjoy the variety and trying something new. Ownership is friendly and customer service outstanding. 

Their restaurant is BYOB. Perfect! You can bring good bottles of wine without the typical restaurant mark-up. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pros: $ 9 for buffet
Cons: After reading the rave reviews, I finally wanted to give it a try. We drove for half an hour for the buffet. It is a small place, inexpensive, but there was not much of variety. Some of the dishes were good, but the whole idea of buffet is to taste more variety.

But, if you are living nearer to this restaurant it could be a good option. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place, even though you will be paying only $9 for buffet."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Cleveland.  I hadn't been there in 8 years because I live 40 mins away but after feasting last night (and today on leftovers), I can't believe I lived without it that long.  I arrived at 5:30 on a Friday and they must have done $250 worth of take-out for 10 different people (of all backgrounds) while I was having my incredible dinner.  The food is so fresh, and packed with flavor. I had mango lassi (milkshake), papadum, picnic balls (don't even like potatoes that much but these light, fried, scrumptious tennis ball sized delights are so good served with tamarind sauce and green chutney), malabar shrimp (rich, sweet, spicy, almost fruity... dear god), and paneer tikka masala.  Yes, I ordered that much and took home enough for two more meals.  The two previous times I've been here I took friends and they ordered \"2nd meals\" to take home... how could they not?  When I there years ago, they were much more casual... ordered at a counter, etc.  Still in a very un-fancy strip mall but a little more formal inside.  Having said that, not much focus on surroundings and I love it because the food is what it is all about!"}
{"text":"This place serves amazing, authentic food.  I had the lamb roganjosh, which is my favorite dish here. The sampler platter is always really fun as well, and my husband mentioned the lamb biriyani is very tasty.  You can never go wrong with their naan, green sauce and samosas either. You can tell the owner and staff take pride in the food they serve and the service is excellent.  Great (northern) Indian cuisine in Ohio."}
{"text":"JAIPUR JUNCTION ZINDABAD!!!!   I am very happy with the service and the food has been great for the 27 years that I have been on this earth.  Let's all say this together ....JAIPUR JUNCTION ZINDABAD!!!"}
{"text":"Yay!  Another amazing Hudson restaurant!  I'm only sad that it took us this long to discover it having lived here for almost three years.  We brought our skeptical kids who left just as excited about the food as we were.  We order several things and shared between the five of us.  We left stuffed!  The wait staff was very friendly although we felt like they were all a bit awkward in serving almost like they much preferred doing take out orders than having to play restaurant.  But it kinda added to the charm of the place.  The food was amazing.  Full of flavors.  Everything different.  Our dinner conversation with the kids was voting on our favorite dish.  Every one picked something different, but we all had a hard time picking.  We will definitely be coming here again and voting take out."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my wife and nephew.  They have been open for 4 years and this was the first time we've been here.  We love authentic Indian food and wish we would have found this place years ago.  The place is awesome.  Staff and owner treated us like family.  I can't write enough nice things to say about them and oh by the way, the food is fabulous.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great Indian food.  The owner came to our table and explained in detail the dishes we asked about.  He personally made our appetizer and desert.  They don't serve beer or wine but who cares when the food is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better Indian restaurants in Cleveland.  This is where I frequented when I first moved here.  It's a great go-to when you're out.  You'll always find tasty naan and well made food."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this place. Tried the lunch buffet. It was HORRIBLE. The food was lacking in flavor and texture. In other words it was tasteless over cooked mush. Not real authentic Indian food. It was just an Indian version of a cheap all you can eat American food buffet (but with very few food choices). It was not worth the $9.99. Would not expect anything better if ordering off the menu...same cook, same cheap/low quality food. The service was terrible too. All around a very disappointing dining experience. Would never go back. Go the extra few miles to Strongsville and eat at The Crown of India...the BEST Indian food and service in Cleveland!! Seriously go NOW you won't be disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. We regularly pick up samosa chat and papdi chat. We like the weekend lunch buffet too. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good Indian food for reasonable price."}
{"text":"Spicy and super flavorful. Great nan, too. This was my mom's first Indian food experience and it was a success! We will be back..."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS.  The freshness of the ingredients is apparent in the color, smell and flavor of the food;  bright and tantalizing.  Surprisingly, it isn't advertised, but after a little prodding I found it to be true, everything is made from scratch down to the home spun ice cream!!  Coming from San Francisco, I would say it's better than any Indian food I've found there in the last eight years...Definitely take advantage of this place, Ohio!"}
{"text":"True story: I ordered the daily special, which was to be Tandoori Red Snapper, and received something that I think was Swordfish. Not kidding. Even worse, the waitress made a point to tell me it was fresh--yeah right. It was definitely over cooked, frozen fish. Then again, we couldn't decide if she was high or just a new, nervous waitress. The only redeeming factor was that the seasoning on the fish and veggies was so good that I kept eating it. The chicken and curry entree my companion ordered was absolutely delicious, so I might consider returning when the fish fiasco is a distant memory."}
{"text":"I remember going to this restaurant years ago. I remember it being very good. I will make a recommendation based on memory of quality and the intelligence of the individual who thought it would be a solid place to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Food quality, price, location, service and atmosphere all award this authentic Indian restaurant a 5 star rating. I went their for dinner on v day and really look forward to hitting up the lunch buffet one of these days! So glad the up and coming Hudson food scene just got another gem!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Jaipur junction multiple times, their Monday thru Sunday lunch buffet is superb,lots of variety,for very cheap price,fine Indian cuisine at it's best!!! Decor is acceptable, very clean restaurant, knowledgeable and patience servers.Check out this little Jewel in the heart of Hudson!!!"}
{"text":"I did a takeout from this place and ordered the chicken saagh (rice included) and onion kulcha via the phone.  The order was ready when I arrived.
The chicken was moist and the dish wasn't spicy per my request.  The entree was delicious.  The onion kulcha was very salty (I think they accidentally put the salt twice) but the chicken was fantastic.  I'd have given them a four-star for a quick service and food taste.  But due to the onion kulcha being very salty I'm dropping a star."}
{"text":"With decor that befits South Asian Fast food hole in the wall, Jaipur Junction delivers exactly what you expect... punchy flavours in copious quantities at reasonable prices, but without ingratiating service, or really delicate flavours.

It's exactly what you'd expect.

Yesterday, I had 3 curries, all of which were warm, but not *hot* in terms of spice.  They were creamy -- and a tiny bit heavy for my tastes, but very edible.  The menu is a mix of northern and southern indian, and is in larger portions than I've had around CLE.  You can get idli, dosa, roti, and paratha here... as well as many other fan favourites (yes, from many regions; thanks Vasanth!)

Given that I live right next to Saffron Patch (Will review tomorrow!), I think I'd rather go there, despite being a tad more expensive.  Yet, if one is in Parma, this is definitely a good place to go.

Heavy handed, but quality.

Got it?"}
{"text":"Visited with my niece & her fiancé & his family who are Indian.  I enjoy Indian food but don't eat it enough to know exactly what's what.  Jaipur Junction is a small mom/pop place that presents very clean & has nice traditional art on walls.  You can order off the menu but on weekends they have a buffet & that's what we chose.  It's not a large buffet so hence its very reasonable $8.95 price - 2 appetizers, 3 vegetables, 2 entrées & 2 desserts & of course rice & naan.  Really enjoyed the cold chickpea appetizer, the vegetables with cauliflower & yummy the carrot pudding. The 2 entrees chickens were ok...the curry had a good flavor but the meat was dry.  They were attentive to refilling water which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Seven years later, this place is still serving up some of the best Indian food I've had.  Just stopped in again on a weekend stay in Cleveland.  Chicken tikka and the lamb curry were still awesome.  The lamb kabobs were excellent.  And, I always love their samosas!"}
{"text":"I have several friends from Northern India, and they all rave about this location and the one in North Royalton. Dropped in today to grab some takeout for lunch.  The gentleman who took my order was very polite and courteous.  I ordered the veggie Samosas, plain Naan, and the Chicken Makhani (comes with some basmati rice).  It was all fresh, hot, and amazing.  It was a little on the expensive side, but well worth it.  The naan was perfect, soft, and crispy on one side.  It didn't even make it home...  The samosas were perfect.  They came with 2 sauces, a sweet tamarind type sauce and a cilantro sauce.  Both were very good.  The Chicken Makhani was awesome and creamy.  You can select your spicy level from Mild to Extra Hot.  I opted for the Medium, scared they were using a more Indian palate to gauge the spiciness. I would have put it more of a mild.  Next time, I will attempt the Hot.  I look forward to going back real soon!"}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet is $8.95 Monday to Friday. Buffet options are limited but everything is delicious. Two kinds of chicken (tandoori chicken + chicken curry) and several vegetarian dishes. The bread (naan) is delicious: perfect with all the sauces + stews. There is plain basmati rice. For dessert, usually fresh melon pieces. 


The decor is very plain. The service is friendly but sometimes slow (it's usually just one person for all the tables + manning the register)"}
{"text":"Went with my brother for the buffet. There was maybe nine entree dishes, all of which were delicious. The pickled vegetables were worth it alone! Good desert and tea, also."}
{"text":"Five stars simply for the deliciousness & quality of this Indian food. It tastes amazing and well worth the price. Have never dined in, but they are always timely with our order and have never forgotten anything. My boyfriend and I like to order take out from here about twice a month and there is usually plenty for left overs! Yum!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and had a curry craving so asked Yelp to help and found this delightful place! I just called and placed an order and picked up 15 minutes later to take away. The place was empty (but  who goes out on Mondays anyway...), but decor looked nice. The host was quite friendly. I also noticed they serve halal poultry as well! I would definitely recommend for out of towners! Too bad I don't live here to continue enjoying the place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Been here twice and the quality is consistent. Loved the chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, and lamb rogan josh. Nicely flavored, balanced, and crave-worthy. Even better than the food is the service. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and to take care of our two year old, bringing her extra treats like mango juice. We don't live close, but we'll be back again anyway."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Unlike some other Indian restaurants, the sauces don't all taste the same, each is unique and, I'm assuming, authentic. The quality is consistent and they are super accommodating when there is a mistake or an issue -- one time they comped us an entire tandoori chicken another time they gave us free deserts. The only reason this is not a five star review is that even though they are awesome at fixing problems, there always seems to be problems that need fixing. That, and it does seem to take a long time to get the food once you've ordered. You can somewhat tell that they haven't \"figured out\" how to run a restaurant yet. Hopefully with time I can edit this to 5 stars.

EDIT: Very happy to update this review to 5 stars. The last several times I've eaten here the food was ready in a timely fashion and there were no problems at all. The flavors are still as tasty, so from 4 to 5 it is!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant for Indian cuisine...  By a mile. Literally we drive from Akron all the time. Three school age children and we all love it.  My favorite is Chicken Avhadi Biriyani. We don't mind, but there is absolutely no ambiance. Keep that in mind if on a date."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!   Great west side Indian food!!   highly recommend this restaurant.   service is spot on, very generous portions"}
{"text":"My friends and I loved this place! The food was great and the waiter was so nice and very attentive. The dishes are generally made more mild, but they will make your food as spicy as you like if you ask. Definitely will be returning :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the service. Owner was kind enough to give us 5 samosas when the order was 2, for the sake of my table of 5 trying them out. Gave us several refills on saffron rice for our meals. Was very attentive and the food was cooked very well and fresh.

Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"First time trying out Indian fare. Very clean, comfortable environment. My coworker suggested the buffet and it was spot on. The Chicken Curry over saffron rice.... I could eat a half gallon! Everything else was delicious too. I didn't see too many labels so I really can t describe all the available options to enjoy, but it was all good!

Made it in for the dinner menu. Lamb Saag was excellent. Looking forward to some night shifts to work through the extensive menu!"}
{"text":"I stopped by on a wed night around 8pm.. I was the only person in the restaurant. The food was hot and didn't have to wait much at all. 
The decor is average and the food is typical .. like you find in mostly Indian restaurants. Nothing fancy.."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. I have always received good service dining in or taking out.  Not a ton of Indian options in this area but this is very good."}
{"text":"For a place which seems a bit run down, serving everything in plastic and pretty much entirely empty on a Monday afternoon, the food was just too good. The naans were utterly butterly delicious. I took a risk with Spinach Mastani but totally loved the creamy goodness."}
{"text":"Everything on the lunch buffet pops with flavor. The picnic balls are magical, the tandoori chicken is heaven sent, the naan is fresh baked and compliments everything.
The staff is always friendly and my glass was never empty.

This place is truly a jewel in Hudson."}
{"text":"Service was OK. But the food was delicious. I totally recommend the chicken tikka masala. It was amazing"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food most recent time we went to buffet on Sunday. Service was very friendly. Love that they include tea and some drinks for buffet price! Will be going back often"}
{"text":"I used to eat here about three times a month, but they've been going downhill. My last pickup order was the final straw. They charged $3 each for 2 oz of Raita and Chutney. In the past, a side of chutney was free, and you'd get a soup-sized container of Raita. I sent almost $70 for a dinner, and they cheaped out on sauces??? I'm done."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. Brought my kiddos here for their lunch buffet, and we were super impressed. Horrible decor lol but that isn't what I'm eating. We will be back again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! We tried this Jaipur Junction location after having their food at a friends wedding event. We have so far tried the methi malai, saag paneer, malai kofta, chicken makhani, Chicken Tikka madrasi style, lamb kabob, samosa chaat, bullet naan, garlic naan, jeera rice, gulab jamoon and chicken hariyani. The meat was perfectly tender and service was A-1. Definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in the Greater Cleveland area!!!  Also, excellent dessert."}
{"text":"Jaipur Junction serve something unique from Indian cuisine that many other Indian restaurants do not server in greater Cleveland area. These are the various popular Indian snack-type appetizer items - Bombay Bhel, Papdi Chat, Pani Puri, etc.  If you have had any of these items before or if you haven't, Jaipur Junctions serving quality is top-grade for these items.  I made my meal all about these types of items during my last visit at Jaipur Junction.   If you want to try these unique items then Jaipur Junction is a must visit.

Their menu includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian appetizers, soups, tadoori, curries, rice, and bread dishes.  The quality of these items are in the least standard and at best above average.  If you are craving typical Indian items, and are in the near vicinity of North Royalton,  Jaipur Junction is definitely a great option.  They will not disappoint.  

Jaipur Junction maintains a very bright airy atmosphere where you order at the counter, pay and the food is brought to your table.  They are a strip mall store-front and have very limited seating space.  

Jaipur Junction offers lunch time buffet,  however, the items are very limited and the set-up did not seem very appetizing to my demanding standards. :-)"}
{"text":"Great food. This is traditional Indian food at its best. Try the chicken makhani or the chicken tikka masala. If you can hit a lunch buffet, it's pretty amazing"}
{"text":"We'd had some food catered from JJ at a friend's place, and felt it was good enough to warrant a try, but we were in for a surprise. Awful - easily one of the worst Indian restaurants (in the Cleveland area) we have been to. We ordered take-out, and the food and service was not too good. The restaurant is really small and it smelled unpleasant. Service was pathetic, with the guy taking the order really skewering it badly (he also worked at the Udipi Cafe in Parma before, and has taken his 'attitude' to JJ now, looks like). Not sure if we will go back to JJ."}
{"text":"I took my wife out to Jaipur for a date and let's just put it this way. Thank you Jaipur for making her feel all warm inside, love the spice. That warm feeling carried on. Guys, just saying, Jaipur starts the warm feeling with their curries and masalas and whatnot and you just gotta pick up the torch and keep running with it. Jaipur will save your marriage and reignite the love. 
Just one warning... don't get the super duper spicy spicy stuff. It'll ignite things you'd rather not ignite.... but that's personal preference."}
{"text":"Every time I come here to eat the food looks and tastes good.
But the service isn't that good, today we went for lunch buffet and it was before 2:45pm and after they seated us, one of the of them came out saying sorry we are closed for lunch, when I asked why when you already seated us he said that it will be 3pm after 10 mins.
He was so rude and didn't even offer an apology.
Last time to come here"}
{"text":"We are regulars at Jaipur Junction. Having tried almost every dish, I can say that this is a great place for Indian Cuisine. It is consistently delicious and the service is always friendly. On occasion they have given us dishes (mostly appetizers or desserts) to try for free with our take-out order. Our favorites include: Veggie Samosas, Butter Chicken, Tiki Masala Chicken, and the best Garlic Naan."}
{"text":"The Best Samosas!  They deserve the 5 stars alone.  But the rest of the food is also very delicious and worth pursuing when in the mood for Indian cuisine.  Note that many of the photos on Yelp as of this writing are actually from their OLD location.  Around the beginning of 2013, they moved to a NEW location in the same shopping strip (different building) that has more room.  Besides location, the big difference is that they now serve using real plates, cups, utensils and no longer use the disposable plates and bowls like at the old location.   I'll post photos of the new exterior at night (next to Postnet and a Dry clean place), as well as a table setting of food eaten family style - which is the best way to eat and share Asian foods.

The new location and plates/utensils is nice, but what matters most is the food.  And it is all good.  I have not eaten anything at Jaipur that I did not like.  Recommended are the Samosa platter (3 fried potato and veggie filled dumplings because 1 is not enough), Naan (dipping flat \"bread\"),  Chicken Makhani curry (buttery tangy spiced goodness), Malai Kofta (vegetarian balls in curry sauce), Lamb Saag curry, and lots of other goodies.

Go, eat, be happy."}
{"text":"This was a decent place for good Indian food. The quantity of food provided for the cost is quite large and sumptuous. If you are in the neighborhood searching for Some Indian food , one can get some quality stuff here"}
{"text":"We arrived at 7 on a Tuesday. They were moderately busy and there appeared to only be one young lady who was greeting, seating, serving, and bussing. 

We ordered the picnic balls and vegetable pakora as appetizers. When they came there were three picnic balls instead of four as the menu indicated, and the vegetable pakora consisted of seven small to medium size pieces of vegetable whereas the menu indicated eight.  Not really a big deal but details are important. The appetizers were tasty. 

I ordered malai kofta, hot, and my wife ordered the tandoori chicken.  My dish came out first and while tasty, there was not a hint of heat in it. I even went so far as to let my wife try it. She is very averse to even the slightest heat and remarked that it was indeed mild.  I plated some rice for her and proceeded to eat my meal as we waited for her tandoori chicken. Now, I understand that tandoori chicken takes a while to cook. This is usually accounted for at Indian restaurants by bringing all of the meals out together. In this case I received my food and it was another 10 minutes before my wife's chicken arrived. 

All in all, it was not an unpleasant experience but could certainly have been better."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers. Moderately attentive wait staff is very young and seems largely uninterested in their work. Average place for an average experience. It's definitely going to be the company you bring with you that makes or breaks the experience!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I go to an Indian restaurant. I went for lunch today. When I get there about 2 o'clock there was only one person. All the food was so cold it was hard to swallow. Is that suppose to be like that?"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious. We ventured here twice. Once for dinner and again for the buffet. Both times we were not disappointed. The buffet is filled with a generous selection of food all of which were so good. Can't go wrong with the ala carte menu either. We had the lamb roganjosh and chicken makhani. Both were mouth watering. Highly recommend if you're craving Indian food."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food in the area. Everything was great, especially the fresh naan."}
{"text":"Finally had occasion to visit Jaipur Junction Hudson this Friday for lunch as part of my family's 2015 \"new adventures\" theme (our answer to a new year's resolution). I ate at the North Royalton location years ago, but my wife was not a fan and our slightly finicky teen son had never had Indian food.

We were very pleased with the food and the service. It was clean and comfortable, and granted the place was dead, but our server took the time to explain all the dishes on the buffet. We especially liked the butter chicken, the tandoori chicken, the vegetable curry and the naan. The dishes were certainly flavorful and different than our usual fare, but not too overpowering. I thought the food was fantastic, my wife and son liked it and will return, so a win-win for me. Plus you can't beat the $8.99 price per person, one can get a lot worse food deal for 9 bucks. We will be returning on a weekend when we can get the special buffet with goat and such."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Never been disappointed with the food here. The chicken tika masala is AMAZING! Super fast and friendly service, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a higher rating, but for dine-in, I have to warn you that the service is terrible. Friendly, but terrible. 

I went with my son and my girlfriend on a Saturday afternoon at around 2:00 pm. It was crowded, but not full. Clientèle ranging from Indian to Caucasian, which was nice to see. We were promptly seated in a booth, and offered the buffet, which we declined, opting rather to explore the menu, this having been our first visit. The menu had a wide range of Indian cuisine. Our waiter, however, went MIA. After maybe 10 minutes, maybe a bit less in fairness, but at least 7 minutes later, our waiter reappeared with our waters, and took our order. My son ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, and I ordered the tandoori chicken. My girlfriend ordered a rice dish, but I don't recall which. Then we waited. And waited. And waited... 

After another 10 minutes or so, we were asked if we would mind switching booths to allow access to their party room next door. We moved, and waited. And waited. And waited... Probably 30 minutes all told. No waiter stopping by to check-in, ask for more water, assure us that the food is coming. Just sitting and waiting. 

When the food arrived, however, I have to say that the flavors were superb. I do not have a lot of experience with Indian cuisine, so I am not able to opine on its authenticity, but I can tell you it was damn good. 

I think that they prefer that patrons partake in the buffet, which did look good (just not my thing, as I have \"sneeze guard\" phobia), but if you're looking to dine-in off the menu, consider yourself warned. The food will be delicious; I just recommend arriving before your hungry. Hunger will set in while you wait. I promise. 

All said, I will definitely go back. Only next time it will be for carry-out."}
{"text":"I'm here on business found this place on Yelp. The reviews were very good and the place lived up to the reviews. Naan bread perfect clay oven burn and the lamb Vindaloo was tender and flavorsome. Great attention to service. No beer but a wonderful experience. Will go back for sure"}
{"text":"seriously - an amazing little hole in the wall.  But SOOO good we got the exact same dinner to go, just to stick it in the freezer.  My cousin had the Chicken Tikka Masala - I had the Paneer with their special sauce.  She ordered the specialty chai - and it was delish!!

Their spice level is about on par to normal standards.  Be careful.

Definitely opt for the bread basket - the kashmiri naan is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service really.
We had pakoras, chicken tikka masala, and veg biryani, with two chais.
All the food came out hot , fresh, and fast. Tasted great and to our spice level ordered
Staff was very friendly
The naan was large and fresh.
The chai was pretty boring but I havent had real chai anywhere in the US anyway.
Excellent experience overall"}
{"text":"My favorite local Indian restaurant. Great, authentic food, solid service and a nice atmosphere. If you want something a little different, check this place out. It's a bit on the pricey side, though, so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Jaipur Junction is our new favorite stop for Indian food.  Hubby and I have eaten here twice now and both times were wrapped up in warm curry ginger lovin'.  My husband even ended his nine day juice cleanse with dinner at Jaipur Junction. (His stomach paid for it later, but he said it was worth it.)  

Between the two of us, we've savored the samosa platter, two kinds of naan, Kheema Parotha, Alu Gobi, Dhaba Chicken, Chicken Makhani, and the Maharaja Grill.  The portion sizes and flavors are satisfying.

The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because the food is served on disposable plates with plastic utensils and the service can be slow.

I promise the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Came here for the weekend buffet and was left pretty satisfied. The place itself is very casual, as is the service. The food was very good, not great, but definitely worth the $10 for the 4 plates of food I had. 

The selection consisted of tikka masala, samosa, naan, papdi chaat, alu gobi, palak paneer, rice, tandoori chicken, and a few other dishes that I can't remember the name of (they don't label the foods). The samosa was a little disappointing. It was all potato with little seasoning. The naan was dry. The other dishes were all very good, although mild. I assume because it's a buffet that they don't make anything spicy, so you may have to order from the menu if you want some heat.

Overall though, I was very satisfied. The papdi chaat is refreshing and full of flavor. The tandoori chicken is actually tender here. They also had a few desserts. Sliced fruit, rice pudding, and something else that was really good. It was this sweet, brownish-orange mush, which I can only guess is carrot halwah from looking at their menu. If you ever eat here, GET THIS.

Saffron Patch is my favorite Indian spot in the GCA, but I will probably frequent this place more since I live much closer. 3.5 rounded up."}
{"text":"Good samosas, fast service when they are open. If they aren't open, you can peer inside and watch workers sleeping on the booths; what a tease."}
{"text":"Everytime I have been here I've had a good experience. The food is pretty consistent and the menu is super easy to read with descriptions of everything. Chicken madras and Kathi kabob roll are my favorites"}
{"text":"My parents and I tried the chicken tikka, saag paneer and pani puri.  The chicken tikka was a little off putting in texture but the flavor was still great.  We loved every dish.  The naan they came with was fantastic!  So glad we stopped here.  Lunch buffet looked fine but it was fun for us to order off the menu.  On weekends buffet is 10.95 and 9.95 weekdays."}
{"text":"The food was average.  I enjoyed the palak paneer best.  They give a good portion of paneer.  The chicken tikka masala, matar paneer were okay.  The lamb vindaloo was too sour or tangy for my taste.  This place has a hole in the wall vibe but dishes are priced between 12-16$.  It's nice to find decent Indian food in the area. If I was dining here again I'd try the tandoori chicken as the sizzling plates looked appealing."}
{"text":"The Rosh Lamb and the Tikki Masala were fantastic.  The garlic naan as well.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love authentic Indian and have been to most restaurants in the area. Including the other Jaipur Junction location on the West Side.

I must say that the quality of the food at this Jaipur is excellent. Better than the other location. Best tandoori chicken I have had in a long time. Not dried out our and bland. This chicken came out hot and was amazingly juicy. My guest loved her dish which they made hot. So hot that she was sweating and she loves hot food.

Naan bread was amazing....

Server was outstanding. Man with ponytail. I would come back for the service alone- for lunch.

Here is my issue- the price point.  The ambiance and the service does not back up the high menu prices. They are definitely set the high price point based on the Hudson, Ohio Stepford Wife community demographics. Compare the prices with the other location and you will be left speechless.

One other thing. I often like to check out the restrooms in restaurants. If the dining area is clean, then I expect the restrooms to be clean. Well, the bathroom was in terrible condition. A restroom that I would expect to find at the Jaipur railway station in India. Paint can on the floor. Patches on the walls. The devil in in the details. Unacceptable. For these prices, an attendant should be in the restroom holding towels and passing out after dinner dessert mints.

Summary:

Food- excellent
Service- excellent
Prices- out of line. price-gouging alert
Restrooms- terrible

If you go to Jaipur, go there for lunch."}
{"text":"We were in the area, so decided to visit our fav. Indian restaurant. We were shocked to find that where it once stood is now vacant!!! On our way out of the shopping center we noticed a Jaipur Junction sign on a building in the adjacent shopping center. 

The new location is dark & sparsely decorated. I guess they moved in, added the old benched from the old location, a table in the middle, and the old buffet and that is it. Couldn't they at least hang one picture on the wall? Storage space must be at a minimum because boxes were stacked in plain sight. My wife decided to get the buffet. I have an aversion to buffets, because of hygiene and lack of sanitizer available at most places I visit. My wife and daughter enjoyed their meal. I ordered a fish kabob. When it came out, I asked the owner when they had moved. He said very little and did not seem very chatty that day. Back to the fish... Must not have been my day. During this visit the fish was very dry. Almost jerky like. Was not an overcooking issue. More like freshness. Will avoid next time.

Bathrooms were cleaner in the new restaurant and there are two! One little closing remark. One the way back to my seat, I peered in the kitchen window and observed the cook placing samosas that he was frying in a large pan that was resting on a trash can. Yes... it was a trash can. I kid you not. 

Anyhow, the bill came to $38 and my wife and kids were happy. I will give them some time and visit again when I am in the area. Hopefully they work on the \"little\" details."}
{"text":"Went here twice in one week and will be back again next week. This place knows food and flavor layering in a way that escapes most Indian restaurants. The samosas are supreme and the naan is perfectly crisp on one side, I won't even go into the butter chicken so good. These guys get it!"}
{"text":"Superb food, great value. Went for the lunch buffet, and all the food was hot and tasty! As a meat-lover, it means a lot when I say don't overlook the vegetarian dishes, but seriously! Don't overlook the vegetarian dishes! The mixed vegetable dish and paneer masala were SO good."}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE!! POOR FOOD the staff is SUPER RUDE!!! I called in to order something for delivery , the person on the other side of the phone doesn't understand the English. I am asking if there is any other items with chicken and he keeps on telling me about the prices and how busy they are. 

Then he puts me on hold without even telling me which is absurd and then he comes back on the phone again and says I don't have time to be on hold for so long if you can't decide what you want to order ?????

Then I am asking him how much time it's going to take you to prepare the food and the guy says 
'I AM CANCELING THE ORDER' and hangs up the phone!!! 

Then when I go to pick up the food the guy who was on the phone is hiding in the kitchen and he doesn't want to face me . 

I call the manager to complain and he goes \"YOU GUYS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE BUSY AND CANT BE ON THE PHONE FOR SO LONG\" 

I wouldn't recommend to go this place at all"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. I particularly love their kathi kabob rolln saffron rice and paneer kulcha."}
{"text":"I met a friend for dinner here and I would have to say it was a very good experience.  They have an array of choices on the menu with great descriptions as well as a few pictures.  

The place wasn't too crowded so the service was pretty good.  We order a starter of samosas which is a must have.  They were really good.  My friend had a mango drink which was made with fresh mangoes and looked quiet delicious.

I order the Alu Gobi- hot as my spice.  The flavor was amazing and I had enough to take has leftovers for lunch the following day.  Most of the meals come with naan, which they are HUGE!  If you want rice with your meal, it is at an extra charge.  

So an appetizer, speciality drink, a basket of naan, to main courses dishes, plus add on rice the meal was around $30.  I think that was a true deal.  My friend and I said that we would for sure head back to this place.

The only reason why I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because my request for hot for my spice, wasn't really hot.  Even my friend mentioned how she would  have liked a little more kicked to the meal."}
{"text":"Good Indian food. Be sure to check their hours because they close shortly in the afternoon."}
{"text":"After a terrible experience at udupi a friend accompanied us here to point out what was what. We arrived in time for the buffet. Its small but wonderful!!
The clientele was mainly white which is great too see. Love when ppl embrace other cultures!!
Everything is fresh and the buffet temp is correct.
The only reason for the 4/5 rating is it took too long too get water and refills."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. They have a little lunch buffet that really hits the spot. The staff is friendly and the place is well kept. I try to come here a couple times a month when I can. Great option for a quick sit down. Quality, well prepared, non fried lunch."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town I make it a point to visit Jaipur Junction. Well, what do I like about this place? JJ has the best Indian food I've tasted. Better then the restaurants in Little India (Oak Tree Road in Edison, NJ). Jaipur is best for takeout as this is certainly not a fine dining establishment and doesn't pretend to be. Plastic dinnerware and Styrofoam plates are the rule here. I would easily give Jaipur five stars if the atmosphere was better. For the money, there is really nothing at all to complain about. Jaipur will adjust the heat in four stages: mild, medium, hot and Indian hot. I'm an \"Indian Hot\" kind of guy. Nothing like the full experience!  Noteworthy is the samosa appetizer and the lamb saag."}
{"text":"No matter what you get, it's delicious! I love coming here! Friendly service and fantastic food! Priced well and large portions."}
{"text":"be decent food. Walk in today and try to order the same thing I had last week and was told that it's only for lunch. I told the waiter to ask the owner and he comes back with the owners busy right now so you might as well order something else. Kept insisting on ordering food on our behalf rather than what we wanted to eat. I walked out of the place and they couldn't care less. I went and ate at Penn Station after that and the service there was 10 times Superior to this place. There's no money in the world that could make me walk back in there and I wouldn't recommend others not to do so either."}
{"text":"The food here was so good!!! It was my first time trying Indian food, everything we had was delicious, and the staff was super nice! We will defiantly be going back again soon!!!"}
{"text":"The food is top notch. The atmosphere is improving. Favorite meal is samosas, chicken tikka masala and nan"}
{"text":"First time - delicious food Makhani Chicken and Basmati Sweet Rice  Dish. Servings were plentiful enough for togo boxes.  They were busy and the service was slightly slow."}
{"text":"Extremely mediocre. Interior is pretty run down, ugly pink paint. Not sure why this place is rated this high"}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey the owner is kind a rude and it takes them forever to make your food in the quality of food is also on the low side at the owner customer service is everything remember that"}
{"text":"Love this place! It definitely hits the spot whenever my husband and I are craving some good Indian food. I usually get one of the curries with paneer, while hubby really enjoys the butter chicken curry. 
Add one of their samosas (or an entire order = 3 or 4 can't remember) to your meal. Very fresh and let me tell you, you'd be surprised by how filling they are! 
There is also an Indian grocery a few doors down from this place, so if you are looking to make some of these tasty dishes at home, go and check it out."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  We did the buffet and everything was good to excellent.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is about my favorite Indian restaurant on the west side of Cleveland.  They just moved to a new location a few doors down from the old, and in the new place they a full sit-down restaurant--I kinda liked the informality and casual decor of the old place, but the new place is definitely a bit more upscale.  Still good food at a great price, though.
Buffet for lunch; full menu for dinner."}
{"text":"3/30/18 Awesome food! Have the chicken patiala every time. Delicious sauce and chicken with great tiny rice. Tried the veggie pakora plate. Fantastic spices! Not much of an atmosphere, but it's my favorite Indian food around."}
{"text":"Ordered lamb curry and chicken Makhani.

The lamb was soft and Delicious as I would expect.

The Chicken Makhani was also very good.

There are only two kinds of Indian restaurants in my opinion:

1. Those that claim to be Indian restaurants.
2. Those that are Indian restaurants.

Good new! This place is an Indian restaurant their for 5 stars."}
{"text":"We got lamb biryani and palak paneer. We exchanged gifts and it was so lovely. We had a voucher and my phone was dying. The server helped charged my dying phone and that was so nice of them~ They were very good and so was the food, this place does not disappoint! I then remember from the decor on the wall I was here last year to and I remember, their mango juice is very good."}
{"text":"Definitely a great Indian restaurant.  I highly recommend.  Clean, neat & very good customer service.  Went on a Friday noon for the lunch buffet & perfectly liked it.."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch buffet and everything was great!  The options were very limited- mostly vegetables. I wish they had more but I guess i can't expect much for a little place. Regardless, it was still awesome and we left full. The server was very nice and attentive. I'd have to come back for the special buffet!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully spiced, fresh, high quality food! I was impressed by everything we ordered in it's flavor, texture and authenticity. Highly recommend eating here. The staff was so kind and helpful. 
A+++"}
{"text":"I love their somosa and chaat papri. Anytime I go, its the same fresh quality."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant 7 or 8 times now and on all occasions the food was excellent. We've never gotten the buffet and always order off the menu. The tomato soup is the best I've ever had. You can tell everything is freshly prepared. I think they've worked out the initial kinks they had in the kitchen and with the service. The current wait staff is good. We've been to many Indian restaurants and the food at this one wins head and shoulders above the rest locally."}
{"text":"As an Indian, I can say with security that this is probably the best Indian restaurant in Cleveland. The buffet costs like $9, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. I definitely love the Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala. I've taken a couple of my friends there and they all are addicted to Indian food now. It's not too spicy, but if you're ordering you can ask them to make it spicy. The Shahi Paneer is to die for if you're a vegetarian. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I live 5 to 10 minutes away and I definitely try making a trip out whenever I can."}
{"text":"The take out I had was delicious! Great flavor from the garlic naan, lots of flavor from all three curries I got, and the rice was perfectly cooked. The only thing I didn't love was that we ordered our food medium, and it wasn't spicy at all. I'd recommend this place for a good Punjabi spot in cle!"}
{"text":"So so good! Coming from California 3 years ago and traveling about I've yet to taste any Mexican or Indian food that could even compare. This place is close, its still amazing! It's hot just like I love it, the flavors are spot on and I don't think I could complain about anything. The bf and I have gotten take out here several times, tonight we got a few dishes to try. He's never had samosas before and I've never had the dipping sauces they served these with, So delicious! I think the samosas where a little soft on the outside, but not their fault considering it was take out and put into a box it probably sweat. Still amazing. 

We ordered as soon as they opened for dinner. Our food was ready as soon as we walked in. Someone was getting take out in front of us, but 2 waiters still greeted us, making me feel like they appreciated us. The place looked clean and a couple people at tables for dinner, not too crowded yet. I'd love to try the lunch buffet some time. 
I got the normal chicken Tikka masala and it had me wiggling in my seat for joy, also the garlic Naan was perfection. 
I'd recommend to anybody!"}
{"text":"I have just returned from a fantastic meal at Jaipur Junction. 
It is a very small place and the service was VERY laid back. It took a while for the server to acknowledge that we were there, and even longer for our order to be taken. The server was very nice, but a little absent. The restaurant could definitely benefit from hiring a more experienced waitstaff...
That, however, was the only fault of Jaipur Junction. So if you are not in a hurry and want some of the most fantastic Indian food around, I highly recommend this place. We started off our meal with some chicken samosas and masala tea, both of which arrived very quickly! The samosas were delicious: fresh, nicely spiced, and crispy, just the way they should be. The tea was also very tasty. If you like chai, you will like this tamed down version.
For our entree I had the chicken tikka masala while my boyfriend ordered the chicken Patiala. The rice that came with the dishes was a little coconut-ty which was exquisite and our chicken dishes were both so much better than any other Indian food we had ever had. Full of flavor and cooked to perfection. 
After that, we were very full but had to try the dessert. Indian desserts are always a little strange but we decided to go for the kheer (rice pudding) and they also gave us a free bowl of gulab jamun. Both were quite good! The kheer has some nuts and fruit in it which were a nice surprise and the gulab jamun were soft and sweet. 
The entire meal took about an hour and half and cost under $40 which is not so bad considering we had 3 courses! So sure, the service could use an upgrade but it certainly is not going to deter me from going back. It was that good.


**Edit: Since this review, I have returned to Jaipur Junction several times. I am pleased to say that they have in fact hired more professional waitstaff. Now, you have no reason not to visit this place. Top Indian food in the area!**

**Second edit: Staff is back in the crapshoot but food is still amazing (though 1-2$ more than before)**"}
{"text":"What I know about Indian food you could put on the head of a very, very tiny pin. I do, however, know what I like, and I like--make that \"love\"--Jaipur Junction's food.  I can't walk into this place without my salivary glands acting like the Mississippi during rainy season. 

It's not an eat-in place for me (although plenty of people do including tons of Indian folks) but that's why the Goddess Annupurna invented take-out. OK, she probably didn't invent take-out but I know she's blessed this food. 

Going there now. Yum."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Our waiter was friendly and recommended the Chicken Seekh Kebab, because it is uniquely made. It was delicious with complex flavors. My husband enjoyed his tikka masala. We also tried the mango lassi at the end of our meal. Yum! We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"I headed here for having some vegetables biryani and they surprised me. The biryani was like any normal rice mixed with vegetable curry and ghee. The rice was not even biryani rice. Unexpected dish."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the best Indian restaurants I have ever visited. It doesn't have a fancy interior but its food is outstanding!

My wife and I are the regular customers and can't resist ordering the same food (samosas, Kabuli Chana and Goan Fish Curry) over and over again, because it is SO delicious!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had another great lunch buffet at Jaipur Junction. They said their lunch buffet is special on Sundays because they offer more choices in buffet compared to other days. Although they charge $2 more for buffet on Sundays, (and maybe Saturdays too), I completely think it's a great deal. 

We had samosa and fried appetizers, 4 type of meat dishes, that were lamb kabap, tandouri chicken, butter chicken and goat curry. Rice, chick peas, peas, coli flower, and naan were vegetarian choices that I can remember. I used my rights mostly on meat dishes this time. I think they had more vegetarian choices.

They also offer lots of sides like salad with choices of dressings, pickles, etc.
They had fruit salad, rice pudding and dough balls in syrup for desert.

They offered 2 choices of soft drinks as part of Sunday's special buffet: 1:Ice tea with mango flavor, and 2:Mango milk shake. Ice tea was made fresh and had great mango flavor. I could drink the entire jar of 3 gallons if I had room.

The only problem was forcing ourselves to eat more than we should, due to great taste of all the dishes. 

A Sunday lunch with many choices like described above for $10.95 per person is a great deal. I cannot wait for th next opportunity to visit this place."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Anything you get you'll be happy with!!! Vegetable Samosas are amazing! Paneer is to die for and lamb Benoni is great! Can't forget garlic nann!"}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING.  To bad the decor of the place totally takes it down a notch.  It is also pricey; expect to pay at least $9-$10 during lunch and/or dinner if you go.  But the food makes up for any of the space or decor problems.  I highly recommend this place to anyone that like or wants to try Indian food."}
{"text":"This is a total lie. I with my wife was there at 11:50 am. I asked u if buffet was ready u said yes or ur rude employee. You just trying to cover for him. I did not ask for roti which I came last time and asked and paid $2. 99 for it. I will attach have the copy of the receipt also. Your waiter has the biggest attitude problem and when I asked him about food and he says there are other Indian restaurant.  If he does not know customer service so please don't cover for him.  You are totally lieing right now. Please if guys don't know customer service please do something else"}
{"text":"I don't consider myself to be an expert on Indian food.  All I know is what tastes good, and I had been searching for an Indian restaurant with food this good for a long time.

The first time I really enjoyed Indian food was on a trip to San Francisco, in a little hole-in-the wall in the city where we had to bring drinks from the shop next door.  The food was inexpensive, delicious, and in large quantities.

I had no luck finding a similar experience back home until I stumbled onto Jaipur Junction.  I've been a major fan ever since.  I no longer live anywhere close to the restaurant, but my wife and I will still make the 45 minute drive.

I've tried several vegetarian and chicken dishes.  The sauces are seasoned well and slightly sweet.  The naan breads are fresh and perfectly cooked, never burned or tough.  The three samosas that come with a samosa platter are plenty for two people to share as an appetizer.

For a good price, try their all you can eat buffet.  I think it happens twice a week, but I can't remember when.

The only reason I cannot give this place five stars is because of the presentation.  The food is top notch, but it's served on styrofoam plates.  You have to walk through an employees-only area to get to the bathroom, which is pretty sketchy.  Recently, they've added some booths to the seating area, which is nice.  It shows that they are willing to make upgrades as they make progress.

I'm hoping that more people will discover this great food so that they can become successful, and maybe one day have a very nice restaurant to visit in addition to amazing food.  If word doesn't spread, though, I really dread driving up there to find out that the only good Indian restaurant in the area had to shut down.

I'm checking 'delivery available' because I used to get it delivered through delivermefood.com when I lived in strongsville."}
{"text":"I refused to eat Indian food until a year or so ago. I've seen the light. I've been to several area Indian places but none like Jaipur! I get carry out from them every Thursday. The Chicken Korma maybe my favorite food ever and they make it the best!"}
{"text":"Super great food!!! The lunch buffet is phenomenal! I love this place! My family and I eat here all the time, and always enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Jaipur Junction last night to see if the buffet was open, but they said they only serve a lunch buffet.  So I stopped in today for the lunch buffet per the recommendation from a co-worker.  I was not disappointed!  The food here is really good and I got to try two new dishes.

Today, I had Chicken Tikka Masala, white rice, curried peas and tofu, curried potatoes and cauliflower, and naan.  Everything was delicious!

The two new dishes I tried, well, I don't have the names of.  One was a flavorful dark sauce with beans in it.  It reminded me of good old American Baked Beans, but nowhere close in taste.  The other dish I tasted was chickpeas, small crackers, green chutney, vegetables, and yogurt.  This was a light summer dish that reminded me of ambrosia.  Basically, it was an Indian ambrosia.  It was tasty and the texture was interesting.  

I also tried a samosa, which was good when dipped in the masala sauce with the chicken.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Indian food.  I found myself longing for a spicy chutney, which was not present.  Oh well, not everything has to be spicy.  Right?"}
{"text":"Mmm, some good Indian food. A bit of a drive for those of us who live downtown, but it's good.

We had a meeting there at 7pm on a Monday night and was able to get a table, without a problem. Located in a random strip mall (I almost passed it, but slammed on my brakes right in time), it's decently busy, but not super full on a weekday.

We ordered a medley of different foods- the chicken makhani, paneer tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and mastani palek to name a few. They were all good and tasty. Not to spicy with a lot of spices though. Overall, pretty good. I'm not Indian so I can't really determine if it was authentic, but in my opinion of Indian places, I thought it was good. Not the best I've had, but very good.

The service was kind of slow and the waiter didn't really hear my order, but we had a large group of 6, so I guess that's always hard. Overall though, pretty good Indian food!"}
{"text":"I was in Parma visiting a friend, and we ordered dinner from here. I'm Indian, and I generally have lower expectations from Indian restaurants in the USA, because I understand the constraints they may face in terms of culinary talent and access to ingredients, and also the pressure to appeal to a wider audience, not all of whom can handle copious amounts of heat and spice. Also, most \"Indian\" restaurants in the USA are really just focused on Mughal and North Indian food, which tends to be heavy. 

Having said that, the takeout from Jaipur Junction managed to trip over the low, low bar of my expectations. We ordered paneer tikka as a starter, and navratan korma and shahi paneer as entrees (both of which were served with a naan), and we ordered an extra naan as well. 

The packaging was terrible, and all of the containers were topsy turvy by the time they reached us. I took out the paneer tikka (supposed to be a dry dish), and it leaked orange colored liquid everywhere. The paneer itself was dry and tasted of nothing, and the accompanying onion masala was only slightly better.

Orange stained mediocrity was the theme of the meal. The shahi paneer was absurdly sweet, with chewy chunks of paneer, and all the naans were slightly soggy. The navratan korma fared comparatively better, with an abundance of veggies and a curry that had a semblance of spice and flavor.

I ended the meal really wishing that I had made the effort to drive out to Choolah, another Indian restaurant in the area that I had visited on my last trip, and was blown over by.

I get the urge that Indian restaurants have to pander to a broader audience, but it would serve Jaipur Junction well to at least be a little authentic!"}
{"text":"Had a samosa here at the CLE Asian Fest, and it was great.  I really think they have the best samosas.  Everything else smelled very good too and looked fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! So good your stomach will come up & kiss your mouth!  Thank you!!  We will be back again & again!"}
{"text":"Very good saag paneer. It's a 1-10 hotness range, but the 3 was surprisingly strong. My dining companions had chicken korma. It was more of a shahi korma than the traditional korma with cashew and raisins that we were used to. The naan basket was fabulous - it even had a sweet cinnamon naan. The Jaipur Thali was quite good, but specify your dessert ahead of time. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great food for a great value. Don't miss the lunch Buffet"}
{"text":"I give out stars relative to the restaurant's niche. For a mid-scale Indian place, this is as good as it can get. Extremely authentic, which means delicious. I only wish it were closer to home.

The service was a bit abrupt, but not rude. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant in an unsuspecting strip mall. 

I've been going to Jaipur Junction for years and I have never had a bad experience. 

I mostly order take out but occasionally I'll eat in. Almost every time I've taken out, no matter how long your order, it's taken 20 minutes. Which is really fast! The order is always correct and comes with more than ample amounts of extra rice and naan. Which is awesome because if you're like me and like to wipe up all the extra sauce with your naan, you'll be good to go!

This past time I came in to have dinner with a group of friends. It was empty when we came at 6pm but quickly filled up by the time we left at 8pm. 

We tend to order family style when we come here since it's easiest to try and have a bit of everything. This past visit we ordered alu cheese paratha, alu gobi (amazing veggie dish! You must try it) lamb saag (the lamb just melts in your mouth), chicken tandoori and chicken tikka masala (staple dish!). The meat dishes always come with huge chunks of meat so you can tell that it's real meat and quality.  We always finish off our meals with a Mango lassi to help cool out mouths off since we tend to order \"American spicy\".  Service can sometime be a little slow but this is a 2 or sometimes 1 man operation and when it gets busy they are hustling to make sure your dishes come out hot!

FYI - they have different levels of spicy so don't be afraid to tailor the dishes to your tastes. They go mild, medium, American spicy, Indian spicy. 

Also note they have now opened the large side room for private parties."}
{"text":"My wife and I heard good things about this place so we drove 30 minutes to try it out. The menu is vast with every Indian dish I could think of (granted, my exposure is probably limited) plus some I've never seen. Appetizer and bread choices are great, too.

My wife had chicken tikka masala and I ordered navratan (vegetarian) korma. We were both pleased. We added vegetable pakora plus a naan sampler basket. There was so much bread we took the extra home and had two more meals with it!

Overall we were pleased but are also happy with another place closer to our home. If you live nearby definitely visit. Every community deserves to have tasty Indian cuisine like this!"}
{"text":"Their lunch buffets are VERY good! Besides their buffet, their wraps are very good as well. A bit on the pricier side though."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Papadoms and chutney are great. Samosas fantastic! Interior very nice. Service very good. Went for weekend buffet.

We were the first ones in there today at 11:30 am. When we left an hour later the place was half full. I would go back when I'm in the area.

Exposure counts!"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in the area! The safe is nice and they provide good service. The food is always spot on !"}
{"text":"I met a man named Mawahdi years ago while squatting to relieve myself in the street amidst the filth and squalor of a Mumbai ghetto. Mawahdi looked me in the eye that day and told me that good Indian food should smell the same leaving us as it does while entering us. He was, in fact, complimenting me on my dinner choice from the night before. I never forgot that blisteringly hot summer day and the begrimed wise man's words. Jaipur Junction, by this measure or any other, is a fine eating establishment.

I have eaten food from this restaurant more times than I can remember and each time when I get down to the last handful (people in India eat with their hands-you'd do well to do the same) of Alu Gobi or Palak Paneer, I smile like a man who just traded an unwanted child. None of the food here will disappoint you and all of it will bring you back to your days vacationing in India. If you have not been blessed enough to go there, you can dream the dream of a billion happy people and eat the food from a well-run and delightful restaurant like Jaipur Junction.

The Chicken Dhaba is subtle with hints of cardamom and clove. Mutter Paneer is loaded with peas and toothsome rectangular bites of rich goat cheese. The triangular fried blocks of potato are crunchy and spicy and positively divine when dipped in the unctuous sauce provided with them. Forgive me for forgetting the name, tell the man you want 'those fried potato things' and he'll oblige.

Get your food to go and don't eat there; they give you plastic forks and look at you while you eat. Bring the bags of food home, wash yourself, and dive into the plastic tubs with your hands like you lost your watch at a MetroParks rest room.

I hope you'll forgive my feculence at points in this review. Mawahdi changed my culinary outlook and I couldn't help myself in including his wisdom. As for the gratuitous MetroParks reference, perhaps it was a bit heavy-handed but like other good things I hope you will let it pass."}

{"text":"I eat here regularly , Five star Indian cuisine.  My favorite spot overall in North royalton. Always fresh food , great quality , good price . Excellent deserts . try to go for the buffet. I like all of their chicken meals so it is hard to pick one. I may just order this right now.  The deserts are great too."}
{"text":"Had the buffet. Samosa, naan, chicken curry, and other stuff I couldn't pin a name to.  Every portion including the tapioca dessert was excellent. And at $9 for lunch buffet a great value. However, service is below average. The cook at the time was seating people. We then had to wait several minutes to check out and pay. Even had to go into the kitchen to ask if we could pay now. Almost thought about the old dine and dash move, but didn't do it. Bathroom was not very clean. The food definitely carries this place. If not this place would be out of bizness.  I'll come back again to eat though."}
{"text":"Wow! This place doesn't look like much, but the food & wait staff were absolutely wonderful! From the samosas, to the Tandoori chicken my children gobbled up & the side of bhangan bhurta it came with that I gobbled up, to the Aloo Gobi & Chicken Tikka Masala. The main dishes were flavorful & well spiced, but not overly spicy. What was great was that the dishes were not laden in oil/grease like most other Indian restaurants. And The naan was perfectly soft - not hard & burnt like some other places. Mango Lassi was delicious. Wish we left room for dessert! Next time!!"}
