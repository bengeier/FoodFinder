{"text":"I have never had anything I didn't really really love, this is by far my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. It isn't a magic trick, it is good honest food."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed in Pittsburgh for weeks and wanted to have pho. I read about good stuff here but was very disappointed.  We have had Vietnamese food in other states before but here is the worst. We ordered Pho hanoi and mixed fried rice. Soup has no flavour and it seems to have excessive MSG. EGG roll and fried rice is too greasy. Service is not friendly.  We don't want to go back."}
{"text":"Food was okay but high cahirs were terribly dirty. You don't want to bring your little one here. Service was below average. They accept cash only. They never give you changes...they think all the changes are tips so get some small bills before visit. I am typically okay with no frill service especially for these kinds of restaurants but Tram's kitchen's service was even below the bar."}
{"text":"I am not going to rail on this place too much because it did provide some mad comfort after a long day's work. I will just keep this easy and to the point.  Let's start off by saying this isn't an \"authentic\" Vietnamese restaurant. It has its MSG and pho broth they use for everything (even vegetarian dishes), but their rice dishes are wretched and everything is just mediocre without thrills. So why does everyone love this place? Well I hate to break it, but most of the frequenters are white and for some reason they became the authority on judging a good or bad Vietnamese restaurant, even if health inspectors closed it down (twice?).  With that being said, it's a good soup restaurant. That's right, not pho but \"soup\" restaurant. Vegheads beware, not cruelty free."}
{"text":"Looooooved this place.  Great food tastes , wonderful menu options. Very appropriate portion sizes.   I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place gets everything right. I like the weird, cheap feel of the decor because it sends snooty people away. The menu is cheap and the portions are HUGE. I have tried the whole menu and never been let down. It's fast, It's friendly, It's cheap, It's delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great taste! Quick on time meal prep. Daughter hospitalized and husband walked there safely from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Other local Chinese option doesn't compare. We are highly satisfied and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite eateries in Pittsburgh.  Decor is not much but the food and prices are awesome.  I find it difficult to find a good vegetarian broth and they have it here.  Had Sate tonight - yum!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the food, price, and atmosphere. I'm a vegetarian and have a hard time finding good veg-friendly pho. Trams had me covered with a \"pho-style\" vegetarian soup, which smelled and tasted very similar to its beef counterpart. Another plus to the veggie pho was the incredible garlic taste added to it and the cloves floating in the bottom - yum!  I can't believe how great the prices are here. It's cash only, but the day I was here the atm wasn't working and staff wasn't too empathetic or helpful for customers who had trouble with it. The staff was very helpful and knowledgable but serious and down-to-business, and not one of them ever acknowledged  a \"thank you\" from any customer during the entire time we were at the restaurant. Don't take it personally, it's part of the vibe here. Also, BYO."}
{"text":"I honestly can tell that the customer service is amazing and the food are superb. A Fried noodle was delicious but a vegan spring roll was ordinary. Had a wonderful time! I will visit again."}
{"text":"Great food, awful service! (although some days the server has a less apathetic disposition than other days). I think that every time we've been here we've had chicken or beef curry with vermicelli, and it has been great! The lemon grass tofu was a pleasant surprise. They don't take reservations and the wait can get pretty long; come after 8 pm. BYO."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place. The spring rolls are really good. I like them better than ones I've had in Vietnam and the sauce is yummy. The fried spring rolls are also very good. I sometimes get beef pho to bring home for dinner and the beef is usually still a little pink by the time I get home. Their broth is flavorful without adding anything too. Just remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much a pho expert.  Maybe not certifiable, but pretty close.  I wasn't sure what Tram's would have to offer in terms of authentic pho- but it's the real deal. The rundown:  I ordered two of the pork & shrimp spring rolls- delish!  I've had better peanut sauce, but the rolls were great.   Then I ordered the beef pho.  The broth was incredible- ridiculously hot (temp) with onions, just the way it should be.  The beef was probably too well done for my taste and was cooked all the way through when the soup was brought to me.  But it tasted just fine.  Only complaint was that the basil that came on the side wasn't very fresh.   Overall, it was great. Def going back.... and Tram is a nice guy."}
{"text":"This little Vietnamese restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. We always start our meal with the fresh spring rolls - we both order two each because we don't want to share. Their hoison dipping sauce recipe includes special peanut ingredients that make it unlike any other that other Vietnamese restaurants serve. For dinner, I always order number 17 with no noodles because I substitute extra vegetables. It's always perfect. It's always delicious. I can't find this particular dish at any other Vietnamese restaurant so I continually find myself ordering the same thing. The pho is also delicious but I often times will share half an order with somebody else so I can get my number 17 :-)   The owner is a little abrupt but very friendly and you can bring your own bottle of just about anything and they will open it and serve it for you at no cost. You might be sitting next to a group of physicians, hipsters, corporate executives or students - they all flock here because the food is excellent and the price is always inexpensive."}
{"text":"[+]  pho soup  rice spring rolls  amazing flavor  waiter with one hand  decent price  byob   [-]  avg. ambiance  waiter with one hand"}
{"text":"Very authentic Vietnamese cuisine, this place has been a go-to for over 10 years.  Their pho and satay soups are both amazing, in fact I've never had anything bad here. The lemongrass tofu is another superb item, as well as the fresh spring rolls. Don't forget to specify vegetarian or you'll get pork or shrimp in things. \"Mr. Tram\" as I call him (Tram is actually his daughter) is really the heart and soul of the place, he is missing one hand and has a gruff demeanor but has a real genuine way about him, and we've loved eating at his place over the years. A good owner can make a restaurant really special."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall - check.  Stern (at times) owner who rules his roost - check.  I don't really trust a Vitnamese restaurant to be really really good unless it is a hole in the wall kind of place.   :)  And this place is good.  Now, my one beef with this restaurant is the limited menu.  But really, they do everything on the menu so well that you can't really complain.  And the prices are extremely reasonable.  Make sure you get the fresh rolls.  I usually get the vermicelli with a little bit of everything on top.  And unless you are ridiculously hungry, get the smaller bowl - it is still a lot of food.  BYOB, so feel free to bring your own alcohol of choice.  I can't remember what the corkage fee is, probably because there is none, I believe.  And bring cash."}
{"text":"I feel I must defend Tram's...   Point one: It's dirty.   So it's not a freakin' Panera Bread in there... with 7 high school students wiping down tables at all times. It's not super clean, so what? Please name for me a spotlessly clean Vietnamese restaurant in the city of Pittsburgh. Seriously, take a spin through the alley behind Pho Minh in Garfield, *ahem* sorry in the Penn Avenue Arts District... Their backyard is like an open sewer... I've still eaten there and lived to tell the tale.  Point two: But for hipsters, it would not be in business.   Don't give yourselves too much credit, my friends. In the ancient era B.C.H. (Before Coming of Hipsters), Tram's still did a brisk business serving tasty if basic Pittsburgh-Vietnamese cuisine (they've taken the shimp curry over french fries off the menu, but you can still order it) to those who would brave the wilds of Lawrenceville (a distinctly unfashionable address, circa 1995) to get it. Did Tram's have all but a corner on the market at the time? Sure. Would people return if it was terrible? I would hope not.   As for the food, I am no student of Vietnamese cuisine, but the bun, or as it's billed here: \"grilled meat (why they don't just call it pork is a mystery, perhaps they're leaving their options open?) over vermicelli\" (pronounced \"ver-miss-eh-lee,\" by our esteemed host) is tasty and filling, as are the spring rolls. I can't comment on the pho as I have had too many inedible-mystery-tendon experiences at \"real\" Vietnamese restaurants in \"real\" cites to \"really\" be all that excited about the dish...   Long lives Tram's! Haters beware...."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled with good Vietnamese food but this was terrible. The chicken in the pho was a mixture of shredded white and dark meat, noodles were larger than normal, and basil was not fresh and the worst part was the flavorless broth. Also questionable tofu in the vegetarian spring rolls."}
{"text":"I love Tram's. If you get confused by the menu, just order the Chicken Vermicelli or the Beef Pho. Added bonus: It's perfect for hangovers.  The food is good. The owner can be stern. And if you are a picky eater, or like to do things your own way, you might want to get takeout--unless you don't mind being told that you're using the wrong sauce or not mixing up the vermicelli enough.   There is something exciting about trekking to a dingy little place with great food and an owner with a hook (which he, unfortunately, doesn't seem to wear anymore). Flavor all around."}
{"text":"Food: Tram's is one of the true hidden gems in Pittsburgh and serves The best Vietnamese food the city has to offer.  Fans of Vietnamese food surely know Tram's by now, but those who haven't tried yet need to.  The menu offers appetizers, meat, seafood, and vegetarian options.  But there's no reason to order anything but the Pho.  There are many options, but keep it simple.  Pho real.  It's unbelievably tasty and filling.  One bowl will have you stuffed, but if you have a massive appetite, the spring rolls are also huge and delicious.    Price: One person can gorge themselves with tip included for under $10.  The prices here are ridiculous considering the quality and quantity of the food being served.  If you're on a budget, this should be a regular stop.  It should be regardless.  Drinks: the Thai iced tea is good, all regular drinks are offered, no booze  Atmosphere: If Tram's was to be criticized in any way, surely this would be it. The dining room is almost but not quite dirty, and likely hasn't changed in 10+ years.  What some may see as a blemish others may view as character (me).  Hey it's Tram's Kitchen, and we're just eating there.  Wear a blindfold, you'll still taste the remarkable food.  Cash only.  Service: A waiter will be to your table with water before you even hit the seat, and another will be over for your order within 60 seconds.  Thats why you just order the pho.  There's no wasting time at Tram's.  Sit down, order, food comes quick, bill shortly after, eat, go home.  (+): Tram's is a can't miss restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The only way to miss it would be driving past it without realizing because its so small and indistinguishable on Penn Ave.  The food and price are unbeatable.  (-): Some may be slightly turned off by the atmosphere.  Would I go back again? Routinely."}
{"text":"Saigon Noodle Soup and Banana rice cake are my favorite here."}
{"text":"I go here as often as I can!!  I love it.  The Pho is the best in Pittsburgh and is always served with the correct sides ;-) The service is attentive without being overbearing and the prices are great! Stop reading and GO!!!!"}
{"text":"We, being fans of the 'hole-in-the-wall' places, we decided to hit this place up for Sunday lunch on a cold day. We got the Saigon soup and split rice. We loved the soup, but the pork and eggs on the rice dish were overdone. The spicy pepper condiment that was on the tables seemed freshly-made and was delicious and really perked up the rice dish. We'd definitely go back for soup."}
{"text":"Tram's is intimidating for the first-time visitor.  A hole-in-the-wall at its best, the decor is not the most stunning (watch for the changing plastic tablecloths), but the food is great.  The menu is small, but I doubt there's anything that isn't tasty.  I hear that the mixed fried rice is excellent, but I go for the beef pho, which is always good, even on a hot day."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and I grew up eating Vietnamese food everyday.  Let me tell you, this place is a big let down.  I don't know why people are giving it such rave reviews.  All my Viet friends in this city also avoid this place because it really is NOT good.    The portions are tiny, and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied.  It lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have.  I've had pho at home and in 30+ different pho restaurants and this was probably in my top 5 most disappointing.  As for the other dishes, it comes to the table looking like someone already ate it or like a jumbled mess.  This is aside from the service..I actually like the old man that works there...he's the only reason I give it two stars."}
{"text":"First of all, Tram's has been cited by the Allegheny Health Department for code violations like not storing meat at proper temperatures. I also personally know several people who have gotten violently ill from eating there. If that's not enough to stop you, read on.  I feel like people who like this place are confusing \"dirty & mean\" with authentic. The staff are unpleasant and it doesn't feel like a place you'd want someone cooking food.   And finally, sure, all of this could be different if the food was good, but in my opinion, it is not. Bland and disappointing, the Pho most of all. Pittsburgh has so many great asian restaurants, including other Vietnamese options, that I don't see any reason to eat here."}
{"text":"Average Vietnamese place. The menu was smaller than most other Vietnamese restaurants. I ordered the Sate soup which was low on soup and dryer than the other noodle soups. Pho was ok, but the broth tasted like it was flavored with mostly salt, not the kind that's simmered for 14+ hours. Pad thai wasn't very flavorful."}
{"text":"If you can get past its humble appearance, Tram's Kitchen has the best pho and fresh spring rolls in Pittsburgh.   The restaurant, which is owned and operated by a family of Vietnamese immigrants that left the old country in the early 1990s, is very down to earth and low key.  The service is primarily provided by Tram's father, who has one hand but somehow manages to seat, take your order, pour/refill your water, brings your food, clear the table and cash you out. He can be moody at times, but I have never found him to be rude even on a bad or busy day (he probably just doesn't have time for slowpokes who can't make up their mind). I would cut him some slack if he doesn't appear to be the most patient person in the world.   Parking in Lawrenceville can be iffy at times, but if you drive west a few blocks past Tram's there are usually many streetside spots. Cash only. BYOB."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a great price. I had a vegetarian spring roll and the vermicelli with coconut milk and chicken. Both were absolutely amazing, not too heavy and super fresh. It's put me off your run of the mill American chinese fare, this is the real Vietnamese deal. I'll definitely be going here again. The people who run it don't come off as overly friendly, but they're nice and the food is quick to come out."}
{"text":"Tram's Kitchen looks like a great dive on the outside, so we tried it out, hoping for a fully authentic flavor. However the pho was a bit too sweet and my noodles were heavy on the fish sauce.   Prices were high for the product and venue.   The service was lackluster but that's what I almost hope for at a Viet dive like this, so there is no dock for service."}
{"text":"First time here, mid afternoon so I had the place to myself. Given the condition of most oriental restaurants this one was spot on...more on that later.  Friendly staff, funky atmosphere and patina, good chow at dirt cheap prices. Since funky and offbeat doesn't normally have a negative effect on the food coming out of the back I don't ding them.  However, my trained nose picked up the odor of roach crap. Not strong, but there and it didn't make me bolt. Smell test is one of my criteria and usually I get a phone call and walk out, but I obviously gutted it out and was happy with the outcome. Use your own judgement. As for me I will return for the authenticity."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why this place has been rated as high as it is. But, we thought we'd give it a try. Being no stranger to Vietnamese cuisine I had pretty high expectations considering the overall rating. The spring rolls were most definitely not \"fresh\".. They were pre-made/assembled hence why they are so cold. As for the pho, it was good, but certainly not \"great\". Definitely authentic food here, but far from the best. Honestly, I would highly recommend Vietnam's Pho in the strip district. I might even go to say Vietnam's Pho could be one of the best. Tram's Kitchen in my opinion is not really worth it."}
{"text":"I had a friend recommend this place. Can't complain about the parking or seating, it's Bloomfield for crying out loud!   The food was take out quality. I loved my noodle and beef bowl with plenty of chili pepper added. ( can't begin to name it, began with a v and is at the bottom of the menu.) but the spring rolls were burnt to a crisp. I'm willing to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Talk about a hole in the wall. No frills at all here. One page paper menu with only a handful of dishes on it. Worth it for the pho and the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is one of the best secrets of Pittsburgh. By far the best Pho in the area and over many places I have visited. If you want good service & environment, you'd better stop here. It's a hole in the wall by a seemingly angry asian (he's actually quite nice). Expect to wait on water or wait on refills. If you make your order too complicated, it'll probably get messed up.  With that, the Pho. It's amazing and I've had a lot of Pho. However, it has it hit and miss days too. The meatball is more tender and flavorful than the beef which can be dry or tough to some that haven't had Pho before. I wouldn't recommend any other versions. A small is available as most Americans I bring here are unable to finish a bowl.  Spring rolls are great (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce. The egg rolls are just amazingly full of flavor (fried) with a fish style dipping sauce. Place is very inexpensive too. Oh, this place is BYOB in terms of alcohol. Forgot to mention it's cash only. There's an ATM at the entrance or any of the nearby gas stations."}
{"text":"I used to ignore the ambience , the service, run down look. But now even the food is not good anymore . With more options coming up in the area I doubt will go there any time soon. Sorry guys have to say it like it is now."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend with friends. Two of us became violently ill with food poisoning. Ordinarily, I would recommend the spring rolls and the pho, of course, but since my trip to the ER, I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Tram's has slipped a bit!  I went a few days ago, and their broth, which is normally super savory, was less so.  Still, I tried the spring rolls this time and they were freakin' good.  Still yummy, but no longer the best pho I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. It was delicious. The spring rolls and egg rolls are amazing. Really might the best of both of those that I've ever had.  The service definitely leaves something to be desired but it's not horrible and they're friendly there. They just kinda need help with their customer service. But the food is great and fast and not at all expensive so I can overlook bad/weird service. Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place. Every time I would want something very good and on the cheaper side I would come here. I would get the rice noodle soup with chicken every time. It tastes so good especially with lime juice and Thai basil. It is the candy of soups, or at least I think so. However, I went once and I must have felt too adventurous and ordered some type of noodle dish, I forget the name. The chicken looked pan seared but it was room temperature and the rest of the dish was cold, which did not mix well with the chicken. It was covered in a clear broth and lettuce was piled high. This could have been normal for the dish, but I just did not like it and the chicken weirded me out. I gave my leftovers to my boyfriend who said he enjoyed it...but I am pretty sure he will eat (almost) anything.   I gave this place 4 stars because the service is terrible. The food does come out quickly but if you have a question about the menu, forget it. The waiter either does not understand or does not care to answer. Also if you do not know what you want when the waiter gets to your table he seems upset/mad even though they could gave you 5 minutes to look over the menu. Once when I was there they made a large party of 5+ move tables once they were seated with their drinks to squeeze in a table for 2. That was definitely entertaining to watch, but it was just bad service in opinion.   Anyways, this place has the best  soup I tasted in Pittsburgh. Just make sure you know what you want when you get there and don't mind sitting in close proximity to other diners!   Oh and the spring rolls and peanut sauce are delicious and tastes fresh. mmmm...."}
{"text":"Great pho. Small, vegetarian friendly and not at all boring. Go to there!"}
{"text":"The fresh spring rolls are really great here -- simple, but very fresh tasting. Perfect for a hot summer day. (However, the shrimp and pork and shredded pork versions are better than the veggie, which is a bit heavy on the tofu.) We like the various bun (vermicelli) dishes and the noodle soups, as well, but haven't explored much else.   The owner / server is quite friendly, especially if you have a baby. The cash-only part is a little annoying, but on the other hand, the prices are very cheap."}
{"text":"Tram's is one of the few restaurants that I would say you must experience for yourself. The food is good, and sometimes great. But the atmosphere and service are as unique as it gets.  FYI, the owner is Mr. Lee, Tram is his daughter."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Pho is ok, not bad. The pork chop rice is horrible, worst Vietnam pork chop rice ever. I had tried PHO restaurant in NY, NJ, MD, VA, PA, and NV. This is the worst. I will never try it again."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh! Lots of vegetables, chicken, noodle, etc. Wonderful flavors, lots of food & all at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Side benefit:  cheap.  We got the pork chop split rice and the pork sate pho.  Both were good.  Service is prompt and efficient. Cash only."}
{"text":"The tablecloths change every season, cow print, leaves, retro stripe and um, that other one. I'll be honest, Tram is crabby, but it's charming, somehow. He always frowns at me but smiles at my girlfriend. I just assume he's homophobic, but I only think this because he watches \"Fox News.\" The tv is always on, but when you're seated, you can't really see it-- it's for Tram, situated just so he can watch it. The elementary school-style milk glasses are amazing and the perfect thing for the wine you should bring to eat with number 17, or the spicy peanut curry, or the saigon or sate soup. The fresh rolls are amazing. This is the best Vietnamese food I have ever had, in any major American city."}
{"text":"Awesome soups.  The place is kind of a dive, so to speak, but is really not all that dirty.  I family owns the place and serves some of the best Vietnamese food I have ever had.  Their spring rolls are a must, as is their Saigon soup.  This place is BYOB and no reservations are necessary.  Cash only place."}
{"text":"Kind of a hole in the wall. But it's authentic and the spring rolls are great; plus, when you order take-out they give you extra hot sauce and package everything separately, so nothing gets mushy on the way home.  Worth your while."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Pho. I normally get take out since I live in the area, but sitting here is quite an experience too. This is authentic Vietnamese food.   Highly recommend to anyone looking for some good Pho."}
{"text":"I had the fresh spring rolls and the pho, both are great.  Considering prices of all restaurants in Pitt, the prices here are very nice! For a large pho, it was $7-8. Spring rolls were $1.50 each.  Things to note: cash only  Also, you can get the pho with beef, chicken, or meatballs. You get a nice portion, but the pho does not include tripe, tendon, flank, and other random meats you'd normally get with your pho elsewhere.   Besides this, broth was excellent and portion/taste was great."}
{"text":"Why do so many people in Pittsburgh love this place? The other day someone asked me... where's your favourite Vietnamese food? I told them that I didn't know which was my favourite, but I could tell you which was my least favourite: Tram's.   I don't even care about the decor or seating etc. Usually the best Vietnamese comes from fairly sketchy looking joints.   I had their \"Special\" noodle bowl which is their version of Bun thit nuong. It looked a mess. The spring rolls were cut up brutally and then everything was tossed in. Usually when you order this at other place, it doesn't come \"pre-mixed.\" Honestly, it looked like someone had already starting eating this. I thought to myself... \"Okay they have a different presentation style.\"   But as I ate, I was even more disappointed. They hardly put any fresh vegetables in it, and the vermicelli is overcooked. The spring rolls were completely soggy.   I don't think their menu is limited though, it seemed fairly typical. I don't know, maybe their Pho is better, but I'm already too disappointed to come back.  After reading other people's reviews and trying other Vietnamese places around the city and then having Vietnamese food in Toronto(at an average place), I'm throughly convinced that people in this city have no idea what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.  Oh and one last thing... do you actually believe that their food is vegetarian? I guess the joke's on you."}
{"text":"1.5 / 5 - Beef Pho: Kind of bland tasting 2.0 / 5 - Pork Chop: Not much meat and as much flavor as I'm used to, but still good."}
{"text":"Was taken here by friends who raved about the food. I wish I enjoyed it more as Vietnamese is my favorite ethnic cuisine. Had the Saigon soup. Wife had a chicken curry dish. The noodles in the soup were hard - that is undercooked. The broth was just so so. The curry dish was oily and the chicken dry. The cold spring rolls were the only decent thing we had - they tasted very fresh.  The peanut sauce served with them was mediocre. Maybe it was an off night for them. Coughing from the kitchen staff does not inspire confidence in the food either."}
{"text":"Pho is good but its not best pho or egg rolls (they don't even serve it with the lettuce and herbs) you can get in Pittsburgh. On the flip side though, their owner is super friendly"}
{"text":"For the price and the taste, i give it 5 stars. It's not the best, but good enough. What's better than a bowl of hot pho soup in the chill snowy winter days? Nothing!"}
{"text":"Located in Lawrenceville, Trams is a BYOB, cash-only operation. The restaurant is unassuming and actually rather on the dingy side. I didn't expect much in the way of atmosphere, but I could've done without the grease splatters in the wall. The service was prompt and efficient, if lacking in any charm. We sampled the veggie spring rolls (fabulous!), the lemongrass tofu (meh!  Boring and lacking), the tofu curry (pretty good), and the Pho, which was my favorite dish and was excellent."}
{"text":"Tram has great Pho, and enough of it to feed all of Pittsburgh when the next fake Armageddon rolls around."}
{"text":"Their best menu items: Split fried rice (any fried rice), Spring Rolls, Egg rolls, and their Thai Iced Tea . The pho is alright, but I think Vietnam's Pho in the Strip has a more flavorful broth.   I would also recommend that you clarify what size dish you order because they automatically serve you the larger portion so they can charge you more."}
{"text":"should've come back for its desert. When we arrived they only had banana cake with coconut milk. You can't miss pho and spring rolls here."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese, worse viet food ever! Beware, I don't know how they are surviving here in Pittsburgh . One of our soups looked like it was curry and its suppose to be a clear soup. Please save yourself the trouble, I'm really surprised with the 4 stars."}
{"text":"They have the best Pho (I get the vegetarian version), vegetarian spring rolls and tofu w lemongrass. Those are the only things I order there bc they are so delicious I can't bare to order anything else.  It's not the best atmosphere, but the food is delicious.. and that's what you go to a restaurant for!!"}
{"text":"excellent food - and i love that there are so many vegetarian/pescatarian options."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Took me back to my days in Saigon.  This is literally a mom and pop shop so the service is great."}
{"text":"This is one of my first stops whenever I return to Pittsburgh.   I always gets the vegetarian spring rolls and a spicy, sate, vegetarian pho.   Wow.  So good.     The spring rolls travel well (for short periods of time) and are perfect for a picnic.  If you show up at a friend's door with a package of Tram's spring rolls, you will unquestionably make their day.     The pho is great for take out if you are feeling a little under the weather.   They will package it up for you with the ingredients nicely separated, so that nothing gets soggy in transit.     Tram's is cash only.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Waited about 40 min and still haven't got our orders of pho. There were only 2 of us and 4 other tables around 2pm. Usually it takes about 15 min to get my food in most of my pho restaurant experience. Also, the pho here is bland, noodle over-cooked and not much meat in it. The food is not worth the drive and the wait."}
{"text":"On my first visit to Pittsburgh after moving back to PA, an old friend and I stopped in at Tram's because he said it was the \"known\" Vietnamese place in Pittsburgh. I was underwhelmed. I enjoyed it enough. I should say I am not a Pho girl (I do like it), but rather a Bun Thit Nuong girl. It didn't have the rich, savory body I'm used to. No doubt, Phoenix and California have robust enough populations of Vietnamese folks to create stiff competition, and the places I frequented there put me over-the-moon. I spied another Vietnamese restaurant just a few blocks down the street. I'd like to give it a go-round next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember it being the first couple of time I've been here so I think I will try a different Vietnamese place next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Still good though."}
{"text":"Oh man... I wish I still lived in PGH. I really miss this place. Food was ALWAYS awesome. I liked their Banana dessert too!!"}
{"text":"Tram's might look like a dive, but don't let that deter you.  The food is tasty and comes in large portions at reasonable prices.  I came in on a Wednesday for a late lunch/early dinner, so it wasn't too busy.  I had the Egg Rolls ($3.90 - They are $1.95 each, but you must order at least two.) and the Pho Hanoi Soup with beef ($8.95).  While the egg rolls were crispy and tasty, they really weren't anything special.  However, the pho was delicious!  A large portion (I had plenty left to take home for another meal!) of delicious, flavorful broth with good noodles and thinly sliced beef.  If you're in the Pittsburgh area and having a craving for pho, this is the place to go.  This place is CASH ONLY so come prepared (or use the ATM at the door).  The service was pretty hands-off, but the staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!!! Due to work being called off because of loss of electricity I thought i would take this opportunity to venture to Trams.  When i arrived i was the first and only one there.  I was expecting to see many different types of PHO on the menu, but there was only one line with PHO on it.  This made it easier for me to make my decision even though the vermicelli bowls were tempting.  I also ordered two spring rolls.   The spring rolls came out and they were much bigger than i was expecting.  They tasted fresh, crunchy and filled with goodness such as shrimp, pork, noodles, and herbs.  I dipped them in a chili sauce as well as a brown sauce to complete this delicious experience.  The only negative of my meal was I ordered chicken and shrimp pho and ended up getting Beef pho.  I am guessing i confused the server/owner while i was ordering.   I didn't bother to complain since i figured he wouldn't understand anyways, so i began to consume my pho.  Every aspect of the dish was perfect from the noodles, to the beef to the sprouts that I got to dunk in every so often.  My meal ended up costing $14 without tip and was worth every penny.  By the time I left every table was filled.  Cant wait for our next February Tropical Storm."}
{"text":"Great Pho. Go here for fresh soul warming food with unique flavor."}
{"text":"We ordered Com tam, pho and spring rolls. The food was amazing. This place is literally a hole in the wall. I was not expecting stellar service but reading the reviews online, I was certain this place would be a gem. Its small, cluttered and the decor is what you would expect from a hole in the wall. I didn't come here for their amazing bathrooms or pretty displays, though. It was 13 degrees outside...I wanted some pho!  The com tam came with a big pork chop, two fried eggs, some veggies and some sliced pork. It came with a nuoc cham (dipping sauce) that my girlfriend loved! After she ate all of I told her it was made with fish sauce but she still loved it.  The pho was some of the best I have ever had! The broth was fragrant and subtle. There was tons of meat in the dish, too. They only had three  types of pho, which was disappointing. But it was simply delicious. The brought over the condiments and veggies. The only thing they did wrong was not bring the sliced chili peppers along with the soup. After a generous portion of chili oil, my soup still needed some bite. I asked the employee for chili and he brought it immediately.  The spring rolls were awesome, too. They were smaller than other places we've been but they had a ton of shredded pork in them. I actually like the smaller size anyway because they were easier to eat.  I'm not a vegetarian but they had a vegetarian menu that was just as large as the regular menu.  Finally, the price was right. Everything was about 20% cheaper than other Vietnamese restaurants we've been to. I would have liked more selection of the types of meat in the pho, but the one I had was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall place is just fantastic. I can never resist the spring rolls and often ask for extra dipping sauce. If you want something tastes but aren't feeling adventurous, go for the chicken curry - I have never been let down. Other great dishes include the vermicelli and their version of a pad Thai."}
{"text":"We live two doors down and this is our jam. It satisfies my pho desires in a major way. Every day we see them in the backyard garden getting fresh veggies for the evening. Don't mind the one armed owner. He knows his food is good so he can be mean. It is cash only but there is an ATM in the front."}
{"text":"This place has been reviewed a lot, obviously, so I'll keep it short and sweet with a list.  Pros: The vegetarian Pho is amazing. I will only have eyes for it when I go there, and maybe a fresh veggie spring roll. Unlike two of the other reviewers who had some sour grapes over their experience, I have multiple resources that the veggie Pho broth is vegan. Cheap. Huge bowl of Pho with fresh veggies and a drink for under $10.   Cons: Parking in this neighborhood is a racket and restaurant doesn't have a lot.  Good to know: No credit. Take cash, or use the ATM in the vestibule. Atmosphere is hole-in-the-wall. If you can't cope with that, get takeout or don't go."}
{"text":"Really good food here, I ordered the beef pho and my friend ordered Pork noodle soup.  The food came out really quick, but we're a bit disappointed that the basil wasn't fresh, it was wilted with a couple fresh leaves mixed in.   Then in the middle of our meal, this guy came up and placed the check right on top of the plate where I had mixed some sauce for my beef. I'm pretty sure they don't clean the check tray frequently, definitely don't appreciate that.  Also a bit disappointed that they don't have beef meat balls or tribe. But overall, my friend really enjoy his pork noodle soup and mine tasted great as well."}
{"text":"I love pho. I visited many pho restaurants all over the nation. Honestly, pho and fried rice here are below average. The serving size is small as well. I am disappointed."}
{"text":"we like Tram's food and were disappointed today to find a hand written sign on the door that the restaurant was closed for 3 days, with a reference to a problem with the Health Department."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Pho in Pittsburgh Tram's Kitchen is the place to go.  The broth for their pho is quite flavorful and you can't go wrong ordering a bowl of it on a nice cold day."}
{"text":"awesome vermicelli with coconut milk. if i lived around here i would eat at tram's every day. actually, i live in san francisco, which (obviously) has excellent restaurants, many of them vietnamese. i would put tram's up against any of them, any day of the week."}
{"text":"stop 4 on our 7 state pho tour - and everything else you read is true.  my thoughts were like this... small, border line clean, authentic, no tripe?, took forever to get food on the table, excellent pho, nice little place."}
{"text":"Lightning fast service. Great flavors. Good size servings. Affordable. Get in get it in ya and get yinz out."}
{"text":"I only had Pho so I can't judge the rest of the food, but the Pho was the worst I've ever had. Biggest let down ever, as I drove here once and it was closed and came back excited to get my fill of Pho at what's apparently the best place in Pittsburgh, but  left feeling sad. The broth tasted like water, and amount of beef and noodles you get was pathetic."}
{"text":"This was my first Vietnamese food experience, and it won't be my last. This place is nothing fancy in terms of decor, the service is quick with little conversation, it's affordable and it's BYOB! I had the meatball pho and two orders of spring rolls. Thought they both were excellent. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Another fine Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their dessert, Banana Cake,  is the best Vietnamese dessert."}
{"text":"Pho is nice with rich soup. However, the soup is too sweet and the \"Fresh spring roll\" was served cold, probably taken out of the fridge right after the order."}
{"text":"I didn't care too much for the atmosphere because most hole in the wall sort of restaurant are authentic & non-Americanized (which is what I'm looking for).  Location of the restaurant was in a run down (kind of Old Pittsburgh style) and parallel parking was a must, be aware that you may have to park far and walk to the restaurant if you're not able to get front door service.  Inside I didn't expect much, tablecloths were vinyl and chairs with uneven stands.  All I care about was the authenticity of the food & cost for what it's worth.  I started my meal with an appetizer of Goi Cuon with shrimp.  I was highly disappointing when disecting what was in it.  There was 1 shrimp cut in half lengthwise, mainly bun (rice noodle) for fillers along with a few strands of beansprouts & lettuce to make it look presentable.  I quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in 2 bites.  My main entree was Pho Ha Noi.  It took forever for the food to arrive, it was a big bowl.  Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless, actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself, Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm, why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).  Ok I may be young but I wasnt born yesterday, I think I know my pho noodle and sorry it wasn't.    Next visit to the 'burgh, I think I'll try Pho Minh & see how their PHO compares to Tram's Kitchen.  So HIGHLY disappointed with my Pho experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic pho! I've tried a few other items on the menu as well (all delicious) but I almost always order beef pho. It's satisfying, filling, and comforting. They have the best in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"the food is pretty subpar in terms of quality and authenticity. i've gotten the pho and it's alright--nothing spectacular--just okay, on one occasion, my boyfriend got food poisoning from the pho. it's also a bit annoying that they don't let you pick the cuts of meats you want. their broken rice portion is quite small and not very good. it's supposed to be served with a pork chop, but the pork chop is just a few slices of pork. it doesn't come with a bowl of soup the way broken rice is traditionally served. cash only + they also gave us the wrong change."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and wanted some Vietnamese so we stopped by here expecting to find the best pho in Pittsburgh.   The restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant. The menu is small with very limited choices. Service is minimal.   We ordered some spring roll appetizer which was pretty good. Then we had 3 different kind of pho for our main entree. We ordered a \"sate\" soup, a Saigon soup and a pho Hanoi soup. Only decent one was the pho Hanoi soup which isn't really like the typical pho. No beef tripe, tendon or beef balls in the soup and the noodles are fatter then what you'd find in typical pho. There was also excessive MSG in the soup dishes."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The Pho is served on very large bowls (that is just the small).  The food has the same quality and taste and for some dishes even better taste than those trendy Vietnamese restaurants in NYC. The fresh veggie spring rolls are def the best way to kick off a meal. This is a small , family run place tucked away near children's hospital- but it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Tram's was in June of 2015. I ordered fresh spring rolls and vermicelli and waited for 45 mins while other people (who came in after me) ordered and received their food before me. I almost walked out, but waited a few more minutes only to receive my order and chow down on the best Vietnamese food I've ever had.  Tram's is no joke. The fresh springs rolls come in orders of 2 with a ginger sauce and you can get tofu or shrimp, both are excellent. They're my favorite spring rolls in Pittsburgh, and after trying one you may agree too. The vermicelli (with pork) is my go-to entree. Noodles with been sprouts and coconut milk below a good portion of pork. Absolutely delicious.   On top of it all, the owners and operators are very personable and easy to talk to. Sometimes they'll crack a joke or tell you an interesting story, either way Tram's will leave you smiling!"}
{"text":"Good place to find Pho in Pittsburgh, Pho-real!  It's messy/dirty.  That doesn't bother me.  I've had better Pho.  I've had better service.  But it's not horrible.  And I would definately eat there again!"}
{"text":"After meeting two people who claim Tram's Kitchen to be their favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh, you know a place has to be good, right? Tram's Kitchen truly encompasses an authentic Vietnamese home, with the cheap plastic table cloths and Asian black art hanging on the walls.  We ordered the fresh spring rolls, vermicelli with coconut milk, and vermicelli with a mix of meats. A quick disclaimer: I grew up eating Vietnamese food so I have pretty high standards as far as Vietnamese food goes. So the food didn't really compare to what I'm used to at home. However, it was still pretty darn tasty. In fact, I now know three people who claim Tram's to be their favorite Vietnamese restaurant, the new addition being my husband. The food was fresh and flavorful, and the service was quick. I really felt a sense of family here too, oddly. Maybe it's because it reminded me of being at home.   Considering my husband is now obsessed with Tram's Kitchen, it's likely I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the food here. I can't blame the place as I am just not a fan of this kind of food. Quick service, folks were friendly."}
{"text":"Spring rolls with dipping sauce. Huge bowl of pho, with plenty of chicken (or beef; I've gotten that before too), crisp and flavorful veggies, with basil and bean sprouts and lime for you to put on top. Very, very filling, fast service (when avoiding busiest hours), no complaints."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is fantastic, and I'm happy that's where they spend their money. I don't need Tram's to be impressive in its appearance because I realize it has been and always will be a family run restaurant. It's about the food, and the food here nails it every visit.   I've read reviews commenting on the service, which there is some truth to the level of character presented in the service. Speaking of which, don't stare at Tram, I'm sure he's well aware of the fact that he's missing an arm. Does that get in the way of the delicious food? Not one bit. Don't think that he doesn't understand you either, don't be ignorant. I just heard a woman almost yelling at him.   The food is great, just try something that sounds good to you. The decor will fade from your mind as you and your companion(s) get a taste of Vietnam in Pittsburgh. Try the fresh spring rolls, better than the egg rolls. I also recommend the vermicelli and coconut milk with shrimp. The pho, curry, and mung bean noodle soup are also wonderful. At the price point of Tram's you can eat here often and eventually try everything.   Oh yeah. It's cash only. That makes me like it even more. No separate checks!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this place has the whole soup nazi feel. You get a little rushed when they are busy, and I get the feeling that the guy gets a little pissed if you take too long to decide. That being said, the food is awesome (if you can forget about the little food inspection mishap), the waiter has mad skillz, and if it's not busy he is also pretty cool to talk to. I say go, but be prepared and know what you want in advance, especially if you get flustered by being yelled at to hurry up..."}
{"text":"great place.  great food.  perfect spice level and it doesn't interfere with the flavor.  had an everything bowl with vermicelli and some egg rolls.  very good.  quick for lunch too.   excellent pricing.  cant wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"The pho is really great, but not made on the traditional sense. The split rice entrée is also delicious. The owner, Tram, is very personable. You can tell he cares about this business. That it's a part of his family."}
{"text":"Great food, and I mean great food for anywhere in America. Pittsburgh has plenty of sketchy and low quality restaurants, but this is not one of them. Authentic and simple food that always tastes great."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in Pittsburgh. The quality of the food in amazing. The service is, as most places with delicious food, not incredible. I don't let that bother me, as the food is worth a drive. I love the chicken pho, and also the curry vermicelli. I enjoy a Vietnamese coffee on occasion, and have sampled most everything on the relatively small menu. Many plates of spring rolls and fresh rolls have passed through my lips, and as I type this I honestly don't know why I am not there right now. In fact, I tried to go there today, but unfortunately they're closed Mondays. Bring cash!"}
{"text":"Love the Hanoi Pho and spring roll. Nice plump shrimp too. Do yourself a favor...it's far from a fashion spot, just real good eats. Reminds of what SF's Tenderloin excellent Cambodian and Vietnamese were back before everything cost an arm n a leg."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had in ten years.  I want to try something else at Tram's, but I can't help but order pho every time I'm in there.  I agree with other reviewers: they could definitely add slightly more \"fixin's\" for the pho (can you tell I'm Southern?), and the fixin's could be a little fresher, but the pho itself is excellent.  The spring rolls are excellent, too.  I just wish they served 33 beer to go with it all.    Service is good, if a bit gruff.  Don't screw around chit-chatting at the table when you come in; you need to be ready to order when the waiter (Tram?) gets to you.  Failure to do so will expose you to his withering scorn.  (Seriously, he'll hang out, staring at you, until you make up your mind.)    Price is right, too.  With spring rolls and an entree, you'll get out of here for under $10/person."}
{"text":"Tram's has the best egg rolls and spring rolls, hands down!  Their pho is perfect for cold weather."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh isnt a city known for its culinary prowess, but there are little gems around town that I can always find myself going back to. Its not about amazing food, its not about cheap food, its about good value, and thats what Trams is. Their spring rolls might not be something to write home about, but the coconut vermicelli is great, and something you are seldom to find elsewhere, in fact, i havent ever had that anywhere else in my american dining experiences. vietnamese coffee is like intense dessert here, and a nice sugary-caffeinated pick me up thats not unwelcomed. Go to trams! get some noodles n'at!"}
{"text":"Dirty and cheap place for a Sunday morning hang over. Its nothing spectacular, but beef soup always hits the spot.  Your typical pho place."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more stars but the food at Pho Van is so much better. Tram's Kitchen tastes like home cooking, and it also feels like home with the owner's kids running around.   But the bun thit nuong (pork vermicelli) was pretty sub-par, even with my already low expectations for a Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh (we're Vietnamese from Cali so our expectations are usually really high!). The pork was so dry and tough it was inedible for me (though the bf ate all of his). The egg rolls were okay but just not the kind I'd sell at a restaurant. The spring rolls were edible yet I have to say the worst I've had (even I make way better ones).   The waiter/owner(?) is really sweet, and I feel a bit guilty for not supporting the restaurant but I'm sure those that love this place will keep it going strong. I'll try this place once more and hope to give it a better review next time!"}
{"text":"Go for the food quality, they said. The one-armed unintelligible waiter isn't that bad, they said.  Well. Turns out this wasn't the case. So the decor and vibe and all other aspects of the establishment besides price are awful, but amazing viet food makes up for it. Right? I've been three times. Each time I tell myself else isn't. Idk if I care any more. Rushed dining experience, meh atmosphere, wobbly furniture, slow service, no English, messed up bills, good prices though, and decently tasty food (yet not much different than other viet food I've had)."}
{"text":"Location:4050 Penn Ave Pittsburgh Price: $ 1/2 Service: Good  My family was really hungry and everywhere my parents visit they always want to try native food. So, I search Viet restaurant on the GPS and it lead us there- I mean if it was apart of the GPS' top 10 it must be good. I feel like being Vietnamese made me more critical on the food when I do go to Vietnamese restaurants.   It is in a residental neighbourhood downtown.You're able to park along the streets. It was a very humble environment and very cute. The service was okay, they were really nice and never rude.   We ordered Pho (of course...), com tam, pad thai, and bun. It all tasted plain;the Pho was a little off, the pad thai wasn't spicy or had enough of the sweet/sour taste to it. The portions were really small. I definitely feel like my GPS lied to me and that I've experienced better."}
{"text":"My favorite pho resturant in town the fresh rolls are great the pho is very tasty.  The prices are good and the food is great."}
{"text":"I was born and raised eating Pho and this honestly was the blandest I've had. Then, to mask the bland no taste of the soup, it was smothered in black pepper. On top of that, my meatballs were quite dry, even in soup.  However, their spring rolls were great!  The service, was not the best. We were seated and then grunted at (literally) to take our order. From there, people who were seated after us, had their food before we did. They had a very similar order to ours. Then, when I did receive my food, the man hovered near me and then started pouring sauce onto my plate, telling me how to make my pho. I know how to make it! And even if I did need help, I was barely just given my bowl and getting my bean sprouts in first. Give me a second.  I had high hopes based on the reviews, but unfortunately, I don't see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"I don't see the hype. Bad service, bland food."}
{"text":"Embrace the quirkiness of this place and you may just fall in love with it. Food is good, I always get one of their soups. Its nice that they recently cleaned up a little, repainted and all. cash only, but ATM in the front. nice insider tip for ppl from out of town."}
{"text":"Given the wide array of chinese, thai, vietnamese, etc. food throughout Pittsburgh, Tram's Kitchen falls somewhere in the middle.  The wife and I decided to stop by before an Unblurred Friday on Penn Avenue.  At around 5:30-6pm on a Friday, the place was pretty slow, but that didn't last very long.  By 7pm there was a line of people waiting to get in (there isn't a waiting area, so it seemed most people just waited outside until a table would leave).  We decided on spring rolls, pho and the highly regarded pork noodles.  Spring rolls - these were the star of the show.  Plump, crisp and plenty of flavor.  Pho - the broth itself was some of the best we've had in Pittsburgh, but the rest of the soup really didn't live up to the same standard  Pork noodles - not too bad...  the pork was great, but there was barely any of it on top of the noodles (maybe a better portion would have changed our thoughts)  The owners seemed nice and a bit overworked due to the crowd.  Overall, we're definitely glad we tried it, but I can't see us going back."}
{"text":"It's been said that you should never eat Chinese Food in Arkansas and never, EVER eat Cambodian food if it's right next door to a veterinary hospital.  I can say with certainty, though, that eating Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh is as healthy and delicious (and remarkably similar to) eating it anywhere else."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a four and a half star rating for authentic delicious pho and spring rolls & the wonderful vegan selections, however waiting 40 mins for the meal as well as our water never being refilled brings my rating down. If you're not seriously hungry or in a hurry, you may fare a bit better. Always feel as though I'm dining in someone's living room, here. Quaint little Viet eatery."}
{"text":"It might be a \"hole-in-the-wall,\" but it's a pretty nice hole with some decent looking walls and amazing food.  Tram's has, arguably (though it might not be much of an argument), some of the best tasting food in Pittsburgh, period.  An instant bonus star for being extremely vegetarian friendly.    My date and I split tofu spring rolls which were fresh, delicious and went well with the peanut based sauce provided.  For the main course I had tofu vermicelli which was by far the best item of food I've had since I've moved to this city.  With generous amounts of tofu, vermicelli and whatever coconut based heavenly sauce they put in it, it's hard not to finish an entire bowl.  Throw in some Sriracha and garlic hot sauce and It's almost too good to be true.   For desert we split an order of \"banana cake,\" which sounds kind of stupid, but is actually incredible.  I have no idea what they put in it--maybe a rice based cake, with some beans cooked in, topped with coconut banana cream with sesame seed garnishing?  Really though, who cares?  You just accept it for what it is and eat because it's delicious.  All of this food for two people with prompt service for $25.  How could you not give this place 5 stars?  A big shout out to Tram too.  I think he's the dude with with amputated arm. He's the man.    Don't' come here dressed to the nines, expecting a ritzy meal.  Do come here for great food in a casual, yet clean and hospitable environment.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We (husband and two kids) went here a few years back and it was much cleaner and the food was fresher.  Last week, we made a special trip (to celebrate the adoption of our children) into Pittsburgh to eat at Tram's and found the plastic table cloths to be sticky, torn and grey, the room was smaller and cramped with more tables and fewer people.  The food was terrible.  We specifically said we wanted vegetarian Pad Thai, and after a few bites, not only could I taste the fish and other ocean creatures, but there were small fish tails in my food.  I almost threw up.  It's disrespectful to ignore someone's simple request.  Oh, and for those of you being snarky toward my review for ordering 'Thai food' at a Vietnamese restaurant, perhaps you should ask why there is Thai food AT a Vietnamese restaurant in the first place...I didn't write the menu.  We used to hold vegetarian meet-ups here, but we will NOT be returning to this place ever again."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty, filling.  We tried the pho, spring rolls, and lemongrass chicken; all were well worth ordering again.  This was, however, my first Vietnamese meal, so my thoughts are necessarily less discerning.    The owner is indeed a character, and he more or less ordered for one of us.  Luckily, we're pretty easy going, and generally happy to take a proprietor's advice on what's good.  He struck me as amusing and endearing rather than abrasive.  The place was packed, though we went at 7 on a Friday.  Given this and the fact that they take no reservations, it'd probably be a hassle to go there with parties larger than 4."}
{"text":"Previous reviewers were not lying when they said the service wasn't the warmest and the atmosphere isn't the prettiest or cleanest...but regardless, their food makes up for it.  My boyfriend and I are on mission to complete a list of trying different culture restaurants around the city and Tram's was our first stop.  We tried the spring rolls, egg rolls and Pho.  Everything seemed very fresh and well-seasoned.  I was a fan of the eggrolls over spring rolls, but I can't complain about anything we had.  I loved the Pho - I think it had a great tasting broth and was served with a ton of sprouts, lime and fixings.  I have a feeling this place is going to be somewhere I crave."}
{"text":"I again had the spicy prawns but this time I noticed the chili sauce tasted a lot like ketchup. I am not a fan of ketchup but hell I can understand using it as a base for a chili sauce it just doesn't set well with me for Vietnamese food but I guess I can undertand it for Pittsburgh Vietnamese...it make sense.  I like this resturant , but forgot it was cash only and I swear the owner blocked my way from the exit while I withdrew cash from the atm...Yeah I didn't like that feeling too much.   Yes I would dine here agian in fact  I plan on doing so tomorrow evening, but I'll make sure I have cash on hand so as not to be made to feel like some sort of sneak thief!"}
{"text":"If I could eat here every day I would. The fried wontons have a really good sauce on them, the fresh spring rolls are awesome, the pho is amazing and will bring you back to life after the worst hangover. I go back and forth between the beef and veggie. The service is quick, food comes out really fast. Despite all the other reviews the staff is really friendly they're just not going to fuss over you."}
{"text":"Came here with a group and ended up ordering the regular size Pho Hanoi along with beef as the dish's meat. Was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful the broth was. It's definitely one of the better tasting pho broths that I've had in pho around Pittsburgh. Noodles were alright, what one would expect in a dish like this. Not too floury, but also not too thin (to the point of falling apart). The pho also came along with a dish of bean sprouts and basil. I mostly used the bean sprouts, which came fresh. In general, I found it to be relatively satisfying. I'll have to come back sometime to try some of their other offerings, but so far a good first impression certainly helps."}
{"text":"Torn between 3 and 4 stars. This place is delicious. The menu is short and simple, but has all the basic and most sort-after Vietnamese dishes.   The \"large\" pho bowl is not quite enough to fill me up. And if anything, I'm a smaller eater than average. I also went the other day craving for a mixed beef noodle bowl.. you know, one of those all-in-one kinds with meatballs, meat slices, tripe, tendons, etc. But no, they don't do those.  The price is unbeatable though. Service is fast and I've always had a good time. As other reviews have mentioned, it is cash only."}
{"text":"A great mom and pop hole in the wall. Very busy location. Parking is a little difficult due too the small streets."}
{"text":"Is it me, or is Tram's changing - and not in a good way?   My husband and I have been going there for many years. We typically order the same thing - fresh spring rolls and sate soup - because they are so good.  Lately, the spring rolls taste as if they were made a day or so earlier, and they are loaded with dried out dark meat chicken(?), rather than the shrimp and veggies of the past.  Service is less than friendly.  The entire restaurant could use a thorough cleaning. What has happened???"}
{"text":"Great service (the server was funny and patience) and wonderful food. It's. It's not too hard to find parking around the restaurant since it's not on the main road. I had their Pho and it was delicious. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Tram's is delish. Found out about this spot from yelp, thanks yelp!  Service was quick, got waters as soon as we sat and asked to order a minute later. I ordered the vermicelli cocoanut combo plate. When it came I was surprised there wasn't more sauce. Came with 3 shrimp tails on and what seemed like very shredded boots of pork with little like brittle straw crunchy things, and then smaller pieces of chicken and peanuts. It was delicious. Great flavor, sweet. Added a bit of heat and it was so good. Glad to know that Pittsburgh has a good Vietnamese place nearby. Definitely recommend. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"pro: really, really good food.  cons: shared tables.  crowded.  hipsters."}
{"text":"I've been to Tram's Kitchen a few times with friends and I hear good things from people about this place.  Personally, I don't see what is so special about it.  It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also, I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big, but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.    That said, the service is nice.  However, I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).  I prefer dining at Pho Minh to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is still around? Clicking here on Yelp brings back old memories from the early 90's when I frequented the place while still living in the 'burgh. My hometown. Sheesh time flies!  (We used to dread politely asking for foe and having to repeat it over and over until they understood what we meant and then they'd SCREAM, FUH! oh, you want FUH! FUUUUHHHH!, cringe, LOL!)."}
{"text":"the pho was good, but not great.  i got the meatball pho just because you don't see that everyday, and the meatballs and broth were excellent.  the problem i had was with the noodles. they use thin clear noodles that break apart when you go at them with the chopsticks. if they switched up the noodles to something thicker, the pho would be right on with amazing pho i have had in nyc.  the service could have also been better - not because of the language barrier, but in attentiveness.  so good not great - but will go back."}
{"text":"The spring rolls are out of this world. The pho is good. We went for lunch and had no problem getting a seat. Cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"The food is really as good as it gets for Vietnamese cuisine. Their soups are very flavorful."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in Pittsburgh hands down, and I've been to all of them several times."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here on the 3rd of July. Still dreaming about the Pho from this place.  Not the greatest part of town, but well worth the risk in my opinion for the goi cuon and Pho. By no means do I claim to know everything about Vietnamese cuisine or even anything more than a 'fan,' this is one place that when I make the 100+ mile trip to Pittsburgh, I will definitely stop to make sure I visit. Even if it's just for something to take home (Nothing beats cold Pho to cure a hang-over)."}
{"text":"One day along time ago I moved from Los Angeles where there is Pho as far as the eye could see to Pittsburgh where selection is very limited. I found this place yelp first day in pittsburgh and since then has completely redefined what Pho is suppose to taste like. I ate here easily twice a week, keeping it simple with pho and fresh spring rolls.  This place gets a bad rap for having a hole in the wall vibe. Most of the best places have this look and feel! Open minded people who have a taste for more then just meat and potatoes will love this place."}
{"text":"Oh Tram's, due to its close proximity to my place, I must resist the urge to come here too often. It's really that good. I've had the vermicelli curry, the pho hanoi soup, the saigon soup - I've never had a bad meal here.  As noted by others - cash only. The restaurant itself is simple and no frills. Service is fast and no frills. Come in, order, eat, say thank you and leave. I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"Feels like a family diner, complete with shouting matches in the kitchen. Food simple and reliably good - best pho broth in city."}
{"text":"What an awesome little place! My friend and I used to go here for lunch often in the 1990s, and we went today in 2015 for a little reunion lunch! It's terrific! Awesome pho and awesome fresh spring rolls! Definitely deserves its numerous awards!!!!!"}
{"text":"I feel so sad having to bump my review of Tram's down, considering I've been going there for years. However, recently, they underwent a closure for health code violations and the food has not been the same since. A few co-workers of mine got food poisoning there prior to the closure. After it reopened, I went back and the food was very lackluster. The spring rolls were still my favorite in town, but the Pho was mighty disappointing. I hope it improves."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the place. It's definitely a neighborhood place and appreciated that vibe. I ordered the mung bean noddle soup with beef. Instead, I got one with chicken. I didn't notice until I started to eat (sheer hunger), so I let it go. I can eat chicken, no fret. The broth was good, with a hint of sweetness. The portion for the price ($8.95) was very reasonable. I got the check, but no one came to break the change (cash only). I did some digging and found smaller bills. It's hard to assess as I'm sure they don't see many solo eaters."}
{"text":"love the pho and spring rolls !!! the best vietonamese restaurant !! i"}
{"text":"I have had Vietnamese food in Boston, DC, SF, Chicago, and Pittsburgh.  The Pho here is certainly on a par with the other places that I have sampled.  What sets Tram's apart for me are 2 things.  1.  The spicy prawn is really different.  I am not sure what it is that gives it its unique flavor and appeal but I have never had anything like it.  2.  The spring rolls are absolutely amazing.  I know that the spring rolls should technically be very basic--the ingredients are generally well understood etc, there are no real secrets etc.  For whatever reason, these are the best springs I have ever had."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the service isn't the best at Tram's.  It was my first time back in several years. I recalled it being a divey type place with meh service and excellent food. My memory served me right. We were welcomed with bright blue vinyl cupcake tablecloths on all of the tables. Heh.  My sister and I hadn't been sitting for more than 30 seconds when the waiter asked what we wanted. I said we needed a minute, but he came back 15 seconds later and hounded us again. It was lunch rush, sure, but there were plenty of open tables. I didn't understand the urgency if there wasn't a line going out the door.  I hastily made a decision of pho while my sister got a dish he suggested, the curry chicken. Both dishes were great. I am not normally a curry fan, but the curry flavor was dulled with coconut milk. And the pho made excellent comfort food. Spring rolls are also awesome, although I prefer veggie over the regular pork ones.  Oh, and it's cash only. Ugh.  So yeah, there are some drawbacks, but probably one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"For 11 am on a Saturday morning, the teeming scene down on the Strip District, where the Internet had guided us tourists and where we first sought out an early casual lunch, seemed crowded and chaotic.  We jumped back on Liberty Avenue and kept heading northeast.  A few minutes later the wife's phone pulled up Tram's.  We parked right in front, and in we went, because I'll eat Vietnamese food, and especially pho, at the drop of a hat (and the wife will do so with not too much more prompting).    Tram's was a pleasant surprise.  For a Vietnamese place outside the big coastal metros, this one's older and mom-and-pop.  The décor isn't much to look at, and the only sounds were a blaring TV and a video-poker machine.  But the food was quite good:  By Vietnamese standards, the menu's pretty short, but there was basic pho with beef and meatballs that was rock-solid.  The broth had some depth to it, and the beef was done a bit differently:  Instead of the usual super-thin-sliced beef, this was almost like pulled beef, but tender and tasty.    The one-armed older fellow who waited on us is, I believe, one of the long-time owners.  Even though this restaurant has been around for some time, something got lost in translation with my wife's order:  She asked for the bun (vermicelli bowl) with tofu, but ended up with a vegetarian pho.  She pronounced it \"too healthy,\" which I take to mean bland, but for a vegetarian pho I thought the broth was quite rich and good.    The spring rolls were nice:  Copious fresh herbs, and a good value for the money.    All-in-all, good job, Tram's Kitchen."}
{"text":"What a great place! Such remarkable, tasty food coming from such a \"dump\"? Who knew?? Been here quite a few times and have always enjoyed the plentiful, tasty, cheap food. If you need atmosphere or want to impress, this isn't for you. If you want to thoroughly enjoy some fabulous Vietnamese food, this is your place! They do great takeout too. If I lived closer, I'd be here all the time. Best Vietnamese food I've had in the city for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have to give this place a 5, and no JUST because of the delicious food.    I'll preface my story with its probably the best Pho/vietnamese in Pittsburgh...yada yada...delicious...yada yada...cheap...yada yada...great pho  BUT a lot of ppl have said its no-frills, angry servers who throw food at you.  And this has been the case a few times before my story tonight.  I've never minded.  TONIGHT though...i went to get some take out pho on a snowy evening.  I had to wait for a few minutes...and the owner was nice enough to engage me in conversation while I waited.  I get my Pho...paid..and I get in my car...and drove away...  A block later, due to the snowy weather and my inability to slow brake...I squealed to a stop when some guy ran out into the street.  I did stop in time, spared his life...BUT MY PHO WAS EVERYWHERE!  Most of it was in the bag, but a good portion was on the floor...on the seat...MORE IMPORTANTLY, NOT IN MY BELLY.  So I drove into a parking lot...had to dispose of the mess...and cried.    Now not only did I NOT have pho...my car now smelled enticingly of beefy broth.  So in a moment of frenzy, I thought...What the heck...im only a block away, IM GETTING MY PHO.  So I went back...and got my pho!  AND...the guy didn't even charge me.  He was SO nice and he was like \"You said you dropped it, I believe you! here!\"  omfg, I EFFING LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places I could find in Pittsburgh! Cheap and definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The best pho that I have ever tasted it ain't many it's only four different times but to me this is the best"}
{"text":"Compared to Vietnamese food I have had elsewhere (New York, Brookyln), the restaurant is a little bit of a let down. I feel like the portions should be bigger, there should be more basil in the soup, and also better meat.  I found their spring roll to be too dry and honestly have made better spring rolls myself using recipes found online.   The pho is still tasty overall, but it could be better."}
{"text":"Just wanted to briefly point out to Seth M. that the waiter with one arm is Tram's father. I was told by my sister-in-law who befriended him a long time ago that his family sided with the American's in the Vietnam war (perhaps this explains the arm, but I'm not sure). Most of his family took refuge in the states, but for some reason (not certain why) his daughter, Tram, was detained in Vietnam while the rest of the family trekked to the States. He opened up Tram's kitchen and then, eventually, Tram reunited with family in the states. Last I was there, the only two servers were Tram's father (wish I knew his name) and Tram, a father/daughter server team."}
{"text":"If you grew up in a part of the country with lots of Vietnamese food or have eaten it in such places, you're not going to be impressed by Tram's.  I gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times. I will admit that I only tried the pho and a vermicelli bowl (on separate trips), but having ordered anything else on each of my trips would have put my bill in the neighborhood of $12+. Having grown up with cheap Vietnamese food in Texas, I wasn't prepared to spend that much for what's supposed to be a budget lunch, even with the understanding that I was going to leave hungry and that the lack of non-European ethnic diversity in Pittsburgh is going to automatically make things more expensive.  Either way, I don't understand the hype surrounding this place. The pho bowl was small, with a tasteless broth and child-sized portions of noodles and meat. After a few bites, I drenched the whole thing in Sriracha just to give it some flavor and to try to trick my stomach into feeling a bit more like I had eaten something.  The vermicelli was not so great either--a small portion of vegetables and noodles with a few too-thick chunks of pork that were not grilled long enough for any sort of darkness or crisp (but which still managed to be dry). The color of the dish was as bland as the taste.  As for the atmosphere, not a big deal for me. The restaurant is small, with minimal seating and some dinginess to it, but that's fairly common for older Vietnamese restaurants. Most diners are young, hip, and not Asian (which could be a turn-off for some due to the perceived lack of authenticity and/or hipsteriness). Parking is a chore; if you live nearby and choose to give the place a try, walk or ride your bike, or prepare to find yourself circling nearby blocks of permit-only parking.  Folks who dine at Tram's should keep in mind that cheaper, better, more authentic Vietnamese food exists out there. I grew up in North Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth area), where with one of the largest Vietnamese populations in the country, good, cheap Vietnamese food can be found all over the metro area. Pho portions down there are reasonably big, there are plenty of different meat combinations, and you can almost always choose the size of the bowl you want (usually kid's, small, large, and extra-large). Additionally, due to the presence of plenty of fresh ingredient suppliers and competition, prices are more in line with portion size, and the food is, more often than not, good. Most folks with normal appetites are able to leave satisfied having spent no more than $7 or $8 a person with tax and tip (compared to $20 at Tram's). Out of all the Vietnamese spots in North Texas that I've tried, my absolute favorite is Pho Pasteur, in Arlington: The pho, vermicelli bowls, crushed rice dishes, spring and egg rolls, and prices are all excellent. Tram's would be put out of business if anyone ever opened a restaurant like that up here.  If none of the other few choices in Pittsburgh are satisfying your Vietnamese food cravings, it might be worth it to take a weekend trip up to Toronto. You would also have access there to some other Asian foods that we don't have here, such as dim sum and Taiwanese \"small eats.\" For a slightly shorter drive, you can also find these things (though more sparsely) in the D.C. suburbs."}
{"text":"The locals know:  if you want Vietnamese food, EAT AT TRAMS  The locals also know:  sometimes the service is bizarre, like ridiculously bizarre, like the time my friend and I were seated at a huge table, and we were eating our entrees and a larger party came in and they made us move and were NOT nice about it, when they were the ones who sat us there.  But the food is so good.  Its like I want to be mad, but their vegetable spring rolls and again, food is so good.  This place is a hole in the wall, I would not recommend this as a first date unless your potential date was the one who suggested going to Trams.  Cash only."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for lunch on my days off of work. As a vegan they are pretty knowledgable and have a decent amount of options. You just have to watch out for fish sauce on cold vegetable salads even if you order them with tofu. And pho is made with ox tail, so I haven't had that. My favorite food to order is the garlic tofu with rice and the spring rolls with tofu. Yum! This place is cash only, but they have an ATM so they got you covered."}
{"text":"Tram's is a pretty small place, and when first coming here, the interior reminded me your typical cheap Chinese restaurant. But the setting is fine for eating. I don't expect anything fancy.  I got the pho tai, which was not bad. They filled up a big bowl and also had hosin sauce and whatever that red rooster hot sauce (whatever it's called) for the optional additional flavor. In comparison to some of the other pho that I have had, I didn't find the broth to be as flavorful. Everything tasted fresh, though.  We also got egg rolls and spring rolls. They were both good. I preferred the spring rolls.  Service was a little slow. We had to flag down our waiter, but that's not too big a deal. I also felt that the preparation could have been quicker, but I don't know jack about making Vietnamese food besides comparisons to other restaurants.  Overall, this place isn't bad, and I'd recommend you check it out if it's close by. My one friend recommended another place in Pittsburgh, but I can't remember the name and I'm too lazy to ask him. Maybe I'll update later and let you know. I'm a big help, right?"}
{"text":"I adore this place. DELICIOUS food, great prices. Not a fancy or snooty establishment - quite a hole in the wall type place. I recommend the pho with beef or chicken, with the fresh spring roll appetizer."}
{"text":"Maybe I am being too harsh BUT I cannot say that I will ever be back to Tram's... for me, this place has earned the nickname \"Tram's toilet\".  I have had pho before, and it was never as not so tasty as this.  Bland, blah, and gross is all I can say about my broth.    Not only was it not tasty, it was not what we ordered.  I do not comprehend why so many people love this place... I cannot even begin to try to force myself."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about Tram's but I wasn't very impressed. Maybe I just didn't order the right dish. I ordered the beef vermicelli bowl, one egg roll, one spring roll. The beef in the dish was tough and poor quality cuts off meat (lots of cartilage) and too many noodles not enough greens. I love little ma and pa shops so I'll have to give him another try, maybe something vegetarian."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here! The food was authentic, delicious and the older man who was our server was adorable!  I loved watching him joke around with the kids at another table who seemed shocked and intrigued by his heavy accent. My friend and I both ordered noodle dishes and were very pleased with our selection. I will definitely try this place again!"}
{"text":"This place checks all my boxes.  I had a super delicious VEGETARIAN PHO off their small but veggie-friendly menu.  My soup was full of broccoli, thinly sliced onions, mung bean sprouts, shredded carrots, and cilantro (YUM), and the broth was deeply flavorful.  It needed nothing extra.    However, I'm a fan of toppings, necessarily or frivolous, and Tram's did not disappoint.  In addition to the usual herbal accompaniments, every table was preset with a whole host of condiments to self-season your meal.  This tickles me greatly, especially for an eating experience such as pho.  Soy, hoisin, and oyster sauce, plus Sriracha AND sambal olek?  Tram's, I feel as though you get me.  And my huge bowl, half of which was boxed up for me to take home, set me back just $7?  YES, PLEASE.  Our friends ordered the beef and chicken soups with extra protein and were super pleased with how much extra meat they were given.  My fiance had the PHO HANOI SOUP and is excited to try the Saigon and Sate styles when we return.  Tram's is exactly what a pho restaurant should be.  Cheap, no frills, and unassuming.  Service wasn't super attentive, but my requests were honored ASAP when they were heard (extra jalapeños, please! and hot black tea--not on the menu but a much-appreciated basic).  This is a pho restaurant that makes me want to stop flirting with other pho restaurants and settle down.  This is the type of pho restaurant that makes me feel less depressed about summer ending, because at least cold weather equals soup weather.  I could eat this pho every week.  Tram's, I'm so glad we met."}
{"text":"For the longest time, I heard Tram's Kitchen was the place to go for great Vietnamese food.  So off I went with another one of my foodie friends last night.    I walked in, and the decor was...pretty bad, but that's pretty run-of-the-mill for a chinese  restaurant.  Watermelons on the tablecloths, generic wall decor...whatever.  We ended up seating ourselves, I'm still not sure if we were supposed to or not, the staff wasn't very talkative, I'm assuming they didn't speak much english.  We both ordered the Beef Pho and Shrimp Spring Rolls.  So first major hiccup, our Pho came out, no sign of the spring rolls, though our waiter asked us \"You want any spring roll?\"  \"Yes.  Yes I do.\" -.-  Well we get our spring rolls, pretty good.  The sauce they brought out with it seemed like hoisin sauce with a pretty odd taste.  One piece of halved shrimp was all I found in the roll, which was a bummer, but it was cheap, so I'll let it slide.  The pho was great.  Nice aromatics, a hint of cinnamon, a decent amount of beef for the price, and a heaping plate of sprouts and limes to accompany it.  The only complaints I could pose were that it was very mild, and it a bit spicier.  Overall, above average, but my quest for the perfect Pho continues."}
{"text":"Tram's is where it's at if yummy pho and gummy shrimp dumplings are your thing. The pho is definitely worth the $7 price tag and their fresh sping rolls are quite gooey and ooze flavor. Tram's is a nice hole-in-the-wall great for a cheap and extremely tasty eat."}
{"text":"This place has been here for so long and it's really one of the only places in Pittsburgh where you can get a good bowl of pho. I have to give it all five because of its singularity and history as well as the soup."}
{"text":"I don't know how other reviewers compare Trams to Pho Minh.  Pho Minh is disgusting and uses a very tasteless powder broth/soup base for their pho.  Pho Minh is a lot closer to the real deal, but their pho selection is really small.  This has been the best bowl of pho I've had in Pittsburgh, and the four stars is totally relative for the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Like the owner. Informal atmosphere- almost Asian cafeteria style except the food is really good. Decor is a little disjointed. Cheap prices so I'm not complaining. Always fast service. Good place for a casual hang out w/ friends or a not-out-to-impress date. Do not add fish sauce to stuff- it almost ruined my Tram's proclivity forever.  Good place to get a spicy hot soup in the winter if you're cold.  Seems good for large groups. Cash only I think..."}
{"text":"I came here awhile ago and ordered one of the rice-based dishes with chicken (can't remember exactly what it was, and there's no menu posted online for me to figure it out).  The dish was dry and lacked flavor.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish here, since the Pho seems to be what they're known for.  As it were, I wasn't impressed. I don't remember anything being off about the service, so it must have been fine.  If a dining partner specifically wanted to try Vietnamese, I'd come back and try the Pho, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, given that there are many better dining options on Butler St."}
{"text":"I came here once and ordered pho, and I was very disappointed. Bland broth, tough meat, I didn't get the Tram's hype. Not that I've ever tried mind-blowing pho (I've only eaten it in Pennsylvania, which is probably the problem) but this was even worse than most.  However, I've since been back and ordered the bun. Now I was impressed! Specifically with the version doused in coconut milk--I love coconut anything, and on top of vermicelli noodles with a squirt of hoisin and sriracha, it was heaven. Only thing is, I don't like the selection of vegetables they use. Onions and broccoli just aren't my jam, and my favorite veggie to have with my bun, cucumber, was sadly MIA from Tram's version.  I do consider myself to be a little bit of a fresh spring roll connoisseur (ooookay, maybe not, but I eat them a lot), and Tram's are good, but not my favorite in the city. I know, a lot of people are all about Tram's rolls, but I like mine with lots of Thai basil, and you can barely taste it in theirs. They're still super fresh with a good amount of meat, so this is just a matter of preferences, not quality.  Regardless of the meh pho, I can't stress enough that it's totally worth it to come here for the coconut milk bun! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, shows lots of wear and tear but the staff is very sweet and attentive. The food is decent. Will fill your belly but not satisfy your craving for authenticity. I don't understand what all of the hype is about, there's definitely better in pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Small menu, decor is barely passible, but the food is excellent. Has been getting more expensive over the years but probably one of the best vietnamese places in Pgh.  I always get the fried tofu and the chicken salad (goi ga). Shrimp curry is good too.  The place is run by a single family.  Waiter (one armed man) is a little short at times (my wife claims that he is always nicer to me than to him. She calls him the \"food nazi\") but he is much better when the place is not so packed."}
{"text":"Very homely and no-frills feel for Vietnamese food. It feels quite authentic, at least to me. The menu is pretty straightforward, although some of the combinations and different prices may be a little confusing. There are mainly a few types of items--noodle soups, including pho, vermicelli (bun), and rice plates (con tam)--with a few varieties in each category. Overall their prices are quite reasonable, and it's only an extra dollar or two more to get combinations of different meats or spring rolls.  Having tried the pho, split/broken rice (con tam), and vermicelli (bun) bowl, I think their food is made well in general. The pho broth is very flavorful, and getting the different meats plus shrimp is very worthwhile. The vermicelli with shredded pork, spring roll, and grilled pork was very filling as well. If I had to pick something, I'd probably say that the grilled pork chop as served with the rice was my least favorite. It was a bit dry, and doesn't really compare to Tan Lac Vien. So I'd still stick with the latter for rice but maybe go here for pho."}
{"text":"I've only been here a handful of times and while the food is good, the one-armed waiter is curt, and the smell is horrendous. I'm guessing the place hasn't been cleaned since the Nixon administration. Either that or they actually buried Nixon under the floor boards without proper mummification. There's gotta be better Vietnamese food in PGH."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Vietnamese food, but methinks the folks who are all \"OMG I AM FROM (name a coast) AND THIS PLACE IS TERIBEL OMG OMG OMG!!!!\" need to put a plug in it.  If it's so great there, STAY THERE! We don't want to hear it.  Nobody logs into Yelp and says \"Well, Tram's sucks, guess we have to go to BOSTON now to get Vietnamese food.\"   Now, the review.    I am a curry monster.  If a country makes a curry, I want to eat it, and once I've eaten it, I want more.  Not all curries are created equal, but the curry you get at Tram's is pretty damn good.  And that's why I go there, but it's not the only reason to go there.  The spring rolls are pretty good, as well.  What I like about them is that they're fat, and packed tightly.  You have to appreciate it, because it is no easy task to wrap one of those things really tightly without ripping the skin.  The service is sort of no-frills.  They're not overtly friendly, but definitely not rude either.  Just quick and businesslike.  I love the ambiance, too, because it reminds me a lot of east Asia.  Cheap tablecloths, pastel-painted walls, and until recently, it was organized in such a way that your table and the folks next to you were so close together you may's well have been dining together.  What's a real complaint about this place? It's what I say about every place that's cash only.  They need a credit machine."}
{"text":"I love Pho, but I haven't had too many chances here in Pittsburgh to try it. On Saturday we were heading to Tram's Kitchen for lunch. The place is quite small and unnoticeable and it was quite packed. We were quickly seated and handed the menu, which is not very extensive but still with plenty of variety. We had the fresh spring rolls, the eggrolls and the fried wonton as entrees and I went for the Mung Bean Noodle soup with chicken for main. All the food came out promptly and was really good and fresh. I have to admit that it was not the best Pho I have eaten, but it was definitely something I would come back for. The staff is very friendly and accommodating as well. All in all, a very lovely and friendly environment and experience and I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"As soon as I feel my seasonal head cold coming on, I know where to go--it's Tram's! No better way to flush out the sinuses than with some spicy as h%*! soup. I usually go for the Mung Bean Noodle soup (with chicken) but there are several options. While the food is delicious, the ambience of Tram's isn't the best so I usually get mine to-go. This is actually even more fun in my opinion because when you get take-out, they package all the ingredients up separately (noodles, broth, bean sprouts, basil, limes, chili, sauces, etc) so you can mix how you like at home! Spicier the better for me!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh doesn't have many Vietnamese options. Tram's Kitchen is the only place I've ever heard people mentioning. Today I've finally visited it.   First impression: solid pho.  The soup had a good flavor, though the portion is a little small. I was disappointed that they did not have tripe or tendon, but the beef was cut thinly. The menu selection is not terribly wide, but they seem at least competent with what they do have to offer.   Efficient family service. Simple ambiance. Dinner under $15."}
{"text":"Tried the rare beef pho and thought it was really great. The spring rolls were also great.   We tried the vermicelli with coconut milk and the split rice - both of which were fantastic. Will definitely come back here again!  FYI - cash only!"}
{"text":"I always go for the fresh springs rolls with pork and the Saigon soup. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Darren and I came here last weekend, and I liked it very much. The \"Saigon Soup\" was sssoooooo goood! I couldn't finish it! The portion was so generous. I also liked their egg rolls and the sauce that came with them. The owner was nice to us but doesn't play around! You have to order fast because the place is always full! I appreciated how he found a table and some chairs to seat us even though they were superbusy. I love Asian food, and now I have another place to enjoy.  I didn't mind the decor, and the place isn't \"dirty\" either. What do people expect? The Le Mont?"}
{"text":"Does this place have the best Vietnamese food I've ever had? No. But does it hit the spot? HELL YES!   This was our go-to for hangover pho in college. Coming back the Pittsburgh after trying countless Vietnamese resturants, I was afraid to try the food again. I thought that the great taste I remembered was more of a memory and lack of food savvy-ness than anything else.  However, Tram's did not disappoint. The rough-around-the-edges owner is still there, pumping out customers.  The pho lacked a little depth, but satisfied the craving. The portion was bit small for the price (Vietnamese is dirt cheap, even in NYC), but fine. The lemongrass tofu was a little on the salty side, but very tasty! The spring rolls, like everyone has mentioned, is packed with goodies inside.  My favorite dish of the night was probably the Split Rice dish. It comes with shredded and grilled pork and a lovely egg with runny yolk on top. The fish sauce that comes with it is sweet and delicious.  Hardly a wait on Saturday night? BYOB? I would be there every weekend if I was still in the 'burgh. One minus: cash only."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Came here for Valentine's Day lunch with my girlfriend and the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Very good noodle soup and spring rolls. Great hole-in-the-wall restaurant in an OK location. Service is variable, but you probably should not be going there for the service anyway.   One thing I wish is that they had more seating. Several times I went there, the restaurant was full, so I had to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am also somewhat conflicted about Tram's.  I have been a few times now, and it seems to be somewhat hit or miss.  I've had the Pho a few times, and while always fairly good my satisfaction largely hinges on the amount and freshness of basil and mint that is brought out.  The other dishes are usually well made and well seasoned.    I enjoy the short menu and the waiter who is fun to interact with.  This place is usually pretty busy even on a weekday evening.  Surprising given the location.  Definitely better than Pho Minh up the street, but I still think Spice Island has the best Vietnamese dishes in town."}
{"text":"I have been feeling very sluggish and found out that I am lacking in dietary fiber. It's hard to make good food from scratch during the week bc of my busy schedule. A great friend of mine suggested loading up on Pho a few times a week. I decided to try the vegetarian tofu Pho and veggie spring roles. Everything was so crisp and fresh, bean sprouts, lime, and a sweet spicey sauce. The broth was extremely flavorful and since I work down the street I have found a new place to get something healthy and delicious!   Take cash, no credit cards."}
{"text":"Peter B. got it right. Order the Pho, order the spring rolls, and I'll add order the summer rolls. These are all good. Other things are not worth trying. I love Pho, and I have it all over the country. Tram's is NOT one of the best. However, when you're in Pittsburgh, and you have limited selections, it is the best. For that PhoFix in da Burgh, you gotta go to Tram's.   Sometimes I think the Yelp Rating needs to be aware of the circumstances. It's not dumbing down, it's just knowing your surroundings. Tram's - you get 4 stars from me. Thanks for quenching my pho thirst."}
{"text":"The beef pho was a bit underwhelming. Not terrible but not exciting, either. Had to add a lot of chili to give it any kind of kick. The spring rolls were OK, but, again, not great. Basically, bland. But, if you're from Pittsburgh it's probably gonna be pretty tasty. If you're from any place with a large Asian community (Houston, NYC, San Francisco, etc...) I'd pass on Tram's."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Pittsburgh, I make time to go to Tram's. Get #17 and order spring rolls. If you've got adventurous taste buds, you don't mind the lack of atmosphere, and you aren't looking for a pampering staff, then this place is quite the hidden jewel. I highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Tram's is the best Pho I've had in Pittsburgh! The service is fast. Don't expect any small talk from your server. Just straight and too the point. I got the fried vegetarian spring rolls. They were great and bigger then most places. The dipping sauce was light and fresh. I got the beef pho. The broth was amazing! Hit the spot! This will be my new pho spot from now on!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in Pittsburgh. I think the satay soup is better than the Pho.  BYOB with no corkage fee."}
{"text":"This has been my family's favorite Vietnamese restaurant for more than ten years. We used to travel 40 minutes from the suburbs just to visit Tram's. At that time, Tram's was probably the only Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh and as a dozen more have opened in the last decades, Tram's still has the best food for a great value.  I love their vermicelli bowl, especially with \"mixed meat\" of pork, chicken, and slices of egg roll. Just make sure to doctor up your bowl with the table sauces: chili paste, sriracha, hoisin sauce, and fish sauce!"}
{"text":"Best spring rolls ever! I could just eat them and be happy...but I enjoy the Pho as well! This place is byob so that makes it even more awesome for me and my friends! If you can't find something to like on this menu then you shouldn't be eating Vietnamese food. Vey laidback restaurant. ..which is perfect for my friends and I!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Wednesday evening for dinner with my fiance.   We have both been to Tram's before but it has been awhile since our last visit.  Whenever we walked into the restaurant we saw that not much has changed except for maybe the addition of a flat screen TV.  The restaurant itself is small and maybe has seating at tables for about 30 people and the decorations are a little sparse.  The easiest thing to see is that they have won a ton of awards which are hanging up on the back wall.  Beyond that it is still a hole in the wall divey type of place that is cash-only with excellent food.     Almost immediately after we sat down the owner asked us if we were ready to order.  At that point we were not ready.  The menu here isn't that big but it doesn't need to be since what they do make is very good.  About two minutes later the owner was back and ready to take our order.  This time we were ready.  My fiance and I decided to split some eggrolls and then for my entree I went with the beef vermicelli with conconut milk. The eggrolls came out at the same time as the meals and were so hot temperature wise that both my fiance and myself left them until after we had eaten our entrees.  My vermicelli ended up being really good with the sauce providing the perfect flavor to the dish.  I don't know how they do it but they do a great job of infusing a ton of flavors into it.  The noodles in it were also good and the beef was better than expected.  After I had finished my vermicelli I ended up grabbing my eggrolll which was still somehow hot.  While the flavor on it wasn't that great, what I really loved about it was the textures that it provided.  It was cooked perfectly and so the shell had a great crispy exterior while the interior with the vegetables had a softer texture.  Overall it was another solid meal at Tram's for me.   The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.   Whats not to like about a place where the food is not only cheap but also delicious?  Just be careful in that it is cash only and I know at one point they were BYOB although I am not sure if that is still the case."}
{"text":"When I moved from San Diego to Pittsburgh, I thought I had given up pho for good.  I tried it once at Lulu's but was almost offended that they tried to pass their soup off as pho.  Then I tried Tram's, a little hole in the wall place on Penn.  Their generously portioned pho was unbelievably tasty, and though I had stopped eating huge portions of food, there was no way I was going let even an ounce of it go to waste.  Now I daydream about the place."}
{"text":"I see a lot of confusion in the other reviews; people seem to either love or hate Tram's.  I think I can help explain this issue.  Tram's has a fairly full menu, but there are two things on the menu that you should be ordering:  the soups (particularly, the beef pho) and the fresh spring rolls.  That's it.  If you've had Pho in other cities, you might not understand Tram's.  There's no Vietnamese community in Pittsburgh, so you can't get all the trimmings you might have come to expect:   no tripe, no tendon, no other strange meat parts. Just beef or chicken.  But what sets Tram's apart, in my view, is the quality of his broth.  I have eaten Pho all around the US, and Tram's broth is, in my view, the very best I've had.  So get the pho (or, if you're in the mood for something different, the Saigon Soup), get the spring rolls, and skip everything else on the menu.  Then you'll understand Tram's.  Incidentally, the owner's name is not \"Tram\".  His name is Le Thao.  Tram is his daughter, who was left behind in Vietnam for many years, when his son needed a kidney transplant in the US."}
{"text":"If you have been to any other PHO restaurant, in any other city, Tram's Kitchen would be OUT OF BUSINESS!   For starters, the portion of the PHO is extremely SKIMPY! I don't think we have had such a small portion of PHO since we were Babies! Seriously, would it kill you to add more rice noodles?   Since we had the PHO as our Appetizers, we then ordered the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles...Oh wait...we paid for Seafood...but all we got were vegetables and some imitation they call seafood. What a Joke!   Suggestion if you plan on going here. Come FULL and just order the Spring Roll."}
{"text":"Come with my boyfriend when every time he visit pittsburgh! Very tasty, local, and affordable. Only problem is we have to park alone street. Other than that, foods is awesome here! Oh! Remind it's cash only!"}
{"text":"I've gone to about five different Vietnamese restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, and Tram's kitchen tops them all. I am a vegetarian and love getting spring rolls and pho. I ordered both which were delicious, as well as coconut vermicelli noodles. The pho had just the right flavour with a generous helping of greens and tofu in the broth. The spring rolls were great, and I believe filled with tofu skin as well as greens and vermicelli noodles. You can also order the spring rolls individually ($1.95) which I think is a plus. The dipping sauce was great! We also had the vegetarian wontons as an appetizer. Everything was fresh and came out very quickly! The restaurant is cash only, but it's helpful that there is an ATM right inside their doors. I will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Tram's is effing FANTASTIC.    The soup (pho) is... You can't even call it \"soup\".  It transcends soup.  It's a fragrant, hazy lemongrass experience, like wading through a stream in the hot Viet summer, cooled with basil and lime.    And, it's served by a Vietnamese man with one arm, and he is awesome.  God bless him."}
{"text":"I appreciate the relaxing and casual atmosphere of this place. It was small, but I didn't feel cramped. The server didn't waste time with small talk, and we received our food quickly. I ordered the fresh spring rolls and pho hanoi soup with chicken. The spring rolls were nothing special, but I liked the dipping sauce they came with. When I first saw the pho, I was disappointed because it looked bland and unappealing, but I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. It was slightly sweet and very light on my stomach. My only complaint is that there was one piece of broccoli in my soup. I don't know if more broccoli was supposed to be in there or if there wasn't supposed to be any at all."}
{"text":"The first thing that charmed me about Tram's kitchen was the tablecloths. They are exactly like the tablecloths I saw in a little hole-in-the-wall restaurants throughout Vietnam. The decor is very similar to what you'd get in Vietnam, so if you don't like the decor, you probably should never go to Vietnam.   In terms of food, the service was quick, the food was piping hot and quite delicious. I was expecting more fresh herbs on the pho, but the complex broth more than made up for any lackings.   I will definitely be heading back to this cheap, tasty hole-in-the wall."}
{"text":"Stopped into Tram's last night for a solo dinner. I was greeted by a joyful man who brought me to a spot at the front of the restaurant where he promptly too my order and delivered me a delicious bowl of veggie pho. I was in heaven and consumed every last bite- so good! I will definitely be back the next time I'm on Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Was craving Pho while in Pittsburgh - and so on to Yelp I went and found the reviews for this place. So off I went in search of Tram's.  Tram's is located in a section of Pittsburgh that is a little on the run down side - the area has seen better days. But that did not phase me - adds some character to the place!  It was about 1:45 pm when I rolled in. Was given a choice of where to sit  - a little old man with one arm (or perhaps he was missing just the hand? - could not tell) took my order. He did not seem to friendly - I asked him a couple of questions and it was hard to get anything out of him.  I ordered Pho Ga with white meat (although their menu lists it as \"Pho Hanoi\") with garden rolls and a glass of water.  I suspected that perhaps their approach to Pho was going to be more Northern Vietnam based on the name for the soup - and I was partially correct. When the soup came out - the noodles were the slightly wider ones rather than the very thin ones.  Now I'm guessing that many of my Yelp friends from the DC area that like Pho would not have liked the Pho here.  Unless I'm mistaken - most of you folks seem to prefer to have all of the fat skimmed and strained out of your Pho broth - which I am against. It makes the broth to clear and light and there is a significant reduction in flavor and richness when this is done. And they certainly weren't doing that here. In fact - there was a slight oiliness or greasiness to the broth - but not overly so. It gave the broth a delicious richness and subtly in flavor that was just so damn good!  I added all of the aromatics and veggies. I will say that the amount of Basil, and the quality of the Basil were the low points of the meal. The poor Basil had seen better days.  I then tasted the broth and was floored by how good it was. I detected light, rich hints of star anise and cinnamon, which when combined with chicken essence fat globules and onions - was just outstanding. Rich, savory, wonderful!  I added Sriracha sauce to individual bites of food as I went - and only added a little to the broth at the very end. I really wanted to savor the broth the way it was.  Cons: - The rolls were not very fresh - in fact I did not finish them because they weren't very good. - The Basil was not crisp and fresh - The restrooms need to be gutted and retrofitted  So I'm only docking them one star for the cons - the Pho was outstanding IMHO - so four stars overall!  Cash only - no credit cards. I had a bit of a hard time finding parking - so beware of that."}
{"text":"Although everyone comes here for the pho, i also like the fried rice and the egg noodles with tofu yummy! yummy!"}
{"text":"Taking a dump as I write this review, and their toilet is surprisingly clean. My buddies told me this is the place to go for Vietnamese food and I was eager to give it a try and compare it to the pho at my super Asian hometown. I've only had their pho and when I drank the first sip of the broth, I was very impressed. Sadly the noodles did little for my taste buds. The noodles consistency was hard, and didn't absorb much flavor. Like they were quite old and refrigerated/frozen. I don't blame them because I'm sure it is near impossible to get fresh rice noodles in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"1 major issue- Cash Only.  All in all the food was ok.  I have had a lot of Pho in my time.  I have eaten in most of the Vietnamese restaurants in the strip.  Menu is rather small.  Would like to have some other choices on the Pho.  Portions were good.  You do get a huge bowl of Pho.  Spring rolls were good.  Peanut sauce was just not as good as in some other places. But still a good spring roll."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Spring Rolls in the city.  The vibe is more about the food, less about the decor. You will find joints like this all over SOMA in San francisco, but not so much here in the 'burgh. Damn, are we lucky or what???!  I first ordered the Spring Rolls with shrimp, and they came out bursting with them! Two huge beautiful rolls. Patrick ordered the seafood pho, which was so bright and vibrant, delicious. And generous with the seafoods! It was the ocean in a bowl. I also ordered the lemongrass tofu appetizer- blown away! Perfectly lemon-y, nice texture and the best combo of salty and sweet. I dumped my peanut sauce all over it and chowed down like it was my last meal on earth. SO good!!!!!!  Service is prompt. You won't get hugs and big smiles, but you will get amazingly authentic Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese joint. They serve all the standard fare, pho, split rice, vermicelli. I usually get the split rice dish with pork and at 8.95 the portion is very large. The only thing I've been slightly disappointed with at Tram's is the spring rolls. They weren't as fresh as I was hoping and some of the produce was slightly wilted.   It seems to be a family owned place, the service is quick, and the food comes out even quicker."}
{"text":"This is comfort food.  Love this place.  The service is so-so but the food makes this place an all-star.  The spring rolls are amazing and the vegetarian pho is my favorite.  The broth is so flavorful and the dish/bowl is filling.  I have never had a bad meal here.  One of my favorite go-to places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Not the best looking place, but they definitely make up for it with their food.  Best, freshest noodles I have ever tasted. I got the coconut noodles and was not disappointed. I will say that their chicken was lacking in quality where I found the chicken very dry and hard. I would just opt for pork or tofu the next time around.   I think Tram's definitely deserves more recognition and esteem in Pittsburgh. I definitely know where to bring friends for some tasty noodles."}
{"text":"I thought the food was decent. The overall dining experience is all right. I appreciate the low-key environment, it's a very relaxed setting (at least when I went).   Pho: I had their wonton soup and chicken pho. The wontons tasted very good, but I wouldn't go so far as to say they were memorable in any way. I would also say the same for the soup. I wish they provided basil, more limes, and more bean sprouts to add into the soup. Noodles were prepared very well and were definitely of the right texture.  Spring rolls: I wasn't a particular fan, perhaps because of my preference for what goes into spring rolls. With the hoisin-based sauce, they were satisfying.  Together, I'd say that the dishes i had above were good and satisfying but not memorable, simply because I've had so much Vietnamese food in southern California that I believe I've just had a greater selection of things that appealed to my preference. I would recommend if you're craving a light meal with south-east asian flavors but not looking for something to blow your mind."}
{"text":"The good: The fresh spring rolls. The meatball pho. The curry. The vermicelli dishes. The fresh spring rolls.  The not-so-good: My father found the fried rice greasy."}
{"text":"Wow! I am so glad Miss Alison suggested this place while we were in town. She's vegan and they have plenty of options for her. We came here with friends for dinner after Day 1 of selling at Handmade Arcade. We got there just in time since it got packed shortly after we sat down. There was a slight language barrier, so instead of getting the chicken with crispy noodles, I got tofu, but you know what? I didn't even notice until 5 minutes after eating and then I looked across the table at my friend Jessica's dish that clearly had chicken and we had ordered the same thing. Oh well. I don't regret it at all. It was delicious and I ate every bite. Also the vegetable gyoza we started with was very tasty. Will definitely add this into my rotation of Pittsburghian restaurants I hit up when I am there. I heart Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times and found their Pho to be really good and the best I've been able to find in Pittsburgh so far.  Their pho menu is kind of limited though in it's options.  It would have been nice to see some more variety in the ingredients.  I also had the spring rolls as an appetizer which were good.  Servers were very friendly and it seems to be a family run place. Food comes up very quickly."}
{"text":"SETTING: Watermelons, that's the first thing I noticed. Patterns of cartoon watermelons graced all the tablecloths. The TV was on and showing soccer matches. One of the servers, a Messi fan, celebrated with a \"GOALLLLL!!!\" at one point. As a family-owned restaurant, I wasn't surprised to see two of their little ones horsing around near the kitchen and getting into an argument. Ah, young sibling love. Low key \"hole-in-the-wall\" spot with smells of an authentic asian restaurant.  FOOD: I was a bit confused with the menu. I was here for pho, and I thought there would be plenty of options. Turns out, when I asked about pho, he pointed only to one option (the last item under \"Noodles\"). For my pho, I went with the beef and meatballs for my meat and shared and order of eggrolls (2 pieces/order).  The eggrolls were moist inside and crunchy on the outside like you would expect. Slightly greasy. Came with a clear dipping sauce. Pho only had a few pieces of sliced beef but had a good amount of beef meatballs. The side dish that always comes with pho only had 2 small pieces of lime, basil leaves that were a bit brown and not too fresh, and no peppers. I was a bit disappointed in their lack of accompanying garnishes. On the plus side, what stood out to me was the savory broth/soup that the rice noodles and meat were cooked in. Delicious and much needed for a cold and rainy day.   Unfortunately, having had pho in California, I had plenty to compare to. Although the pho here was pretty basic and satisfying, it would be nice if the pho here had more slices of beef or had the usual options for tripe, beef tendon, brisket, flank, etc.   SERVICE: Hardworking kitchen and serving staff. English does not seem to be their first language, so sometimes it is a bit difficult to communicate. They brought out spring rolls instead of the eggrolls we ordered and when we expressed our confusion, they thought we wanted to place an order of eggrolls in addition to the spring rolls.    IMPRESSIONS:  Tram's is a family-owned restaurant, sharing Vietnamese culture with the Pittsburgh community. As a child from an immigrant family, I always have admired the courage and work ethic of immigrant families who are chasing the American Dream. I've heard this is one of the better pho spots in Pittsburgh, but knowing that I've had better (albeit in California where I grew up) makes it difficult for me to go out of my way to come back. When I do have another craving pho, I wouldn't mind visiting again."}
{"text":"OM NOM NOM NOM NOM   Tram's was everything I wanted in a noodle shop.  My friends both got the Pho and proclaimed that it was downright delicious. They didn't even feel the need to add any of the sauces or various accoutrements to enhance it.   I got a vermicelli noodle bowl that's made with coconut milk, shredded pork, chicken, beef, & tofu. IT WAS HANDS DOWN THE BEST NOODLE BOWL I HAVE EVER CONSUMED!!  I cannot explain how much I loved this dish. Tram's is a little out of my way, but I'll definitely make the trip out there for another bowl of this awesomeness.   Quit reading this and just go!"}
{"text":"Below average Vietnamese food. I don't know why people like it so much, unless you like getting yelled at by the owner. He's definitely a character."}
{"text":"I've been there several times over the past year and it's my go-to Vietnamese place in Pittsburgh. I like that it's BYOB, it's intimate, and it's delicious."}
{"text":"This place is no frills, but the food is delicious. Must try the lemongrass tofu with rice! Downfall is cash only."}
{"text":"It's not for the service, it's not for the style, it's for the Pho! Tofu lemongrass is equally amazing."}
{"text":"I can't sing this place enough praises. I've been patronizing this establishment periodically for nearly a decade, and I've never had a negative experience. The owner is an old soul, and he can be rough around the edges, but he knows Vietnamese food, and really opens up once he starts to remember you. The food is always impeccable. This is still one of the best kept secrets in the 'Burgh, and I'd give it six stars if I could."}
{"text":"For the truly Vietnamese peeps do not order anything besides pho. Probably your safest bet. Spring rolls wasn't all that everyone raving about. Hey but it is Pittsburgh so I can't expect much of the authentic."}
{"text":"5 stars. The food stands up to lots I've had elsewhere (and paid more for). Menu is a little limited.  We often ordered the mixed vegetable with chicken appetizer and our neighbors would always see it land on the table and murmur covetously.  I don't know if the dish has a Vietnamese name, or if it's not particularly authentic, but I'm pretty sure it's described as mixed chicken and vegetables on the menu.  It's a kind of sweet vinegary slaw with peanuts and root vegetables and it's amazing.  It's way better than the somewhat over-rated spring rolls.    Also, really great service and I, for one, love the seasonally appropriate plastic tablecloths."}
{"text":"These guys set the bar for Pho and supporting Vietnamese fare!  Amazing!  Great friendly service, amazing food and a fun atmosphere.  We do our best to hit up Tram's any time we can.  If we lived in Pgh it'd be a weekly stop... at the very least!  Everything on the menu is great!  We especially love the tofu spring rolls and start every meal at Tram's with an order or two!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars if that were an option. I have been going to Tram's for the past 3 years, and love the place. Not sure how the people who have given it negative reviews could arrive at their conclusions, but hey, everyone's entitled to his/her opinion, right?  Everything I have ever ordered here has come fast and fresh. Spring Rolls are a must, and can be made a meal unto themselves. Chicken fried rice is astounding. Vermicelli dishes are a great treat in the warmer months (because they come at a cool temperature, and are almost salad-like), and the chicken pho is transcendent.  Yes, transcendent.  I yearn for the cold months because it means that I can eat the stuff - my wife at first was horrified that I referred to chicken pho as the best broth based food I had ever eaten. Hell, she even made fun of me for craving 'chicken soup,' which most people would simply make at home, but this is not like anything at home, this is the ultimate comfort dish. The beef pho is good, but their chicken version is simply the best.  I know that they had some problems with their accreditation, but that appears to be well in their past, and frankly, I never had a single problem with their food before that. (That's more than I can say for many other restaurants I've been to...)"}
{"text":"Shockingly good. First off, it was hard to find pho in Pittsburgh so I was very concerned about the shops that did exist. When I walked in.... I was immediately brought to the small street shops in Vietnam. Loved it and enjoyed that aspect.  Service was quick but lack luster. No real cordialness or small talk. Just sit, menu, and left. Spoke Vietnamese to everyone else in the back. Started yelling a lot too. If you've ever been to Vietnam you would know this is very typical of the restaurant world. Lots of bickering in the back and not a worry about what the customers think.  But let's get to the real important stuff, the food. I ordered the egg roll and spring roll to start. They were nothing special, of anything the veggies in them were a bit dry and old tasting. I also ordered the Hanoi pho as my main course. OMG! Loved it. So simplistic. This is true northern pho. The flavors, the ingredients, it was so simple and that's how it is over there because it is not full of expensive ingredients. It was pure in beef bone flavor, most other American restaurants go the extra sugary route, but that's understandable because it's to appeal that specific crowd. And unfortunately our American cuisine is packed with tons of sugar.   Besides, the point. Pho was good. I would definitely come back. I would also want to try the other dishes too."}
{"text":"This crowded little place was very friendly, and the gent running the room gave me his personal table, complete with his newspaper. I ordered the veggie spring rolls and a beef pho. I can't say I was a huge fan of the rolls- something about the tofu and texture of the rice paper skin tasted like they'd been made a while back. The pho was delicious and well seasoned though, and they have salted lemon drink- very hard to find in the US. Overall a good spot to get your cravings met."}
{"text":"I visit Pittsburgh frequently and had been looking forward to trying out this place after having read the reviews. Wow... The guy really knows his trade. The food is on par if not better than the majority of well known/respected vietnamese places in Los Angeles.  BTW, the owner is hilarious. Someone mentioned in another review he was a mind reader... I totally get it. Lol. Since it was our first time there, we had no clue on what to get, we were stumbling over ourselves when the owner comes over and says \"YOU. Get this.\" And points at the menu. \"You will like with your wine\" holy smokes was he right :) loved the food! Btw. Did I mention BYOB??? No corkage fee either. Score.  One and only thing to keep in mind is the establishment is CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"I used to come here about 10 years ago or so, and the quality has not changed a bit. The fresh spring rolls (shrimp), are to die for and my mom was ranting and raving about them. I also got the chicken pho with shrimp added. Most of the time when I order chicken pho, I pretty much expect the chicken to be a bit dry, or even completely dry. However, I still order it pretty often and my expectations have lowered. Tram's Kitchen has proven to me that it doesn't have to be like that! The chicken in this soup is perfectly cooked, juicy, and even still has a delicious fatty consistency. And the perfection didn't stop there. The shrimp were tender, perfectly cooked, and cleaned by a thoughtful hand. Broth is so flavorful and will warm the soul! This is comfort food that will perk you up no matter how rainy your day was. I also ordered the wonton noodle soup on another day, and it had delectably juicy thin slices of pork, with a satisfying broth. But if I had to choose between the two, I would recommend the pho as one of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap, but quality asian food. The portions are nice and big and they are not cheap with their meet like many places in town. I like going there for a casual dinner from time to time."}
{"text":"For starters I had a fresh spring roll and a fried egg roll. The fresh spring roll is big and stuffed with shrimp, shredded pork, lettuce, basil, and rice. It was probably a sixth of the size of a chipotle burrito. The fried egg roll is a little smaller, yet it is still packed. I enjoyed the fried egg roll way more, but I wouldn't discourage someone from trying Tram's fresh spring roll.  For dinner, I had the Vermicelli noodles with coconut milk and beef. It was sweet and savory, but it missed a kick of spiciness to counter the coconut milk. I asked the staff for crushed red chili pepper flakes, but there was a significant language barrier which impeded me from conveying my request. Eventually, I said pepper enough, and I was brought jalapeño peppers. Not quite what I was looking for but they were an acceptable alternative.  The only subpar point of the night was the difficulty with service. The cash only policy could have been trouble; luckily, I read some reviews beforehand which prepared me. Also note that Tram's lets you BYOB."}
{"text":"Best fish sauce everrrrrrrrrrrrrr! For the eggrolls which have alot of taro in them so its very fragant"}
{"text":"I regret to write this review but my last few experiences at Trams's made me regret going there in the first place. The food has zero flavor and just taste like it's been doused in oil. Tram is such a kind gentlemen but I don't enjoy eating there. The restaurant is not clean. I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh! Tram's has a ton of character... I've been going there for about 6 years, and have watched the business grow, most recently with the redecorating. I've tried almost everything at least once, and have no complaints. My favorite is the Saigon Soup, and their fresh spring rolls are just that- fresh and delicious! A definite must if you like pho and Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!  Like the other reviews - you will not be disappointed by the fresh spring rolls.  Best I've had in the city.  The only part of our experience I wish I cloud have changed was the ordering process.  We weren't really sure what any of the dish's were, and the server offered no clarification.  My boyfriend was so flustered he just ordered by number and ended up with two entrees!  It was pretty funny.  Everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  We will definitely be going back (with a bit more knowledge of the menu)!"}
{"text":"I saw all the 5-star ratings and I thought maybe the place had improved, but the pho is really mediocre here.   They put a lot of cilantro and scallions in the broth, which is something I like, but it seems like they kind of skimp on the beef and bones they use to make the broth, so it's really thin... almost watery.   I suppose if you like a lighter broth with lots of herbs & black pepper in it, this is your spot... but I need my broth to be rich and aromatic."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and searched for a good place for pho. Stopped by and were pleasantly surprised.  The eggrolls hands down are the best we've ever had. Served them up with plenty of lettuce and herbs just the way we like it. The pho was good but nothing amazing. I had the curry chicken and was pleasantly surprised at how good the flavors were. Curry with just the perfect hint of sweet, so yummy! We will definitely be back! Don't judge a book by it's cover, this place is great!!!"}
{"text":"Being Vietnamese I've had tried tons of Vietnamese Pho restaurants and Tram's has to be one of the worse place I've ever been to. The food was mediocre and full of MSG. I ordered a rice vermicelli dish with egg rolls and they were oily and greasy. The Pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty.   My total bill doesn't reflect the price of the dishes I ordered. My bill came out to be higher than what's listed on the menu. Maybe because I'm vietnamese and being a visitor to Pittsburg for the first time, they think is ok to overprice their dishes on a Sunday night.   Although the old man at the place is nice, this place doesn't deserve the stars that's given. I don't recommend this place to anyone especially my Vietnamese comrades whom may visit to Pittsburg looking for good authentic home town cooking."}
{"text":"Coming from California I feel I know good Pho. This place had an amazing Pho, the broth was great, and it was simply delicious. I will say their choice of veggies was different then what I am used to but I appreciated the spin."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype about the Pho at this place is all about... I find the broth to be way more bland than it ought to be.  Barely any umami.  There is much better and more authentic Pho at other places in Pittsburgh.  Their other dishes are mediocre, except for the spring rolls, which are admittedly awesome.  It is very vegetarian friendly and probably the best vegetarian Pho that you could get in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Meh. I was visiting from NYC when I ate here before a show at the Brillobox. The beef pho was sub par. Food took about 10 minutes to arrive when it did the beef was already cooked through (that's a BIG no-no in my book). I could hardly make out the star anise in the broth, and the bean sprouts had seen better days. The framed PPG review says Tram's has the best Pho in Pittsuburgh; if that's actually true, then the state of  Pho in Pittsburgh is in bad shape.  I also tried the vegetarian satay that my wife ordered and it was pretty decent, so plus one star for having vegetarian soups, and more importantly, actually trying to make it good. It beat the pants off of the veggie Viet place on 6th st. in NYC. I kinda have my doubts about their interpretation of \"vegetarian\" though I kept that to myself...  As others have noted, the decor is kinda dumpy and the guy that took my order was surly, but I wonder if there's some kind of inverse halo effect going on here. Some hole-in-the-walls are just that: a hole in the wall.  Also: $8 for Pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing."}
{"text":"I'm looking for a Pho I can come home to late at night. A Pho I can dream about on cold days. I have an official Pho place- Pho Bang in NYC- but it's obviously too far away. So far I haven't phound the pho I'm looking for in Pittsburgh. I will persevere and try the other places, but it's hard to live up to Pho Bang. The spring rolls were good. So was the little boy who took my order."}
{"text":"This is the only pho place... taste is better than Lulu's that's pho sure."}
{"text":"This place is cash only!! (They do have an ATM)  I got the egg rolls (basically a spring roll), the chicken pho, and my friend got the summer rolls as well. The egg rolls were really good, and very fresh, the waiter had to warn me they would be hot they were that fresh! The summer roll did look a little sad and like it wasn't the freshest ingredients, and the basil they provide on the side was also not that fresh. The broth for the soup was pretty good, but I wish they gave more noodles and that the pho itself was a little more flavorful.   The service itself is super fast, so you don't have to worry about waiting too long for food.   Regardless, if you're looking for some pho while in Lawrenceville, Tram's is your best bet."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  Was in the Pittsburgh area for one day and decided to try the pho here.  It was a toss up between Pho Minh and here.  I think I chose wrong.  A rule of thumb is a good ethnic restaurant will be swarming with that particular ethnic people.  When I went, all I saw were non-Asians.    Ordered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable. It did not taste flavorful and authentic but maybe that's what is available in Pittsburgh.  Another sour note, they dropped off some spring rolls at our table.  It was our first time there and I thought they were complimentary so we ate them.  Later on, we saw them on our bill.  WE DIDN'T EVEN ORDER THEM.  They were overpriced, and not worth it.  Be careful if they drop off food or drinks at your table, they will bill you for it afterwards even if you didn't order it."}
{"text":"Note #1: CASH ONLY!   Note #2: I saw a fellow diner break out a bottle of wine, so they must be BYOB.    Having only been to Tram's a pair of times when I worked at the now-gone-and- replaced St. Francis Medical Center, I recall their beef fried rice to have supernatural qualities; 'twas the very best I'd ever had anywhere.   Kay felt like Vietnamese food last night, and since I hadn't been here in close to a decade, we popped in for a spot of food.  Ignore the paint peeling from the walls.   Take co-owner/server Thao Le Truong, his limited English skills, and his no-nonsense personality with a grain of rice. If anyone deserves to be living The American Dream, it is Mr. Truong. He is there to take your order, serve you your food, and get you on your way. He is not there to make you feel special, joke with you, or be impressed by you. Have some compassion for a man who has obviously led a more difficult life than his clientele of hipsters and yuppies (it was scarves, low-rise jeans, thick-rimmed glasses, and slender people galore Friday night!) likely ever will.   Have some Vermicelli, with coconut milk and shrimp, like I did. Bite into the tight, plump, vibrant prawns, slurp up the soft noodles, crush the bean sprouts between your teeth, drink the milky broth, and experience edible, drinkable comfort from a Vietnamese perspective. Have some crispy, oily, richly-filled egg rolls as a starter. Dip them into that syrupy sauce I cannot identify. Enjoy.   When we arrived at Tram's, we were disappointed at first since it looked to be too full at the moment to accommodate Kay and I, but as soon as Mr. Truong caught sight of us, he held up two fingers, scrambled about, and seemingly pulled a small table and two chairs out of thin air to seat us over in a far corner of the restaurant where we could see everyone without being seen.  As far as Kay's \"Saigon Soup\" went, I had to finish it for her and found that it went down easy on a brisk winter evening, filling my stomach with love.   I'm certainly not a world-traveler who is well-versed in Vietnamese cuisine, but Kay and I both took pleasure in what we ate. Leave whatever pretensions you may have at home if you choose to come here and do the same.  P.S. The service was acceptable, none of the staff, including Mr. Truong, were rude to us, and while the dining room won't win awards from interior design magazines, we didn't find the place to be \"dirty\" either."}
{"text":"Best pho in town!  Try the \"Saigon Soup,\" which seems to be their basic pho.  The broth is delicious.  The spring rolls and fried wontons are great too.  I've been ordering the same meal here over and over again for about five years now and have never been disappointed.  Really, I'd say the food is four stars, but the space itself brings the place down a bit."}
{"text":"I am from Houston, since I came here I've been searching for the perfect bowl of pho. I have to say this is the closest thing yet from home!!! Good pho with fair pricing, doesn't get ebtter than this."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is right out of a Seinfeld episode.  It's in a tiny space on Penn Ave in Lawrenceville.  Tram is a gentleman who doesn't like it if you're not ready to order immediately when he comes to your table.  Because you only get about 2 minutes to look at the menu, the pressure's on when you sit down!  The food here is tasty and inexpensive.  The Pho is perfect on a cold winter day.  I'll agree with other reviewers that the spring rolls are delicious as well.  It gets pretty crowded during the weekday lunch rush.  Recommended if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many great stories about this hole-in-the-wall place in Bloomfield-Lawrenceville section of the city, gave it a try, but was somewhat disappointed.  Ordered Saigon soup. The broth had no depth and was quite bland, almost as if the boiling of the bones was done with only 30 minutes of cooking instead of 3 hours.  The meat were rectangular slabs of processed meat, as in Hormel Spam.  The vegetables were a few leaves of iceberg lettuce.  There was very little in the delicate blend of Oriental flavors.  This was a cheap truck-stop meal, prepared without love, using mass-produced and heavily-processed inexpensive food sources that one can get at Restaurant Depot by the case.  On the plus side, the bowl was a dollar less than at other Vietnamese restaurants in the city. But I think I will now pay that extra dollar and get some real pieces of meat."}
{"text":"It's about 2.5. We live in Squirrel Hill with a lot of good restaurants and I thought this place is better than where we usually go. The pho is the cheapest in Pittsburgh but the portion is very small. The spring roll is the most expensive vietnamese spring roll.  I ordered the Saigon soup for myself and #17 for my husband. My husband likes it because he is an america and like sweet stuff. Everything with coconut is good for him. These dishes we got doesn't look like what they showed on the photo. The Vietnamese place in Squirrel hill or the stripe is a lot better."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place. Although it's nothing fancy in terms of decor, it makes up in reasonably priced Vietnamese food. This place is BYOB which is a total added bonus.  When I came I was craving something kinda healthy so I opted for some of the pho. My husband also opted for this option as well.  I really liked the fact that wait was pretty short and the apps we got which were spring rolls really were delicious.   The pho itself was excellent, came in with a little dish with fresh basil, limes, and bean sprouts to add to your bowl. The broth by itself was amazing. The meatballs in my dish were also very flavorful, and added a more depth to my pho.  My husband had the Saigon Soup with pork and shrimp. Both soups were just amazing and just perfect for a chilly night.   I am honestly glad I found this little place. It looks so unasuming from the street, but it is just a jewel. Check it out."}
{"text":"I tried this place, there food is good. They make the best egg rolls.  I never had to wait  long for a table also. It is BYOB"}
{"text":"I pretty much got my dad obsessed with pho when my family came out to California for my graduation in April. Everytime he calls me now he asks if I've had any pho lately. So, when I came back to the 'Burgh for a visit he was all about finding a Vietnamese place in the city to get some more.   My parents and I had spent the afternoon in the Strip District, and enjoyed a few beers at Roland's before heading over to Tram's for dinner. We were hungry and the portions were huge, tasty and the reasonably priced. We decided to get three different entrees and all share. Obviously, we got the pho with beef, the fresh spring rolls, a spicy/bbq shrimp plate that came with white rice, and a vermicelli bowl with pork.   Everything was pretty tasty. The pho broth was a little salty for my preference, but it had a wonderful lemongrass aroma and taste. Also, usually I get fried or garlic rice with any rice dish I order from my favorite place in Cali, but the shrimp was very good and not at all over-coooked, as so many places do these days. The vermicelli dish was right on, and other than the fact that I prefer egg rolls to spring rolls, those were tasty as well, especially with the dipping sauce they provided.  I'd give this place 3 and a half stars. It was, overall, a good dining experience and service was quick, despite the neighborhood being a little sketchy and the inside being a little divey.   Also, a personal comment. I firmly believe pho is a miracle cure for the cold/flu. Anytime I get sick I head over to my pho place and order a huge bowl with beef and then add plenty of Siracha sauce. I always wake up the next day feeling like a million bucks.  So, if you're feeling sick (especially around this time of year) try it out. Even if it doesn't work for you, you'll still get some tasty food : )"}
{"text":"if you're going out to vietnamese for the food, go here. if you're going out for the ambiance, go somewhere else. when you walk into tram's, you'll be seated and handed menus and approximately 45 seconds later be asked if you're ready to order yet. the staff is pretty get-in-get-out-get-going style. it is byob though, which is pretty cool too. i ordered the beef pho soup. i really enjoyed it. like i said, if you're going for the food itself, you should definitely check this place out, it's pretty damn good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. Spring rolls, egg rolls, lemon grass tofu appetizer, pho are an absolute must!! So authentic and delicious"}
{"text":"Like a couple others, I'm really not sure what all the fuss is about this place.  I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle where you can find some of the absolute best Vietnamese food.  This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor.  I don't mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with.  I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice.  My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl.  Our food came fast enough and it was served hot.  However, my dish was nothing to brag about.  It was pretty average tasting Asian fare.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality.  Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.  My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles.  The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll.  The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all.  It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion.  The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something.  It almost looked like boiled ground beef.  I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious.  As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars!  Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for.  I don't understand this either.  The rolls were extremely bland and chewy.  The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.  Also, please take note they only accept cash and no cards."}
{"text":"Tram's Kitchen satisfied my craving for pho. But with most cuisines in pittsburgh, i had to lower my standards. I understand that Tram's has to inflate their prices to $9 and serve a stingy amount in order to get their ingredients here due to the slow cultural traffic in this city. It's just not within their power. A lesser star goes towards the fact that the broth was not completely filtered through and I saw more than I wanted of the cow's body parts besides the roundeye fillets. To reiterate: the serving sizes was TOO small and TOO overpriced pho."}
{"text":"Was visiting the city so I decided to try this place, even though it was away from DT area. The service or aesthetics aren't great at all, but the food and price compensated! I tried the vegan spring rolls and pho (the tofu they use is very tasty! )"}
{"text":"I've been to Tram's several times, always hoping for a better experience, and more importantly, better food.  I eventually gave up.  The food tends to be bland, the owner brusque, and with Pho Minh just up the street, I find myself going there when I'm craving a hot bowl of pho on a cold Pittsburgh winter night.  Food highlights -     None that I can really think of.  The food is cheap.  Food cons -     The component that makes or breaks a bowl of pho is the broth.  It is the one thing that must be good for the soup to be enjoyable.  I've never had any hint of real flavor from the broth itself (before you add the plum sauce and the srirachia and basil and lime).  This is something that Tram's has gotten badly wrong every time I visited."}
{"text":"Trams has Vietnamese food and it's in Pittsburgh.  So if you're craving spring rolls with peanut sauce or vermicelli with fish sauce and fresh herbs, this is the place to go if you're in Pittsburgh.  Be forewarned - if you've had Vietnamese food from places with large Vietnamese populations, Trams satisfies an urge but it's definitely not the greatest.  They're stingy with the herbs and the peanut sauce; a bit on the expensive side for this kind of food (especially for being such a dive); the pork is dry; and the vermicelli bowls are pre-mixed - even the fish sauce has already been dumped in."}
{"text":"I've eaten Vietnamese food all over ... from Little Saigon in Orange County, CA to Seattle to NY.... and this place ranks up there with the best of em. But don't come to Tram's for decor or ambiance. Everything inside is very bare bones...you'll get a chair, some chopsticks and sriracha sauce... but  you're guaranteed to get a delicious and a very economical meal. The food was very fresh and filling, and the restaurant pulls in a steady crowd. The pho is excellent, and they also have menu options for vegetarians. This place is a hidden gem among the restaurants in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"First time here. Its a small place but has a friendly atmosphere. I had a bowl of combo ph? with beef, chicken and shrimp. It came out quick, tasted great and I left feeling better than when I came in."}
{"text":"Very good choice. The Pho was excellent as were the rice noodles with chicken.  Very simple place - you'll go for the food not the atmosphere.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I love pho and it's always my hangover meal. my first time here. I ordered fresh spring rolls and pho combination with meat outside. The fresh spring rolls were brough out within a minute so it seemed more like it was premade. Pho comb didn't have the usual beef  ingredients and the slices of beef weren't too fresh, because the color was brownish instead of pink. The noodles were very chopped up as well. I understand every restaurant has their own style but this is definitely not my favorite. The check was place to my table when I was still eating, and it was CASH ONLY. An ATM was right outside and of course I have to pay charge fee to take out cash. The most unacceptable thing is that they charge extra for having the meat outside, like who does it?!!? Just like McDonald charges extra for buying 2 burgers and pack it in 2 separate bags. WOW!! Unbelievable! Personally I won't go there ever again. I think I still like the Vietnamese place on strip district better."}
{"text":"Tram's is lovely for what it is -- a hole in the wall Vietnamese no-frills noodle shop. The table service is spotty, but colorful. The menu isn't extensive, and really, I don't know why anyone orders anything other than the following things: spring rolls, Vietnamese spring rolls, vermicelli with onion (pork or tofu), vermicelli with coconut milk (pork or tofu), Saigon soup, pho, satay soup. Things are served with the right accompaniments and things are always fresh and well-prepared.   Tram's isn't a place to take your boyfriend's parents to impress them (unless they like good Saigon soup and plastic tablecloths), but it is a great place to take friends. Smile at the staff and they smile back. The food is delicious and the place has charm."}
{"text":"I have NO idea what people see in this place. I'm just going to assume they've never had Vietnamese food that was actually good in an atmosphere that was actually clean.   I felt so dirty sitting in this place and the longer I sat there, the less I wanted to eat anything. The water tasted like they just dunked the glass in the toilet.   I don't remember what I ordered - probably because I was not happy with the minimal menu and just chose something. I do remember not being able to finish it because it was so awful.   There were 3 of us in our party and we all agreed that the food was gawd awful and would never return.  I think this is one of those \"hipster\" joints that only gets good reviews because it's the hip thing to do.  Oh, and by the way, fish sauce is not vegetarian...and it's in everything."}
{"text":"Trams is, IMO, the best Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Although their menu isn't huge and they don't offer my favorite noodle soup, bun bo hue, everything that I've tried is super yummy! Plus, they have good prices!   I always start out with fresh spring rolls. I think they could use a little bit more fresh herbs in there, but their dipping sauce is really good. I'm also a huge fan of the mixed/special vermicelli noodles. It comes with tons of grilled and shredded pork, a crispy spring roll, and veggies on the bottom. Always enough for two meals too.   Service is always very quick as well, and the owner is really friendly!"}
{"text":"Trams kitchen is by far my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I always order pho when I come, and it has never fail to disappoint. They're very authentic and tasty. I should branch out and try something else next time. I will update my review if I do. The only thing I have to complain is that they only accept cash. I would come here more often if they take cards."}
{"text":"My favorite spring rolls in Pittsburgh. I always get extra for lunch the next day.   Also, this is my favorite place for Pho.   The owners are always super nice and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Two things I order each time I'm here: Pho and spring rolls. Been coming for a couple of years and the food has always been fresh and tasty. I'm thankful to have them so close to home as it makes for a nice little walk when the weather is decent."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 14 and had an amazing dinner! There was no trouble getting seats together, and the staff was wonderful. I ordered the Saigon Soup, which was probably the best pho I've ever had! Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Tram's is one of the best options for quick and healthy vegetarian/vegan food in the Lawrenceville area.  I am obsessed with the \"tofu and veggies\" (same item on the appetizer list and the noodle entree section)-- it is a cold dish with a piquant, vinegar-based sauce and lots of fresh herb leaves with julienned veggies and a well-cooked tofu with an excellent texture.  I crave this stuff.  It tastes so good that it's shocking how healthful it actually must be.  Other favorites are the spring rolls, the vermicelli with tofu and vegetables (hot dish with a different sauce and vegetables), and the pho soup.  The complaints in other reviews are spot-on: it is cash only and BYOB, a bit cranky and rushed service-wise at times, and not the most restful decor and interior (noise from tv and staff's children and dated plastic tablecloths/decor).  Don't let that stop you from going."}
{"text":"Reading all the positive reviews here led me to believe that this was a great Viet restaurant. I was really disappointed. It's sad for me to say that even NYC pho was better than what I had here. The pho broth from Tram's was sweet. Yes, that's right - sweet, with barely any savory. And the cha gio (spring rolls) tasted a little bland and chewy, like it wasn't just freshly fried. The older gentleman (who I assume is the owner) was telling another set of customers that he used to have a restaurant in Vietnam before coming here. I don't know what he brought over but it didn't taste anything like what I grew up with. The menu itself is definitely affordable, but if they can't get the basics right, I doubt I'll come back here for anything else."}
{"text":"Dropped by here today with some friends for lunch. It was not busy at all and it was quiet (which I hear is rare). All three of us ordered beef pho and the food came out quickly. Portion size was decent, food was hot, and very flavorful! Delicious! Service was good and very polite."}
{"text":"I do have a special place in my stomach for Tram's kitchen and I try to eat there every now and again.  Pho is a good meal to warm you up in the winter and this place is a great place to stop in for a yummy dinner.  I have been a little wary to go off the beaten path of the spring rolls and the Pho, so I got the spring rolls and the chicken peanut soup (I think that is what it was called).  It was very close to the chicken Pho, except it had less noodles, more veggies, and a little different twist on the sauce with some crunched peanuts that settled at the bottom and a bit more spice.  The dishes definitely didn't disappoint.  The parking is on the street (which is usually pretty empty after working hours), and the ambiance seems to have perked up a little bit with what I think is a new coat of baby blue paint and some new flowery table cloths.  Don't worry though, the mother of pearl wall art is still there, and your chances of not understanding your server is still high.  The prices are cheap, the grub is good, and the place is uh... rustic, oh yeah, and bring cash!"}
{"text":"For many people in Pittsburgh, Tram's is the only place to be to get pho.  For me though, whenever I go, I always leave disappointed wanting more.  Their saving grace?  Their spring rolls are easily some of the best of the Vietnamese variety in the area.  I find their pho to have small portions and to be of inconsistent quality.  If the I find the broth is good, they might ruin it by dumping a good 6 shakes of black pepper all over everything before they serve it (wtf?).  Other times, they might serve beef cooked well done as opposed to the rare which I prefer.  Or maybe they will give me my beef rare, except the broth will be so lukewarm that zero residual heat passes on to the beef.  Their spring rolls though are good.  Fresh and wrapped tightly, they help make the long wait time it takes for pho to be brought out more manageable."}
{"text":"I haven't had Pho since I moved to Pittsburgh, partly due to the lack of ethnically diverse cuisines here. But I must say that this place does a good job in bringing one of my favorite comfort foods.  Although the broth isn't super rich and deep, it still has lots of flavor. In fact, I like how light the broth is and how it isn't heavy. I had the Shrimp Pho, which was delicious; the shrimps were also tender and not overcooked. The serving size was pretty big too, so  you get your bucks' worth.   Bean sprouts, Thai basil, onions, and lime wedges are served alongside as add-ins when you order soup based dishes (Cilantro is already added to the soup). However, I noticed that these garnishes were a bit limp and dry, not fresh.  The spring rolls were a nice start, but I would say that it's a bit dry. If you're sensitive to cilantro, do not order it, because it comes with a good amount inside.  Also, this place is CASH ONLY, so come prepared."}
{"text":"Ordered the fresh spring rolls, they were the bomb! Followed that with the tofu vermicelli bowl and it was even better. Just the right amounts of everything and it was perfectly seasoned . Also tried the tofu fried rice and that was even better than the vermicelli bowl! Great flavor, big portion and left a happy camper."}
{"text":"Tram's kitchen made me feel like I was back in Vietnam again! The exterior and interior resembles that of the typical restaurant back in Vietnam (Except back at home we sit on little plastic chairs)! I had the Pho and it was flavorful. The table besides me was just eating lychees for dessert. I've never felt so at home at a Vietnamese restaurant in the states.  The place is very casual and is cash-only. I would highly recommend this place for an authentic Vietnamese experience!"}
{"text":"Only been there once and I ordered the Pho Hanoi; I would say that even though their Pho Hanoi has noticeably less ingredients than that at Pho Minh, the chicken was absolutely the best chicken I've had -- probably chicken breast -- as opposed to the usual chicken \"unknown parts\" that one usually gets at Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants ...."}
{"text":"I ordered party strays for my dad funeral. Their  foods was so disgusting.  Egg rolls was black for over cook, a lot greasy in fried rices, Vietnamese salad tasted like sugar... Food was packing poorly, some of them pill in my husband new car, it took him forever to get  rid of the smell. After all, most of the foods end up in the trash cause we couldn't eat them. I never go back there again."}
{"text":"While drinking my morning joe at Constellation across the street a local suggested I try this place. It was fast and fairly tasty. I had the vermicelli. I'm from Houston and we have some of the best pho places in the US. So I'm a little spoiled. Place was clean food was ok."}
{"text":"I love Tram's. I don't know much about Vietnamese food, but it has been my experience that the best fucking Vietnamese food in the whole world is tucked away in this little gem."}
