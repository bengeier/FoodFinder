{"text":"They have really good pizzas- if they are not burnt! It happened to us twice, receiving burnt pizzas. We only realized it upon getting home and my kids were too hungry for me to haul the pizzas back to the store. Wrote to the shop a few times and received no reply. Very very disappointed that we spent over $50 for these. The owners do not even have the courtesy to return my messages to apologize. Check your pizzas before you leave the store."}
{"text":"This pizza is really amazing. I got the vegan eggplant special and a pepperoni pizza. I also got the cheese bread and Cesar salad.  I don't recommend the salad, the dressing was good but it had bacon on it so it wasn't really traditional.  The pizza however is super thin crust and deliciously flavorful.  It's SO much food though.  Two pizza is enough for 3-4 people if you get cheese bread as well.  Highly recommend!  Especially if you like complex flavors."}
{"text":"I am so glad I discovered this place! The pizza tastes great, price is super fair, the service is great and super quick, the location is convenient...I can't think of anything anyone would be able to complain about. With some of the best pizza in the city, I'm sure I'll be back every week or two."}
{"text":"Disappointing pizza, even Pizzaiolo is better. Really the worst pizza I've eaten in Toronto. Was so excited to try due to all the great reviews and photos on yelp but completely didn't match the expectations nor quality."}
{"text":"I think their pizza is one of the best in Toronto. The sausage one is my favorite. They also come out really fast, ready in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"This pizza place serves up some of the best pizza I have ever eaten and revolutionizes the pizza scheme in Toronto with their thin delicious crusts and brilliant original pizza ideas (although they also serve the good old classics). The cashiers are always very friendly and they make every single pizza fresh when you order it. This is an amazing place with pizza that is better than Italy\"s i highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the City!!!!! Fresh and tasty.    Must Try"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and called ahead because I didn't want to wait there while they made my slice. The girl on the phone laughed when I asked for pick up for a slice and then told me it would be ready in 5 minutes which was no problem because I live so close. When I got there the girl made another comment about how I called ahead for a slice and that she's never had anyone call about that before. She was pretty rude about it and I don't know what kind of business plan includes making your customers feel stupid but whatever.  What really made me mad was that when I got there she called over to the cook about the slice and they started cooking it then! So I still had to stand and wait there! Why did I even bother calling ahead then?  To make matters worse, when I got home and looked at my pizza it was undercooked, soggy and half the cheese was falling off.   Thanks Za Pizzeria. You just lost yourself a customer."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza - the best pizza we have had outside of Europe.  Finally amazing pizza in the Annex/Seaton Village.  Try them - you won't leave!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had in my life.   I live in the neighbourhood and did not even know that they serve vegan pizza at this place. I really don't know why but I decided to walk in today and ordered the only vegan item on the menu(Tomato Sauce, Saut√©ed Mushrooms and Zucchini, Peppers and Cauliflower & Macadamia Nut).   I visited Rome once and had some of the best pizzas topped with only vegetables, tomato sauce and no cheese. The vegan pizza here wins by a big margin. I did not think I would ever find a place that makes pizza better than the ones I went to in Italy."}
{"text":"Thin crust, delicious sauce and cheese. Only problem is deciding which pizza to get. Very possibly the best pizza I have ever had! ..... did I mention they're also cheap and quick, because they are."}
{"text":"We bought two pizzas - the margherita and the eggplant parm. While the dough was tasty, both pizzas were burnt on the bottom. Most of the crust was not edible due to this, and there were not enough toppings. Not worth the $30 I paid."}
{"text":"We're usually Pizzaiolo fans, but this place is a great new addition to the pizza scene. We got a half-and-half: I chose funghi, and he chose pepperoni. It went really well together, and it was perfect for two people.   Although there are only a few window seats at the front of the restaurant, this shouldn't be a setback to anyone who likes picnics in the nearby park located just north of Bloor and Walmer."}
{"text":"Great restaurant quality pizza at takeout prices.  In fact i like this much better than the neapolitan sit down place next door.  One tip, eat soon after ordering, it doesnt taste that great cold, the funghi is amazing when hot but cold not so much."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had in Canada!! The first time I went here I got a (freshly made on thaa spot) slice and legit took it behind an alley and inhaled it. Couldn't even make it home! #epicza !!"}
{"text":"It's about time I update my review of this place - I had one bad experience here. Since then, I have been back many times and each time, I am blown away by the pizza.   My absolute favourite part of their pizza is their vegan options - I have never tried the vegan pizza on their regular menu, but I have tried two of their vegan specials. Each one was AMAZING. And the best part - they don't use Daiya brand fake cheese, which is full of chemicals and leaves me bedridden for days with a migraine. Instead, they make their own nut based cheeses. This is definitely a rarity among vegan pizza options in this city.   Tip: Order your vegan (or non-vegan) pizza with garlic rolls. If you're vegan, they'll make a vegan option. If not, enjoy your cheese. :)"}
{"text":"I live close by and was craving pizza. My pizza was okay. I had a slice for about $6, and it was very thin with minimal toppings, so I was still really hungry afterwards. They have the flavours right but not the execution/quantity. My pizza sauce was dripping down my hand and due to being thin was difficult to eat without utensils. Nothing very memorable, I'd rather go down the street to another pizza place to get more bang for my buck.   In my opinion they would be more successful if the pizzas were a little bit thicker and if they were a little bit more generous with topping quantity. They do have great pizza flavours but they fall short when it comes to presentation...customers should feel somewhat full/satisfied after a $6 pizza slice. I would maybe try again if those things were resolved."}
{"text":"So good! Pizza is always good, but this was top shelf. The crust is soft and thin, ideal. Just got a cheese, and it was perfect. Did not need any toppings for sure."}
{"text":"With 8 pizza places in walking distance, this is my go-to. Za specializes in Neapolitan-style pizzas with excellent classics and creative monthly specials that keep you checking in.  Of their Classics, my recommendation is the funghi. If one of the specials when you stop by is sausage, rapini and maple-cured chilies be sure to try it, sweet and spicy goodness.  Service is quick & friendly and one pizza serves two, though it wouldn't be tough to polish one off alone."}
{"text":"I dropped in here on their 10th day of business. I walked in to check it out and was a little confused. I wasn't sure if it was a sitdown restaurant, a takeout restaurant or an online ordering restaurant with pick up only. There is a small seating area inside the restaurant that consists of about four or five bar stool seats. There was a family sitting at the window enjoying their pizza which meant that there were no seats available. I had to walk down the street to find somewhere to sit to eat. The staff was very friendly and explained that they are a brand-new business. They took the time to explain how their menu work switched was helpful.  They have an extensive menu of traditional and creative pizzas. The crust is very thin and fresh. Taste is very good. Everything is brand-new inside and very modern. I ordered a slice which was very good and well priced at $3.50. They forgot to put napkins inside my take-out bag and I was a little bothered by the fact that both of the people making the pizzas were eating toppings and slices while making pizzas for customers. All in all it is a nice little shop but I think next time I will try somewhere else with a few more seats to sit down."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent pizza.  Don't plan to eat there, the seating is very limited.  Also call ahead to pick up if you can, it'll cut down the wait time."}
{"text":"Less than mediocre. I'd rather eat Amatos. I'll stick with North of Brooklyn for slices."}
{"text":"Went here the other day and ordered the meatball pizza -it was sooo soo good!!  I will be back to Za very soon but I am going to make sure I order ahead."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza place. Best thin crust pizza we've found in Toronto. High quality ingredients all made in house, with creative and classic combination. Order a half pizza with a garlic roll. Their rolls are insanely good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for phenomenal pizza that won't take a bite out of your wallet, this is the place. Just a great spot. Check it out if you haven't been already."}
{"text":"Hell, am I enthused about Za! There is finally a bit of new life on this classic stretch of Annex highroad and this spot is THE highlight among a smattering of new players (e.g. The Common, Oh!, Union juice, etc.).   When I was picking up a pie the other night there were lots of other folks around my age with the same idea... I hope the chefs/owners are ready for the massive patronage that is likely to build in this 'hood!  I have tried a slice of the signature Oh-Canada (Maple Syrup, Mozzarella, Crispy Bacon and Potato Chips). A bit too sweet for my liking, but it's absurdly tasty for just one slice or a treat. I have also tried the Smoked Tomato & Arugula (Garlic Butter, Mozzarella, Tomato 'Bacon', topped with Arugula, Diced Tomatoes, and Smoked Tomato Aioli). Just great. Their specials always sound appealing to me, as well as most of the classic, signature and feature pies on the menu. I will probably try everything eventually!   I appreciate how they are adaptable and will do pick-up, half orders, mix-and-match, full pie etc. You can also just stop in for a slice. It's well priced and there's a little station set up with different oils, cheese, pepper flakes, napkins, straws, plates and a few spots to enjoy your food up front.   ZAAAAAAAA GOOD.  Update: At this point I've also tried the fungi (A+), peppers and pepperoni (tasty, but too heavy on the balsamic glaze), the house made sauces (dangerously good) and a monthly special too ludicrous not to try... Big Mac pizza (i.e. Big ZAc)!"}
{"text":"I had the privilege of passing by Za on their first day. They offer thin crust pizza by the slice, half-pie, or whole pie. Completely different than any other take-out pizza I've had in Toronto - more akin to classic tavern style pizza than anything else. The sauce, cheese, and toppings were first-rate gourmet quality and the slice was delicious. It was so good that I immediately turned around, went back to the shop, and ordered a pie. The customer service was excellent, wonderful people to talk to. Pizza was quick - slice or pie, only took 5 minutes. Would heartily recommend to anyone who is tired of the typical take-out options in the city, and it's a great answer to the proliferation of gourmet pizza restaurants around town."}
{"text":"Walking around the Annex and looking for a bite brought me to this little gem. I was lured in by the idea of pizza poutine (omg yum) but I went with a classic: half pepperoni. The pizza cost a little over $6 and there was a $2 garlic and chive dip that was a perfect accompaniment. The tomato sauce was fantastic! Too many places use a tasteless paste but this was chunky and saucy. Devine.   Here's how you eat it: You fold the pizza up, dip it and savour the slight spiciness of the pepperoni with the tang of the tomato sauce and the slight char of the dough."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite vegan pizza in the city. The crust is painted with olive oil, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They make their own vegan cheese using nuts, instead of the salty packaged kind.   The vegan Hawaiian pizza cannot be compared. It's also in a great central location."}
{"text":"Za Pizzeria does know how to make some good thin crust pizza, I ended going for the Oh Canada, thick was the size. Which i was explained as slightly smaller size against the whole, I think this was 14 inch vs whole was 16 and i think price different was couple of bucks.  So the pizza is made fresh as I did watch as they made it, no concern on cleaniness or cooking process, no health code violation.  The pizza was good but it was over powered by the maple and chips that you barely taste the bacon but that was my only grip, maybe i try a different pizza"}
{"text":"This is a fairly small pizza parlour but everything is made fresh.  They have about 10-12 different types of pizza and you can get a slice, 1/2 or whole pizza.  I ordered the vegan pizza.  It was mushrooms, grilled veggies, and some tomato sauce.    I thought the thin crust was amazing and had a nice crunch. In addition, the toppings didn't fall off, which is sometimes a challenge with vegan pizzas.  I believe 1/2 pizza was 8.50 plus tax, so essentially $10.    While the pizza tasted good, and I love thin crust, I thought there could have been more toppings and an offering of vegan cheese to make it more filling.    Will I be back? Sure, why not.  Will I make a special trip here just for this? Probably not."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in town!!! Fantastic pizzas, quick service and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's one of the best thin crust pizza places I've ever been to and the only one that makes it fast right in front of you (perfect for takeout). The prices are great and the pizzas are delicious. Hands down the best in the area. The place itself is new, modern, and clean.   They make their pizzas fresh each order and it only takes 5-10 minutes. Lots of options and cool specials. You really must try it."}
{"text":"I had the Funghi, and got the half with the extra side garlic buns, which have mozzarella cheese inside and taste amazing (you could just eat by themselves, you get 12 for $3.50), They shred some fresh parmesan cheese and herbs on the side and there is an assortment of special oils for a topping. Unfortunately I didn't realize that this pizza had goat cheese mixed in with the usual mozzarella, a cheese that I can't stand (not their fault). They serve it up on a wooden platter and it was made to order in about 5 minutes. Very quick and beautifully presented.  There are only five small stools at the window, I got lucky when two people left at once. They were also rendering a huge pot of balsamic vinegar on the stove top. This food is gourmet style and the staff are very nice and the place is clean, well run and cheerful. You can tell that they care about what they are serving. The prices are very reasonable. I took one star off because I found the crust to be floppy instead of a bit more crisp (my preference) and the topping was a bit spartan, (not much cheese or mushrooms). I get the feeling they will expand their business, this location is very small. Try it, you can't lose, and if the weather is nice, there's places nearby to sit outside.  Do yourself a favour and order the garlic buns, you'll die and go to heaven, they are so good.  Update September 10, 2016  They've doubled the price of the garlic buns now, over $6, making them not worth the time, as a nice little snack, they were great, but not at that price. You can eat a lot cheaper on that block. Too bad, too good to be true..."}
{"text":"This is my absolute most favourite place to eat in the annex...the staff is always warm and friendly and the new flavours every month are always fresh. Their points card adds up really fast too."}
{"text":"The Za vegan mushroom pizza was definitely up there with the best vegan pizza I've ever had (and I've tried my fair share of vegan pizza). The cashew cheese was unreal and the rest of the flavors and herbs blended so well together that I shamelessly at the entire takeout pizza in the car on the way home. I couldn't even wait.   I will definitely be going back ASAP to try the other vegan specials that they offer!"}
{"text":"we got the vegan option delivered and it was excellent. fresh, tasty, definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G I could eat the Oh Canada every single day. Thin, crispy, maple infused, topped with bacon and crunchy kettle chips.  Pizzas are not too expensive and really liking that they offer combined toppings.I also love that they sell pizza by the slice or 1/2 size. It's usually busy, so I like to call ahead and walk over (usually around 10 mins). There are a few seats in the window if you want to eat there. The best for quick, fresh, thin crust pizza in The Annex. PS. I am not a pepperoni fan but my sidekick swears Za has ruined pepperoni pizza anywhere else for him & at $12.50 you definitely get your moneys worth - the pie is wall to wall pepperoni."}
{"text":"First off, confusing/poor layout.  Cash is at the wrong end.  Cook is pestered by entering customers.  $5.10 for the meatball slice, small and limited ingredients. Check my picture, if you like your pizza BLACK and BURNT, you might love this place!  Cashier on Thursday may 28 very friendly, but don't waste time with asking for names for slices, annoying."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are divine. Great neighbourhood joint, with a nice sitting bar at the front to people watch as your wait/eat.   Always cooked fresh to order, even for a simple slice, in mere minutes.   Especially love the Margherita and Eggplant Parmesan pizzas, but they have a great range of specialty pizzas too. The side pizza roll thing (I forgot the name), is awesome, the vegan one was a delightful surprise for this non-vegan.   The garlic aioli dip was a favourite, but seems to have changed in recipe. Now onto the samba which adds a spicy touch to my ceremonial crust dips."}
{"text":"Placed an order through hurrier for a veggie pizza. Somehow, they thought it was okay to send me a burnt pizza... About a third of it was black underneath. I complained, they apologized and didn't offer to make a new one or offer anything to make me want to come back and give them another chance. There's way too many pizza places around to settle for this; I highly recommend walking the additional 10 or so metres to pick another, better, proper pizza place"}
{"text":"Za is amazing- it's the first place that's ever had me enjoying pizza (and I've tried many places with friends who actually love pizza).  Pizza is delicious with flavourful toppings and made fresh quickly. The crust (and this is what really got me) is wonderfully crisp and soft at the same time. Moreover, Za has friendly and efficient service. Keep up the fantastic work!  Za is going to be my go-to suggestion for best pizza in this city- if and until I find a better pizzeria. The chances of finding that pizzeria are slim."}
{"text":"Freshly baked thin crust. Delicious flavours innovative yet familiar. A must try. Had two slices of pure awesomeness. Great price too!  I keep on coming back to Za. Pizza has character.   Highly recommended. The best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Their margherita pie is pretty delicious but the mushroom/funghi pie is out of this world delicious. It might've been in the top 5 best pizzas i've ever had... Took off a star because they weren't very busy when we got there but still somehow managed to forget half of our order... we had to go up and ask about it before they remembered."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great price. Doesn't really offer much on the way of sit down eating but they are pretty quick to have your made to order pizza to you.   They bake their pizzas in barbecues so the texture of the crust is comparable to traditional Napoli style pizza. Very delicious. We live in the neighbourhood and grab a quick pizza for lunch every couple of weeks."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good, but the prices are super high for a quick takeaway joint. Try the pepperoni and peppers or the special, which is usually quite innovative! Friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Oh wow, the best vegan pizzas we've ever had!  We had the the \"Vegan\" and the \"Vega-waiian\" and both were fantastic. They make their own cheese (almond ricotta and a cauliflower macadamia nut puree) which is creamy and flavourful. MOVE OVER DAIYA!  The other ingredients were definitely great quality. Their pizzas are definitely a case of quality over quantity. Doesn't look like many toppings but you really didn't need more.  They have three vegan dips (garlic, roasted tomato, spicy zamba) which were all great and even better mixed together. Get them all. Thank me later.  A 14\" thin crust will feed one very hungry person. If two people, get two and save a few slices for the next day.  Also, they DO offer vegan garlic rolls which use their almond ricotta. Next time! Next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza at a fair price.  I had a half Oh Canada and a half chicken souvlaki. Why have i never tried chicken souvlaki pizza before?  Clearly awesome.  Ones without tomato sauce are better.  Parmesan oil was interesting.  Service was super friendly and didn't wait long.  Pieces were fair, and servings are big.  Absolutely recommend it"}
{"text":"This is some great pizza. I ordered the double garlic roll, Caesar salad, and the funghi.   The double garlic roll is off the chain. It's soft, gooey, and flavourful. I got the pesto aioli for dipping and it was a great match.   The Caesar salad had a good dressing, nice and lemony. A lot of croutons but still yummy!   The pizza is sooo good. Thin crust and great topping combination.   My only disappointment is (from the uber app at least) I couldn't order a half size. But that's ok I still don't regret it.   Will definitely get za from here again."}
{"text":"I have had the funghi and the pepperoni pizzas so far and they were both full of flavour and loaded with toppings. I was most impressed by the pepperoni pizza because the peps were not too crispy, cooked just long enough.   The crust is very reminiscent of a new York slice. Perfect balance between fold-ability, thinness and crispness.   To put a cherry on top, there's even a stamp card. Every 6th pizza is free."}
{"text":"I am very excited about this place. There's so few options in the area for good indie pizza.   I ordered pick up today and was very impressed. I ordered the whole margarita. Crust was thin and fresh and the pizza was cooked perfectly. Above all it tasted like quality, totally unlike all the chain pizzas around.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"Good pizza - price was about $18 for a whole pizza and a dipping sauce. The price is reasonable. The pizza isn't huge but good for two people. The quality is good and they made it quick! CAn't complain, will be back"}
{"text":"Crap.   They charged me $2.50 for a can of soda and they automatically charged me for a tip.   Seriously crap. Don't waste your money at this joint. Pizza is crap. I mean crap. I spent $16 bucks for two small slices that where paper thin.   Next time I'm heading out to Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in toronto yet! Tastes most authentic, the tomato sauce is excellent. Had the margarita with half roll. Prices aren't the best, but taste is great. Ordered urber eats delivery so got a little cold but I'm sure it'd be great dining in."}
{"text":"I do not often leave bad reviews, but this place is horrible and even after over a week I'm still suffering and disgust of this place, possibly ruined pizza for me. so this is what happened: Everyone I know had been raving about this place, the good thing slice oven baked pizza..I got to try it it will blow you away. It so worth the 25mins car ride or 1.5 hour bus ride down there for this place. Well f**k no. I wish I could've taken a photo of the pizza I gotten..I was in so much shock.i could barely talk.i couldn't believe that the so called pizza they served me was called edible food to them.. and that they accepted it, and that the people whom made it thought it was acceptable to serve.... It was completely burnt.l Ike burnt to a crisp , dead bodily set on fire burnt. and the guy who made it could dare to serve it to us... No standards here. I went with a few friends whom loved it here... Sadly I didn't ..  my friends just took the pizza without complaint... So I assumedthat \"hey, even burnt it would be good . Since the regulars are eating it.\" Well I was wrong this place is worse than the worst pizza pizza chain. Burnt pizza through and through. Charred on the outside and inside..  cooked under  5mins and u can charred it that much and serve it?!??! I know it's like $6 for 1/2 a pizza but please have some standards when you serv. The worst pizza I ever hard. Will never good back, even on their good say to give them another chance. The guy making the pizza even dared to ask us how was the pizza. I just wanted to yell and also for my money back. Plus I got sick from this pizza so did the other non regular that we with me, you can't and should not anything burnt beyond help not even to try it. Sadly my regular friend had to be polite and say it was ok. I was so upset with this place I wanted to call the city health inspector to check on them. Who serves burnt pizza to customers and dare ask and expect a good review ?!?! Talk about quality... Out the window here. Don't eat here unless you want to die from charred dough. My friend tried to convince me it was an off day and the pizza wasn't always like this... However, if they cared and had quality standards they wouldn't have served me that pizza. I would had gladly waited another 5mins for an non burnt one, I shouldn't have to ask if they had standards! I barely ate the damnned thing I ripped it apart to \"try it\" and tossed the whole thing in the trash. Waste of money. This place needs a standard to see to customers. You will nevr see me  There again. Plus I refuse and rebuttal anyone who said this place is good... It might have been but they have no standards and do not care about what the customers are eating,they do not deserve your loyalty. I deeply regret not visiting the pizza pizza I passed by to get to this place cuz at least I would get something edible even if it tastes like garbage, it was better than this 100x better. Anyhow, I can finally put this behind me now, and pretend this place doesn't exist as I hope it will not exist any longer if those standards stay."}
