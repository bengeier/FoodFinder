{"text":"So good! Service was excellent food came in generous portions and the price was fantastic. With the atmosphere and the service this place was a top tier restaurant. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant! The staff are amazing, they are so nice and attentive; the food is delicious, their super nachos (vegetarian style) are the best!!; and their drinks are strong and amazing. This is mine and the wife's go to restaurant when we want to stay local. They also have Mariachi Band Friday's and Salsa Saturday's!"}
{"text":"The service was good, the music is fun, and the food is almost authentic. I always eat the tacos asada at any Mexican spot. I will be back to visit during their weekend DJ fiestas."}
{"text":"Good chips & salsa.  They have sopes! quick service"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The staff is kind and hardworking:) wonderful traditional tacos! And very close to Carolina Juniors Volleyball club!"}
{"text":"Favorite authentic Mexican restaurant in the area.  Love the sopes and definitely ask for the sauce tray.  Their homemade enchiladas are tender and they keep the toppings simple (in a good way, avocados and fresco cheese).  Service is always good and fast."}
{"text":"Great food! The steak tacos are really juicy. I also had the chimichanga which was very flavorful. The elotes were really good, my first time having it. The only downside was the guacamole. It could use a little more salt and lime. All in all I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting on business and decided to get Mexican in lieu of the company choice of hickory tavern. I made a mistake, the food was tasteless ! They get two stars for the service, but it seemed to be almost too fast ...as if it was already prepared somewhere and had been waiting an hour for me to show up...never again!  Steak Sopas...might well have been cardboard."}
{"text":"To start off, I am in no way or kind a Mexican food expert, but I will say this is my to go place when I am craving Mexican food. My to go plate is the taco lunch special, I've also tried the chimichanga and they are both really good. The people here are welcoming. It's clean and fast service. Food normally takes 15 minutes to be ready and they provide chips.  They have a huge parking space which is a plus when you're on the run."}
{"text":"Vegetarian food is really good. Environment is really nice and service is great.   Would recommend anytime."}
{"text":"As far as food goes everything was honestly pretty average. Not bad, but I wasn't really impressed. What killed it was the price. We got a cup of queso, a cheese quesodilla, and a plate of nachos and paid $30. Every entree was equally overpriced and the tacos/burritos/etc were also expensive. I'll definitely not be coming back, and I'd consider a restaurant that is a better deal for the food you get."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Food is fresh and service is great. Had my birthday dinner there tonight and the staff was fantastic!  They even brought 8 complementary shots of tequila to top off the evening. If you're looking for great food, great service at a fair price, this is your place."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Definitely thumbs up on food, service was so so. Kitchen manager saved the day"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food near house. Seeing the previous Yelp reviews we thought we'd give it a try. Since it was early on a Monday afternoon, the place was dead! We had to call out for somebody to help us after waiting for a few minutes. In hindsight, we should have taken this as our cue to leave. Our server was friendly and attentive to our needs. However, our food was bland and left a lot to be desired. Also, the margaritas were very weak and tasted watered down."}
{"text":"Wow by far the most authentic Mexican food I've had!  Brandon, our waiter was really sweet and patient!  We ordered off the dinner menu. The burrito was huge and very flavorful. The fajitas were also really well seasoned. I had chorizo and steak.  The corn tortillas they make on site are really good!  Their chips were also fresh and they had 3 types of spicy salsas.  Try this place, the location and exterior are not too appealing but don't be fooled...its awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is good!  It's most likely not the best mexican you're going to say you've ever had, but it sure isn't going to be the worst either.    Very clean and good service on my first visit and I'm definitely going back soon.  I tend to judge mexican restaurants by their salsa and theirs is some of the best I've had.  I ordered the carne asada tacos with cilantro and onion and they were very good.  Rice and beans are whatever, but for what it's worth, they were good too and definitely better than average.    If you're looking for a good mexican spot, look no further."}
{"text":"Sooo good. Best Mexican food I've found in Charlotte, and the former Los Angeles residents I brought with me agreed. Tasty dishes, great margaritas, and their prices are really affordable. Highly recommend if you find yourself in that area."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food this is the place, it's the perfect place to treat yourself for lunch.  Taco Tuesdays is my is the best! You have to get their original style tacos they never fall short in flavor. Original style consists of corn tortillas, a meat of your choice, onions, cilantro, and slices of radish. Beef tongue and chorizo tacos are so good and for $1 a pop, you can't beat it;   All in all definitely worth a visit for cheap authentic food from Latin America."}
{"text":"I just had dinner at this restaurant and was not pleased with the food. Although it was Taco Tuesday and the tacos were half priced, the quality was not great. The soft taco shells were way over cooked and actually tough to chew. The other patrons with me both ordered the tacos and were not pleased. I ordered the Enchiladas Rojas and the plate came out lukewarm at best. The Roja sauce was not very tasty on the enchiladas and the refried beans were bland and  pasty. The best part of the experience was the chips and salsa, the interior decor, and the service provided by the server. There is a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Great little place. I ordered a bunch of tamales for a dinner party, placed the order the day before , when I went to pick them up, they were ready the moment I walked in the door, no questions asked. Everything was ready and the order was as it should be. The tamales were much bigger than expected  and moist! I was amazed at how they  held up even when I had to place them in the oven to warm them. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Place is good and so is the food especially the micheladas. My husband is a truck driver so we visit a lot of states and nothing comes close to this place so far."}
{"text":"On the hunt for some tacos de lengua and found them here.  I'm a taco truck junkie but didn't know where to find them here.  I drive by this place several times a week and I just liked the look of it and kept a mental note to come back.  I was on a mommy/daughter date and after enjoying some smoothies, we decided to go get some tacos.  When we walked in, there was only one other patron dining in but we also went at an odd time. After lunch and much too early for dinner.  We were seated immediately and after receiving a complimentary basket of chips with a side of salsa we ordered 5 tacos.  Three beef tongue tacos, one tripa de res taco and one chorizo taco.  I wanted to try something new and since I've never been wowed with anyone's al pastor taco, I gave the chorizo a shot after a suggestion by the waitress.  We got our tacos, our salsas/hot sauces with wedges of lime and a few slices of radish, just like we are used to.  The tongue taco was very tender and almost on par with our favorite food truck and had the perfect amount of cilantro and onion on it. The tripa taco was different because the tripe seemed to be deep fried because it was very crunchy, I'm used to it being more of a braised style but I really enjoyed the crispiness and the chorizo though a bit dry, had a nice flavor to it.  I was a little disappointed that none of the hot sauces were very hot and I just wanted a side of those pickled onions, carrots and habaneros to add some heat but at $2.00 a pop, I'll definitely be back.  And I wish that they doubled the tortilla on each taco because they are pretty thin. The place itself is a little dated but cute in its own way. There's a DJ on Friday and Saturday nights and I was told if you get there before 10pm, there's no cover charge.  The staff did a great job, was attentive and professional and even suggested we check out the candy shop.  We did, and found a few candies to try out but a lot of the stuff, we had no clue what it was but we were willing to experiment a little.  I was even told where I could find some taco trucks and Mexican bakeries and so I'll definitely be checking it out.  I'll definitely be back and hope to try their fundido, flautas and tortas next.  Fingers crossed, they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I love this place! The music is great and so are the food and drinks! Definitely my new spot!"}
{"text":"Su casa es Mi casa! Walked in yesterday looking for some take out tamales. I was greeted by a very polite and knowledgeable person who walked me through all their various varieties of Tamales. I am old school as I am from New Mexico where the standard of Mexican food is very high. I grew up with fresh food at home and the food I took out of this restaurant brought back memories of my childhood. It was truly a great and exciting time for me as I have a very hard time with all the yuppy food others are trying to pass off as genuine. THESE GUYS ARE THE REAL DEAL. I will recommend them to all my friends and hopefully they will stay afloat long enough to become one of my favorite haunts.   If you can read this review, THANK YOU for such a wonderful experience...you will be seeing me again soon. I will be looking at your beans and enchiladas next time and will be dining in."}
{"text":"We come here a lot due to the excellent bar next door and have never been disappointed, it's a great hidden gem that doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it's been completely renovated and is much nicer than a lot the placed in Charlotte, staff are friendly and I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Great Margaritas in fact one of the best I have had as a \"house\"  margarita in many years. The food was also really good. We will go back."}
{"text":"We have not had any Mexican since moving to NC... So my husband wanted Mexican food, being from Texas and all, and we have passed by this place several times so we finally stopped in. We sat at the bar, which is what we prefer.  While my husband was in their candy store,  I waited to be served.  And waited.  My husband returned and surprised I did not order at least a drink yet.  One of the reasons we sit at the bar is for quicker service.   Finally a server came over and we ordered Negra Modelos. Upon his return with the beer, there were limes in them.  Never had that before.  Yeah, it's a Mexican beer but it's not a Pacifico or Corona.   We ordered the Milinesa, which was very delicious.  Because the food was so good,  we ordered a Milinesa  Torta to go. Huge mistake as it is the kind of meal that only tastes good when eaten fresh and not reheated.   My husband wanted a tequila shot. While he went to the restroom,  I attempted to order a shot. I asked which one had a smoother taste,  as I know this shot can have a bite from previous experience but, I digress. Apparently,  the server took this to mean I was asking for the cheapest.  He brushed me off and gave me a negative vibe as if he was insulted. By the time my husband returned he still had no shot. The server returned and again asked which tequila, directing the conversation at him only. He got one finally.    At this point,  I just wanted to go.  I felt unwelcomed and although the meal we originally ordered was good, I will not return here. Service can go a long way and I did not appreciate being dismissed like that."}
{"text":"Tried the chimichanga, queso, and house margarita.  This place has a very nice atmosphere, it's really interesting how they have a stage, and some billiards In another room. I didn't use them, but thought it was unique for a Mexican restaurant.  The staff was sweet, and everything came out as we ordered. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"So here's the thing, authentic Mexican food is fresh, filling and really not that spicy. I don't understand that perception but what evs, this place is fantastic. They make the corn tortillas in house and there is nada on the tacos except onion, cilantro and a wedge of lime. Sorry, but that's exactly how it's supposed to be.   Delicious. Friendly service and a clean dining room. Can't ask for more for 5.99 lunch specials (add Flan for 1.99).  The decor is atypical for sure for American tastes but looked very similar to many restaurants in Mexico.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently awesome. Taco Tuesdays is my jam! You have to get their original style tacos but I promise they never fall short in flavor. Original style consists of corn tortillas, a meat of your choice, onions, cilantro, and slices of radish. Beef tongue and chorizo tacos are so good and for $1 a pop, you can't beat it; not to mention chips and salsa once you sit down. They bring out three different salsas to go with your uh-mazing tacos and they're all delish. Let's not forget a $2.50 can of Tecate to top off the meal.   The service is also great! Their usual waiter, Raul, is the BEST! He's so nice, always has a smile and is very attentive with the diners! He really makes the dining experience worthwhile.   Overall this place is the best bang for your buck in the area and you'll definitely never go wrong on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had the pork quesidilla. I think this was the best pork I've ever had in a restaurant. If you're never been it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Was just like bing back in California! Missed my authentic Mexican food, and OMG...MARGARITA!  The staff immediately makes you feel like part of the family, can't wait to return to try another item on the menu!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 9:15pm after a visit to Carowinds Winterfest. There was one person eating at a table and a single girl sweeping up. After waiting for about 5 minutes she finally came over, I asked are you still serving...after asking what time it was, she looks at the wife and says \"I guess\".  Don't get me wrong, I know it's a Tuesday and it's 9:15 but you're open until 10...it's not like I walked in at 9:50 (which if you have a good restaurant should still mean the same level of service). With an answer like that and a look that felt like we had just insulted her we decided to walk out. The food may be good, but I'm not willing to roll the dice based on that interaction alone. We drove 10 minutes down the road to a Five Guys that also closes at 10 and we're immediately greeted with a smile and good food. In a world with some much competition for food you're first impressions are important."}
{"text":"Service good, nice atmosphere with several specials. Tacos with lots of choices. Corn grilled with chilli  seasoning that will make you want to come back for more!  I am impressed with food quality.  Guacamole is tasty, better when I added extra lime juice.  Chips were fresh with salsa, there is extra spicy if you ask.  Surprisingly not packed so this is perfect for dinner."}
{"text":"Solid but unspectacular.   The food was decent however there are other options in the area that are superior."}
{"text":"THIS IS MEXICAN. Great hole in the wall Mexican. $2 tocos, great drinks and knowledgable waiters. There is nothing like having a waiter that knows their liquor. He made top notch recommendations. The Chorizo tocos were AMAZING and the chorizo chimichanga was superb. Simply stunning the taste that was in my mouth.   FYI after 10 this place turns into a club. No lie. They push all the tables and seats to the walls and a DJ rocks the night away!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend their tacos and elotes! They are so authentic. Besides the good food and service there is also a Mexican candy store in the facility. A nice treat after a good meal."}
{"text":"Awesome! Jose, the manager is an expert bartender who really cares about this place. They lean more toward authentic style fare - sauces, etc than your standard ameri-mex restaurants. Fridays and Saturdays there's dance from 10p to 2am - I haven't gone yet but tonight sounds good! Food is consistently good and pretty quick even during the lunch rush which is quite a rush, drinks are affordable and well made, beer is just right. Survey says - definitely go here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. The food was fantastic but it was the exceptional service by Sara that sealed the deal. This restaurant clearly strives for excellence. Honestly I would give ten stars if I could. The owner is so friendly and interactive with the staff and patrons. We had so much fun! This was the highlight of our Charlotte trip! Love from the Prosser's from Pittsburgh and the Steel Blossoms from Nashville."}
{"text":"The tamales are sooo good. The drinks and prices you can't beat for the quality you get. Bar service is much better than dining room service but that's typical for Latin American restaurants from my own experience. As long as the food comes out fresh and the drinks keep rolling i generally don't have any complaints about it. I haven't done to go yet so I'm curious on how my food would hold so I'll def post a tip or review once I do. This place can't get busy when they have live music. Plenty of parking but they need to repave the entire parking lot. Check out their margarita weekly specials"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, as expected.  I usually eat gourmet, but the food is fantastic for the price.  Had a delicious meal with a beer, and bought extra food to go."}
{"text":"Spot is sort of \"off-the-beaten-path\" ... Had my friend not told me about it I would have never driven down the road and found it. Looks a little iffy from the outside, but the inside is pretty modern and updated. Everything looked very clean, and the bar was full with people eating/drinking.  My wife and I both got tacos --- pretty good! Nothing to write home about, but for the price I'll definitely be back. Our favorites were the chipotle chicken & the pineapple pork. If you come on Tuesdays, they have $1 tacos (with drink purchase I was told). Thursdays are $4.50 margs ... a fun place to come with some friends for cheap food and drinks!"}
{"text":"This place looks a little questionable from the outside. Don't let that fool you, the margarita's were on point. I went with a group of girls after work for some dinner and drinks. I have a pretty basic dinner, 2 Tacos loaded. They were good, no complaints at all. But my main focus was drinking and hanging out. I had Raspberry margarita's and loved them. They were not cheap with the tequila, I love when I don't feel like I'm waisting my money.   The manager or owner came over with tequila shots for everyone...twice... on the house. Who doesn't love that? Our waitress was the right amount of at the table, she knew we were hanging out so didn't bother us much.  She was really lovely!   The bathrooms were ok, clean enough. Nothing fancy, just enough. Just a tip.... the first stall is a tricky one. My friend got stuck and I had to unlock it with a dime :)   The Mariachi band was amazing, fun, good and we really enjoyed them.   We will be back, next time I will bring my kids. Totally family friendly. Margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!! Best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to! We come here a few times a month! Margaritas are made to perfection here! We are vegetarian so we usually get the super nachos with a ton of veggies like squash, zucchini, onions peppers etc so so so good!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Came here exhausted from carowinds, walked in and got great service was given drinks and chips immediately. Food was good and was reasonable price... Totaly agree with other comments tho- looks sketchy outside but super nice inside. Deff hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we found this place about two weeks before moving out of the Charlotte area. The outside of the restaurant is not impressive, but we entered anyway. Can't really find words to describe the interior. It looked a bit retro to me and I wondered whether or not they had done that on purpose.  We were promptly greeted and seated. There were ample choices (usual Mexican fare) on the lunch menu and regular menu. We received the salsa and chips (menu says first order is free). Chips were thick, without a hint of salt. Salsa was typical.  I ordered steak fajitas. Steak was negligible and cut in very tiny pieces, almost like it was scraps from a larger piece. It was tender, however, The fajitas came with rice and beans. Steak was accompanied by peppers and onions which definitely overshadowed the steak. Nothing else came with it. When I asked for some sour cream and cheddar cheese, I was told they only had Mozzarella cheese. In a Mexican restaurant? My companion had the chimichanga which he raved about. Flan was reasonably priced ($1.99) but tasted more like mousse than creamy flan with sauce.  Came time to pay and we told them we had a coupon. Were informed it was only valid during the evening, despite what was written on the coupon (that we had to make a $10 purchase). Not in the mood to argue, we paid the bill and left. When we got outside I discovered that I had been charge $1.99 for the Mozzarella cheese and $1.99 for the sour cream! That's almost $4 for items that I feel should accompany fajitas in the first place. I can see charging for guacamole, maybe $1 extra.  If not for the coupon and cheese-sour cream issues, I would have rated this one star higher."}
{"text":"It was merely ok. Many other quality Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. The fajitas were ok. The chimichanga was undercooked. Thought we were ordering the $5 margaritas but were charged $10 each."}
{"text":"Always love the food. I want to give a big thank you to the manager Jose. He took extra great care of us Thursday night."}
{"text":"The food, drinks and service is excellent and authentic. Don't the let the outside appearance or location fool you. The interior is very nice. Queso dip with Chorizo & pico de gallo was SOOOO GOOD! There were 7 of us and we all had something different and everyone left happy. Yummy margaritas too!"}
{"text":"Very yummy FRESH AND CLEAN! Very friendly and prompt waitstaff and there's a candy place next door!!! Love this place! This will be my spot for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The decor looks oddly modern not the typical Mexican restaurant decor.  They have a candy store which I find it pretty interesting they have all kinds Mexican candies and piñatas too. They play the music awfully loud and our table were right by the speaker did not help.  The chips were pretty hard it has like the fried pita texture. Salsa were bland.  Horchata taste really water down, no flavor whatsoever.  The fajitas were ok I didn't like the texture of the chicken.  My rice was kinda greasy Overall the food taste bland and it's passable but not great. The service is kinda slow and not very friendly and they don't really pay attention to you they basically just take the order and bring the food out to you. I think they're busy taking care the guys at the bar."}
{"text":"My first experience here was really bad, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it was Cinco de Mayo. I popped in on my way home to grab a couple of tacos. Wish I could have had a margarita too, but I'm currently prego. I was greeted within a couple of minutes with chips and salsa. Good but pretty standard. A few minutes later someone came for my order. I ordered right away. Then I was forgotten about. A family of 4 was seated at the table next to me, ordered, ate their entire meal, and their table was cleared away before my 2 tacos & one tamale came out. During my 40 minute wait all I did was watch a \"DJ\" while he played on his phone and rotated some seriously horrible music and flashed stage lights around the room. Kind of strange for 5:30pm. A manager never addressed my (lack of a) meal, and my waitress looked so terrified that I was going to get upset once she realized that I didn't have my food I just waited patiently without mentioning it. The food itself was ok. The tamale had decent flavor but wasn't temperature hot, the sour cream on the tacos looked completely liquified. I've seen lots of good reviews on the place and I'll give it one more chance. Hopefully next time is better."}
{"text":"My new go to spot for tacos and Mexican food. Probably one of the best ones I've had in charlotte. Very authentic food and friendly service. I will be eating here weekly!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my boyfriend to try it out. This is now my place to go if I'm ever craving Mexican food.   Our server was extremely friendly and understanding as we were taking our time looking through the menu. The dining area is also very welcoming and clean!   There were tamales and corn on the cob too (which is rare), or at least based on the places I've been to. It was delicious. Tacos were good too. They have the options of traditional or loaded.  Perfect place for me, I will be coming back soon to also check out their candy store."}
{"text":"I love this authentic Mexican restaurant. I'm giving it four stars because they're quite picky when it comes to giving you certain things I usually get my mean with chips and  salsa but you have to pay for it separately. Most restaurants give it to you on the house. But they're different here. But other than that it's a very clean family environment. I love the music that's played in the restaurant as well. Makes you feel like your in Mexico!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place many times, but what made me to come here was one of my friends that said the food was really good and very authentic. Since it 5 de Mayo Mu husband and I decided to eat some Mexican food and La Poblanita was the chosen one. I've passed by this restaurant so many times but never noticed it. I love the decoration inside and outside. The colors of the walls are vibrant and they have piñatas hanging all over the ceiling, so cool! We got there around 2pm and were sat right away. The waitress brought us chips and salsa that were really good and we placed our order. Their menu have menu options and pictures of the plates which I thought was cool since it helps you out when you don't know how the dish looks like. My husband and I had the exactly same thing: Beef Tostada, rice, beans and a grilled chicken taco. We both enjoyed our meal, was delicious, authentic and unique. The restaurant was busy but nothing too much, but even though our food took a while to get ready. Our waitress also took forever to bring our check and we had to ask for it twice. Other than that we can't complain, great food, great prices, cute place! They have a candy store at the restaurant with Mexican candy, my husband tried different kinds of chocolates and bubble gum, he felt in love and said they were the best chocolate he's ever had. If you like Mexican food you should try this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm a California girl transplanted to North Carolina and this is the only authentic Mexican food I've had out here and it's good! The carnitas is my favorite. My husband and daughter love the carne asada. Their premium margarita is perfect! Fresh squeezed lemon, lime, and orange with chosen premium tequila. Exactly how I like it, which says a lot! The staff are great, totally on top of their game, super friendly and attentive. There's no flash here just good food and drinks."}
{"text":"I came in for taco tuesday specials. Well this is real Mexican taco. Not the stuff from Taco Bell, and nothing like I've ever had before. Came in with my family. My mom didn't like her food which is to be expected. My son had hot dog and fries it looked yummy. They don't serve those nasty looking red hot dogs. My brother had wings and fries, the wings did look good as well, cooked to golden brown perfection. As far as tacos, I tried, chipotle chicken, grilled chicken, steak, and pulled pork. I enjoyed the grilled chicken and steak the best. Tacos are $1.00 on Tuesday. I also ordered a side of rice and beans. While I thought the serving was small, I enjoyed the rice because there are veggies in it. For the 6 tacos I had (they're small) I actually had just enough to finish off while eating my tacos. I look forward to coming back to trying something off the regular menu before I say I have found a new spot to frequent. Typically I get a chicken dish with rice and beans or fajitas. I also enjoyed my drink it was a margarita with a carona added. I'll give that two thumbs up. Not sure on the rating so I'll give it average right now."}
{"text":"Food was great, service as quick and pleasant at lunch time. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican place in CLT yet it's still accessible to most people. Cheap, too.   On Tuesdays they have a great special on tacos for lunch. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've only had the Texana fajitas and I probably will continue to get it because it's so good! Their pico is one of the BEST that I've ever had! Order extra, lol. My husband usually gets the Alambre which is like the fajitas except with gooey cheese and bacon (nom nom). You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Enchilada sauce was made on site, not out of a can, and it was dark, rich, and tasty...not talking about the mole.  Carnitas were fantastic, and the corn tortillas were top notch.  Quiet place, and service was excellent.  Great place!"}
{"text":"This place is banging great traditional tacos, not so great service sometimes but atleast the food is amazing and the orchata is good, I think I might of misspelled that but it's that white drink."}
{"text":"I have never in my life been so proud of a decision to eat somewhere ever in my life until I came to this place. We walk in and they have fun festive music playing. Dance my way to the table. Raul greeted us and was prompt, friendly, alert, and effective. The menu was easy to understand and the prices were unreasonably inexpensive. I ordered traditional tacos and a tamale. The carnitas taco was simply the best taco I've had in my entire life. The sauces and salsa were absolutely exceptional. The entire meal was spent discussing how happy we were that we made that decision to eat here. The absolute only reason I got a box was because I wanted to ration my food so I got to taste it again later tonight. Raul told us his name and gave it a personal touch by asking us to come in and ask for him. We joked that they must have made a deal with the devil to create food that spectacular. When the bill came we were shocked at affordable it was. I couldn't have asked for something more. The experience was wonderful and made my night. We will be returning on a regular basis to see our friend Raul and eat here. I am in love with this place."}
{"text":"The stars are for indoor ambiance.  Clean, nice solid furniture. Have driven past for years, never interested in stopping. Tried it today, nothing to it. I cook tastier food than the fare at the restaurant. Shrimp with garlic, was nothing to write about.    Will continue to drive past the building."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken tacos (btw taco Tuesday deal is only if you get a drink, so if you only drink water you'll still be paying the full price) with just chicken, lettuce and cheese on a flour tortilla. Came out with tomatoes on it. I sent it back, and the server came back in seconds and obviously the tomatoes had just been picked off then smothered in more sauce (which again, I only said lettuce and cheese). As soon as I picked up my tacos I realized they were corn, not flour tortillas. Server already seemed irritated with me so it wasn't worth bringing up. Very disappointing experience after reading the reviews. If you aren't picky you'll love it, but if you're like me and like your tacos only a certain way, be careful."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!  Stopped in for a quick bite while traffic calmed down and found a gem of a restaurant.  My husband had the chicken chipotle chimichanga (which he loved) and I had tacos. The corn tortillas for the tacos are homemade and delicious!  The waiter was very friendly and brought us various salsas to try.  They were all so fresh and fantastic!  We had the strawberry cake for dessert and it melted in our mouth.  We will definitely be back.... soon!"}
{"text":"Very good food here. Best in the city IMO. The place is clean & the staff friendly.  I have been here 20+ times & have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service. House margaritas are a little pricy compared to other places but they were good. They do have outdoor seating which is nice, even though it's a parking lot view."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and really loved it. Service was fast. Food was too and also, SO delicious. Real authentic Mexican food and all of the flavor was there. Mariachi band was also really wonderful and fun."}
{"text":"Food and service was very good and authentic and very friendly staff. Mariachi band nice touch. Priced right too."}
{"text":"Being on the other side of the city we noticed an unusual number of cars parked outside and decided to give it a try. Stepping inside the white tables and the white sofas are definitely an eye grabber. I loved the ambience of this restaurant! They had a complete bar, two snooker tables, lot of colorful banners hanging around, a little stage with some DJ like equipments. I was rather impressed! The menu was extremely colorful - we were even offered free shots of cinnamon and whiskey! We got some good nachos and salsa! We ordered our food and started digging in the chips with the great ambience and the good Mexican music. Everything was good till that moment - but then we waited for our food, we waited and waited! Finally came out some plates - then we had to wait for some more time till they completed the order! We had trouble trying to get the attention of our waitress as she was taking care of multiple other things across a large room. The food was okay. But finally after the bill came, we noticed they weren't same as advertised in the menu.   Ours wasn't a pleasant experience - may be I should try going there at a less busy time to see if it's really worth the star rating it has."}
{"text":"I loooove this place! They seem to be doing really well, so I hope they take some of their money to go a few much needed updates.   Update! They updated their floors and boy what a difference that made! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice service at the bar. Didn't have anything other than chips and salsa then a small side of guac. I've had better namely when I've made it at home but the sanitation score of 91.7 really curbed the appetite from the start."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from my house so one Friday on the way home we decided to try it.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and the \"patio\" faces the gravel parking lot so that's kind of lame.  Inside the décor is nice and it's very clean.  We were seated right away as it wasn't crowded and given chips and salsa immediately.  Both were tasty.  My husband had a margarita that was on special and it was very good.  I got a steak and vegetable dish and he got a chimichanga, both were enormous, cheap, and served quick.  I appreciate all of the above.  It's not going to win awards for atmosphere but the food is reasonable, really good, and worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place more times than I have checked in. LOL!!! I get so side tracked the second I walk thru the door that I forget unless I do it before I get out of the car. It is so much fun. Gone on different day/nites/items, but have always had a great time. Amazing energy!! The owner Jose is absolutely hilarious. Very infectious. The staff also works perfectly to keep the flow of the day or evening great. Drink specials are on point and the food is amazeballs!! Chips n salsa will keep coming until you explode.  If you love to dance than Fir. or Sat. night is for you. After 10pm they clear the center of the place and it's a dance floor with a stage for the DJ. Plays all different types of music that flow as the night progresses. For you pool junkies the y have a small room past the bar filled with a few tables so you can just drink n play if you choose. Also a small little Mexican shop to get candy, drinks, spices and very VERY weird pinatas.   FUN LAUGHS GOOD TIMES"}
{"text":"Was in here a few weeks ago with my roommate, and we just had a ball! The customer service was beyond excellent, the food is phenomenal, and the place is clean!   They made us feel like we were regulars (even though this was our first time in!) Not to mention their chips/salsa/queso is out of this world good!   Only not giving it 5 stars, due to the location and feel of the inside is a bit \"off the radar.\" However you know what they say and this place is definitely, \"A diamond in the rough!\"  Will definitely be going back on Thursdays for half price margaritas!"}
{"text":"Decided to try somewhere new for Mexican. The food was awesome and they were large portions. Free chips and salsa, pico and salsa verde. The staff was friendly and attentive! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the Orange building this place is great lunch or dinner. Food portions are just right and full of flavor. Be back again and again for sure"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant! The margaritas are awesome and the food is surely authentic. Can I get a live band please?!?! I don't wanna leave! 2 more chorizo tacos on the way..."}
{"text":"Food was nothing special. It took a while to be acknowledged and get a seat.  I would not return.  There are better restaurants for better prices."}
{"text":"Hands down awesome burrito! I got the marinated pineapple pork, so delicious. Just the perfect amount of spice which makes it perfect! Get the guacamole, so fresh! You will not be disappointed. Definitely will come back and so will you."}
{"text":"Well I go all the time if you are looking to eat or dance go on Saturday night is salsa all the way is the best salsa club come and see me and my wife go there all the time the food is excellent ."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week for lunch. Its authentic, delicious, the service is fast, and its inexpensive. They have a robust lunch menu which is usually all I ever order. I usually spend less that $10 on lunch. They have everything from tacos, nachos, burritos and so on. Great choices of meat too (FYI- they have lengua)   Full bar, great margaritas."}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here yet. I stopped in here the other night just by chance with one of my friends after our first day out by the pool for the year and when hunger struck Mexican food always calls my name. I really cant remember how we ended up here since it was a ways down the road from where we were.  Its located right next to The Trap bar on Westinghouse and while I have been there I don't remember seeing this place.   Let me start with the first thing I ordered which was a michelada which was on special for $4.....FOUR DOLLARS!!!! Yes I was already excited.. I am super particular about these and will absolutely not order them if the mix is not at least homemade. We sat at the bar and when I asked if the mix was homemade he just smirked at me and started to make it. I knew already it was going to be good. He used hot sauce seasonings lime juice it was made completely from scratch. It was to die for. I am now ruined for micheladas anywhere else. Not to mention this thing was huge it was a meal in itself. Now on to the food. I kept it simple and ordered nachos. There was literally nothing simple or boring about these nachos everything was fresh made the guac the chicken the toppings were super fresh especially the lettuce. These were hands down the best nachos I have ever had.  My friend ordered the Diablo shrimp I think was the name if it. I only tried one but it was amazing it was spicy savory and the shrimp were perfectly cooked too.   The staff was amazingly friendly and the place was very clean. They have plenty of parking outside in the lot they share with the trap. I am literally mad at myself for not having come here sooner and to say I will be back would be an understatement. I will definitlely be a regular here and cannot wait to try more of the surely amazing food."}
{"text":"Okay, let me start off by saying that I love Mexican food. I have had my fair share for sure. So, when I go to a new place, I always try to keep an open mind and not compare them to other places. That said, this place, hands down, is in my top 3 that I've been to in the US. I  I ordered the combo. I had a steak taco and a chicken tostada. It came with rice and beans. The star of the show was definitely the tostada. It was the best one I've ever had. The taco was really good, but don't expect the American version with cheese all over it. It will be very authentic. The rice was just okay and the beans were normal. But that won't stop me from coming back.   While I was eating, I peaked over near the side of the bar and noticed a sign that said \"Candy Store.\"  My eyes lit up like a Christmas tree! I've never had any Mexican candy so I didn't really know what to get or try. I thought I would take it slow and get some chocolate. Wow! It was so good and creamy. I will say this also, this candy is actually from Mexico and not just distributed in the US. I know this for sure because I loved the candy so much, I went to a Supermarcdo the next day looking for it and noticed the store only had the ones distributed in the US.   Try this place! Get you some tostadas and finish it off with some Carlos V Chocolate or some Bubu Lubu."}
{"text":"Three stars for service and nice decor.  Very clean.  Had steak fajitas he had chicken and shrimp fajitas.  Very bland.  Most bland Mexican food I ever had.    No seasoning at all.   Had to salt it and drench in salsa that wasn't very good.  Never did that before.  The salsas were not much.  None were even spicy.   It's like they think white people can't handle spicy food.   We both agreed Taco Bell would have been better.   What a shame."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever had! And I love Mexican food. Was traveling through Charlotte and came across this place. Had the chicken tostadas. Liked that it was grilled chicken and not the nasty shredded chicken Mexican places usually serve. I was just sad that I couldn't take my leftovers with me cause they would have gone bad before I made it back home to SC. Also sad I couldn't test out a margarita! It was a quick lunch stop en route back to SC. Very similar to the Mexican food found in Arizona/southwest. I'll definitely be stopping here again on my next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"As a South Texan, It is so terribly hard to not like an authentic Mexican place in Charlotte, I feel akward writing a less than positive review.  First, let me say that I have received nothing but glowing recommendations for this place.  Friends and family alike keep telling me that I'll love their food and atmosphere. Why? Because they all know I live for my chips, salsa, and guacamole.    Just the other day I was told I need to try this place out.  I had hesitated for a bit because I didn't want to start contemplating which Mexican place was best in Charlotte.  But, I decided to bite the bullet and jump in.  We came here tonite and received the boilerplate greeting. We headed to the bar and sat down without any fanfare.  After a few minutes I looked to my left and noticed that they had a candy store of some sort. Score! I am so into Mexican candies.  I shot over there and looked around for a bit and finally headed back to the Bar and asked a server if they had my favorite candy: coconut rolos. Yes! They had one left and I bought that without blinking.  And it was half the price of buying online. Schwing.  By the time I had headed back to my wife we had apparently been assigned a server. He never introduced himself, but later I would discover his name. The first time we met he asked what we wanted to drink; which tequila we wanted to drink actually.  I asked about the specials and the menu and this is where all the miscomfort seemed to begin.   Our server gave us a  menu and walked away.  He came back a bit later and we ordered a couple of unremarkable beers. It took a dozen minutes to get our beers and he had placed limes in the beers.  Guess that makes since for Tecate or Corona beers,  but we had Negro Modelos. Never had that before.   We finally got to order the steak Milinesa and also placed an order for a steak Torta to go.  The Milinesa was divine. In point of fact it was crazy good.  The refried beans were weak and the rice was just a bit above average, but the Milinesa and corn tortillas were freaking perfect.   My wife and I devoured the food.  Out server returned once to give us our Torta which we had ordered to go.  We tried to make small talk; Went so far as to joke  about the quality of Mexican food in North Carolina; He was not impressed.  We finished up the goodness and decided it was time for a bit more to drink.   I wanted tequila. I had not had that in a bit; And while I was visiting with the folks around me, my wife asked our \"server\" about Tequila shots.  She wanted to know which was smooth vs which might have a bite. He immediately took the question as \"which is the cheapest?\" By the time I came back and she mentioned the conversation he abruptly turned away from her and asked me to choose something to drink.  Ok. This was a gift drink from my wife.  I was shocked that he had blown her off; seems like he just wanted to make a sale.    Moving on.  I had my Tequila shot and got my wife a less potent drink and we finished up the nite.  After mentioning closing out twice we finally got our bill.  When it came, it was unremarkable. Not a bad value.   Like I said, I liked this place.  I really want to go again. I am just a little taken back by the server we had. Service makes all the difference. I feel like my \"server\" was anoyed and just wanted us gone. Man, it was a very stressful experience and I'll be hard pressed to get my wife there again.   Food in my opinion was high 4 stars.  Loved everything with a few minor observations that only folks who grew up eating Mexican would understand.  It was the service that killed my opinion of this place. It's a 1.    Will I go back? Likely for the candy store and for to go orders. Will I dine in? Not at the moment.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Had another great meal at la Poblanita. The whole family left happy and full. We had tacos, burritos, fajitas, and margaritas. Everything was great. Our waitress was a doll. Definitely going back again"}
{"text":"Very real Mexican food. Could be spicier. But good solid Mexican food! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We went here last night. This place was unexpectedly great!!! It was a cute little Mexican restaurant. If you like spicy, ask them for their spicy sauces to go with the chips and salsa it was pretty delicious. We went on a Friday night and there was a mariachi band which was super cool. They walked around and serenaded the tables and asked for requests. The food was pretty good. The taco was delicious. The only reason I gave them one less starves cause I got an enchilada and it didn't have any cheese in it, and usually every other enchilada I've had has had cheese so it tasted a little funny. We will def be going back though it wasa great little Mexican place."}
{"text":"One does not expect a 1960's Esquivel space age bachelor pad decor when wandering into a Mexican restaurant but here it is; looking like something out of Epcot Center/ opening year. The Kenny G flavored smooth jazz doesn't help matters much. By the time I was seated, my senses were very confused. Smelled Mexican, but it looks and sounds like The Jetsons.   My first step was to order a house marg, which came accompanied by chips. A little late - but pretty good if you ask for the hotter sauce and the verde to go with.   Carnitas seemed easy - they were a good sized portion served with refried beans and rice, a splut of guacamole salad and salsa with no cheese in sight. Carnitas lacked pizazz for the only Mexican restaurant that I'd describe as \"Kubrickian.\"  Beans and rice were passable.   I asked for extra tortillas and was told they would be extra. Always take points off for that.   The server was sweet and nice enough and the music choices improved  (kongos!) as time went on. It's not the worst I've had and far from the best. It's a place with a palpable identity crisis and that was foreshadowed by way of the \"Help Wanted\" sign on the front door.   I've heard they're bouncing back from an unexpected move and expansion, so here's to hoping they find the right combo that works. Right now, there's work to be done."}
{"text":"Great food,  atmosphere & service. Will be back to eat.   Karaoke on Friday & Latin Nights on Saturdays nights @ 9pm."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and tasty Mexican food. Nothing spectacular but it's all still quality Americanized entrees including fajitas and burritos and enchiladas and the like. Large bar with cheap beer too.  Service was also good.  It's a short review because, really, what more do you need to know?"}
{"text":"This was my first time at La Poblanita and it was good. I would go back again. On the menu is the usual Mexican fare, and I ordered the tinga chimichanga for $8.99.  And it was big and very good and came with a side of beans & yellow rice. This location does also sell hard to find candy straight from Mexico. Kids just love to go to the candy store inside the restaurant.  Nice meal. Lots of great parking.   Food C Staff A Decor B Location A Health Inspection Grade 94.0"}
{"text":"Pork awesome.  Cheese bland.  Rice not very seasoned and bland.  The salsa was outstanding. May try again, but definitely not what i was looking for"}
{"text":"They have the best tamales I have ever tasted in my entire life. I've been getting the chicken ones and I've gone there three days in a row now. Their service is great...And did I mention the tamales are OMG amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food, good lunch specials, and half price very good and large margaritas on Thursdays, had not been in awhile, went today with friends, had a good experience"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that La Poblanita opened here.  For those who are unaware, La Poblanita was forced to move from Plaza Fiesta at Carowinds Blvd since that site is going to be redeveloped.    They did not just move to another location.  They opened two locations...one in Rock Hill and this one here on Westinghouse Blvd.  Unlike the Plaza Fiesta location which was a limited service restaurant, This location is actually a full service restaurant with bar.    It is quite large inside with the bar off to the left and booths along the outside walls with a few tables in the middle on what appears to be a dance floor.  They will have entertainment here and they have a small stage.  There are also a few TVs on the walls.  They have a few bugs to work out yet.  Food service was a bit slow and the heat was not working on one of the coldest days of the year.  But they had a technician working on it while we were there.  The food is still as good as the old location and the menu appears to be larger.   I love that you have several different meat options for your meal rather than just chicken or beef like many Mexican places.  Prices are still very reasonable.  Their salsa is decent and if you ask they will provide a tray of 3 additional salsa to top your meal.    Give them some time to work out the kinks of the new location and I can see them doing well here."}
{"text":"Authentic. Family friendly in industrial area. Food worth coming back for. The most like Baja in the Carolinas."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to La Poblanita. From the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall, but really it was festive inside. I was greeted immediately and I felt welcomed.  I ordered the chorizo and al pastor tacos which were good, but not enough flavor as I hoped. When I compare the tacos to Anita's Mexican, they do not compare. Maybe the cooks were off a little during this busy lunch period, so I will return again to give them another try."}
{"text":"Being a transplant from California has made me picky about Mexican food. It has been difficult to find delicious Mexican since moving to NC but I have been pleasantly surprised by La Poblanita every time I visit.   The tortilla chips always come out warm and thankfully are only lightly salted. The salsa that goes with them is delicious! It has the perfect consistency between liquid and solid and a spice level that lets you know it is there without overwhelming.  My most recent visit I opted for the Pollo Fundido and it was amazing! They seasoned the tender chicken perfectly - and who doesn't want their meal smothered in cheese? The plate was huge and I was barely able to finish it all (possibly because of the amount of chips and salsa I had consumed before).   I am also quite partial to their nachos which I frequently order after I have spent some time at the bar next door. I cannot speak to the quality as a menu item but as a late night munchies food it has always been perfection."}
{"text":"I ordered the fajita styles shrimp nachos with no sour cream. When I informed the waitress the nachos had sour cream on them, she apologized, took the nachos and returned them after removing only a portion of the sour cream from the nachos. When I asked if she simply removed the sour cream she stated \"yes, because the kitchen was busy.\" She then asked if I would rather have fresh nachos!   They have lost a customer as the lack of good customer service and the basic respect for your customer is not a priority here."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice, the first time was tasty and good across the board, today unfortunately was not so good...    We arrived to a full dining room, it took a few minutes to be seated and once we were seated nobody ever came to our table.  No drinks, no nothing.  We gave it a full 15 minutes before we flagged the hostess down.  She seemed wildly hurried and it didn't result in anyone coming to our table.  We gave it another full 10 minutes (keep in mind our allotted lunch is 1 hour) and then just got up and walked out.  We drove around the corner to Don Pedros; we were seated and eating within another 15 minutes.   I'm glad this place has gained popularity, but I guess it's not a place to go if you're on a firm timeline  :-("}
{"text":"Real. Mexican. Food. Not that TexMex stuff.   Caldo De Res (Beef Soup) is amazing. I get it with a side of rice for a perfect bite.   Everything is good and they don't skimp on the meat. Lici is an amazing server tell her Joanne sent you. No matter what section your in the service is great.   Oh and they have this Mango drink with a stick of Tamarindo candy (Mangoniada) and Chamoy... Best Drink Ever!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Looks kinda sketch from the outside but this place is a hidden treasure. Super clean inside and the staff are so nice! The food is fresh and homemade. I wish I had more stars to give this place!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with wifey. This place is a hidden gem! They have taco Tuesday's and all the meat tacos are 1.00 with the purchase of ANY beverage. I tried the steak and also the chicken tacos and they were excellent. Wifey had the veggie tacos and she really liked them. Just happen to find this place on Yelp looking for another Mexican restaurant. Glad I found them. We will go back. Oh I don't want to forget, the service was excellent also."}
{"text":"I have to say I was really impressed this used to be another Mexican place some time ago I did not like. However its changed hands I knew it had to be a different place the parking lot was packed  good sign :)  We ordered the guacamole an cheese  dip  To start both so good , smooth creamy guacamole you must order these with your meal. Our waitress was great very on top of our order n drinks thats always a plus for me.  I ordered the Carne asasda Im sure I spelled the wrong lol However goodness so good I filled up on chips so I only ate my grilled steak lol That  was  the best grilled steak such great flavor an alot of food beans, rice an sour cream, guacamole an Pico .  Im not a spicy eater I always say I dont do peppers, mushrooms or onions lol my plate came with a jalapeño but it was grilled sorta like a chargrill. I handed it to my friend I caution you if you get one of these she took a big bite an her mouth throat an eyes were all on fire . Poor thing she is vegan so we couldn't ask for milk she finally got her mouth back in-order lol seems you need to put the pepper n get the seeds out than eat it just a word to the wise lol my friends are vegan an they love their food they eat there a good bit.  My friends said the margaritas were perfect an big fish bowls lol I cant wait to go back if your in the area which      I know looks very dark at night an shady you gotta try it. I did see a few items on the menu cuban looks interesting."}
{"text":"This is definitely a new favorite Mexican for me! The food is good! And I like how you have many choices of meats for some entrees you choose. They also have a good choice of liquor. Staff is very friendly and helpful! Will be going back here often vs the other Mexican down the road."}
{"text":"I been eating at place for 3 days in a row ..they have great prices and the staff it's super friendly Raul was the name of one of them."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte!! Authentic delicious food. Chip and salsa open the door for a fantastic meal! We had carnes asada tacos, a must tender and flavorful meat. Rice and beans full of flavor! My favorite was the chicken in green salsa tamale! I'm definitely coming back! Great food and wonderful service thanks to Raul for heads up on the days to come and party here!"}
{"text":"Tacos tacos tacos! Listen up fellow Yelpers - this place is tacos galore! And I'm not talking about the crunchy shells or soft flour tortillas of Taco Bell or the bland tacos you get at every other \"Mexican-like\" restaurant. I'm talking about the flavorful soft corn tortilla taco that you can get from the street stalls in Mexico. The one where the corn tortilla is made fresh in house, the meat is marinated and cooked to perfection and toppings only include cilantro, white onions and a side of lime that you freshly squeeze on top for a little acidity to cut the richness of the meat. Yep, that's the kind of taco I rolls with. They offer the Americanized option to add lettuce, cheese and sour cream. But why disgrace a taco like that? If that's what you like - go to Taco Bell!  I came with friends for dinner Friday night and was very surprised at the selection of tacos available. I opted for one chorizo, one steak and one tripe taco to accompany my chimichanga. Why so much food? Well, I was hungry. No judgment, ok?  Like every other Mexican place, they serve you free chips and salsa while you wait for your meal. The difference here is the quality of the chips and salsa. Because their corn tortillas are made fresh in house, the chips you get have so much more flavor and freshness than you'd expect. The salsa was the perfect accompaniment to the chips.  My friend and I each ordered a house margarita with a salt rim. I chose mango (cause no other fruit compares to a mango) while my friend opted for the green apple. Check out the size of the margarita glasses - I went to pick It up and was surprised how heavy It was. There wasn't as much alcohol as I'd like. Maybe I'm just an alcoholic but I prefer stronger drinks, especially with the heavy price tag of $10. But I won't let that take away from the food.  The chimichanga was smothered in a white queso sauce that was delicious but the chicken inside was not to my liking. Too much onions, chicken was tough. The rice and beans, however were perfect. So why give 5 stars if I didn't like the margarita or chimichanga? Have you been listening? TACOS!  Each bite of the taco I ate was mouth watering flavorful scrumptiousness. It was so good, my friend pointed out that I closed my eyes and made weird sounds as I bit into It. Yea, It was eye closing, Harry Met Sally good. Chorizo was seared and full of spice, Steak was marinated and tender, tripe was stewed to tenderness then cooked in its own fat till it has a slightly crunchy exterior. And the amount of meat on each taco is ridiculous. I'm no salad-for-dinner kind of girl but 3 relatively small looking tacos filled my belly perfectly. Did I forget to mention the variety of salsas they give upon request? Three hot salsas that made my brow sweat while still mild enough to taste the individual flavors. They just serve to enhance each bite of taco. And it's only $2 each. Did you get that? Two buck chuck. How do they make a profit giving so much food at such a small price? Even better, they offer $1 tacos all day on Taco Tuesdays. Are you kidding me? A couple tacos, a couple beers - that's all I need on a Tuesday night.  This place is about 30 min from my house, 45 min if you add traffic. I don't care. Today is Tuesday. Can you guess where I'll be headed?  Treat yourself to some tacos. I wouldn't even bother with the other menu items. Well, maybe I'll try the elotes..."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  My family and I have been huge fans since they were located at the Fiesta Plaza at Carrowinds!  They have the absolute best tamales I have eaten in the Charlotte area and possibly any restaurant.  I can't say enough about how good the tamales are but their other menu items are delicious also.  The Chimichangas are out of this world and the fajitas are good too.  I love the food here, the atmosphere and the prices can't be beat.  If you are looking for great mexican food at a great price look no further because you have found it here!  I hope you'll stop by and find out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Bad service and really bad food. The enchiladas were terrible and the chicken was dry. We had to get up to get our own extra napkins. The nachos were disgusting."}
{"text":"First time in, very friendly service from Raul.  I had the tinga tacos, yum!  The refried beans are great, my favorite ever.  The salsa was great too, not a ton of heat but fresh.  My husband had the chimi and enjoyed it.    Tried the corn, had never had that before.  I wasn't a fan, but that wasn't because they did anything wrong I just didn't like those flavors together.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, the food can be really good. It's not worth the horrible service. All the servers have never worked in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Incredible authentic Mexican food in a really great space.  I cannot say enough about this place! Just incredible! They have great elotes, tamales, traditional tacos;I could go on! Found my new favorite Mexican place!"}
{"text":"This is a 100% legit Mexican eatery! I lived in Los Angeles county for over 30 years so I know my Mexican food.....There's a full bar for those who need that margarita and the food prices are very reasonable and the portions are big. They got pool tables in a side room and outdoor seating for the smokers. If you are looking for REAL Mexican food - this is the place for you...."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Mexican placed in South Charlotte/fort Mill area.  Don't pass this place up. You can't go wrong with anything you order. Sopes, tacos, chimichangas, fajitas, enchiladas are all on point.  Go on a Tuesday for taco Tuesday, $1 tacos.  The staff is great and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Mexican restaurants we've ever tried.  Great vibe and great food.  Jose makes the best margaritas."}
{"text":"Not very good for lunch a couple weeks ago. Chicken was bone dry and the service was just 2 or 3 servers watching tv until they noticed my empty cup on the edge of the table."}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise! It's my first time visiting Charlotte and I didn't really have high expectations. But WOW, this place had the best tripa tacos I've even had! The steak sopes were amazing too. The food is truly authentic - I lived in AZ before so that says something. The service was also great, shout out to Raul who made sure I was taken care of."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. Similar to what you find in AZ and CA. Very fresh tasting. Very good service. Don't let the area or outside fool you. Been there every week for the last 3 weeks."}
{"text":"Glad we found them!! Don't let the exterior of the building fool you. The food is awesome! The entire restaurant is spotless! It is very traditional Mexican, not the bad Mexican food you get In most Mexican restaurants in the Carolina's. The best part is the ice cold beer and the amazing service! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The fajitas texanas were soooo good. Wanted to drink the sauce they were cooked in. Also had the carnitas sope which was great too. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food.  It's only 2 miles away from Carowinds, so perfect after a day at the park.  Don't let the outside fool you.  The inside is bright, eclectic, clean, and comfortable.  We've tried both the burrito and the chimichanga.  There are a variety of meats to pick from (including beef tongue!), and I'd highly recommend the chicken, or pineapple pork. The portions are huge, so be prepared to come hungry, or you'll be taking leftovers home.  Ask for the other salsas! They bring you a delicious picante, but if you ask, they will bring you a small tray of three other salsas: one is Verde, one is avocado based, and one is a smoky hot orange (I'm guessing chili based).  The margaritas are huge, and cheap compared to other places, same with the beer.  The wait staff is pleasant, and attentive. Check out the candy store before you leave! There are some interesting things on there!"}

{"text":"A true diamond in the rough. 1st time here for us. Great food and service. We went as a family and we all enjoyed it. The Loaded Fries and Queso with Charizo are amazing. Server Sofia was great. We will ask for her again."}
{"text":"Don't let the dive exterior fool you... This place is authentic Mexican at its best. Great food, delicious drinks and super friendly service. You will not be disappointed. Ask for Maria and her recommendations on food and drink."}
{"text":"The bomb and best Mexican food my wife (she's latina) and I have found in the Westinghouse area. Quality and damn near authentic Mexican dishes, Tecate and Tecate Light, salsa that isn't just tomato paste and cilantro, and out of this world carne asada and camarones (shrimp). On Fridays they have a mariachi band that takes requests. Don't be fooled by it's exterior, this place is legit!"}
{"text":"Great flavors! Tacos were delicious (steak, carnitas, chicken), flautas were nice and crispy, chips and salsa were great. We all enjoyed the rice, and beans were fine. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"had my first mexican sandwich and it was sooooo good!  it had hot dogs, ham, chili meat and a thin fried pork chop along with an egg and a bunch of veggies on a yummy bun.  needless to say, i was full.  it was so good."}
{"text":"Love this place so much. I'm usually on the edge of my seat when my meal comes. Tacos are awesome. Let's say food isn't your thing, well Saturday night it turns into a club. So put your Latin party pants on and get out here! Seriously, do it !!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican spot in Charlotte. Beans and rice are addicting and lunch specials start at $5.99. Draft Mexican Beers cheap $3!! Delicious fare and sauces. Third time coming! DJ and dancing at night on the weekends!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to lunch here yesterday. I used to enjoy cheap lunch at Plaza Fiesta whenever I went down for gas fill-up. Now that Plaza Fiesta is gone (I wonder where did G.H. Bass move to... anyone knows?), my choice for lunch down in Carowinds Blvd is limited to basically one.   Westinghouse isn't exactly on my way to and from anywhere, but I couldn't resist my curiosity. I took a detour, and was glad that I did. I got to the restaurant shortly after 1. There's really no system to the operation; by that I mean there's not a permanent hostess, so just say hi to whoever walking by to get their attention. I recognized the man who used to run the food court location (I'm sure he didn't recognize me) and he promptly sat me at a booth. The decor is kind of groovy. Bright orange walls, Ikea style sphere paper light fixtures. The place is obviously a lot nicer than the crowded food court. I saw on their doors that they have karaokes and live music too.  The lunch special menu is served during the week for $5.99. You have several options and the meat choices are little more authentic than the typical Mexican joint (thank goodness, because I'm here to have my lengua and al pastor). I was curious about the sopes, so I asked my waitress instead of having 2 sopes or 2 tacos lunch special if I can have 1 of each. She said sure but she didn't explain that she's basically ringing it up as individual items. My lunch \"special\" ended up being $6.75 instead $5.99, no biggie, but she could have informed me upfront. (FYI, taco is still $1.75 each, sope is $2 each, and apparently rice & beans is $2.99) Don't forget to ask for the avocado pepper sauce. It's not as hot as it used to be, but still good. I think overall it's a good cheap lunch spot."}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe I've never been here before. I happen upon this place due a yelp review and decided to stop in. I've driven by this building a thousand times and never once considered actually going in. Boy was that a mistake as I've been passing blindly by a hidden gem. The staff here was super friendly. They food isn't quite the typical standard mexican, same menu as everyone else. Of course, they have the similar menu items, but somewhat unique. I've had several different kind of tacos and always excellent. My wife and children had other menu items and never any complaint. The best thing about this restaurant is the live mariachi band on Friday night. I had so much fun listening to the band and just enjoying the experience. They came around to each table and played requests. My daughter got up and dance the Macarena with them. Awesome memory! Please go and check out the restaurant on Friday night, enjoy the band, and then you'll be back. See you there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with hubby cuz since moving from California, I have yet to find a tamale I like. OMG. The beef tamale!!  And who would think that chicken enchiladas would be so delectable w/o any cheese. Going back for sure on Friday for hubby's birthday! Gracias, La Poblanita!"}
{"text":"Being from CA and growing up in a Mexican household my standards are set pretty high... And it's so hard to find even a passable authentic Mexican restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised by this one... In North Carolina!  I had the elotes loco traditional style and carne Asada sopes... Most restaurants don't know what that is... But the meat was tender and I put the green chile salsa on it  I'm impressed! The service was fast and friendly and I plan on coming back!"}
