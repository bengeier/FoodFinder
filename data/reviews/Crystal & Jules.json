{"text":"Dinner was delicious, we had a party of 11 and service was wonderful. The owner came by and was a joy to visit with. I had the stuffed chicken with the yummiest brussel sprouts and a side of creamy alfredo, delicious! My mom had an amazing crab stuffed flounder with a lemon blanche sauce, my grandma had chicken picatta that she said was fantastic. Everyone enjoyed appetizers and a really great meal, we highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Call ahead for a reservation, this restaurant will take them for even parties of 2.  Our service was wonderful. The lobster (which is diced, not a full tail for $22) and creamy (basil) pasta with their caeser salad = delicious!!!! Scallops and Shrimp Scampi pasta was not overcooked, but had a funny aftertaste and so it is not recommended.  creamy clam chowder was too salty and had to send it back to the kitchen. We heard a patron take a spill on what the server described as floors that \"are slippery\" ....  bread and white wine were terrific.  still recommended but can't give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Try the pasta here it is excellent!  The pineapple martini is also very good.  You can't go wrong with any thing here."}
{"text":"What a fine dining experience.Wife and I were talking on way there with snow pouring down it better be good.Not good,Very Good.Started with the Shrimp and Crab Fondue.Well when we got done it looked like two dogs had licked the bowl clean.So yes we liked it.Next was salads.I know a salad but the freshness and crispness stood out when some places all you get is wilted brown stuff.I then had the Pasta Alfredo with Blackened Chicken .This was so good.Chicken was still moist inside and the homemade pasta and sauce what can I say.Just so good.Wife had the Chicken Picatta.I had a taste I think it was better than what I had.Finished off with Bread Pudding and New York Cheese Cake with coffee.Good way to end the meal.Chad was our server and took great care of us.Andy the owner and chef came over and talked to us to see how everything was.After talking to him you can see the passion for his food and restaurant.So if you know your headed to Madison sometime make the call get a reservation believe me you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"amazing dinner in Madison, the crab cakes, fondue, scallops, and to finish it all off creme brûlée, were all over the top outstanding, would recommend this place, and I don't do that often.  I wish it was closer to home, but I believe it was well worth the 1 1/2 hour drive.  Bon appetit to all who are lucky enough to dine here!!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming and friendly owner/chef. The food was great and all ingredients were fresh. This is the best restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"We gad a holiday dinner for four at this lovely restaurant in downtown Madison, IN.
It was our second visit to Crystal and Jules. Both dinners were a very satisfying experience. The food is great, the menu has several options to choose from. The server was amazingly friendly and carefully made sure we had everything we needed. The atmosphere makes for nice dining. We and our guests truly enjoyed the experience. It is nice to have fine dining in historic Madison, Indiana."}
{"text":"In town for work and saw the reviews on yelp, so glad we are here. The food was great. I had the stuffed chicken, highly recommend this place. The owner and chef came out to talk to us, I love places like this."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Friendly atmosphere! Chef/owner Andy and his Dad were working the night we dined there while visiting Madison for a Folk Festival. Steak Tartar was excellent as were our entrees. We will definitely visit again the  next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Simply incredible is all we can say. Food, service and ambiance are all great and would be twice the cost in any major city. Chef Andy has created a restaurant and experience we will come to enjoy again and again. Don't miss this when you come to Madison."}
{"text":"We recently dined at Crystal and Jules and had a wonderful meal and attentive service from both our server and Andy, the chef/owner. It's very hands-on with Crystal, Andy's wife shuttling between the bar and the hostess station. The shrimp bruschetta is very creative and we even got a brief lesson on what kind of vanilla beans give the crème brulee such an intense flavor. Well worth a trip!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  From appetizer to dessert, perfection.  My hubby had the NY Strip medium rare and it was so delicious.  I had the lobster with fettuccini in cream pesto sauce and it was divine. Great value, well trained staff and great food.  What s not to like.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"In town for a speaking engagement. Out with a group so got to try several appetizers and desserts. All were excellent. NY Strip was marinated and amazingly seasoned...menu described it perfectly. Chef Andy came out and talked with every table. Don't miss this restaurant when in the Madison area!!"}
{"text":"First off I want to start by saying the owner is an amazing guy and he came out to all of the tables and talked to them for a few minutes which I have never seen before. He was extremely down to earth and definitely loved what he produced which made the experience dining here a lot better. I had the Costa Rican New York strip which had to of been the best steak that I have probably ever had, just look up the description for it in the menu and you'll know why. The creme brûlée was the best me and my girlfriend has ever had and I recommend that if you have room for it. Definitely come here if you go to Madison!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The shrimp bruschetta lived up to the hype. The steak was great and I really enjoyed the spicy marinade. The stuffed chicken was phenomenal, as well. And I don't know if Andy (the chef) made a deal with the devil for his fettuccine recipe, but if he did, it was worth it! Great wine, great conversation with Crystal (the owner), and great prices. I'm coming back again for sure the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome dining experience.  A definite highlight of our stay in Madison.  We sat at the bar because the reservations were booked.  (Fine for us, we typically prefer sitting at the bar.)  The wait staff were very knowledgeable and helpful.  Wine selection was good and wine prices were very reasonable. The soup du jour was an amazing shrimp bisque- you could actually taste the shrimp- and apparently chef owner Andy also used a lobster stock.  It was a delicious change from typical seafood bisques, which typically have so much cream and/or tomato all seafood flavor is lost.  The bread was soft and satisfying, and was served with a very tasty herbed butter.  And, in-house, homemade pasta!  I couldn't resist.  I had the lobster pesto fettucine- perfectly cooked and great flavor.  My husband had the ribeye with a side of pasta alfredo, and raved about both. (And he is pretty picky about steak!).  To finish a great experience,  Chef Andy came out to greet us, which we really appreciated.  All in all, a wonderful time.  We recommend calling ahead for reservations,  though.  We were lucky."}
{"text":"Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable. My wife and I both had pasta dishes, hers with lobster, mine with blackened shrimp. Both were as good as we've had. For dessert,  the creme brûlée was excellent!!!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"With my husband we went to Madison a few weeks ago for a wedding and in the B&B we stayed there was a binder with menus from several restaurants in Madison and the Shrimp and Crab Fondue was what made me want to go and once there and it was not only delicious but we had a wonderful service, our entrees were also fabulous, a nice bottle of wine, Chef Andy the owner was very charming and for me his restaurant is a jewel at the south border of Indiana."}
{"text":"I give it a five. We went based only on Yelp reviews and it was WONDERFUL. Every item we ate - app, salad, entree, and dessert was delicious. Ashley, our server, was friendly, fun, and attended to our needs with abandon. Chef (and owner) Andy stopped and chatted with us multiple times and was delightful. Definitely a must go again!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner this evening at C&J!  We didn't have a reservation, but they did have a two-top available - and I'm so glad they did. Savannah was our server and she was friendly and very attentive. Our drinks were never empty. I ordered the stuffed chicken with fettuccini and the house salad with vidalia onion dill dressing - unbelievable flavor. So delicious. The fettuccine was also fantastic - handmade in house and you can tell the difference. My husband ordered the smoked duck breast that was served over polenta with a Caesar salad and spiralized zucchini and tomatoes. He really enjoyed his entire meal, especially the zucchini.  The chef/owner Andy came out to greet us and he was so friendly and welcoming. You can tell he's truly invested in the entire dining  experience for his guests and it was nice to thank him for his incredible food. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an excellent dining experience in Madison."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks.. great bar 
Reservations are a must during the weekend 
Staff was great and very helpful 
The food was so so good, much better than I ever expected to find in Madison."}
{"text":"Drove from Louisville to spend the day with my girlfriend from Chicago and hoped to find a decent restaurant to relax and chat at the end of the day. We were beyond pleased to locate this restaurant. The food and service was excellent and exceeded our expectations! I will visit again just for another great dining experience."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal here this past weekend.  My husband's was not such a success.  I had the herb crusted lamb chops with mashed potato and roasted brussel sprouts.  I'm still thinking about them with very fond memories.  They were perfectly done with wonderful flavor.  Sides were also very good.  Creme Brûlée was also really really good.  Hub's NY strip was done more than he liked, although he did request medium well.  Meat was hard to chew.   We will definitely visit them again!"}
{"text":"I was in town to visit family and wanted a relaxing dinner with all of the frills and not a lot of bologna! I was alone and sat at the bar. The staff was very inviting and professional. The bartender was knowledgeable and easy to talk to. The chef came around checking on everyone and adding to the experience. I had a nice glass of Hob Nob Pinot Noir/NY Strip/Mashed Potatoes/Asparagus. The sides were exceptional and the steak was on point, Medium and Marinated 3 days. I suggest bringing the family, enjoy the food drink and ambiance."}
{"text":"Wow, what a true treasure! Worth going too for a five star meal at a very affordable price. Ordered their chicken Alfredo with homemade noodles. One of the best I have every eaten. Kudos to Mike the owner and chef. Personally came out to our table to see how we enjoyed the meal. Great guy and great staff! Tori was an awesome server. 
Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best dinner I've had in a very long time. Waitstaff was wonderful and the owner/head chef came out and greeted everyone throughout the evening. If you're looking for a great meal without any of the pretense that typically comes with fine dining, this is your place. Try the chicken piccata with a side of the brussel sprouts. Every time I'm in Madison, I'll plan to have a meal here."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and great service. Kinda wish the beer selection was better but, if you like wine the selection is impressive. I had the lemon lime chicken was good but I liked my girlfriends lobster tail pesto pasta a bit more."}
{"text":"The service and the food is wonderful! Reservations are a must, but well worth it. The salmon was delicious!"}
{"text":"While celebrating our anniversary, hubby and I came here on a Saturday night.  We were warmly welcomed when we walked in and taken to a table immediately (we did have reservations, though I'm not sure they were necessary).  
  Our waitress quickly came and greeted us with water.  She did a wonderful job throughout the evening!  Happily answered any questions about the menu and in general was totally on top of her serving game.  She was always around and kept both our water and wine glasses filled up, while being completely un-intrusive.    
  We started with the hummus with garlic pita chips.  YUM!  The garlic pita chips were surprisingly garlicky.  Not sure I even needed the hummus- but of course it was great. 
  Both of us ordered the Costa Rica strip.. man- you cannot go wrong with that!  Hubs got a side salad, which they brought out with some great bread rolls.  As soon as our entrees were brought, my husband requested a steak sauce.  The look on the waitress' face was priceless!!  I really wish I had recorded it.  She looked at me, perplexed, while I just shrugged sadly.  It hurt her soul to have to explain that #1- they don't have steak sauce and #2- the steak was marinaded for 3 days and had enough flavor that he wouldn't need steak sauce.  Seriously- her reaction made my entire evening :)  But really- it was one of the best steaks I've ever had (and I was born & raised in Texas; I've eaten a LOT of steak!).  The flavor was sweet, spicy, juicy... everything melded so well to be delicious!!!
  Of course I was going to try the hand rolled fettuccine alfredo!  I wondered if I should get double for my sides, but I asked about the brussell sprouts, and our waitress quickly told me I couldn't go wrong... with anything, apparently.  The brussell sprouts were delicious- cooked with onion in chicken broth.  But- I wish I'd gotten 3 sides, because the fettuccine was really that amazing- I would happily have eaten double helpings!
  We ended with dessert: I got the chocolate ganache.. mmmmm!  It was decadent and wonderful.  Hubs got the cheesecake- which he said was great, too.  
  Of course, the chef/owner came and greeted us to make us feel very welcome.  When asked how we found out about them- I answered Yelp!.  He laughed and said, \"Of course!  We love Yelpers!\"  
  The whole evening was fantastic!  I have to mention that when we received the bill for an appetizer, 2 steak dinners, 2 desserts, and a bottle of wine- dinner was MORE than reasonable!  We were thrilled to have such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner!!! Went Friday evening with my boyfriend....had the tuna steak and he had crab stuff flounder I believe...both were delicious.  I could have cut the tuna with a spoon it was so tender and delicious  SIdes were great and crème brulee was divine.  Our server, Tori, was great!  Would love to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Fine dining options are limited in the town of Madison, IN. But, thankfully Crystal & Jules is a hidden gem in this quaint river town. My hubby and I spent a weekend exploring the downtown area and desired a dining destination that was a little more upscale than the many bars and diners found there. C&J definitely hit the mark for us. 

I'm glad that we ended up arriving early for the dinner hour because not having made reservations beforehand at the town's premier restaurant would have been problematic. But, lucky for us C&J has a bar area for walk-ins to belly up to.

On top of the bar is a large clear vat that contains pineapple rings, soaking in vodka. This is for their signature pineapple martini. Very delicious! They have a full bar and a decent wine list as well.

The menu changes weekly based on what's in season and what the head chef feels like serving. Our bartender/server was very good at recommending her favorites from the menu. The hubs got a filet with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts. His steak was cooked perfectly and had a lovely rub on it. I went with the wasabi tuna with roasted cauliflower (odd combination, but the spices on the fish and the cauliflower worked so well together!)

The head chef came out to greet us and asked us how we enjoyed our meal. I really love it when small restaurants do this. It shows they care about their diners' experience and gives you some insight into the decisions made in the kitchen concerning the menu. This chef is all about the small touches on a dish and making sure everything on the plate compliments each other nicely. He definitely takes pride in crafting a creative and appetizing menu.

We love visiting Madison. I think C&J may be a regular place we visit from now on."}
{"text":"My husband and I always eat at Crystal and Jules for date night or other special occasions. If you've never ate here before, you're in for a treat! The restaurant is beautiful and the atmosphere is warm and intimate. The food is fresh and delicious. You can't go wrong with anything you order. Chef/owner Andy grows his own herbs and other vegetables (if I remember correctly). Also, Chef Andy makes a point to come out and greet all customers. Even if you're a newbie, he will make you feel like you're an old friend. This is a chef who is serious about his service, quality, and clients. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable. Owner and chef, Andy makes it a point to talk to you and see what you think. Affordable wine choices. My seared tuna was great, and the key lime pie was so good. My wife loved her tomato basil soup, especially, and Andy was available to tell her the secret ingredient! :) Go. Enjoy."}
{"text":"It's nice a small town like Madison has such an upscale gourmet restaurant and with reasonable prices.  A local told me it was good but pricey but good entrees were in the low $20 range which included two sides.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer and got out of there for about $60 which seems very reasonable to me.
We both had a seafood dish and they were delicious.  Had crab cake with remoulade sauce for the appetizer and it was also very good. All the sauces really seemed to make the meal.  The chef/owner was a personable young man named Andy, and he made it a point to visit every table.  My only complaint about the food, which I probably should have mentioned to him, was my side of pasta alfredo.  Described as a creamy alfredo sauce on fettucine, it was in reality a congealed clump of tepid noodles in a small cup. I gave up on it halfway through.  
We were too full after the main course to have dessert.  We would have liked a scoop of ice cream or sorbet to cleanse the palate but they had none.
My only other misgiving had to do with the seating.  We were advised to make reservations and we were glad we did even though we could not get seated until 7 pm.  However, there was a table next to us that was empty before we arrived and still empty when we left, but one group was turned away at the door and another couple was forced to eat at the bar. Several tables around us came open during our meal and went unfilled, yet people are turned away?  Not the first time I have seen this in a restaurant and have never understood it, but then I am not a restaurateur.
Will definitely go back here next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Please visit this restaurant if you're ever in or near Madison, IN. Very inviting and quaint atmosphere sets the stage for what was a fantastic meal! These guys and gals are passionate about food & hospitality. Homemade pasta, quality meats, fresh fish, fresh veggies, & deserts - what else could we ask for? The flavors are outstanding and I strongly recommend dropping by for a top notch meal at a reasonable price! Thank you Andy & I will be back - guaranteed! 

-Augusta, GA"}
{"text":"Great service!!  Great food. Had the Tuna, crab cakes, and shrimp with scallops. Pasta is fresh daily MAKE RESERVATIONS AND BE ON TIME"}
{"text":"Uhmmm... Yum!   We had salads, New York strip, filet, mashed potatoes, and the fettuccini pasta side (the fettuccini pasta is amazing!). EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The menu is seasonal and I've tried just about everything the chefs make.  I've been here more times then I can count and it's always great.  Andy will greet all customers even on the busiest night. You are in for treat in downtown Madison.   CostaRican steak is always a favorite as well as the lemon lime poblano chicken.   Staff is attentive and helpful.  Full bar, taps and a decent wine list  with some higher end wines as well.  The creme brûlée is spectacular and a great end to any meal here."}
{"text":"Is it possible to get a table without a reservation? At 5:30 in the evening and only a few tables occupied, we were turned away."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for work and asked locals where to go for a nice dinner. So, I came here. It is a small place, but it was definitely busy for a Wednesday night. The service and ambiance was excellent and they suggested an excellent wine pairing for my meal. I ordered the grouper. It wasn't my favorite fish dish but it was fine. The accompaniments with my meal were actually better than the main entree. The asparagus was perfection. This place isn't vegetarian friendly. Fish is my go to when there are not vegetarian options on the menu. Currently there are only 2 vegetarian options - one appetizer, humus and one entree fettuccine Alfredo. Not impressive. Overall, I would recommend this place for big city folk looking for more than meat and potatoes in a small town! 3.5/4. I ordered key lime pie for dessert. So good. Made in house and totally worth the nearly $6 price tag. Not overly limey or sweet. And it has a lovely raspberry sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Sigh....what's not to love about this place?!  An amazingly delicious and upscale restaurant in the heart of historic Madison. Clean and contemporary decor, amazingly talented chef, and kind waitstaff. 

My parents took me here for my birthday dinner, and as my third time dining there, I was still incredibly impressed. I ordered their Lemon and Lime Chicken with Roasted Poblano Sauce pasta dish. They hand make all of their pasta which is al dente and essentially perfect. This pasta dish left me full, happy, and ready to return soon. The beer selection is small but mighty with Indiana microbrews on tap. The dessert is deadly good. 

Top notch food in small town Indiana. I'd be ecstatic to find such good food in a big city, let alone right next door. Love love love!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST steaks I've ever had!! EVER!
Not even joking! It was juicy, tender, cut amazingly, seasoned to perfection and delicious. I ate every last bite and savored and enjoyed it immensely. $28 dollars with 2 sides is well worth it!

As soon as we walked in we we're waiting about 3 minutes. The girl up front couldn't find our reservation. Not going to lie, I got nervous. She said she would check with \"him\" real quick. She walked into the kitchen. Andy came back with her and said it was his fault and would accommodate us asap. As we waited a friend I was with asked Andy what he would recommend...he immediately said the Costa Rican New York Strip with the fettuccini pasta in cream sauce. Done.
They worked on a table for us and we were seated right away. 

This is a small, quaint house that has been turned into the bar and restaurant. It works. There is seating in the main room, at the bar, and a few larger tables in the back. They make their pasta daily in house.

We were seated right next to the kitchen door. I could see right into and down the galley each time someone entered or exited the kitchen. Let me tell you...it was CLEAN. I tried to find something wrong and couldn't. Big plus to me. Means they do care.

3 out of 4 of us got the Costa Rican New York Strip 12oz (marinated for 3 days) and 1 of us had the Lobster and creamy pesto. Salad, mashed potatoes and fettuccini we're all ravishingly good.

I ordered the Pineapple Martini...amazing!

We opted for dessert. Each couple shared a huge piece of cheesecake. The sauce they put on the cheesecake is made in house also. We got the caramel and they had Strawberry puree. So so so good!

I highly recommend going here when in Madison! We walked the shops on Main Street and had a wonderful experience. 

Oh and yes, make RESERVATIONS."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time last Saturday and man I was blown away. The service, the atmosphere, the food.  YUM amazing.

First! I had the caprese salad. The sweet balsamic reduction across the fresh tomatoes and mozzarella cheese was divine.  (Inhaled)

Next I had the soup of the day which was crack in a bowl. seriously.  Well it actually was Curried Butternut squash soup with pear. I loved it so much I ordered a cup to go. It was blended so well and the flavors just popped. 

For the main course I had Shrimp and Scallops with pasta and a balsamic reduction sauce.  Heaven. The pasta was lightly tossed and the seafood was cooked perfectly. It was really yummy.

I choose not to have dessert but I ended eating half of my mothers which was creme burlee in a cup. IN A CUP! heaven with sugar! it was superb

Reservations are required or a must.  It really filled up and we could only get in with a 5:30 or a 8:30.  But it's really worth it yall"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great dinner here while enjoying Madison's charms. I had the pork chop with a fantastic mushroom sauce. That sauce really made the whole meal. The chef should be proud. That was great! My wife had a shrimp and scallop dish. She said it was good, but that it was a bit too salty. Of course my wife's low sodium diet makes most restaurant food taste salty to her.
 
The venue was pleasant, but I'm very glad we didn't have one of the tables back behind the bar near the restrooms. If we ever get seated there we will just move on down the street. The service was good and the owner/chef came out and made the rounds. That was a nice touch. It's nice to know he cares enough to get to know his customers.

The only negative part of our experience was the mash potatoes. They were easily the worst mash potatoes I've ever encountered. Mashed potatoes aren't supposed to be pourable. The next time the chef is in Louisville I encourage him to go to the Irish Rover. Now they know how to make mashed potatoes! Still, we had a great evening at Crystal and Jules and I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"Andy, the chef / owner, was very friendly. He seems to be a jack of all trades. He bounced from the kitchen to the bar and through the restaurant to greet the guests. 

My wife had the grouper with bronzed cauliflower. It was smoky, seasoned very well and cooked to perfection. I had a pasta dish with scallops and shrimp. The handmade pasta was a perfect al-dente. The scallops and shrimp were excellent. 

It was a very enjoyable dinner. If we're ever in the area, we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here tonight while staying
 in town to visit the Swiss Wine Festival in nearby Vevay, IN.  Our collective summary was \"DANG - wish we lived closer\".  We were warmly greeted when we walked in and taken directly to our table.  Service was timely and patient (it being our first time and taking a bit to make our selections) and friendly.  We had the Costa Rican New York Strip & the Pasta Alfredo with Blackened Chicken.  The menu said it was made and rolled-in-house pasta and it was Delicious.  The Blackened Chicken spice was wonderfully spicy without being to hot on the tongue.  The Costa Rican Steak was equally flavorful having both sweetness and spice.
Andrew, Chef and Owner of Crystal & Jules, came to our table to inquire how our dining experience was.  This was a delightfully personal touch that ensured that we will make the drive and be back soon."}
{"text":"A must stop if you are in Madison. Service is excellant, and that is just the beginning. Great starters, you can't go wrong with any of them. We had the pan seared shrimp and scallops, and lobster tail fetticini. The pasta was amazing, made in house. Seafood was fresh and very flavorful. Portions were perfect. But our favorite was the brussel sprouts. Even if you're not a big fan of BS's, you must try these. They were the best we have ever had. Creme brulee for dessert, and good rich coffee. Andy, the owner visits each table, and I enjoyed the background music (50's Sinatra) as well."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  This was our first visit and we were very impressed!  The handmade pasta and Brussel sprouts were fantastic and my husband's steak was spot on. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service ! The whole family loved it. Madison is a great town and this was a perfect place to celebrate my son's graduation!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Madison, IN.  Two of us stopped for dinner on a Friday and it was 75% filled with customers.  We sat at the bar and Crystal was our server.  She was very polite and it was clear she was passionate about her restaurant.  The chef (Andy?) stopped by to say hello as well.  

Caesar Salad was great.  The Lobster & Creamy Pesto was excellent.  It was very satisfying but not heavy, tasted great, and cooked/served at a perfect temperature.  The bread was noticeably great too.  

Crystal & Jules will become a routine stop whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great resturant in this Jem of a town. We really appreciated the chef coming out and greeting us as well. We really recommend the creme bruelle, it was one of the best we have had in a long time."}
{"text":"I'm still mad--but not at the restaurant!  I had finished my review, then realized I had not \"signed in\".  So I signed in, and *poof* my review disappeared.  Why in the world it would leet you  do all that only to have it all disappear is beyond me.  I was so mad I quit posting on Yelp for awhile!

Now on to Crystal and Jules.  I have a pretty firm rule.  That rule is premised on there are so many restaurant to eat at and so little time, it makes no sense to go to the same place twice.  I have a few exceptions to this rule, usually based on low costs, good food, and interesting entree's.  Crystal and Jules is a new edition to the list of eating there twice.  Heck, if it were in town, I'd probably eat there about every day.  I know I would tonight since I am herre alone.

What makes it so good?  Small, intimate casual ambiance.  Reservations are not required but highly encouraged if you want to make sure you get served.  A full liquour license andd tasty cocktails.  Then there is the chef.  He often meets you at the door and discretely finds out if there are any special dietary needs and assigns you a waiter.  The waiter sees you to your table, and starts the ordering process.  The menu items have a heavy concentration of seasonal vegetables.  Everything is prepared to order, and everything was impeccable.

Definitely worth the second, third or fourth trip back."}
{"text":"One of the best dinner we have had years the tuna was cooked to perfection The drinks were amazing service is the five star plus one of the thing I like was the chef owner came out talked to each table before they left that was a very nice thing we can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Another great experience at crystal & jules. Crab stuffed flounder was awesome. Great service."}
{"text":"A great restaurant in a wonderful small town. My husband and I both ordered the strip steak. The favor was unique and wonderful. The cook on both of our steaks (medium and medium rare) was perfect. The onion and dill salad dressing and the broccoli and cheddar soup were amazing. The restaurant is small and intimate. Our waiter was great and the chef came out and had a conversation with us about the steak marinade. We will definitely come back to dine again."}
{"text":"Appetizers and entrees were excellent   Service very good and friendly     Side dishes were good but not on same level as apps and main dishes"}
{"text":"I had a wonderfully experience here. The waitress was wonderful and the food was excellent. Great to come to a restaurant that makes pasta from scratch. I highly recommend this place to all who visit Madison."}
{"text":"My husband I have both tried several dishes, and everything has been perfect. Homemade pasta is excellent, all of the seafood dishes, steak and pork chop are all amazing. Best dining in Madison Indiana!"}
{"text":"My Aunt Libby (owner of the Broadway Hotel & Tavern) highly recommended Crystal & Jules to us after a not so great meal at Shooters earlier in the day.  It was 4th of July weekend and our chances of getting in for dinner were very slim, but the host at Crystal & Jules snagged us a table for four at 7:30PM.  The ambience inside is very welcoming yet homey; attire is everything from dressy, upscale casual to very casual (t-shirt, shorts and sandals).  We were seated immediately and gushing over the tasty menu options.  I had the pineapple martini; a beautiful and refreshing start to our meal...the pineapples marinated in liquor for several days.  We started with the beef carpaccio which was amazingly simple, but SOOOO full of flavor; it was devoured within minutes.  As we were ordering our entrees, my husband related to the waitress that he is lactose intolerant, but really wanted a pasta dish (Chef Andy makes all the pasta by hand).  The waitress wasn't sure on some of the pasta sauces, so Chef Andy came out to our table and walked through several recommendations personally.  Shortly afterwards, he sent a smoked salmon (lox) appetizer out to our table that was phenomenal; the dill was fresh from the restaurant's herb garden and the mustard sauce was so flavorful, it actually \"popped\" in our mouths as we all ooooohed and aaahhhhed over each bite.  By the time our entrees arrived, we were already very happy customers, but I must say, each of our meals were simply fantastic!  Chef Andy changes the menu every season and these items were on the Spring menu:  I ordered the baked flounder (I asked for the butter sauce on the side and that they cook it in EVOO if possible); two ordered the shrimp and scallops and then one of us ordered the blackened tilapia.  There wasn't much conversation as we dove into our meals and passed around bites to share the pleasure and smiles...all round, a huge hit, but the pasta itself is really to die for...perfectly al dente, but light and tasteful.  

Very, very rarely are my husband and I able to find a place with such outstanding food, service, ambiance AND prices.  We're from the DC area and those criteria are just hardly ever \"5 stars\" across the board.  However, we ALL agreed that Crystal & Jules had in fact surpassed our expectations on every level.  Well done, Chef Andy and team -- we'd recommend your place to any of our friends/family and we'll be back if/when we're in Madison again...thank you!

Note to potential restauranteurs looking for a great chef...you're silly to pass up Chef Andy...what a gem!"}
{"text":"We visited Crystal and Jules on New Year's Eve 2013.  The food was delicious and well presented, the service was capable and efficient, the environment was suitably hip.  Everyone at our table of 4 had an excellent entree.  The asparagus and butternut squash were perfectly prepared.  The noise level was challenging -- - probably a victim of its own success as it was very busy and  it wasn't helped by the party of 10 seated near the front.  A memorable part: of our evening: the chef came out to greet every table.  The prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous.  Attire: I would recommend business casual as a minimum; I wore sport coat and I wasn't out of place.  While we didn't partake, the desserts looked outstanding.  There is a TV as I recall -- one screen, in the bar, thankfully with the sound turned off.  It's not visible from the dining rooms (yea!).  This restaurant would not be out of place in a larger, more cosmopolitan market so it's a special find in Madison.

We can happily recommend this restaurant and we look forward to visiting it again."}
{"text":"Probably our favorite restaurant in Madison! The service, food and wine were all fantastic! I could probably put the Sweet Vidalia and Dill dressing on any and everything. The hand rolled pasta was delicious and very filling, my husband got the beef filet and said it was the best he's had plus the mashed potatoes were perfect. Make sure to try the salted caramel tarte for dessert even if you need to take it with you!"}
{"text":"This was a true 5 star dining experience. The dining room was fully reserved but they were able to seat us at a table for two. The interior is modern with a large frony dining room, a bar with several stools, and a smaller back dining room. They make very good use of the space they have. All of the food was excellent, they make their own dressing in house, the ranch and Caesar were both very good. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm not into upscale dining but LOVE this place!! Chicken Fettuccine is to die for. Call for reservations!"}
{"text":"We had dinner reservations on a Wednesday evening at this newest spot in town.  Located in an older house, the restaurant is decorated in black, white and gray.  It is simple and elegant.  There is a pleasant bar with a full selection of liquors.  The beer list is adequate and the wine list is limited but sufficient. Wines by the glass were only $4.25!
Our bar bill for two martinis and three rum and cokes came to $16 plus tip. 

My husband had the prime rib egg rolls and seemed to enjoy them.  He also ordered the pork chop.  It was not large but nicely seasoned and tasty.  His carrot soup was creamy and delicious.  I had the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was quite good and cheesy.  If I had one suggestion, it would be to heat or chill the plates according to the dish.  The salads were nice. My Caesar was good but would be improved with shaved cheese and anchovy fillets.   I ordered a side of asparagus.  It was excellent - roasted and served with a perfect Hollendaise sauce.  Steve had the cheesecake dribbled with strawberry sauce and he loved it.

Dinner was an incredible $56 with tax plus tip.  The chef came into the dining room several times.  The servers did an nice job and I hope Crystal and Jules makes a go of it."}
{"text":"Went here with the wife on Valentines Day, Had the best service ever. We had a waitress named Ashley she was perfect and very accommodating to our every need. The owners husband the chef and wife the bartender came over and talked to us, they even remembered where we sat the last time we were there.
 The food is beyond great everything was fresh all the favors work very well with each other, I had the Costa Rican strip marinated for three days in some of the best spices I have ever tasted, the steak was sweet at first then finished with the right amount of heat. My wife had a lime chicken with peppers over pasta this too was excellent,
 The sides,salads,soup,and drinks where of the Highest caliber also.
 Needless to say this is by far the best place to eat in or around the Madison area and I can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"WOW! ANOTHER  wonderful dining experience! Hate to sound like a broken record, but this place is THE place to dine when in Madison, IN. As usual the service and dining were up and beyond. The salad had this tasty dill & onion vinaigrette. Even asked if the kitchen could add the filet to their creamy pasta and lobster dish. Chef Andy came out and said \"Do you trust me?\" - my response was \"100%\". I was not disappointed - a blackened filet paired nicely with the creamy pasta butter and lobster dish....pure dynamo! Thanks again to Chef Andy, his crew, and my server Chad who was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Outstanding top to bottom, chef Andy and staff make you feel at home the moment you walk in the door.  I had the seared yellowfin tuna and it was perfectly prepared.  Fine dining does exist in a small midwestern town.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"house made pasta is excellent !  Shrimp was cooked perfectly...however our dishes were overcooked and dry.  The 3 day marinated strip seemed over marinated and texturaly not right....perhaps acid in the marinade ?  It was over cooked to medium or beyond, ordered m/r.  Next visit, pork chops way overcooked and dry.

I am also not a huge fan of the \"croutons\" that show up in two of the dishes we tried.  They seemed \"food service\" like...not fresh house made.

Service was very good, keep in mind...this was Regatta weekend, thus the kitchen was very likely stressed, and not necessarily indicative of what is usually pushed out.

I think probably the glowing reviews are closer to what most would experience on a non-event weekend."}
{"text":"What a nice evening!  From the minute we walked in the door the wait staff was prompt and attentive!  Started out with the crab cake as appetizer it was yummy.  My husband ordered the Caesar salad, smoked duck breast, and spiral zucchini. I ordered the Clam chowder, Brussels sprouts and 8oz. Beef fillet all were excellent choices. 
If you are in Madison you must try out this restaurant!  We rate it five stars!!"}
{"text":"Service is always great and the food...DELICIOUS. I am always recommending this place to people. And you have to save room for the creme brulee, its sooo good!"}
{"text":"My family had a great experience here for a family reunion dinner. The food was excellent, and the ambiance very nice.  Prices were reasonable.  The chef made his rounds in the dining room, which was a nice touch.  I would bring my out of town family here again.  There were a few glitches though -- the waitress gave two people in my group the wrong meals, but realized her mistake and came back in 5 minutes and switched them to the correct person.  One person's meal came much later than anyone else's.   No one came by to see if my cup of tea needed more hot water, and the waitstaff left empty plates on our table until we collected them ourselves and handed them to her.  Still, a nice place for dinner."}
{"text":"Fabulous menu. A lot of good choices made it tough to narrow down to. I ended up with the mushroom tart as an appetizer and chose the lobster pasta with a pesto cream sauce. It was excellent! I will be back again. Andy is a great chef and owner. Both my friends very much enjoyed their meals as well."}
{"text":"Can't do better than this.  Fresh and delicious food!  We dined here two nights in a row. A first for us!  Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Must try: crab cake, handmade fettuccine and the New York Strip. One of our favorite restaurants in Madison! Always consistently delicious. The raspberry martini is super smooth and tasty. Grab a spot at the bar - the best place to enjoy good conversation along with an amazing meal."}
