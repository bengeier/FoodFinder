{"text":"Wonderful service, atmosphere welcoming and beautiful with many Irish items displayed, and great food. What a treat!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had.

I went there for lunch on a weekend.  It was reasonably busy, but not overwhelmingly so.  

First, they seated us, brought coffee, and vanished.  Turns out they'd seated us in a area reserved for a private party, and when said party arrived, they had thus forgotten we were there.  Oops.  But forgivable.

So we were moved to another spot.  Where they took our order and then disappeared.  Again, apparently forgetting we were there.

At that point I was ready to leave, but part of me just wanted to see where this went.  I mean they forgot me!  Twice!  Hunger and curiosity overwhelmed my better instincts.

After tracking down another waiter, we got moved *again*, and our food was re-ordered and this time actually arrived.  It was...okay.  Nothing spectacular.  Certainly not worth the 90 minutes of trouble.  Our waitress apologized for all the inconvenience and offered us comped desserts.  Okay.

The desserts never came.

Nor did our waitress ever return.

I flagged down ANOTHER waiter, who said that we could just leave our payment.  I mentioned that we'd never actually seen a check - or our waitress - since our food arrived.

Turns out she'd closed out and left for the day.  It took a manager to re-open our check and figure out our bill.  I probably could've left without paying and nobody would've noticed, but I'd never forgive myself.  We FINALLY got our check...

...and the desserts weren't comped, as they promised.

Total time for lunch: 3 hours.  Total number of times our waitstaff forgot we existed: 3.  Once is annoying, but forgivable.  Twice is hilariously bad.  THREE TIMES?  I may be forgettable, but I wasn't the only one at the table and my companion was wearing bright colors.

Never going back."}
{"text":"zero stars because went there today for the first time and had awful service from female bartender.(yelp requires at least one star. sorry but they don't receive one from my experience today.)"}
{"text":"Customer service is not a focal point for this joint.. I have been here numerous times for lunch, dinner and drinks due to location and convenience..Overpriced for average food and fare and poor service.."}
{"text":"Food is ok here. Nothing great. Chicken wings were drenched in oil and salmon was supe salty. Guess this place is one of the few relatively better places to dine in in terms of ambience. Food is just about ok. I would come here only for the beer."}
{"text":"It's a good irish style bar. Staff friendly. Lots of seats. My sheppards pie was good. Why do restaurants still load up salads with dressing?  It's good non-chain spot in an area filled with chains."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  Salmon appetizer and their wings with dry rub, extra crispy and bam bam sauce are my favorites.  Great staff and owner. Outside bar is done to perfection!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with comfortable and interesting decor and a large bar with ample varieties of beer.  The selection and variety of food served could fit anyone's taste.  Several fish, meat and even a veggie burger made the menu.

My meal started with Scotch Eggs (a favorite of mine).  I was surprised how the dish was presented.  The eggs were cut open and served on the plate with lettuce. To me the perfect Scotch egg maintains a slightly to runny yolk and a nice thick layer of sausage covering the eggs - never sliced open and served.  Also, the layer of sausage was micro-thin.  Not good at all!

We had fish sandwich and a salmon wrap and both were very good.  had it not been for the butchering of the eggs I would have given a higher rating.

We enjoyed our lunch and it was affordable, but the dinner menu is much more $$$$."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the worst service I've ever experienced in a Restaurant.  Ever."}
{"text":"Had a great corned beef sandwich... figured I'd try since it's an \"Irish place\". It was delicious. My wife thought the same and she's hard to impress when it comes to Rueben's, or corn beef."}
{"text":"I've been to Erin's on several occasions for dinner and recently lunch. The authentic Irish pub decor and ambience is something that is very difficult to find in Wisconsin. The pub has several different eating areas (\"rooms\"), each which give a unique atmosphere. Several great brews on tap as well as a mixed brew list which I haven't seen elsewhere (2 different beers (Guinness frequently used) poured into 1 glass - haven't tried 1 but I hear great reviews about them.

Service - I have always had a positive experience with bartenders, hostesses, and servers. Overall, a very friendly, well-trained staff with prompt service.

Food - I've tried several different meals here. Burgers are excellent and can be ordered to your preference, great sandwiches/wraps, and tasty Irish fare. Every meal I have ordered here has been excellent.

Overall - Excellent place to grab a couple beers, lunch, and especially dinner. The best Irish pub I have been in Southern Wisconsin in terms of atmosphere, food, and service. I would absolutely recommend Erin's to anyone in the Madison area."}
{"text":"The beer & food were excellent, but the people at Erin's Snug made our trip to Madison an amazing, incredible trip. Get the wings, get the cardiac fries, and talk to as many people there as you can. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service and the Guinness were great. Corned beef sandwich was very good. The bluegill and the calamari were very saltly. The breading on the bluegill was too salty to eat. The waitress and Manager both sincerely apologized and took money off the bill. Stick with the Irish food and it should be good"}
{"text":"Service is fantastic. Friendly and efficient. The food is home cooked. For example  the potatoe skins are not purchased frozen and then deep fried. Real potatoes that the cooks prepare. The shepherd pie is made of lamb like it should be. The ribeye was juicy and delicious.  Great selection of beer too.  I will be back next time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"The worst fish n' chips I've ever had. My first piece of fish was more or less ice cold. The manager came over to apologize which was really nice but then the second round of fish was equally as terrible. Never heard from the manager again...do not order food here. Beer was great..but I was starving and gross fish will kill any beer."}
{"text":"We found our way here on the road to our hotel. It's a bit out of the way from the freeway. We found it on a road trip cross country. Loved all that we had. If you can finish what they give you, I'd be amazed."}
{"text":"Stopped here based on a hotel recommendation. Glad we stopped. Recommend if you are around Madison WI"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and while I typically order a Rueben,  I have enjoyed everything that I have eaten there."}
{"text":"Very disappointing - this is a great building and a great location however the food just plain sucks.  The drinks are extremely expensive as well....service is below par."}
{"text":"This may be just my pet peeve, but I've finally found an Irish pub that serves shepard's pie with beef and lamb. It was also nicely seasoned. They have a decently broad menu. The place is large and appears to have lots of seating. They have a decent selection of scotch, including 2 \"scotch flights\" that serve 1/2 oz. of 3 different scotches for $8. Not bad.

The service is a little inconsistent. It partly might be that they seem to have a lot of larger groups going there, but we had to wait very long to get service, and then our meals show up about 3 bites into our salads. Give us a chance to eat, please.  

I would go back, but partly because that area of town is dominated by chains like Friday's."}
{"text":"Went to Erin's on a Friday night with friends for dinner.  Atmosphere is very nice, but the food was just above average, and the fish fry $13.99 is about $2 more than competitors.  I ordered the petite filet which was cooked well, but the place was so incredibly loud we couldn't hear our server, or one another talk.  After asking, the manager moved us to a booth which was somewhat quieter, but we still had a hard time hearing conversation at our table.  If you like loud, this is your place; but don't plan to converse with your tablemates during a busy time.  Overall, I would like to try this place for lunch or another time when it's perhaps quieter.  My bill for 2 drinks and an entree $36; with tip - $45.  Overall I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"The environment is good, very Irish ambiance, but the food wasn't all that great. Maybe it was just a bad batch/ day."}
{"text":"I had just found out I was mostly Irish so was looking forward to a authentic Irish meal at Erins Snug Irish Pub. Loved the atmosphere but was shocked at the \"Shepard Pie\".   I had read up on the dishes they served but was dismayed when I realized that they avoided using their oven in making this dish.
. First to be authentic the potatoes need to have either cabbage or kale in them.  Then they were microwaved no browning what so ever.  It was the most expensive microwave meal I ever hope to have!"}
{"text":"Our group of 16 went for Mother's day brunch. Rather than a lot of food, the Snug kept the buffet fresh with frequently replenishing their available items. Only scrambled eggs, but 3 carved meats. #fodmapfriendly only that they had green beans and meat choices. Service was excellent for our group and everyone was satisfied. If it wasn't I'd only give 3 stars. Coffee and mimosas got high marks."}
{"text":"This place would have been great in the early 1980's when restaurants really did not understand food"}
{"text":"I'm always excited to go to Erin's Snug Pub. I've been here for lunch a few times and a late dinner once. I was served quickly and politely every time. For lunch, I first tried the T.B.L.T (turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato) w/ a side salad and liked it so much that it's what I ended getting for lunch the other two times - trying various sides. Erin's Pub managed to take even something as simple as mixed veggies and make it taste awesome. Great ambiance and good beer selection too."}
{"text":"Not much to say here.  I do have one suggestion.  Nothing makes for a crappy, overpriced cocktail like a $6 Jack and Diet served in a piss warm glass fresh out the dishwasher.  How about a cool glasses for your customers.  Also be attentive while tending bar.  I might want to be served another piping hot cocktail.  Shouldn't have to use a road flare to get your attention.

The place is clean and fancy.  Most of the clientele are stuffy business people, probably from Am-Fam.  Don't expect a humorous night out here.  Forget about single women. Typical Madison sausage party.  

Positives- Open Mic once in awhile.  Clean, usually friendly staff (but slow and inattentive)

Ok place to visit if there isn't any other choice."}
{"text":"Order sausage and mash, cottage pie and Irish stew. The sausage and mash drowned in gravy and was a soup. Seriously!  The sausage was tasty but the potato broke down and floated in the gravy soup like icebergs. There were no peas either. Need peas with sausage and mash. 

The Irish stew was too spicy fort wife but the cottage pie was a success for my son. Still it wasn't traditional."}
{"text":"Authentic, rustic, friendly and flavorful! 
First and most memorable Irish pub experience in middle of Madison. 

I had the Reuben sandwich and it was best corned beef outside of my mom's. Tender, moist and oh so tasty! Fries and slaw were average but nice compliment to my meal.

Max had Pub burger and he said was incredible!

The atmosphere and decor was warm, classy and very inviting.  
Next time I wanna try the fish and chips or corned beef and cabbage."}
{"text":"Good food, cool building. Love the red bus! Always fun to take friends here for a relaxing time to catch up :)"}
{"text":"Most of the menu is pretty American. Try their specialties instead.
Smoked salmon appetizer was very good and did make me think of Ireland. 
Corned beef sandwich and clam chowder were typical for what they were but not really typical of Ireland. 

Decor is very nice, several separate rooms makes it more intimate and each resembles various types of pubs in Ireland so nice atmosphere. Service was good but we were there in a very quiet time of day.  (about 1-2PM for a late lunch)

If they had been playing Irish Music I would have been more impressed..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Between our party of 5 we had corned beef and cabbage, the blue gill, fish and chips and the whiskey BBQ ribs... All delicious.  The rib meat and corned beef fell off the bone.  The bread and cinnamon butter was also great.  Great beer selections. The only criticism I have is the fries are a tad salty."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful!!  The food is pretty good.  We tried the combo appitizer, majority of it was very good.  The corn beef egg rolls were great!  I had the corn beef and cabbage and my husband had the shepherds pie.  Mine was okay, I expected a lot more from a Irish pub.  It was bland and nothing special.  (it did taste great at home the next day as corn beef hash) My husband loved the shepherds pie.  He said he would order it again for sure.  The place is amazing inside and very clean.  I would give 4 stars for this.  

I only gave 3 stars because the service was disappointing.  We waited probably 45 minutes for appetizers and over 30 for our meals.  We also had to wait for drinks a lot.  This is what was disappointing...the service could have been better.

We will probably return here."}
{"text":"Rude staff and owner. Sitting at the bar, we had to keep asking for service for both drinks and food. Those around us had no problem. It wasn't busy either. We ordered 1.5 hr before the kitchen closed. An hour and 15 minutes later we learned that they had forgotten to put our order in. Since the kitchen was now about to close, they didn't want to serve us. When they reluctantly did, none of the food was even luke warm. The owner insisted that she buy us a drink or free dessert to 'correct' the problem if we keep the cold food (fried fish). Sent it back, 10 minutes later we're told that they're going to make us new food (what were you doing the last 10?). 15 minutes after this, still sitting with an empty glass and no food, we left to get a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"First off, let's start with the atmosphere. The sight of a drunk \"cowboy\" smoking a cigarette on the way in to the restaurant really set the bar high for Erin's NOT SO Snug Irish Pub. I had a really fun time arguing with the manager over the phone to try to make an 8:30 reservation for over 25 people coming from a hockey game. The manager (in a snooty attitude) said, \"we don't accept reservations for hockey teams...you will have to figure it out yourselves.\" With that comment, we could have EASILY gone somewhere else with our $500 worth of business. And let me just say, this restaurant wasn't packed in the first place, so $500 worth of business would probably not be something that the manager would want to turn down. The owner of this pub would be very unsatisfied with his management if he saw it for himself. With a bunch of hungry hockey players and no where else to go, we decided to just give it a shot. We arrived at the restaurant, and after arguing with the manager for 10 minutes, she finally sat us, but we were scattered throughout the whole entire restaurant. Once seated, we waited at our table for over 20 minutes to even see a glimpse of our waitress. Let me just say, the waitress was perfectly fine, it was the poor management that slowed her down. So far, the management was really poor and they need a major attitude adjustment, because their current attitude will not get them anywhere good in life. 

The food came, and is was amazing. That is the only reason why this is a two star review. Otherwise, if I had the choice, it would be 0/5 stars. If you love dealing with rude staff and you really like good food, then this is the perfect restaurant for you! You would be better off visiting the McDonalds down the street to hit up the all day breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is as advertised!! The food is as authentic as it gets. On a lunch date my partner and I ordered the corned beef and cabbage and the Shepard's pie. We both were blown away by the quality of the food. It was exquisite. We highly recommend this place. The service matches the food. Please ask for Katie she was polite and helpful. Make this a destination for you and your family."}
{"text":"I don't find myself on the East Side all that often, but when I do the options always seem limited.  My friends on this side of town tend to agree.  But there's one thing going for east side of the freeway, and that's Erin's.  Judging by the fact that it has been crowded every time I've been, this is a shared sentiment.  As a general rule I like the atmosphere of the Irish Pub-themed places and this place has all the basics: wood panels, fireplaces and a nice bar.  I like that it isn't some kind of national chain like Claddagh in Middleton - the original bar is out of Reedsburg I've been told.  

The food here is usually good, and although the prices are on the high side I've never had a bad experience.   I really like the shepherd's pie but it's pricey.  I've been going with the fish & chips lately which is a bit more affordable.  It comes in a paper bag on a plate, a bit anachronistic but I appreciate the touch.  I only wish they had malt vinegar on the tables.  The main complaint that I've always heard about this place is the pace of service, and the first time I came here it was as bad as everyone had said.  A coworker of mine went here soon after it had opened and had waited over 45 minutes just to put an order in.  My experience was similar, and we were even sitting at the bar.  However things seem to have gotten better; in fact last time two waitresses had been assigned to our table.  I still think this place gets a bit overwhelmed on busy nights, but that's going to happen with any popular place so be forewarned.

The bar has a relaxed vibe to it and there's a few flat-screens on the walls to catch the game if you're so inclined.  It's not exactly positioned in an area where I'd stop by just for a drink, but sometimes when I'm over that direction meeting up with my friends it's a nice place to meet up.  Drink prices seemed reasonable and the bartenders were quick and friendly every time except for the first, so I've got no real complaints there.      Overall Erin's is a nice place for an occasional dinner or drinks with friends, but is a bit too pricey for me to regularly go there when I find myself over on that side of town."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with two other travelers while on business in Madison.  The parking lot was completely full, and so I had high hopes for a great dinner.  When we got parked and inside, we found that the restaurant was hosting a few Christmas parties (the layout for the parties looked nice).  The restaurant itself is really beautiful - it is decorated in dark colors like you would expect from an Irish Pub, but still very bright and clean.

I had the Kelly's Top Sirloin with Rosemary Glaze (sauce recommended by our server).  I ordered medium rare, and it came out rare (and less than rare for some bites).  The Rosemary glaze was pretty good, but the sautéed vegetables were really bland like they were from the freezer section of the grocery store.  I ordered the Guinness Chocolate Cake for dessert - it was really disappointing, dry and pretty flavorless. 

The bright side of dinner was that the beers were cold and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"I LOVE Erin's. 

I believe ownership exchanged hands.. or altered in some way not to long ago.. at least that's what I caught wind of while walking in once. 

My boyfriend and I recently moved to the East side of Madison, Erin's is a quick hop-skip-& a jump from our new apartment which makes it all the better. ANYWAY, me being a veggie only eater & my boyfriend is meat's biggest fan.. Erin's suits us both. The walnut burger is awesome as well as the pasta choices. I love the bread with the Cinnamon butter.  It may not be the most irishy food in exsistence, but it's definitely good food.  They also make the most fabulous bloody marys.

The wait staff is top-notch, but we've managed to have the same waiter each time.  I believe his name is Kevin, and he's wonderful.  Super friendly, never rushes us..AND he continues to check up on us and refill our beers after we've finished our meals.  This isn't some place I'd suggest if you're in a hurry to dine and get out.. save that for mcdonalds.  Erin's is a place to sit and relax, something that's near unheard of here in Madison."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this Irish Pub soooo very much, but the place is NOT AUTHENTIC. Yeah, I know the exterior looks pretty authentic and the interior has an Ireland theme, but the food is American fare 100%. 

Take the fish n chips for instance. Not hand beer battered at all. Probably frozen with the breading on it from the factory. 

Alcohol choices are plentiful with a cider on draft. 

But hey, let's get darn the fish and chips right, folks!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today at Erin's Snug Irish Pub. Erin our server was fantastic and the food was superb. I'll be back anytime I'm in Madison. Recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"We went in there for lunch yesterday at around 11:30. Surprisingly, the place was very busy! Kristen was the host / bartender / waitress / busser. She did EVERYTHING! She did an amazing job. I was a little nervous given the volume she was handling, but she made this a great experience. Things were a little pricey and the dip for my steak sandwich was very salty, but other than that, I will go to this place again."}
{"text":"Great server, nice and very attentive but not overly so.  The beer I selected was no longer available and she offered the Spotted Cow as something very similar. It was quite nice and complemented my fish and chips. The later was nothing special, I just had an craving for it plus I am departing on Friday. I left stuffed. Two filets along with thick cut fries and coleslaw. Irish music in the background and college basketball on the tube. The dining room was not too crowded for a Wednesday. The bar had most stools occupied with folks that appeared to be regulars. Oh, I nearly forgot the double decker bus parked out front. I forgot to ask when they press it into service."}
{"text":"Beautiful, flavorful, and friendly service.  Picked it because it was close to our hotel and it was a great surprise!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was solid if unspectacular.  Great atmosphere.  I'll give it another shot next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Erin's Snug Irish Pub is just that- snug. The ambiance is really great for groups, as you can get your own cozy room. 

The service was excellent, but the food wasn't mind blowing. The dinner rolls, however, were to die for."}
{"text":"This place gets high marks for atmosphere.  It is a gorgeous Irish pub  with new wood and classy fixtures abound.  It is HUGE, lots of rooms, each with its own charm.  The staff was very nice and attentive, too.  The only reason i can't give it a higher mark is the sad excuse for an Irish breakfast. First, they don't even pretend to have white and black pudding.  Okay, maybe its hard to come by in Madison.  But they so claim to have bangers and Irish rashers.  There were long sausages but they definitely weren't bangers...and they were not very good.  Then don't claim that you have rashers bacon when you are just going to serve me American bacon.  I mean i love American bacon but this is just false advertising.  Lastly the hash browns were straight from Denny's.  Without question the worst Irish breakfast I've had.
That being said, it seems like an awesome place to have a drink at night...so perhaps i'll try that one day."}
{"text":"I met a relative for an early dinner at Erin's Snug Irish Pub where we enjoyed a cozy booth that really was a very private nook. 

I ordered the Rueben with a side of sweet potato fries... both were excellent. My aunt had the Raspberry Walnut Salad. Considering it's January in Wisconsin I was amazed to see her salad had fresh ripe raspberries. 

Our waitress was friendly, and the service was great. My aunt and I stayed and chatted long after we were done eating and I never felt rushed to leave for faster turnover of tables.

I found the restaurant layout a bit odd, with lots of different rooms and even some raised seating areas. I imagine the separate rooms would be good for hosting parties or large gatherings and still maintaining some privacy.

And because it matters to me, and perhaps others want to know... the womens bathroom was clean and comfortable. The sinks are manual, the soap automatic and there are paper towels from a wall dispenser for drying your hands."}
{"text":"Awesome first visit to this gem on American Parkway.  Upon entering you really get the feel of an Irish Public House (aka Pub).  
     We were greeted promptly and seated in Molly's Parlour ( each dining area has a specific name, including Cindy's Snug...where women had to be seated so as not to be seen imbibing!)
     The menu includes the Irish fare you'd expect as well as typical steak house cuisine.  I wanted very much to order the Guinness Stew, but was not certain it had the alcohol sufficiently cooked off.  Our server got us a sample, which was both generous and perfect for my taste buds and dietary needs.
     My dining companion had a Guinness pour over a Blue Moon and declared it the best she'd ever tasted.  Service, food and atmosphere are perfect for this Celtic lass!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Erin's. The place has a great vibe and some of the dishes are pretty awesome. My friends and I have stopped in for the Friday fish fry, and the portions are pretty hearty, and worth the cost. The pasta dishes have been misses every time I've stopped in, and every so often so has the Sheppard's pie (although my sister would probably disagree).

Overall, the vibe is great and some of the dishes are pretty awesome. I'd definitely stop in for the fish fry again, but that might be it."}
{"text":"Proper Irish pub that is massive. Over 50 beers on tap and an equally massive menu. I had the Irish breakfast and I can't believe how spot on it was. Specials 7 days a week. I just showed up to Madison randomly and here was this gem. Irish faire thats so good. Black and white pudding was amazing. I'm so lucky."}
{"text":"I gave Erin's 3 stars because I like the atmosphere.  The bar is nice.  The food is average at best I've tried various items from the fish fry on Friday to the pasta and BBQ dishes.  It's worth stopping for a beer or two, the bar is large and so is the draft list. I get a nice feeling being in the space I just wish the food was a little better."}
{"text":"The Guiness Irish stew was ok, the service was good and the Caesar salad was fresh and crisp"}
{"text":"First time I ate here I got food poisoning. I had a honey mustard chicken wrap. Thought it would be safe but I was in bed and the bathroom for two days. No bueno. Needless to say I'll be avoiding the food here for a while."}
{"text":"3 stars for the beer selection and scotch eggs.  Rest of the food so far is ho hum...."}
{"text":"Great food, beer and whiskey! Ate here because I was in town for business and would make the effort to go back if I were ever in the area. The decor and staff were great. The local beer was very impressive along with the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Food is Nothing to write home about. I've been twice for a business dinner; service has been below average at best."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Food I had was the baked potato had no flavor the shrimp was nice and big but no seasoning as to taste. Only thing good was my carrots and beer not a place I recommend AT ALL!"}
{"text":"We've been to Erin's several times and, unfortunately, the last few times we have been there the place has really disappointed.  We arrived for a late lunch (around 1:30 PM) and were seated only after we asked it there was a hostess available to show us to the table.  Took a while for the waitress to show up with our drink orders (and no glasses of water until we asked a second time).  Since it was Friday my husband had the fish sandwich and I had a chicken sandwich.  The fish was dry and overcooked (hard to do with cod) and the fries were cold.  We asked for ketchup - and waited, and waited, and waited.  I finally went back to the front of the restaurant to ask about getting some ketchup - only to see our waitress chit-chatting with the seating hostess.  I asked for the ketchup, and a refill on water which I had also asked for when our lunch was served.  My chicken sandwich was better than my husband's fish sandwich, but overall a very disappointing meal.  With the food not being great, and two bad experiences with servers, we'll likely not be back."}
{"text":"The St. Patty's day Double Decker bus tour is really fun. They took us around to about 6 local Madison Bar's (mostly the seperate Great Dane locations). The food is always good and the beer selection is great. The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow what a find. This place is so \"out of place\". My Sister lives in Sun Prairie and took us here for a family lunch outing. It's located in the middle of a business park and is such a quaint fun place that it seems like the last thing you'd find here.

They sat us in our own private room which was great since there were 6 of us and we were kinda loud. Really great beer selection, Irish of course. But they also have a lot of local craft beers as well. I love Black & Tans and they probably have a dozen different versions.

The menu is big and of course Corn Beef rules. My daughter had the Ruben and loved it. I had the prime rib sandwich with onion, pepers, mushrooms & jalapenos. Yum!

It was Winter but my Sis said they have an awesome patio so I cn't wait to go back and check that out."}
{"text":"I was here towards the end of March with a large group for a rehearsal dinner. The menu wasn't the standard one posted online, but one put together for the party. The appetizers were pretty standard, fries, poppers, etc. Dinner was a pasta primavera, and it was mediocre. The noodles were over cooked and almost mushy, the sauce was red and lacked any flavor until it was covered in salt & pepper and there weren't many veggies in the dish, there were maybe 1 piece cauliflower, 4 pieces of broccoli and 8-10 olives. It wasn't that great and I ended up eating the bread and skipping the pasta dish. 

The place is beautiful inside and the wait staff friendly and helpful. I probably won't go back unless it's for drinks."}
{"text":"Gotta say I'm pretty disappointed with my dinner tonight. My parents and I chose to eat at Erins because some friends had recommended it to me. We were seated in a secluded room which was fine, I would have much rather have been seated in the room next to us which was much more cozy with a beautiful fireplace but no big deal. After a few minutes of sitting at our table we noticed this terribly annoying clicking sound, we figured out it was coming from one of the gas lanterns on the wall. We mentioned it to our server and she said she knew about the problem and how annoying it was but that they wouldn't be able to do anything. Anyway after quite a while we got our food, my mom had the smallest $10 salad I have seen, my wings were disappointingly small and hard and my dad's sweet potato fries were very cold. We would have mentioned something to our sever but we didn't see her again until we were pretty much done with our meal. Over all very disappointed and I will not be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"Irish fun on the East Side!

With so many chain restaurants filling up the East Side of Madison, Erin's is a pleasant surprise! Not only is this Irish Pub decked out like no other, it's got a great beer-on-tap selection and awesome Irish food. It is the perfect place for a good weekend lunch or dinner.

Each room in Erin's pub is divided up and has sort of it's own unique theme. Tables are well spaced out so you have plenty of room to enjoy conversation with friends. While the food wasn't \"the best\" Irish food I've tasted in states, it does the trick - especially the all you can eat fish fry on Fridays. There is a nice variety of food on the menu that will satisfy any pallet. It is also a perfect location to bring large groups of people."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place so I decided to check it out. Pretty neat exterior of the building and the inside was cool too with st. Patrick's day coming up. Being Sunday at 2pm we got a table quickly. The service was adequate but we were told the blinds couldn't be shut on one of the windows because the owner was \"particular\". This was an issue because the sun cast a glare on the tv we were watching. This didn't ruin the experience but it was interesting . My pulled pork sandwich was great but the chili was just eh. The beer I had was good too. My friends said their food was just ok and nothing special. I would be willing to try this place again to see what else they offer."}
{"text":"We LOVE Erin's Snug!  You can always get a table (the place is huge), the staff is friendly, and the food is great.  You can hunker down in a deep booth, sit by a fire, or hang out on the patio.  Unlike a lot of pub grub, Erin's food isn't frozen/ microwaved garbage.  The Twisted Chicken Tenders are my favorite."}
{"text":"First of a all 
First class experience
Food 5 star
Service 5 star
Atmosphere excellent
The last night we were served by a girl by the name of B. Skaar
What a great girl
Made us feel so welcome and had a great chat and a laugh with her
A true asset to this bar
One thing I can't stress enough is the cleanliness of the place
It's been open for a while but is run like a ship
Will be back sooner than later hopefully
Thank you guys

{"text":"Every time I walk in I feel like I am transported to another time or place. I love the ambiance. The food is pretty good. I really love their french onion soup! I recently went for brunch which was good and affordable but seemed like something I could cook up myself at home and have it taste just as good or better (I am not a great cook). Their bloody mary's are a tad spicy but they are only $4.00 for Sunday Brunch. On my last visit the service was mediocre. She wasn't attentive. The host spaced everyone out which was nice but I think the server forgot about us multiple times. I probably wont be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"When visiting in the area, the front desk agent at our hotel recommended Erin's Snug for a good dinner.  We went there and were pleasantly surprised--the food was delicious!  We had calamari, which came with a wonderful dipping sauce, and their all you can eat fish and chips.  Service was decent, but the restaurant seemed to be kind of noisy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Love this place, total Irish pub all the way. Great service, great menu. The food was wonderful and portions were large. And the beer was heaven. Absolutely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and yummy comfort food with large portions!  Celebrated a family birthday here and had a wonderful time!  A great place to take out of town visitors!"}
{"text":"Erin's Snug Irish Pub has always been a solid, reliable place. Their Irish Favorites are always great!! The shepherds pie, Irish stew, corned beef and cabbage, and the Irish breakfast are always delicious. Tonight I tried the shepherds pie mac and cheese, though. It was pretty awesome!!! It's creamy and delicious on top with the shepherds pie underneath. Also, they pour a great Black and Tan!!!"}
{"text":"Overall good meal. I thought that they could have the host waiting at the host stand for people coming in but it was a Monday so not a huge deal. I had the shepherd pie and it was pretty good. It wasn't the best that I had ever had but I would order it again. The music was a bit loud for a Monday but we asked our waitress to turn it down. They did and it was much more enjoyable. I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend with some great friends for dinner and drinks. The atmosphere is great - especially if you like Irish Pubs as much as I do. Service was very good too - we met our friends at the bar - and before we had our coats off the bartender was asking if he could get us anything! (good man!) Dinner was pretty good. I had the Prime Rib special (Saturday night). I got the 10 oz and it seemed huge. Mine was a bit over cooked but it was still decent. I opted for Erin's Colcannon which is mashed potatoes with sauerkraut in it. It was OK, but I don't think I would get again. Wife had the Ruben sandwich and said it was good. Looked delicious. Bread at the table was EXCELLENT as was the Cinnamon butter."}
{"text":"There are two types of Irish bars when it comes to atmosphere.  Those that go for the rustic beat up chic, and those that go for the upscale dark paneling low light style.  Erins is the latter.

There are also two types of food in these places.  Those that serve Irish Irish food (blech, Irish food sucks) and those that serve americanized Irish food (meh, its ok)  Erins is the latter.

They all serve Irish beer and whisky.

So that is Erins.  Meh, ok food, in a very dark clubby type atmosphere.  If its what you want, its fine"}
{"text":"Saturday service for dining late afternoon was very slow. Waitress was inattentive. Food was standard WI bar food and just okay."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that the 4 star rating is mostly for the decor and the food is probably a 3 1/2. Having said that I have only been here once and for lunch. The decor is more upscale than you would normally see in many Irish places. Really very nice. They have a large bar and it is full of woodwork as it is everywhere here. The place is clean and the service from the hostess/host to wait staff is very good. We came in here with a group of 7 and everyone had been here before. The menu is ample and there are plenty of healthy selections for those who are trying to eat healthy which I was that day. I ususally do not see this in Irish places I have been. I ordered one of the salads with Mahi on it. I asked for a specific way for the fish to be cooked which was totally different than the menu offering and I was accommodated. Three of us had salads and although they were very good the portions were small for the price. One person ordered the shepards pie. It was decent sized. He mentioned that it was very good as well. The rest of the party ordered sandwiches which came with fries and slaw and another person had the fish and chips. A All of those portions looked ample. Everyone said their food was very good. I look forward to trying this place again and will have something else. If it is a salad I know to get another side dish to go along so I do not get hungy in 2 hours again."}
{"text":"Love this place! One of the gems in the SP madison border that you can sneak away to with a friend or group of friends and enjoy eachother's company without a bunch of riff raffs or drunk kids from the sticks around. The corned beef is excellent and I'm from Cleveland's West side which has high standards for Irish grub. Rock on Erin's. Oh, and the scotch eggs are incredible too. Just done simple and good. The bartender never gives you wit when you ask for hot sauce so that is a plus. Again, I'm from cleveland and eat at alot of authentic Irsish joints. They get offended or snappy when you ask for hot sauce. it's an Irish thing. Not Erin's."}
{"text":"Decent enough but not someplace I'm going to frequent on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Erin's Snug is fine; it's not amazing and it's not bad. It's simply mediocre. I've been to Erin's Snug a few different times for lunch, dinner and drinks. Every experience I've had there has been the same: the service is sort of slow but okay, the food is basically average, and the place is always extremely empty. I've gone during off hours and peak restaurant hours, and the restaurant is always empty!

The Irish theme/decor is cute and visually appealing, and I think that's the winner for Erin's Snug. The food could be the winner if it were better-seasoned and specifically if the calamari were better-fried and crispy. Soggy calamari makes me sad!

Erin's Snug isn't a place that I will go out of my way to visit, but if someone invites me to go to Erin's Snug, I'll definitely tag along."}
{"text":"Some nights I just need a Black Cow after work. Black Cow: 1/2 Guinness/ 1/2 New Glarus Spotted Cow. It's fantastic! Now if I have the munchies I order the Corned Beef Shalaylee... These things are Heaven on Earth. I haven't tried anything else here, but I hear it's very good. 

The decor inside is neat and blows Claddagh in Middleton out of the water.

{"text":"Slow service, below average overpriced food. Nice facility. Slow service, excellent TV's, slow service. Did I mention slow service. How can you have such slow service at the bar. 3 people seated at the bar, the bartender walked by me like I was invisible to answer his cell phone. I hate paying for bad service. Sorry, I can't recommend sitting at your he bar."}
{"text":"I'm lucky Erin's pub is right by my job,
With drinks worthy of any beer-snob,
The snugness comes from the warm fire,
With a Celtic theme to admire,
And good food to shove down my gob!"}
{"text":"Very cool place with a great atmosphere. Definitely try the french onion soup!"}
{"text":"We had heard some good things about this place and decided to give it a try.  Very large, big bar, cool atmosphere style resturant with seperate rooms for eating and visiting.  We were greeted right away with friendly wait staff and promptly seated.  We had lots of beers to choose from on tap which I truly enjoyed.  

Asked the server her favorites and we went with those being our first time there.  I had the Reuben which was just ok.  Nothing wrong with it but the homemade Russian left some to be desired.  Felt like it was just alot of sweet mayo.  Ive made better but the rest was delicious.  My wife had the special of the day.  It was a backend chicken tortellini with asparagus and vegetables.   It was amazing.  We left very filled and happy with our first experience.   Yhe place was very well lit and very clean.  Again it was a nice experience and we plan on visiting again to try something else.  Lots of Irish classics to choose from.  Next visit we will step out of the comfort zone and try some S hepards Pie or something more authentic.

Give this place a try.  Even if its just for a beer and an appitizer.  You should leave very happy.  Cool chill spots in front of fire places if you just want to lounge and chat."}
{"text":"Erin Snug is the closest we have found to an original Irish Pub. After spending time in Ireland we long for the pubs of old! :) The room divided Erin Snugs affords us the feel that we are back in Ireland. 

New to the area and living close to Erin's we have been there more then any other establishment in the Madison area. For dinner we try to get there early to avoid the rush that seems to start after 6 pm. My husband and I usually split two dishes, our go to favorite of fish and chips, and one other to try something new. We have loved everything except for the shepherds pie which we found a little bland. We recommend the Fish and Chips for dinner and the Corn beef sandwich for lunch. Also the Rueben rolls on the appetizer menu are great! 

Service has always been good to great there. One waitstaff even took the need we had for feeding our 2 month old into consideration when she was choosing a table for us. 

Two of the times we have been there they have had some sort of live music. Both times were a pleasant surprise. 

Do take a moment to sit in front of the giant fireplace for a while. Chad and I sit there after dinner and chat...prolonging needing to get our kids from the sitter. :) 

If you are in the area, do stop in for a Guinness and sandwich. Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"This place is great. There's too much things on the menu that I wanted to try so I'm definitely going to have to come back. 

We went for a friend's birthday and this place easily fit a group of 12 even on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"Being of Irish decent I really was excited to go here. We were in Madison for work and decided to stop in and try it out. We ended up eating there two times out of the four nights we were there. It's very nice inside and out, very relaxed too."}
{"text":"What I like most about Erin's Pub is the atmosphere. The restaurant is super cozy, complete with a fireplace perfect for frosty Wisconsin winter evening, but they also have a great patio in the summer. The warm wood interior and Irish themed decorations just make it a place you want to be. 

They do offer quite a bit of traditional Irish fare and have a nice, long drink menu. Actual food is just ok, but the ambiance is the real draw. The restaurant is spacious, too. This would be a good place to take out of town relatives and friends. Also one of the nicer restaurants (in appearance) near Sun Prairie. I would totally go back."}
{"text":"They have Irish breakfast! Yay!
I love the traditional Irish breakfast and they have it with black and white pudding. They have other Irish dishes as well, fish and chips, Sheppard pie, and Irish stew. 
The place looks like a huge Irish bar and as a result of its size has plenty of sitting. We did not have to wait for a table for three on a Friday night.
It has a bar as you enter the establishment, friendly staff, and good food."}
{"text":"I brought my husband here a year after my first trip and this place still was just as amazing as the first visit. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Always good food and fun wait and bar staff.  My two companions had the walleye and said it was very good.  And that is coming from a Minnesotan.  I had the salmon and it had great flavor, perfectly done and presented very nicely.  Definitely going back with clients again."}
{"text":"We travel as a family and therefore have the option to try many different things in one visit. We had fish and chips, hero sandwich, club sandwich, and a bacon cheese burger. 
The pub fries were addictive and we ended by fighting over the extra. 
The main dishes were all excellent.
My only concern was the portion compared to the price. For example the $15 fish and chips had 2 pieces. However it was delicious. 
We'll be back the next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Well first time coming here the food was great and fulfilling but the waitress took forever with the food and the orders... I believe it wasn't her fault but the restaurant should have more people helping for the orders instead of having just one running around ..."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of coworkers and we all wanted to sit on the patio.  The server immediately started yelling at us that we couldn't move tables together so that we could all sit together with the only explanation being \"the owner\" wouldn't allow it.  We immediately left and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"5* decor; the food is inconsistent--some of it is fantastic but some of it doesn't work.

The Irish smoked salmon (lox) appetizer is outrageously good; had it twice. It's too large a portion for one person, so I took the leftovers back to my hotel with me.  

The blackened mahi mahi salad didn't work.  The apples, pineapple, cucumber and other flavors just didn't make sense together. And those are some of my favorite ingredients.  

The bread pudding dessert also didn't work for me.  I usually love bread pudding, and I like my desserts sweet, but I found this dessert to be TOO sweet.  The bread pudding itself was delicious, but they dumped so much syrupy sauce on and around it, that they drowned it in sweetness.  It might have been perfect with a smaller amount of sauce.

We liked our servers, Erin and Megan.

We loved the eclectic music mix--Irish, Beach Boys, Zac Brown Band--something for everyone."}
{"text":"If you're looking for red meat on the East Side head on over to Erin's and give it a shot. Lots of beefs to choose from. I just had a Reuben there and it was great. They also have a good bar scene of you want to hang out with your peeps."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, the service was a little slow considering it wasn't a busy night (Monday) but the food came hot.  My husband enjoyed his steak, good seasoning, and my chicken stew was yummy."}
{"text":"We were visiting WI, so my family and I didn't know which places hit up. We ended up at the pub since it was not too far from our hotel. When you walk in, it has nice decor and feel. And the food seemed pretty good but because it took OVER AN HOUR to get our entrees everything tasted delicious at that point. 

I wouldn't recommend this place if you don't have the time to kill or have hungry kids with you because they will undoubtedly have meltdowns."}
{"text":"This first-class pub and restaurant is a beautiful spot for an evening out in Madison. We stopped in for just a beer and a snack and were impressed at the decor, wondering if we were in over our heads. We sat at the bar, chatting with our friendly bartender, who cheerfully took time to help us choose the perfect brews for our tastes. The man next to us at the bar introduced himself, and lo and behold, we soon learned he was the owner--eager for us to try some of his favorite meals and his signature chocolate cake. His enthusiasm and warmth helped make it an enjoyable hour for us as we chatted, munched through a plate of wings (order them naked with dips--DELICIOUS) and watched the women's NCAA basketball finals. We left satisfied, warmed, and eager for yet another visit, next time for dinner. Maybe even for the St. Paddies Day event with bagpipers and green beer. We highly recommend this spot, which was busy even on a Tuesday night. It's easy to see why."}
{"text":"This place has really transformed into the stellar image it holds from the outside. When it first opened I counted it out. Was pleasantly surprised to see how well they've gotten their act together in the past year."}
{"text":"Not bad, nothing to Cher about either. I had the walleye and veggies. Veggies seemed a bit frozen and the fish was too oily for my tastes. Nice decor-great for groups and my group seemed to like their burgers."}
{"text":"We get to Madison a couple times a year for football games and stay in hotels near Erin's. It's conveniently located and has generally good reviews here. We've eaten here on multiple occasions and have had mixed experiences. Friday night our service was good and the fish fry was very good. Erin's has a nice selection of beers on tap that pair well with most menu selections too. 

Saturday night was a completely different experience. We had 7:30 reservations and the restaurant was not crowded nor overly busy. From the time we were seated to the time our appetizer arrived a full hour had elapsed.  Two of us had ordered the prime rib which, being the special for a the evening, should have been a quick turnaround. It arrived at our table about 45 minutes after that. Our salads had not come out ahead of the entree. We had to ask for those and took them to go. 

After speaking with the manager we were offered a couple of drinks but that seemed very little for the poor service we experienced. In the end we were comped about the equivalent of 1 entree which took a serious amount of negotiation.

We'll be looking for a new dinner experience in that area next time we travel here."}
{"text":"Let's be perfectly clear. Erin's is not really an Irish pub. They are an Irish themed restaurant. Nothing wrong with that, but if you are expecting an Irish pub with a small Irish gastro-pub menu you will be disappointed. This is a large restaurant along the lines of Olive Garden. They have a large menu with some Irish inspired dishes as well as pastas, dinner salads, appies, burgers, etc. My wife and I shared a scotch eggs appetizer, fried cheese curds, and a salad as well as a couple of fine brews. The eggs and cheese curds were quite good. Service was good, the food came out in a timely manner and the food was of average quality. We would have rated the food higher but about a third of the lettuce in our salad was badly wilted and not very appetizing."}
{"text":"This place had a nice and clean atmosphere, but the food sucked. My wife had the Guinness beef stew and she hated it. I had the trio salad. The seafood salad was minced to almost liquid and the chicken salad was made with canned chicken. The lettuce was going old. The amount they are charging, the meals should be more quality. If I returned it would be for a beer, but nothing else."}
{"text":"We were considering going into town for dinner and drinks, but then we found that this place was in walking distance of our hotel, so we figured we would take the easy route and just head here. What a great decision!

Erin's is a great place. The ambiance was that of your typical Irish pub - lots of dark wood and Guinness items on the walls. A-ok with me. We were seated in one of the side rooms with a huge big screen TV with sports on and a fireplace. Very nice.

The menu had a decent selection - and the portions are huge. We got the cardiac fries and an entrée - I barely touched my Sheppard's Pie (which was very good by the way) because I filled up on the fries, and I'm not one that balks at portion size. They also had a good selection of beer and wine available. Service was also very friendly and fast.

If you're staying on the east side of Madison, definitely check out this place - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place and finally had the chance this week. I immediately enjoyed the decor, a hint of Ireland, but it didn't hit you over the head with it. They weren't too busy when I came in during a very cold and snowy night, so I was seated promptly and immediately introduced to my server. I started with a glass of their house Pinot Noir, which I had low expectations of, but was pleasantly surprised that it was quite good. Fro there it was on to a salad and corned beef and cabbage (a favorite of mine) and I have to say I was very impressed with both the presentation of the dish as well as the hearty portion. My only complaint would be a couple of more red potatoes, but the abundance of cabbage made up for it.

If anything wasn't perfect, it was the wait times between when I ordered and when it was served, though I was perfectly happy drinking my wine and enjoying the setting. Their menu is extensive with many more non-Irish dishes (though they have the main Irish one's covered). I'll definitely be back to try some additional fare!"}
{"text":"Sheryl, at Erin's snug Irish pup, was absolutely a gift as I planned a Birthday celebration for my brother in Wisconsin from California.  Food was fantastic (especially for a group) where the invites grew each week.   Erin was able to handle everything with ease and a joyful smile.  Atmosphere is fun, cozy and welcoming.  Barb"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pub i have been to. From the astonishing architecture from inside out this pub has a variety of beers to choose from as well as cocktails.  I met the owner Jerry and we talked about his menu and he recommended i try the Scottish eggs. The were  absolutely amazing. We also tried the cheesecurds which were very delicious.  You cant go wrong with this pub from the ambience to the friendly family atmosphere amd outdoor patio for those game days. Come on down to Erins snug pub and i promise you wont be disappointed!! I definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"It was next to our hotel, looked better than what they offered. I have been to better Irish Pubs with better food authentic food selections. It was nice, clean and large restaurant."}
{"text":"In town for work, and had lunch here. Had the Mediterranean chicken sandwich and cheese curds (cuz you must have them when in WI). The sandwich was tasty, and the cheese curds were like fried mozzarella sticks - good, but nothing exciting. Our server was very pleasant and nice. It's a large place, and looks like it could be a fun place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Greag food wonderful atmosphere.  Menu is varied but has some irish classics that take me back to childhood.  Only complaint is to little on seasoning."}
{"text":"Spotted Erin's at a gas stop during a six hour trek to the north woods.  Let's see, lunch at a greasy spoon or at an Irish pub? No-brainer.  The kids loved their sandwiches and the wife said her reuben was yum.  I had the chicken spinach-artichoke sammy and a tall draft Guinness.  Happy Dad.  Server was efficient and friendly to the kids.  I can't comment on the Friday night drinking scene but this may become a regular stop for us when traveling north."}
{"text":"Dined solo while on business. Had the Corned Beef & Cabbage and Guinness Sampler flute. Was a pretty small portion especially for the asking price. The brisket was fatty and the cabbage and potatoes very sparse. Lots of broth and diced celery. They have a very nice gas-fireplace but for some reason they didn't have it on. Even though a snow storm was going on outside. The experience gave me the impression of money woes for this establishment.  Would probably not return."}
{"text":"Went here twice this last week. The first time was a great experience. We had Matt as our server and he was very attentive and friendly. Our food was OKAY, not great.  I went there yesterday with a big group for brunch and unfortunately our experience wasn't that great. Our server was named Erin and she started off fairly nice and enjoyable but after we said we needed a few more minutes to order she didn't come back for 15 minutes.  Not that big of a deal, we knew she was busy, but it seemed like  a really long time to wait to place our order. The second thing was the coffee. It was brunch so we wanted to drink coffee which we ordered but there was no creamer on the table so we asked for some. After pouring it into our coffee it looked weird and turns out the creamer was expired. It was disgusting. We asked for new coffee's and Erin got it for us but gave us attitude when we asked about the status of the unexpired creamer... it would have been nice to have creamer that wasn't expired. They ended up just bring us milk since they didn't have any creamer that wasn't expired. The final thing I'll say was that the cheese and egg omelet is just a regular omelet with a cold slice or two of american cheese. Yes, not shredded cheese, just slices of cold cheese. Wasn't Erin's fault, but it was yuck. Won't be back. Nice building though, it is clean."}
{"text":"Traditional Irish atmosphere and comfort food. The restuarant is divided into different rooms with plenty of seating. We had our grooms dinner here and baby shower, both went well."}
{"text":"Have been here on multiple occasions, at different times of day and days of the week, and with both small and large groups. I have always found the food to be tasty, the service to be excellent, and staff very courteous. My family, friends, and I have never left feeling dissatisfied for any reason. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! No Irish feel was spared in the detailed design of the building both inside and out. It is beautiful and upscale and yet very fairly priced. I had the black cow beer after reading the high reviews and it was delish!  I also had the Guinness stew, despite fair reviews, and I thought it was good. It's served with a very flaky pastry which was a neat touch to the dish and was a better than expected pair. 3 people at my table got various types of steak, all of which loved it! The corned beef sandwich was also very good. Our only suggestion was more kraut for the colcannon. Definitely a great place for families, dates, or friends to get together!"}
{"text":"This is a fun local Irish pub. The field is something you really find where it is cozy and friendly and welcoming. The staff are very friendly. The outside seating areas one of the best in Madison. The only thing that prevents five stars is their menu is stagnant. There are hardly ever any changes and if you want to space that people frequent often, you should change it up a bit every once in a while.

This is a great place to stop off after work and grab a pint or two."}
{"text":"Had a really good dinner here with my mom earlier this week. Our server was attentive and polite. We both ordered a drink, mine a happy hour priced cider & my ma ordered The Molly margarita- made with Jameson. She loved it, said it reminded her of lime kool-aid. The Old Lady had corned beef and cabbage and I had the Reuben mac and cheese. Both were generous portions and delicious, albeit the corned beef being a little spendy especially when prices are lower for St Patty's Day. We took home the Guinness chocolate cake, and the cake was good but the icing was a little off. It was cream cheese icing, and we just felt like it didn't work too well with the cake. Definitely will return when in Madison again. A solid place for good food."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!!!
HUGE square footage for a restaurant.
Fantastic food!!!"}
{"text":"I had a corned beef sandwich and fried cheese curds.  

Sandwich was pretty good, cheese curds were great!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection and good food. The Reuben is choice. Waitress Natalie was amazing. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Nice big pints of Guinness...poured proper! Large bar. Great atmosphere. Didn't eat, but the foods looks pretty good"}
{"text":"First, let me state that I will be back. The food is good. The service is ok. The atmosphere feels like an Irish pub if an Irish pub was made to seat 150 people - but it's really nice. I would give them a five star review except the \"bangers\" they serve aren't real bangers. I have been all over Ireland - and Irish bars in Chicago and New York - and no one there serves what Erin Snug's is serving."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food but unfortunately our experience was miserable because of the arrogant and entitled and arrogant attitude of the bartender.  I've never experienced someone in that type of position that openly cared so little about the customers.  I watched in amazement at how poorly he treated everyone that he came in contact with.  I hope for the business' sake they get rid of him soon.  I know that he'll never serve us again."}
{"text":"Have yet to try their food, but having been for drinks on few occasions now, I have to say as a drinking establishment, it's pretty darn good. Atmosphere definitely skews more towards having drinks after work with friends and colleagues, however, don't let this detract you as like any decent Irish place, you are more than welcome to sit alone at the end of the bar and wallow in your Guinness and whisky. Also, you might have to be a little bit forceful in getting the bartenders' attention when it's busy, but that's true of any bar. Anyways, definitely a candidate in my neverending quest to find a comfortable, regular drinking establishment. Maybe next time I'm in, I'll stop drinking Guinness as a meal and actually order food."}
{"text":"Seriously, I have eaten hundreds if not thousands of chicken wings and Erin's Thai peanut sauce is one of the best I have ever had. It's not currently on the menu but they have it if you ask for it. 9/10 and I don't give out 10s!"}
{"text":"Maybe I went there on an off day. Maybe there were new kitchen staff. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Or maybe it's just me. I have no idea... but I can safely say I had one of my worst dining experiences, ever, at this restaurant. 

Every review I've ever read for this place has said that the restaurant is okay, if not pretty good. 

They must not have had the food I had. The Sheppard's Pie was the worst I've ever tasted. No joke, it tasted the way canned cat food smells. It also looked like canned cat food. I just thought since it was an Irish themed restaurant, it would have decent Sheppard's Pie. I was horribly mistaken. 

Not only was the food bad, but it took 20 minutes to get our order in and hour or so for the food to come out. I would understand had it been busy, but seriously, there were MAYBE 3 other groups of people beside myself and the two others I was with.

Even if someone were to offer to buy me dinner there, I don't think I could ever go back."}
{"text":"What caught my attention was the 36 beers on tap!!! Why not stop here? Walking in and it feels like you came to a small village pub in Ireland."}
{"text":"Been here several dozen times, great atmosphere, friendly staff,usually great service and the bar staff are awesome. The seating around the bar area is great. A full wrap around bar with plenty of space to sit. The new patio area is great with several TVs and a nice fire to keep you warm when its a little cool. 

My favorite things to order are: Irish Smoked Salmon & Calamari for Apps and for dinner the Buffalo wings with some awesome sauces along with the Shepherd's Pie. They are both well prices and hit the spot well. If you like wings, check out all you can eat wings night!!!


The only negative thing I can say is that service over lunch time can be a tad slow at times but has improved. Many business people have avoided coming here in the past as its taken a little longer to order and deliver lunch than other near by places. 

In all a great place for everyone...After work business gatherings, casual lunch, bring the family and kids."}
{"text":"Its not a bad place at all but yet again its not that great either. Don't expect a Gordon Ramsey certified meal here but expect a nice stiff drink. Especially their beer. Has a lot of potential to expand or add on new things."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Got a seat right by the fireplace. Great cheese curds. Got a black cow which is spotted cow and Guinness - delicious !!!  The Reuben was delicious. Loved the marble rye. Didn't love the veggies on the side. My friends got Guinness stew and said It was great. My husband got the prime rib sandwich and said It had too many veggies on It. Very slow to remove our used dishes after we finished our meal. Waitress did not check back often enough for my taste. Great beer list. Chairs r not very comfortable. Also Would come back for the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had been here before for drinks and to listen to a band, it was great!  Tonight I was alone and wanted to get a bite to eat and didn't want to travel too far from my hotel. Saw some great food reviews  on Yelp and decided to stop in.

The restaurant was about half full which I'm sure was about average for a Thursday night after 8pm.  I sat down at the bar to get a drink and to watch TV while I ate.  I waited a few minutes but the bartender did not see me so I moved to a location closer to where he seemed to spend most of his time.  I still had to flag him down to get his attention.  Then I found out what was  up!  Apparently the single woman in the corner needed a lot of attention!  Poor girl was having problems with the menu or something! 

I got my drink finally, but he did not take my order and I really thought about putting a couple of bucks down and going somewhere else.  At that time a second bartender appeared so I asked him to take my order.

I had chicken noodle soup which was lukewarm and very average, (which came quick).  My salad was very fresh and had great flavor.  I was very surprised that my main dish came up about a minute latter.  Hardly had two bites of my salad!  

I'm a huge Irish food fan and was looking forward to trying their Shepard's Pie.  It was pretty good, maybe a little dry , but had good flavor.  Not the best ever but I did like it.  It was well worth the price.

If you go hopefully you get a better bartender or sit at a table .  I liked most everything except the service.  My bartender said four things to me the whole night \"what will you have\"  \"here you go\" \"are you done with this?\" And \"would you like your check?\"

I'm sure he would have been better if it were not for the \"distraction\" in the corner!"}
{"text":"Fave fish fry place in town hands down. Service has always been great. My friends that have tried the \"irish fare\" entrees have all said they were great."}
{"text":"Not very impressive. The food is okay and so is the atmosphere, however the service is subpar. 

This is a place to skip if you are Vegan and be wary if you are vegetarian. I would say the food quality is that of an Applebee's. Everything seems frozen and reheated in a microwave. I suggest looking at the quality of ingredients or finding a classically trained chef. I feel like this place has amazing potential to be a culinary hotspot.

Our server seemed afraid of us. She was friendly, however this may have been her first job/day.

The place looks like you stepped into a pub down the lane from the Blarney Stone. It does look magnificent, which is why I think it has so much potential. My one criticism on the atmosphere is that the music is obviously from some radio. Halfway through a set of 5 songs, the radio let's us know that we've chosen \"Irish Pub Radio\". 

We will try this place again on a busier night and see if the location improves."}
{"text":"Took clients there for lunch, had a good lunch and left a nice tip. I left something very important and called. I spoke to the manager and she promised to mail it to my home address. I never received the item. Very dissappointed."}
{"text":"I will give this place 4 stars only because of what I had, the Pig Twisted Mac. My partners Sheppards pie was pretty disappointing. Especially from an Irish bar.  All of the twisted mac's looked amazing! And the waitress said so too. The flavors of the pulled pork mixed with the cheese were on point. The \"garlic toast\" was SO disappointing- basically French bread with seasoning that was microwaved. Microwaved!! Put that bread in the oven for goodness sakes. 
Decor is awesome, cozy and warm with the fireplace & different decorated rooms- definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the corned beef sandwich with side salad. Both very good. Plenty of food choices!  As a traveler I recommend for those looking for lunch or a good Irish pub."}
{"text":"Okay food...nothing special. The last time we ate here everything tasted very salty. Our waitress was very nice and the overall decor is cozy. This isn't an authentic Irish Pub. This is the Irish version of the Olive Garden. Keep that in mind when you visit."}
{"text":"I've got to echo something said below about authenticity.  Yeah, that's right on the fish and chips, but further to that, when I ate them there, they did not even offer malt vinegar to go along.  Not at all Irish, but then when I was in Ireland, at least in Dublin, it seemed that all of the chippers were Italian or Spanish!  Also, they pass off a cottage pie as a shepherd's pie.  If it is made with beef, it isn't shepherd's pie, which is made with lamb.  When's the last time you saw a shepherd herding a flock of cattle?  After all, the \"shep\" in shepherd is a reference to sheep.  Prices on alcohol in general are a bit over the top, especially for Madison, and this place is on the border, probably actually in the Sun Prairie school district.  We live right in the neighborhood, and notice that it is almost always crowded, the parking lot being an indicator.  Huge crowds are not necessarily an indicator of quality, however.  Since they've \"snuck\" Ireland in their name twice (Erin is a Hiberno-English derivative of the Irish word \"Éirinn.\"  \"Éirinn\" is the dative case of the Irish word for Ireland) I had really expected something reminiscent of my half year living in Ireland.  The looks of the place were more Irish than the contents of the menu.  They did have a substantial selection of spirits from Ireland, but none of the bar staff really knew anything about them.  As a true descendant of Irish immigrants, this place kind of reminds me of all the Irish pretenders we see at St Patrick's day, wearing their green when they are Norwegian or Polish or Black.  It is a pub, I'm not sure if it is snug, but unless you're in the neighborhood, or your standards are pretty pedestrian, it isn't really worth driving out to the far northeast end of the city for a meal.  Like Lauren said, it is not bad, it is simply mediocre.  If your standards are for mediocrity, you'll probably be satisfied.  Considering the quality, the service, and the cost of dining there; for me at least, it isn't worth a repeat.

On St Patrick's Day 2017 I'm sure they were loaded to the gills with people getting loaded to the gills.  The customers took over all parking within a couple hundred yards of the place.  I should've called the fire marshal."}
{"text":"Good Irish food. Shepherds pie is pretty tasty. Drinks a plenty at Erins. Also great music on stage."}
{"text":"Not very good.  Started with the hostess moving so fast in front of us that we actually lost her.  When we did find her she just placed the menus on the table and took off.  No seating us or telling us that our waitress would be right with us.  

The waitress showed up after 10 minutes, it took another 15 minutes for her to bring our drinks, it took over 30 minutes to get our
 food and when we did get the food it was tepid at best.  

My husband's stew was fine, I had corned beef sandwich.  They charged $2.59 for fries that should have come with the sandwich and the fries were cold.

I would not recommend this resturant."}
{"text":"A night without the kids led us here. The Bloody Mary is delicious, and the French onion soup is amazing. Attentive bartender. Great time!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the staff was helpful. I had the Irish stew which was a little bland for me but was overall spot on for what it should have been."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Erin's with friends for fish fry on a Friday night. We arrived around 6 and were seated immediately. This was my first time at Erin's and I think we will be back.

The fish fry was pretty good - good breading (not too much, not too little) - fried cod is the only option for the Friday all-you-can-eat fish fry. They do have other fish options on their regular menu. Sweet potato fries and steak fries were both good. We all got the fish fry, so I don't have much else to report. 

They do have an interesting drink menu with a drink for each of the 7 deadly sins. I tried lust and anger. Anger was a delicious sangria-ish drink (and not angry at all!). 

We all left stuffed and really enjoyed our meals. The rest of the menu also looked interesting, so I'm looking forward to going back and trying other meal options!"}
{"text":"I have been to Erin's a few times.  Rhonda always suggests it and I say no.  After about a year between visits I forgot how bad it was and said yes.  The food is not awful, it is greasy and low in flavor.  The prices are high.  

Rhonda had the fried bluegills and they were greasy and left a film in your mouth.  I had a couple of bites and wished I hadn't.  It took a few hours before the film and taste went away.

I had Mediterranean pasta with chicken.  I know, you don't go to a Irish Pub for pasta.  I thought it would be easy for them to make but I was wrong.  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was lacking flavor.  I thought having kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes would make it flavorful but I was wrong.

Hopefully this review will remind me not to go back and drop $60 on food I don't like."}
{"text":"This is another of our favorite restaurants in Madison. Part of my heritage is Irish and it's hard to find a restaurant that serves it. Their other food is good too, but I usually have the Irish specialties like Guinness Stew or Irish Farmhouse Stew. My friend and I both ordered entrees that came with a side salad. Not only were the salads good-sized with a pleasant variety of greens but they had two kinds of vinaigrette, sesame and raspberry, that were delicious. Our waitress was a dear and quite happy to bring us samples and accommodate my friend's dietary needs.  My husband got a sample of the soup of the day - 5 Star Mushroom -and had to have a cup with his Shepherd's Pie."}
{"text":"I love going to this place, the atmosphere is 5 stars and service often 5 stars as well. i wish there menu had a bit more to offer. That being said, the food is very good. last time Ihad a sammich, the artichoke spinach sandwhich and it was fantastic, homemade chips are special too."}
{"text":"I have been to several different Irish pubs all over the us and I have.to say this one is definitely in the top 5. I will make it a point to come here anytime I'm.in Madison."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Prices seemed a little high but the food was decent. I would place it about average for an irish pub."}
{"text":"Erin's Snug is a solid place on the far east side. I've not only been here for dinner, but this month alone I've been here for two separate private party bookings. One for a rehearsal dinner for my sister's wedding and for a small holiday party for my fiancee's company.

We've always had good service. Food options range from salads, sandwiches, your standard Friday fish fry and even steak. There's also some traditional Irish specialties if your looking to keep it traditional. 

Most recently I had the fish fry (portions were huge) and the sirloin entree. Both were good. The drink menu also has a lot of options. Beer on tap, wine, mixed drinks, and martinis to cover a few. Prices on the specialty drinks can add up fast, so just beware if your on a budget.

My fiancee loves the decor including the lanterns and large knight in the corner, and now thinks he's having a knight someday in his house. :)  They have a huge bar as you enter, so it's also a great place to just grab drinks or appetizers. 

This is a great place for private parties - they have a few room options but would definitely recommend from my experience. I also should mention I've been here on St. Patrick's Day in the past - as you can imagine it is packed and crazy!

Parking is pretty easy and they do offer Badger game shuttles if you are local to the area and looking to head down to the game. And by shuttle I mean the double decker that they have parked outside. We have yet to try it, but know it is an option."}
{"text":"We came up to Madison all the way from Rockport,Texas. Have to say that this was the best fish and chips we have ever had, and I live on the coast.  Nice light batter just right for malt vinegar. Get the colcannon as a side and use the real butter they offer to make it super tasty. The cheese curds were some of the best I had in Wisconsin. Their signature Irish Ale is a perfect balance for the meal. All the staff was friendly and we enjoyed it enough that we returned the next night. Great selection of tap beers and speciality drinks to round out the evening outside on on the patio. We had a service dog with us and they didn't bat an eye. If you come to Madison take the drive up to Erin's and skip the crowded downtown area and enjoy an evening on the patio."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! From their wings to their traditional Irish cuisine! The prices are reasonable, service is good and food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time I've been very underwhelmed. It's a bit on the expensive side. The service has been so-so. But the atmosphere makes up for some of the price and service. The food on the other hand has been the low point for me. First meal: Corned beef and cabbage. I can make it cheaper myself at home ($13) and get a far bigger portion. Second meal: Buffalo wings, ribs, and mashed potatoes. The buffalo wing appetizer was by-far the hottest wings I've ever had, even though we ordered Mild. The ribs were dried out with TONS of sauce on them. The mashed potatoes though were on point."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite place to go. Never had to wait for a seat and the decore is comfy cozy. We have had consistently good service and Great food."}
{"text":"Overall, I was not impressed with my dinner. The decor is great when you first get here. The restaurant has a lot of character. They have a large beer list and have a lot of whiskeys and specialty drinks. 

For the meal, I ordered the Sheppard's Pie. It was dry and under-seasoned. The top did not have the proper crust that you'd expect, either. I was disappointed. 

The biggest issue I have is the pricing. Everything on the menu is a bit expensive for the style of restaurant. For these prices, they really needed to deliver on their food, which they did not."}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant! It really feels like an Irish Pub inside. It has lots of separate dining areas instead of one big room. They even have outdoor seating with a cute fire pit. They have a very large selection of drinks and menu items. We tried a hard cider sampler and they were all very good.

The rolls that they serve as you wait are warm and yeasty. They are so smooth and buttery with a yummy cheese/herb sprinkle on top. My husband ordered a Guiness beef stew which he enjoyed very much. I ordered their seafood pasta. It is kind of pick your own as far as noodles and sauce. They were flexible when I wanted to sub calamari for salmon. I wasn't expecting it to be fried calamari, the result was salty but still good. The prices were a bit high, but I kind of expected that by the look of the building. It was a good place for a quick date night."}
{"text":"Back to poor service.  The food was ok, not worse than before but the experience was dreadful. A coupe seated after us got their good, bill, paid, and left before we were midway through our meal. Waiter was barely around.  Yes they have large groups but all that says to me is that the management is poor and they do not know how to schedule staff.

Service was so bad the waiter got $0 tip.  We will not be going back here for quite some time, once again.  Shame too because they are the only place I know of that has banoffie pie."}
{"text":"I hate this place due to the fact I am not a big fan of potatoes. lol j/k they serve way more. I gave them 4 because even though I am not a fan they are consistent and they rock out good food if you like nacho's made out of potatoes. They have a decent enough of a selection that I can even go and find something to gnaw on that taste good. My star review is unbiased in the fact I wanted to give it a 1 star.......  Anyways if you like Irish/americana I guess you call it then you are in luck.  p.s. to anyone using this as an actual review. This place is good just not my style of food. 4 stars is fairly accurate I think."}
{"text":"This might be the worst place to go in Madison.  It is located on the eastside and I was so excited when it opened because at the time I lived just minutes from it and there is not a lot of restaurants out that way.  

Right when my boyfriend and I walked in, the hostess didn't smile or say hi, she grabbed menus and just walked to our table where we sat.  Then, although there was a whopping 2 other tables in the whole restaurant on this night, NO ONE came to our table for 20 minutes ( and maybe would have been longer, but we got up and left).  The server walked by our table two or three times on his way to another table, but never spoke to us once--even to take our drinks.  

I have also heard from people I work with and am friends with that the food is terrible, but I have not experienced that.  The service alone spoke volumes to me!!"}
{"text":"I was back in my hometown, Sun Prairie, for the Sweet Corn Festival. Good, small-town American fun. Our plan was to visit the Festival on Saturday. So, Friday Night, my Dad wanted to treat us to an All-You-Can-Eat Fish Fry. I asked him about Erin's Snug Irish Pub and if he had been there before. He hadn't, and in fact he had been wanting to try it out. What a perfect time to do this!

Erin's isn't located in a residential area. It's in-between the build up of Madison & Sun Prairie. Right by American Family Insurance. Growing up, this was all farm fields. Now, you can't tell when Madison ends and Sun Prairie begins!  The outside of Erin's is fresh and crisp. Nice landscaping. Inside was a bit of a surprise for me. It's really nice. Woodsy décor. Beautiful rugs on the floor. Lot of little nooks and crannies to sit in besides the larger dining areas they have. Plus, a long bar with plenty of seating. 

The bar was busy, but the restaurant not so much. We got a table right away. It was a little too close to the bar, as for the noise level was high. Looking into the menu, I saw why the bar was so busy. Erin's has a Happy Hour that runs until 6 o'clock. We arrived just after 5:30, so when our server stopped by, we inquired about it. A buck off draft beers. 2 bucks off apps. Erin's has a good selection of beers and it wasn't hard for me to pick one out. A Wisconsin brown ale. Alyssa went with a Raspberry Tart from New Glarus. My Dad got a Long Island Iced Tea. My Ma, well, I can't remember. 

The menu is pretty well laid out. Lots of selections highlighting Irish Fare. The back page has all the daily specials. Friday tells me that the AYCE Fish Fry is served standard with Beer Battered Cod, Steak Fries, and Coleslaw for $13.99. That is exactly what my Dad & I got. Alyssa got a Rubin and my Ma got a Salmon Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.

After ordering, our server brought us a bread basket. Fresh, hot, garlicky buns with soft butter. Boy. Those were good. We devoured them. Our wait for supper wasn't all too long. My supper came with two full fillets of lightly battered Cod, a large pile of Steak Fries, a medium sized ramekin of colorful Coleslaw, and a small ramekin of Tartar & a lemon wedge. 

I squeezed the lemon on my fillets and took a dip into the tartar sauce.  Solid taste. Batter isn't thick. Too much lemon might make your Cod a bit soggy. The tartar was really good. Seemed to be house made. It was chunky with dill pickle. The Steak Fries aren't a favorite of mine. I personally don't think they go well with a Fish Fry. They are called Steak Fries for a reason. right? To go with Steak? I think a Fish Fry should get the skinny Fries. The Coleslaw was fantastic. Again, seemed to be house made. Purples & oranges mixed in. Great cutter into all the fried food bites.

Our server was alright in checking back in with us. I was able to get a few more pieces. I shared with Pheona and gave a bite to Alyssa. Her Rubin was good. I got a bite of it. The bread didn't get soggy, as some Rubin's do. 

The cost isn't justified of this Fish Fry. $13.99 is way to high. Reason being: You don't get any selection. No choice of side or Cod. A Baked Cod would be nice. I'm happy we tried this place out, and will be back to have a drink. But $13.99? C'mon Erin's. For that cost, let me choose what kind of potato I get with it. Overall, the food was good. But not $13.99 good. The ambiance is nice, but loud. This is a place worth checking out. There's a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"I like Erin's. I've been here quite a few times now, and I have never had a bad experience. 

The food has always been good. Not outstanding or amazing, but a very solid, reliable good. 

I visited last summer and ordered the Pig Mac. It was Mac & Cheese laid on top of pulled pork. Except, my pulled pork was forgotten. I let the server know and they brought me some pulled pork, no biggie. It was SO DELICIOUS. Aside from my \"Pig Mac,\" they had several other Mac & Cheese variations to choose from. A Ruben Mac, a Shepard's Pie Mac, a few more... they all looked great!

Today I had the Cottage Pie. It was very good. Very hearty and filling. My group also inquired about Scotch Eggs (we couldn't find them on the menu, but pictured in previous Yelp reviews). They were able to make us some as an appetizer. Those little buggers were FANTASTIC. 

Overall, I am a fan of Erin's. I work super close so I am sure I will continue to pop in time and time again."}
