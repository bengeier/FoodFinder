{"text":"I had the most simple order of veggie bowl..but it was a disaster..avoid if possible.."}
{"text":"if you are at PHX, you have to go to El Bravo in concourse D. It is really good Mexican food & just about the best food you'll find in any airport.  The tortillas are fresh, the food tastes homemade, the service is friendly and fast, and there is a good selection.  my personal favorite is the red chile burrito. A fresh tortilla filled it shredded beef cooked in chile colorado (red chile sauce) and nothing else. No filler like beans or rice. And it is less than $7.  In fact, I like El Bravo so much that I try to rouye through PHX just to have it."}
{"text":"We had a little extra time during our layover to grab some dinner but couldn't go too far, so our options were pretty limited.  I was in the mood for Chinese, but the restaurant didn't look like it had much for vegetarians.  Wendy's is out of the question.  So that left us with El Bravo.  I want to thank them for having several veg options on their menu (although I forgot to double check if the beans were really ok for vegetarians).  My husband and I both ordered bean burritos, one with red sauce and the other with green.  Sorry, El Bravo, but it really wasn't very good.  Nothing was fresh and I didn't care for the taste of anything.  I was so uninterested in my burrito I didn't finish it (a rarity for me).  Thanks for the veg options, but the bean burritos and sauces can use a little bit of love.  Also, you might want to get the airport to invest in more seating- it's uncomfortable eating in that tiny space."}
{"text":"Food is ok and owner is a jerk, go to Jose Roux if you want a good burrito and great service.  Sad because I normally eat here when passing through."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten. I asked the guy at the counter how their carne asada burrito was?  He replied we just made some meat. I should of listened to my spidey senses.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Thought it was very good for the airport. Breakfast burrito was great. Service was excellent. Prices are to be expected at an airport."}
{"text":"Tasty and quick (it's fast fd.) and worth the $ you spend.  Only missing the serenading Mariachi band."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito I had to the potato breakfast burrito. Very good I was impressed."}
{"text":"Delicious as always. Enchiladas or tamales or the Huarache burrito are all my favorites. Fresh made chips and sauce are a plus. Prices are extremely cheap by airport standards. I was here tonite eating my food and witnessed an unruly and abusive customer that had a little too much to drink and was getting mouthy with not only the cashier but also the old woman next to him in line. This idiot was actually threatening the manager with \" I gonna ruin you on Yelp if you dont comp my meal\" I heard the guy admit his food was made properly but did not like what he ordered and felt the restaurant owed him something for his buyers remorse. The police had to be called just to remove him. Really good food and ive always recieved excellent customer service. Its sad they have to deal with airport rifraff, their food is better than restaurant quailty and does not get the credit due because of the location"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken burrito plate. Give you like half a cup of rice and half a cup of beans, both which were mediocre. The burrito was more of a taco than burrito, just meat slapped on a tortilla and wrapped with melted cheese. For $15 I give this 1 Star. You're better off getting something else, or snack until you get to your next destination for better spots."}
{"text":"Ugh I don't know why this place stays open. We came here last year because of a delayed flight. My Bf and I were very disappointed and said, \"lets never go back here\". Well, here we are in the airport again with some time to spare. Only having a couple hours sleep, we needed some fuel before our long flight home. We decided on a Bacon breakfast burrito with added cheese (extra .75 charge) and salsa and we also got a side of beans. WORST burrito I've ever had. It was completely flavorless, the cheese was Cold and so processed that it didn't even melt. The salsa was watery and horrible, which made my whole burrito cold and soupy. I would never suggest this place to  anybody and was tempted to tell people to not go here."}
{"text":"All I got was a beef taco and it was over $5. I was expecting at least a hefty taco but it was just a regular rack the size of Taco Bell or del taco. Wasn't terrible but I could have ate 3 at least but no way was I spending $15 for 3 tacos or getting that combo for $13 which is only two tacos rice and soda. Not worth it"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on my way home, and the $5 egg-bacon-onion-jalapeno burrito  was totally yummy. It was fresh, not greasy, and the salsa was pretty good to. Way better than most airport food."}
{"text":"I had a beef tamales plate. It was yummy and the service was very polite.   I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food for an airport restaurant.  No singing cashier this time.  Next time I fly out of Phoenix I do plan to do the breakfast burrito again.  I think I like it a bit more than the green tamale.  It was a little to wet for my taste."}
{"text":"This place isn't super fancy but it's good Mexican for a reasonable price. I ordered an enchilada plate and it came with a beans, rice, two enchiladas, and a fountain drink with free refills all for $10. If you are traveling with family there are several other dining options if you have a picky eater.  This is located in terminal B.  The only draw back is seating is limited."}
{"text":"Good food and service but ridiculous you have to pay extra for cheese in a breakfast burrito.  Also, they charge $2.19 for pico de gallo."}
{"text":"So I'm in the D concourse 3 hours early for my flight and really hungry. As I look around at my seriously scare food options that include Wendy's, a CNBC gift shop, and some sort of overpriced bar & grill I see a small mexican beacon of hope with El Bravo.    I walked up to the counter and was surprisingly impressed by the array of options I had. After taking a minute I decided to play it safe with a Vegetarian Burrito w/ guacamole (because I can never say no to guacamole even when they charge me an extra dollar for it).   The best part of the  experience by far was the cashier (named Devin look out for him on the next season of American Idol) who sang all responses to you. This is no exaggeration he in fact sang everything from \"Next in line\" to \"Have a wonderful day\".  He made such an fantastical impression on me that I literally booked it to my gate so I could Yelp this experience.  I wish I could say that the food made such as great of an impression on me but sadly it was pretty forgettable. It was a mediocre burrito that was definitely nothing to call home about. Also there were only 3 small tables for El bravo so I had to do play the eat on my lap at the gate game (not my favorite).   Overall it was a decently priced (that is for the airport) mediocre place that you should only really make a point to stop at if you see that a man named Devin is working the counter"}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food... especially Phoenix airport food. If stuck right at that exact location, I'd eat there over the alternatives."}
{"text":"This is for the location in concourse B. Food is OK but pretty expensive for what you get(Mexican food wise). The taco salad (as it stands on the menu) has lettuce and meat), anything else is additional (rice and beans? That's extra, sauce? Extra). So after you add all the things it's more than $5 extra to the menu price. The burrito is very small if you're used to the typical restaurant burritos (I was still hungry afterwards). Again, it tastes fine, but small portions and lots of add on when it should be included in the original price."}
{"text":"Better flavor than Chipotle.  Quality ingredients, great guacamole, and fresh ripe spicy tomato salsa (sweat inducing).  The Gorda burrito with shredded beef was expensive ($12) but considering the size (bigger than chipotle) and airport location, it was well worth it.  This place satisfied my 'last chance' Mexican craving as I waited to board my flight."}
{"text":"Maybe the worst burrito and cost to  value mexican food I have had in years.  9 dollars for a carne asada burrito that looked like an el Monterey frozen burrito and tasted similar.  I actually left hungry,  it was probably about 6 inches long.  Terrible.  I regret not going to the pizza place next door.  Avoid it."}
{"text":"I had the Carne Asada burrito with guacamole. Since it was from an airport place, I wasn't expecting much, but this was an excellent burrito. The meat was nicely seasoned, and the guacamole tasted home made. Hot sauce had a nice kick. I'll be trying this place next time I'm at Sky Harbor Airport Terminal 4."}
{"text":"Almost $10 for a \"burrito\" which was a dry tortilla, shredded chicken, unmelted cheese, tomato and lettuce. If they had called it a wrap, I still would have been disappointed, no flavor and nothing resembling Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great little Tequila bart to hang out in while you wait for your flight.. Great bartender. Be careful the tall beers and $3.00 shoots will catch up to you as soon as you get up to get on the plane.  have fun!!"}
{"text":"Blech. The flautas were really extremely small taquitos, the chicken flavorless, the beans canned, and extremely small portions for a hefty price.  I'm sure there are better options in PHX airport."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews on yelp but I thought I would do other people a service by warning them about this place. The absolute worst airport food experience I've ever had. Heck, probably the worst food experience overall anyway. Having been to the other Mexican place in terminal C last time (which was pretty decent and 50x better than this one) I wanted to try something different. I ordered the chicken bowl. With tax it came to $9.55. What I got in return was a small styrofoam bowl with tiny portions of rice, refried beans and maybe 2oz of shredded chicken (maybe less) lying side by side. That's it. Nothing else (well other than some salsa in a small plastic container). I've never felt so ripped off while eating out. So the first thing I'm doing after eating my \"food\" is writing this review (haven't tossed the bowl in trash yet). Plus the guy taking orders was kind of weird. Today is 16 Feb and he welcomed the next customer saying \"Happy Holidays\"."}
{"text":"Yuk.  I threw it away not even half eaten.  This is a horrific experience.  Terrible. Just terrible.  Airport food doesn't need to be like this... please replace them."}
{"text":"Alright, granted this was airport food but this was still thoroughly mediocre.  I originally intended on exiting the airport to hit Pizzeria Bianco, but alas I chickened out because I wasn't sure I had enough time.  I settled for this after reading about the food options in this airport.  Supposedly this is an outpost of a Phoenix restaurant that is famous for their tamales.  I love tamales and don't get to have them often, so I decided to try it out.  The lady I buy tamales from next to the subway in the Bronx has better ones.  This tamale was a soggy mess due to the sauce on top of them, and it was devoid of flavor (as were the rice and beans).  The pricing also made no sense in hindsight.  A tamale is only $4 and the soda and rice/beans brings it up to $10; however if you get a burrito ($6), it's the same deal for no more food.  Basically this is a local place that is cashing in on people who are trapped in the airport.    Bring your food or just starve.  It's better than this!"}
{"text":"Only 1 star because at 750 they decided to close while I was waiting to order girl walked away from counter turned chairs upside down on tables and came back to me 5 min later to say hi we're closed....hmmm ok. So Rude. Sign said no more fried food or certain items so I guess they put stuff away throughout the evening so they are ready to go AT closing and then can just go home?!? Don't know don't care will never eat here when I go through here again and I come through this airport often!"}
{"text":"I will definitely eat here again.  It was delicious!  I got a veggie burrito and a bean and cheese tostada.  The beans were excellent.  I was surprised to find such good food at an airport."}
{"text":"How many times can you claim to have had a decent meal in an airport?? Having flown through Phoenix Sky Harbor numerous times in the last month I've found myself strangely drawn to El Bravo. When your other choices are Wendy's and some random Chinese place its easy to see why.   My chicken burrito, which I enjoyed many hours later, 30,000 feet high somewhere over Chicago was surprisingly good. Granted I'm starving, on a plane, and anything sounds good at this point, but I found the burrito to be filling and have pretty fresh flavors.   If you find yourself starving and stuck in Phoenix Sky Harbor its not a bad choice.."}
{"text":"My last flight through PHX brought me to El Bravo, as usual; but this time I found the prices slightly lower and the quality much less than usual. The bean and cheese burrito, my usual standby, was much smaller and, sadly, made with canned beans. Huge no-no. Glad I'm not traveling for a while...."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous. I'm not even joking. I didn't know there could be worst Mexican than Taco Bell... today I was proven wrong. Bland. Basic. Bleh. I wish I could rate it lower than 1 star"}
{"text":"Stopped at this restaurant in Sky Harbour airport, terminal 4, B concourse around 7 am on June 23rd. I ordered a breakfast burrito.  After one bite I knew something was wrong.  It tasted terrible and was cold in the middle.  I had only one bite and promptly through it in the trash.  Upon arriving in Miami I was sick. Food poisoning.  I was ill for 24 hours.  Shame on this restaurant, the employees and management that were working that day.  They do not care about their customers.  I strongly recommend you stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst chicken burrito I have ever had. It said grilled. Chicken was shredded and I'm pretty certain canned or something. Tortilla was warned, otherwise crappy chicken lettuce and cheese for $11.  I could not eat the whole thing even though I was hungry and I am not a picky eater. McDonald's would have been better"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast burritos! $9 for a bacon burrito with only a couple fine chopped little pieces! Very small also. Ingredients for a breakfast burrito cost nothing and should be filled! Would not recommend! Waste of money!"}
{"text":"If you're in D concourse in PHX, and you're hungry, then this is a decent spot for eats.  They do the lot, and prices are not horrible.  I don't know what happened to the first reviewer--[perhaps someone should flag that?]  As for this eater, I stick to the red tamale combo--beans / rice added.  The masa is first rate and the shredded beef is spiced well for a real mc coy.   You can wash that one down with a tamarind soda or horchata if you like.  My tip for fellow yelpers east of the Mississippi river, where good masa is hard to find, go ahead and order a dozen tamales packed cold for your carry on bag--even a five hour flight gets them into the freezer to stay great tasting for months.  My fellow travelers have taken on the burritos and tostadas, with positive remarks.  Tortillas are genuine--hard to ruin a bean/cheese otherwise. Again, this is not the best Mexican you'll ever eat, but it is the best you'll ever eat in an airport--so that's how I justify the five stars here."}
{"text":"Another day in Phoenix and another burrito. It's a theme that has become all too common in my visits + layovers in AZ, and my love affair with Mexican cuisine often leaves me desperate and stupid enough to seek it all forms both good, bad, and ugly. To declare El Bravo as the best burrito option in Sky Harbor Airport would be the truth, even if it doesn't say a whole lot.   For airport food, it's as pricey and as subpar as one would expect. Don't fall for the sad nachos or the depressing state of their soft tacos, burritos are definitely the way to go. If the thought of eating a small brick of a burrito doesn't appeal to you, ask them to have less rice and more protein / filling. Some folks shoot for carne asada, I am more of a chicken pollo fan myself. It's not as tough as the beef and the chicken is usually the least dry of the choices  If you go wet enchilada style, it'll save you the trouble of wolfing it down while holding it like a slob while keeping that flour tortilla soaked and moist (oh my). This will all run one close to $10 with a drink and rice and beans, which for airport prices isn't the worst thing ever. Don't expect the staff to accommodate any picky eating habits, unless of course its simply a matter of 86'xing the veggies.  Finally, the airport version of El Bravo is as expected, a watered down version from the semi-famous original (http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-bravo-phoenix) in downtown Phoenix. There is some limited potential here, but until something better comes along, it's best that El Bravo Sky Harbor remain."}
{"text":"Another place that for some reason can't make a breakfast burrito.  The ingredients are egg + chorizo + cheese + tortilla, thats not a long list!  Yet for some reason mine was totally devoid of egg and the woman behind the counter had the audacity to argue that it did have egg in there.  I'm pretty sure I know the difference between egg+chorizo and just chorizo and that was definitely the latter.  The only reason she got bumped up to 2 stars was for offering to make another, though I didn't feel the need to brave another iteration of that horse troth worthy slop. Probably would have been less grossed out by a turd wrapped in a tortilla.  You know when as you order they hand it through the window and the kitchen is dormant that that crap has probably been sitting a while, and it trasted like it.  Her offer to \"Make me a fresh\" one was just a pleasant way of saying \"hand another cold one thats been sitting for the last 30 thru the window\".  I'm sure their real place in town is much better, obviously you can run a good restaurant in an airport or someone would have succeeded at it by now.  Airport food always sucks, best to just bring a sandwich get to wherever you're going and eat a real meal there."}
{"text":"Located in terminal B of Phoenix International Airport. I was a little bit wary, since it is scrunched in btw a coffee place and pizza joint. You could probably miss it if you were flying down the concourse. Thanks to Yelp though, it got the best review out of all the food places in terminal B. We decided to brave the Mexican place (we had been thoroughly spoiled from all the Mexican food we ate in Arizona that week).   I got the veggie burrito and my hubby got the chicken burrito. They were warm and pretty darn tasty for airport food! Kept us full during our flight from AZ to Philadelphia...we weren't tempted to buy any of US Airways inflated snack options. Thanks El Bravo! P.S. And no, there were not emergency sky-high bathroom visits needed."}
{"text":"1 hour layover, so why not? It was breakfast time, but the entire menu is available (except for the carne asada). Ordered the chicken soft taco (meat was dry and pretty tasteless) and the shredded beef (juicy, flavorful meat). Taco is dressed with iceberg lettuce and diced tomatoes. Not super interesting and the hot sauce doesnt add enough \"umph\" to fix this. Considering the options in the area, this place is fine in a pinch. Just skip the chicken."}
{"text":"You can do better at Sky Harbor. It was fast but the service was snippy and the burrito forgettable."}
{"text":"Warning sign should have been no line in a packed airport and super slow front staff.  I ordered a bacon, potato and jalapeno breakfast burrito, and they charged me extra for cheese and salsa but didn't post the prices.  My 8.59 burrito was over $12 with these additions.  It had no jalapeño to speak of, no potato and a few bacon bits.  The salsa was so watery it leaked everywhere and I tossed it."}
{"text":"Worst worst thing you could ever eat - to start, I always look at Yelp reviews before I eat anywhere. For some reason, I don't do this at airports. But I'll never forget to do this again.   So I'm trying to find my gate, and I need to eat lunch before a cross country flight, so I see this place and think how bad could it be. $8.99 for a chicken burrito doesn't seem too excessive. While I'm looking around to make sure I'm in the right gate, the cashier asks if I want things like salsa, cheese, beans in my burrito. I say sure cause why not. I hand him my card, and didn't realize until I got the receipt that the burrito came out  to $17 with tax.  Besides being shocked at the price, and realizing everything was at least $1.50 extra, I figure I'll be full because it will be a huge great burrito.  Sadly I was wrong, and this was the worst burrito I've ever had. The tortilla was definitely microwaved and extremely soggy, the chicken had no flavor, there was like 3 beans in the whole thing, barely any salsa. It was so so so bad that I couldn't eat more than half any threw it away.   Just go over to Wendy's a couple places down, spend less than half the price, and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Witnessed manager refuse to take back an order that was messed up. Was an absolute jerk to a very nice lady who just wanted to exchange it for what she ordered. Can not believe a manager could be so unprofessional! Corporate, if you see this, have a talk with the manager on duty on 6-30-11 @ 6pm. I can say that his attitude turned many people away that were in line. Not good for your business!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst chicken burrito I've had.  Shredded, unseasoned chicken with iceberg lettuce, cheddar cheese and pale tomatoes in a soggy tortilla.  There was no sauce or seasoning.  There was no flavor in this burrito at all."}
{"text":"We had a few minutes to kill before our flight and El Bravo looked to be the best option. I was excited to see they bragged about their tamales and decided to try the tamale burrito with beans and rice. At first bite I was impressed. The tortilla seemed to be homemade and I got a bite of the masa shell. Unfortunately the next bight I got meat. It was the greasiest, worse-than-taco-bell type flavor I've ever had. The beans and rice were nothing special and I had that awful meat flavor in my mouth the entire flight home."}
{"text":"It gave me calories.  I'll give it that.  Had a burrito.  Very little flavor.  Dry.   Convenient location."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fast Mexican food. Had the shredded beef quesadilla, was a bit dry and definitely needed the side of sour cream (0.75). They threw some lettuce and tomato in the box, but it looked a bit wilted so it stayed in the box. I was a bit scared to try it, as everyone seemed to be going to the pizza place next door. It was ok, but nothing to rave over."}
{"text":"Every Sunday I get great tacos at a flea market by my house. I found myself with time to kill at the Phoenix airport on a Sunday morning and decided to keep the tradition alive.  I had the chorizo breakfast burrito. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  Just kind if bland and forgettable. I guess I shouldn't expect too much at an airport but if a wagon at a flea market can make great Mexican a full kitchen should be able to do the same."}
{"text":"I ordered a machaca and egg burro. It was dry and flavorless. The advertised jalapeños were close to non existent. To top it off there was no salsa to accommodate the burrito. Growing up in the southwest this was a first for me. The cashier also seemed to think that providing eye contact was not necessary for taking my order."}
{"text":"OK for airport food, but they ask you if you'd like various extra toppings and don't tell you anywhere that they are charging for them until the bill is rung up.  That is just shady business!  Please advertise clearly!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I just ate here and were pleasantly surprised. I had a beef burrito bowl (ie a veggie burrito with shredded beef) and was very impressed with the quality of the beef, as well as the other ingredients. And my co-worker enjoyed the carne asada tacos. For an airport this is actually quite good. Would even go here if it weren't in an airport."}
{"text":"This place closes at 8pm on a Friday night. Not convenient for any of the people arriving or departing here at night.  Same with the pizza place next door."}
{"text":"Bandidos!! On my way back home from a vacation to Mexico City I had to catch a connecting flight at Phoenix International Airport. After a long day of traveling I was starving. With not much time to catch the next flight and not many food options at terminal B gates 1-14,  El Bravo seemed like the best choice. A taco salad seemed like a good transition from vacation to reality but it was mostly a reality check. A fried flour tortilla shell with a few shreds of lettuce, a meager scoop of salsa, guacamole and chicken and a ton of absolutely no flavor for 10 dollars? I need some tequila to help me forget this experience."}
{"text":"MAN! I can't believe people have rated this place so low! I have a hard time saying I just got lucky....  I was flying out early and the line for the coffee/bakery adjacent to El Bravo was 20 people deep. There was no way I could wait that long for a quick breakfast nibble. I'd forgo the coffee. There was no line at El Bravo and I ordered right away: two shredded beef tacos on soft corn tortillas. These are the street tacos, so ordering 2-3 is a pretty standard thing. And tacos are terrific for breakfast, especially if you don't want a big burrito with eggs and potatoes.    The cashier was very friendly and polite, and it was nice to be able to have a quick conversation rather than forced through the cattle lines at the place next door.  Seating is super limited. I was lucky enough to have scored a table before my order came out. The two tacos were delicious! The beef was super tender and flavorful, the cheese/lettuce/tomato garnish was fresh and plentiful, the corn tortillas were soft and looked homemade, and the taco sauce/salsa they give you is just the icing on the cake (or the sauce on the taco, as it were). Honestly, a REALLY GOOD TACO. I have no idea what these other people ordered, but get the shredded beef taco on a soft corn tortilla. I can vouch for it.  Go ahead and order 3-4. Two wasn't enough."}
{"text":"You don't come here because you're starving. You come here for punishment! Typical Mexican fast food that makes you gassy and bloated. Located in the B concourse in Terminal 4. This joint reminds me of Filiberto's, but more expensive. The Price is okay for airport food, but they have a great staff and it's vegetarian-friendly too!  AIRPORT: PHX T4- B SIDE"}
{"text":"We tried the machaca breakfast burrito and was disappointed- small, dry tortilla stuffed with very little spicy shredded beef (that was dry and hardly had any flavor) and full of egg for over $10.  We added cheese to it too - without the cheese, it would've been even more lifeless!"}
{"text":"First, Gloria was so pleasant and outgoing and she gets extra smiles from me...extra salsa (because that is my kryptonite). Grabbed a bean & cheese tostada before boarding the long flight back to DC.   Devoured it - every bite. A bean tostada for $3.59...very inexpensive. Add chips & salsa (because that is a staple in my diet) for $2.99 and I'm out $7.15 - make sure you tip! hard workers here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Well...I was pleasantly surprised this morning as I looked for a quick breakfast option before hopping on my flight. The young lady working the register about an hour ago was AWESOME! I wish I'd gotten her name. She was friendly, efficient, patient, and accommodating. I had a special order breakfast burrito and they got it right! Yahoo! It was quite tasty and didn't take forever to get to me. So appreciate that!"}
{"text":"Got a chicken rice bowl and was disappointed with runny frijoles bland chicken and skimpy portion for an eight dollar rice bowl"}
{"text":"Everything in the airport is overpriced - this is the first airport meal I've been happy to pay the price for. I walked up to the cashier and with a song-song tune he let me know about the special. A Navajo taco with carne asada (his recommendation) with beans, lettuce, guac, sour cream, tomatoes onions, jalapeños... best airport meal I've had. Quick service and nearly no line. Sandwiched between two other eateries. I wish I had a place like this near home."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant at Sky Harbor.....  I've been meaning to check out the original El Bravo location in Phoenix, as I've been so happy with this little counter-service airport version of it.  They really have a great selection of burritos and other fast casual Mexican food items.  Even the bean and cheese burrito is tasty!  (Everyone who knows me knows that this is probably the first thing I'll try at any casual Mexican restaurant).  It was the perfect delivery mechanism for El Bravo's rich salsa roja (the red stuff).  El Bravo is an all around good place, and it's leaps and bounds above the rest of the chain options in the airport.  One little nitpicky note about this place..... I'm pretty sure the prices have gone up recently.  They didn't seem exorbitant, but competitive, which was a huge disappointment.  This place used to be pretty cheap."}
{"text":"I'm thankful for El Bravo being in the Airport. It's probably the only place in Terminal 4 serving food that didn't come in a box marked \"Sysco\".    El Bravo serves up a number of different authentic-style mexican dishes, but sticking to my successful action of not eating meat from a place I'm not familiar with, I chose the Bean and Cheese, adding rice for a complete protein*.   The food tasted home-made and the ladies making it are the real deal. It didn't taste like they used any processed ingredients and it filled me up pretty well.  Only problem I had is that they didn't offer any commercial hot sauce, like Tapatio or Cholula. The food I had was very bland and could really have used a few ounces of help.    *Rice and Beans, the complete protein: Rice is rich in starch, an excellent source of energy. Rice also has iron, vitamin B and protein. Beans also contain a good amount of iron and an even greater amount of protein than rice. Most significantly, the consumption of the two in tandem provides all the essential amino acids."}
{"text":"Average at best. Tried the breakfast burrito.  Eggs and a bit of bacon.  All the other included items were barely recognizable. Maybe the other items are better. Not sure why the reviews are so good."}
{"text":"You could save your money and just make this at home and bring it in. Pretty bland chicken."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place. I reminded me of a place from college, but has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. The last 3 times I've dined here before my flight it has simply been terrible. I, and you, should not go here. Previously would enjoy friendly service in getting a chimichanga.  Prior two visits, oil must had been too cool and it was nasty greasy with no crisp. Last time got a chicken burrito.  I was assured it had the extra guacamole and sour cream.  It did not. When politely asking for it, I was given a cup of totally old grey green goo and two serving of diva attitude that was not ordered. Bland and not fresh. So many better options at the airport."}
{"text":"Meh. Airport food, you are so expensive and bad for me. It's like Disney.. minus the rides and people dressed in costumes. Wait no I'm wrong I hope that was a costume.  This was okay. I mean its airport Mexican. Quesadilla meh, not really spicy. Fast, Yup. That's that."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Ordered the beef burrito combo (with rice and beans). This was unequivocally the worst burrito I have ever seen. Came in a wrap, was so moist it was sopping wet. The packaging started sticking to the wrap and was difficult to separate. Chewing on paper, not the nicest feeling. Rice and beans were VERY small portions. Combo is not a deal. Should have checked with Yelp first. My bad!"}
{"text":"What could be more satisfying while waiting for your next flight than enjoying a delicious burrito, taco or enchilada? Other than winning the lottery (or having your flight actually depart on-time), nothing comes to mind.  This shop was opened by the daughter of the original El Bravo (north-central Phoenix) and her husband. While it's hard to beat the original, this airport version bears a strong resemblance (food and service-wise; obviously it's much faster since located at the airport).   If you're looking for a delicious meal and have a soft spot for Mexican, El Bravo is your spot in Terminal 4!"}
{"text":"Homemade chips were a dream during a two hour layover, however, the chunky salsa needed to be blended more.  One chip dip delivered a tomato chunk that was half the salsa bowl.  Horchata was watery and as expected...not authentic.  5 people in the kitchen and one cashier doing too much that caused obvious delays.  Does anyone manage this or do they just do what they want?"}
{"text":"Airport food, is Airport food, I can't get to excited about it, but sometimes you get something that satisfies the hunger of staying up all night at an airport and preparing to fly out for the day!  I got a veggie burrito from here and it kinda tasted like a half pound bean burrito from Taco Bell.  I used to got to Taco Bell at 4am after a night of recording or drinking so maybe it was just my lack of sleep or I was on some other zone, but this tasted like a bean burrito from Taco Bell, mind you it was about 8 dollars more then a Taco Bell burrito but thats pretty much what it was..  The gal selling it was very sweet though, and let me refill my early morning diet coke!  Oh I'm tired."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex in an airport.  Nothing amazing to note.  The food was actually better than I expected."}
{"text":"I find it funny that I've been to Phoenix about 9u79q87909qut09qw8r09 times yet every time has been only in some portion of this airport /airport tram. Anyway...  I ate here at El Bravo on March 29, 2010. It was around 8 ish o'clock and let's face it, there's not a ton of places to chose from to eat when you're waiting on your flight to board. I had a 2 hour layover and I didn't want Chinese or Wendy's so this was my only choice. I was so hungry as I had a slice of sausage and a glass of water only that day.   It ticked me off that while Wendy's and the Chinese restaurant share a fountain machine to get drinks out of, yet when I asked for a cup of tap water here, free at EVERY restaurant pretty much, I was told I had to buy an overpriced bottle of water - they don't share the water spout of the fountain machine with the two other restaurants. Grrr. I wish I would have just asked for a cup and went to the water fountain next to the bathrooms since I can suck down a bottle of water in 3 or 4 gulps. I'm a water feign.   The tortilla soup wasn't much of a soup, it was more the consistency of of paste or oatmeal. If it was any thicker, you may be able to eat it with a fork. Luckily, it had a really nice flavor and was not loaded with cumin! The loaded nachos were overpriced ($8+) since they didn't contain any delicious animal flesh of the beef or chicken varieties."}
{"text":"While fairly fast, this fast food Mexican joint near B10-B15 gates is deficient in taste. I guess I expected a little better since we are in the Southwest here at PHX. I was surprised that the rice bowl came in a styrofoam bowl, wrapped in foil and then packed into a plastic bag - bad for the environment and bad for taking to go. Airport establishments need easily transportable containers that don't leak all over your bag. Portionwise, it's a decent price for the bland mass of rice, beans and dry chicken that you get, but it's not worth it if you have taste buds."}
{"text":"ordering a bean and cheese burrito at the airport seemed like an ordeal and way overpriced.  Seriously $14 for a medium drink and bean and cheese burrito."}
{"text":"I ordered the rice bowl with chicken and I was pleasantly surprised by both the quality and the quantity of food I received.  This is surprising this is an airport eatery.  Service was good and wait time for my food was very reasonable.  I'll probably be eating here again."}
{"text":"Great service all the time.  Anyone get the singing cash register?   So funny I tipped him a five for a five dollar burrito."}
{"text":"when you don't have much time in between flights, mexican is usually the way to go. sure you when you think of beans & a plane ride, they don't conjure an ideal situation. though overall it usually works out. i had the chimichanga though asked that it not be fried... basically i wanted a burrito with everything in it without paying money for each item added on as extra. i found the meat to be really dry... actually overall it wasn't that appetizing. i think if they had put salsa or some refreshing or flavorful sort of taste into their burrito, it would definitely save it. it was bland. that's all that comes to mind. it was definitely worth the \"meh\".   though as i mentioned before when you have to eat quick on the go you don't have time to think & ask if they can change things. so in the end... don't order it unless you have overactive salivary glands that help make this meal juicier."}
{"text":"Food is bad.  You pay a lot of money for Taco Bell or deal taco quality food.  Don't waste your money.  I spent $12 for a chicken burrito and side of chips."}
