{"text":"Sometimes you don't need a perfect setting and fancy place to indulge and enjoy the good food. All it takes is a friendly atmosphere and definitely a delicious authentic meal. The best taste that you can have of Persia in a place as far as this one from the Middle East. 
Real super food and good service, fair price and most importantly clean.
Super! Bravo! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"While the d√©cor isn't anything to write home about, this place is a tiny jewel of a find. The seating was comfortable, but close for a group as large as ours. The service was very friendly and attentive, and the food was excellent. The menus are in Farsi, French, and English and everything is well-explained so nobody new to the cuisine felt awkward. I had a veal tongue plate (most dishes are available either as a sandwich or a plate), and I can't recall the last time meat literally melted in my mouth like that. Everyone was delighted with their choice. On top of that, we originally thought the prices looked quite reasonable, but when we saw the huge portions we were served we felt like we'd gotten a real bargain. Almost everyone in our group of nine ended up taking food home. When you go, take a hearty appetite. It's clearly popular with the Iranian community, too, which is always a good sign - we were the only English/French-speaking customers there while we were having dinner. Overall a great place. We'll all definitely be going back.

{"text":"Excellent Persian food. Try the kashk bademjoon (aubergine with youghourt) as well as the mirzahashemi (aubergine with onion and garlic) then a spot of tea afterwards."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place amongst the Persian community here in Montreal, but never really got a chance to try until now. It's a small cute place. The staff was very nice and accommodating, I told her it was my first time here so she placed special attention.

They basically have everything Persian you can imagine, from kookoo sabzi (fried herb cake), tongue, brains, abgoosht to kabab, different types of Persian stew with rice.

Everything was tasty and fresh, but most surprising of all was the price, very very affordable, basically you're paying for a Focus but you're getting a Mercedes.

I will be going back very soon. If you're in the area try it."}
{"text":"We kind of randomly found this place on Yelp.  The food was excellent, very fresh and tasty.  The kids liked it and there were many things that they could eat. Hot fresh bread was also wonderful.  I will be back for sure. I had an amazing eggplant dish that was really wonderful. 

Very nice staff."}
