{"text":"If you're a tourist, COME HERE! The service was nothing short than superb, came to Montreal to visit some friends and explore the city, we had a reservation and we greeted kindly as soon as we walked in. Our waiter was friendly and lively, more importantly patient as we had difficult time choosing what to have. We ended up getting quite of bit of food to share among all of us. The food was terrific, the beef tartar was packed with flavor and ask for extra bruschetta because there is only 3 pieces along with the order. Duck poutine and shepherds pie makes my mouth water every time I think about it. Their wine selection was not bad, and had all of the essentials. We had a great time among friends and the staff, and the food with wine is amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday, it was quite busy but we don't mind waiting. Things started off well, we were steated quickly and we recieved our coffees quickly as well. However it took an hour to recieve our food, not one person came over to explain the wait or ask if we needed a refill on our coffee or water which were empty for 45 minutes. I understand the kitchen can get backed up and waits do happen, but you should explain this to your guests. We finally got our food which was alright, I ordered the eggs benedict and there was barely any hollandaise sauce and my poached eggs were overcooked. When it came to pay the bill we left a 10% tip, as we thought that was fair for the service we recieved. The waiter came over to us and told us off because its expected you leave at least a 15% tip. This was outrageous to me, he was at our table for maybe 2 minutes, never asked how our food was or offer us more drinks and he is questioning why he didn't get a 15% tip. Tips are earned, and when we get great service we leave a great tip. Don't mouth us off for 'bad tipping' when you ignored us for most of the meal."}
{"text":"Yesterday, had a beer towards the end of the night at the outdoor tables with my pup and a friend.  LOVELY server; good beer (red ale).  Went back tonight.  Sat at the bar.  Bustling.  Totally comfortable atmosphere.    Service good and professional, food DELICIOUS, beer yum (blonde ale), and though I didn't have a cocktail, I watched some being made and they looked great.  I had the FROMAGE HALLOUMI RÔTI.  Lovely.  Had I been able to read the menu (I tried the French, and refused the English) I might have not ordered it but I'm glad I did.  Really lovely vegetarian meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing. If you go anywhere near this place eat here. Don't think of anywhere else to eat. The prices here were reasonable, the service was good too but the thing that surprised me was the decor. I think this place is a good place for kids to eat (7 and above) lower not good choices. Overall this restaurant is the best in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Délicieuses frites, délicieux hamburger, même végé et belle ambiance..."}
{"text":"After being recommended by the W Montreal concierge, myself and my husband tried Vallier out over the weekend. We were excited to try it out after seeing a great menu online filled with comfort food.   We were going to the hockey game in Montreal at 7:00 so we made a 4:00 dinner reservation for an early dinner before the game. We arrived early and decided to sit at the bar for a drink before eating, we told the maitre d that we were there for our DINNER reservation. After having a few drinks we told the bartender we would just eat at the bar and asked for a menu. He handed us a paper printout with FOUR items on it, he said it was a limited menu until 5:00. None of which we wanted and none of which were on the menu online. I understand if they have a limited menu before 5, but knowing that we were there for dinner and letting us sit there and wait for our dinner reservation AND THEN tell us that we have a choice of four items was rude. We asked if we could just order the Mac and Cheese, we were greeted with a quick NO. No explination, just No. We asked for the check and left.  After realizing that there were no decent restaurants in the area after the game, we decided to go back because my husband really had his heart set on the Mac and Cheese with Bacon. We order the mac and cheese, french onion soup and the buffalo wings. The mac and cheese was EASY MAC, no taste and watery. The french onion soup and buffalo wings were OK, nothing great.  I don't see what the attraction is with this place and would never recommend it to anyone I know. Besides the food being mediocre, the staff was unfriendly and rude."}
{"text":"Ending afternoon in old Montreal, Vallier was a nice surprise. Window seat, good jazz, tasty cheese plate with excellent small French rolls. Relaxed clientele, all enjoying themselves. Casual, comfortable decor, a favorite spot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I hopped across the border to grab some dinner. Little did we know, it would be nothing short of amazing! The service was fantastic. We were a little nervous that we don't speak French, but as soon as we said, \"Hello\" they catered to our English. The menu has a great array of choices, but not so many you get overwhelmed. Before entering Canada, I said, \"We HAVE to get Poutine.\" The first we ever had was here- the duck option- and it was to-die-for. A-Mazing.  We also got the fried calamari- it was the smoothest calamari we've had. I usually don't like to order it because it's most often rubbery, but this was really really fantastic. I ordered a burger, which was pretty good. The only thing that was odd was that I wasn't asked how I want it cooked. Now thinking back, I'm not sure if it was one of those frozen patties, you know? So that's where the one star is deducted. Also, the fries that came with it were SUPER greasy, but it's fries...so what can you do...The salad was super yummy! It made me feel better after having 10000 calories of cheese and gravy and fries haha Anyways, I would totally come here again!  The bleu cheese was wonderful and fresh (as fresh as cheeses get ;) )  The wait time in between was comparable to other French restaurants- we weren't rushed at all and there was ample time to relax. No one shoved all the dishes in our face at once and no one tried to take our plates away without us being visibly finished.  The check-out process was quite nice too- they bring the card machine to you...not that whole \"I'll bring it back and forth while you wait an hour to cash out.\"   The strange thing that happened was that they put onions on my burger after I requested no onions. The waiter appologized and said he would replace the burger, but I just simply asked for new cheese. He brought a good serving and then never came back- we were assigned a new waiter. I don't know if this is policy? But either way, everything was completely fine once he brought the cheese! I hope he didn't get into trouble! Poor guy lol"}
{"text":"Terrible service, and the food was not great either!  My sister and I had spent the day at a spa in Montreal, and a woman who worked a the spa highly recommended Vallier for dinner. My sister and I were starving when we arrived, so we asked the waiter to put in an order of calamari while we looked over the drinks menu, he said the calamari is instant and it was a good idea to order right away since we were hungry. About ten minutes later we were, ready to not only order our drinks but our dinner as well, the waiter took forever to come back to take our order.. Not sure why he was so frantic because he didn't have that many tables. He finally took our order and came back with our drinks a few minutes later, we ordered the white sangria, which was delightful! He continued to be frantic, and about fifteen minutes later we got our dinner. I said to the waiter I assume the calamari is not coming out? He looked confused for a minute and then said oh yes you ordered calamari! Why didn't you ask me about it when I brought the drinks? I told you they are instant! I responded well I didn't know you had forgotten our order, and thought it was taking a little longer. The waiter was not available if we did want to flag him down to ask him what the eta was anyways. My sister had the ravioli and I had the lamb Shepards pie both meals were lacking salt and spices, both meals were very bland! The waiter never asked if we were enjoying our meals, and every process from start to finish took forever including him bringing the bill and the credit card machine!  There are so many great restaurants in Montreal, Vallier is not one of them."}
{"text":"Fantastic salmon with légumes and a lobster consommé. Salmon was cooked beautifully. Beans were a little too crunchy. Consommé was mildly spicy. Very very busy at lunchtime but the servers didn't take too long, were nice, and the food arrived fresh from the pan."}
{"text":"The chicken was awesome (juicy, flavorful) , the cheeseburger was terrible (cold, tasteless, you name it).   I guess that if you stick with poultry you're golden."}
{"text":"All I can think off is... average ! The food is ok but average, clientele, prices are average. The service is very very slow and average again. The choice of wines is poor. In the plate of cheese, it's only American cheeses  (it's supposed to be a French Brasserie).   I got the salmon tartare which was too spicy, which hidden all the savors of the fish. My friend got a beef tartare and made the same comment. My other friend got the \"Volaille\" and told it was very good (and she is picky). Our neighbours got cheeseburgers, and they looked really yummy. The décor is nice.  I won't go back by choice and definitely give my loyalty to Holder or l'Express."}
{"text":"J'adore le nouveau concept, l'ambiance et le menu du resto. Le poulet frit est hallucinant et j'ai adoré les calmars avec la sauce épicée."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner on a Wednesday night after arriving from Montreal.  This restaurant is a 10-minute walk from the Intercontinental Montreal through quaint and safe streets.  The ambience is awesome-- little French bistro, and pretty full even for a Wednesday night at 9 pm.  I started with a glass of rose, very refreshing, then onto a salade Lyonnaise with bitter frisee, lardons, and a poached egg.  There was WAY too much of the lardons on the salad, but be it far from me to complain about an excessive amount of crispy, smoked, fried meat. . .  Besides this, it was delicious with a runny egg and sharp vinaigrette.  I ended with the most delightful little cake with a maple cream sauce.  It came with the de rigeur but superfluous half-ripe slices strawberry and mint leaf, but I forgive them for the trite garnish.  I'm still thinking about that maple cream sauce.  Overall, a wonderful little gem for good-- not great-- food that hits the spot when you need a fix of old-world charm and classic French bistro fare."}
{"text":"Came for a late meal on a Sunday night.  Sat inside, it was a beautiful night so the windows were open and it was a very comfortable atmosphere with the open air feel of a bistro.    Looking over the menu I noticed there was a lot of stuff I would have liked to try.  However, after much deliberation decided to get the albacore tuna with quinoa and it was delicious.  Perfect meal for after a nice workout, which coincidentally I had just finished.    Only complaint was I thought the tuna could have been slightly warmer.    Service was fine, and I found the prices to be reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Food was borderline gross. The French onion soup was coated in American cheese and clearly microwaved, and the potato soup was average and cold.   We both ordered the flank steak, which came with an unappealing salad and a pile of fries. The fries were good but the meat was not. I had asked for super super rare; I wanted to see some blood, and I wanted to make that really clear. My partner asked for medium rare. Mine was a disaster. Way overcooked and the meat was sinewy and tendon-y instead of smooth and buttery, so I sent it back hoping to get a meal worth the $25 price tag . Unfortunately the waiter decided to try to convince me that it was rare, that it was what I had ordered, and literally scoffed at me when he eventually took it back. When he returned, he slammed the plate in front of me and demanded that what was put in front of me was now rare. In the hopes of salvaging the rest of our time, I didn't argue, however the new piece of meat was still overcooked, and even less appetizing than the first one. My partner was upset because I had to wait around while he ate his (also overcooked) meal, and our waiter was being a jerk.  Our waiter was replaced by a different waiter at the end, who was much nicer, so I tipped him in lieu of the other guy. Overall we paid too much to eat a meal that neither of us could enjoy. I hated this experience and the only reason I gave a star was because the place itself was very nice inside.  If I had read the reviews before coming here, I would have just gotten a Five Guys burger across the street."}
{"text":"Came to montreal for a quick get away. Walking around we found this restaurant and the menu looked pretty good. Well it was delicious! The wine was fresh and crisp and the food was amazing. My husband started with their soup of the day, broccoli n potato with cheese purée and I had a salad. Both delic! He ordered the duck confit with pasta and I had the chicken! OMG best chicken dish ever! It was basted in Rosemary and maple.. Mouth watering! Duck confit pasta was great it you like duck, very rich! Must try!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a rating higher than I would want, since the food wasn't amazing. Just average, but the prices suggest otherwise. I give this place a 2.5, but I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt here, and disregarding the food. Decor is beautiful. Very clean, very modern. Love the atmosphere, very lively. The service is professional, constantly checking up on you. They are easily capable of continuously pouring water and making people feel comfortable at all tables in the restaurant, which totally goes against a few other reviews. Anyway, we were seated quite quickly. For a regular Monday night, there were quite a few tables, but it was nowhere close to full. The menu consists of French favorites with many twists, along with multiple dishes with American influences. No appetizers to start, since we weren't very hungry and my entree came with a side salad. We had ordered the flank steak with frites and salad, a full rack of ribs, and a haddock sandwich. The haddock was cooked well, didn't break apart and had good taste. Quite a large sandwich. The flank steak was undercooked when I requested it to be medium. It was more like a rare or medium rare, which wasn't what I wanted. It was completely dark pink on the inside. I'm no steak expert and I know that flank steak is supposed to be a rarer steak, but to serve that is unacceptable. Plus, it had no taste. I thought it would be rude to add a heaping load of salt, because that would cause attention and lots of fuss. The frites were quite nice. The salad had a nice vinaigrette on it and was fresh and quite nice with the meal. The ribs, despite the fact they were cold, were actually really good. We had to send them back once, but the waitress and the kitchen handled the situation professionally and quickly. Really delicious ribs! Despite the few problems, the meal was actually quite pleasant. Pricing isn't completely reasonable, but it is a pretty decent restaurant, and they need the income to compete with other nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our visit. Both the haddock sandwich and especially the veggie burger (with portobello mushroom and Brie) were delightful. French fries were crisp and tasty. Nice ambience and friendly service. Management cares. Fair value. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went here after encountering a huge lineup at gourmand.  Decent food, I'd happily eat it again.  The service is slow and lacking though."}
{"text":"Stayed at a hotel nearby and stumbled upon this restaurant.  My meal was absolutely delicious. Started off with a vegetable purée soup that was bursting with flavor. The lamb entree with some type of fruit salsa and yam purée was perfect.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, actually I am pretty sure our waiter got canned during the time we were there. Forgot to bring drinks, coffee, have to ask for everything. No offer to give us any compensation. Not going back... Would not recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Canadian comfort food, then this is your place. Was looking for a modestly priced place for dinner that wasn't too scene-y. They have things like mac-and-cheese with bacon (note Canadian bacon, not American style), steak, burgers and more. The mashed potatoes I had with my steak were just okay, not creamy and buttery enough. But my chocolate ice cream for dessert was tasty. Please also note that families like to come here, so if you're not in the mood for kids, you may want to come here on the later side. It's a solid place, but not mindblowing."}
{"text":"Not sure why this currently has only 3.5 stars. My wife, daughter, and I ate here for lunch and it was wonderful all around. Great fresh food and excellent service. We had poutine and the large breakfast with a latte and a beer. We were impressed by everything on our plates! Plus, the atmosphere was to our taste: clean and chic but cozy"}
{"text":"For an American who has no idea what Canadian cuisine is (do Canadians really know what Canadian cuisine is?), Vallier did a nice job explaining it to me. Apparently, it consists of similar things as American comfort food (your meatloaf, your mac and cheese, etc), but with a northern twist.  For example, I had the meatloaf (or pain viande, if you must), but it was made of game. It was like eating a really big, juicy hamburger patty that happened to be spiced and had delicious pieces of bacon peppered within. Oh yes, and it was topped with a sliver of foie gras. Not exactly for the faint of artery or the humane. The side of vegetables was perfectly roasted. The carrots were so carrot-y! The asparagus asparagus-y! The tomatoes were sundried, yet somehow incredibly tender!  For dessert, my server Pascal (what a wonderful French name!) recommended the maple pudding, but fearing it might be Canadian overkill, I chose the crème brûlée. It was not maple-flavored, but coffee-infused, and was topped with some round yellow thing that I thought was a tomato but wasn't a tomato at all. The mind boggles.  Anyway, for an out-of-towner, Vallier was a great choice because the food seemed pretty authentic (rather than cheesily catering to poutine-craving tourists), and the price wasn't bad. Attentive service, too. The wine list could be a little more comprehensive (or more carefully selected) for the type of gastronomic experience the place strives to be; nevertheless, a fantastic find!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I had my bachelorette there (the dinner part at least) and it was lovely. Perfect for all size groups.   I had the burger with goat cheese on it  and it was DELICIOUS!  Will definitely go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find! I came here for an after-dinner dessert and tea/coffee. It was a random find since few dessert places were open that evening. It had outdoor seating on the sidewalk with a nice view of the buildings in Vieux Montreal without too much traffic.  It has a local French vibe as most of the patrons are friendly francophones. The pudding chomeur was to die for...so memorable for it's plush little cake with melted maple syrup jelly on top and sitting in light maple creme. I shared it and devoured it within minutes.  I also had a loose leaf green tea which was a bit too light for me but the presentation was nice. The Lavazza-brand Italian latte came with a delicious piece of maple fudge.  Next time, I'll have to try a meal if the high quality of the dessert is comparable."}
{"text":"Vallier wasn't our first or second choice for dinner. Garde-Manger appears to be super popular and their voicemail says to leave your name & number and if they have any reservations available, they'll call you. No call back. We huffed it over to Boris Bistro only to find it closed until the new year. We couldn't take being outside any longer (Montreal in December) and walked a few doors down to Vallier.   The atmosphere was jovial and we started with some good, local microbrews. The food is bar food but with some of it on the more upscale side. The waitress admitted she had forgotten to put our order in and gave us a free calamari appetizer. This was great for me but not so much for my non-seafood eating husband. The calamari was just okay with the breading not as crispy as it could have been. When our entrees came out, the burger for my husband and a special with white fish for me, the burger was definitely the better choice.   Overall, Vallier is an okay place that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Second time in quite sometime. My previous experience was much better.  Food was greasier  and saltier, almost diner like. The place as a new ambiance and the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Writing this review as I am sitting in the restaurant itself. Extremely overpriced. Two plates and a coffee for 50$??   Terrible service and absolutely mediocre food. I made one simple request and that is for my eggs to be well done. Low and behold they were extremely yolky. Took another 15 minutes for them to remake it.   Servers kept avoiding eye contact everytime I tried to hail one over to our table. Our waitress who initially took our order seemed to clock out and sit at the bar and order herself a burger and beverage. Fantastic work ethic.  No tip and certainly wont be visiting/recommending this place again."}
{"text":"What a great lunch place - food was so tasty but not over seasoned. This is my second time back in 3 days so it really was a hit with me. They serve fudge with their coffees which is such a cute touch. Well worth getting a window seat when possible to watch the very fashionable people of Montreal go by.   Had the chicken burger with avocado, salad and fries. Looking forward to future visits!!"}
{"text":"Visited on May 26, 2014 @ 6pm:  Contrary to the other reviews here that praise the service, my boyfriend and I's experience was vastly different. The waiter was rude and condescending. On our way out, the waiter physically stood in my boyfriend's way to prevent him from leaving and voiced that \"services charges weren't included in the bill\". The man said this not once, but TWICE! My boyfriend was speechless, so he simply pointed to the bill on the table which already included a tip and continued to exit. Unbelievable.   I had the Vegetarian Burger and my boyfriend had the Chorizo. The food was tasty, but nothing exceptional. Better quality in terms of food, prices and especially service, could easily be found at other places in Old Port. Hopefully this place will hire more respectful staff soon.   One thing is certain though: we will NEVER dine here again. Not only that, we will be sure to inform our friends and family of our negative experience."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the dinner/ lunch menu, but the brunch at Vallier was delicious. Not a huge selection, but they were spot on with everything we ordered. I had the Little Miss Sunshine breakfast parfait and my boyfriend had the classic brunch, with eggs, bacon, breakfast potatoes and pancakes. Everything was great including the latte. They also have mimosas and bloody ceasers available with brunch. 4/5 stars because service was very slow - other than that great brunch experience. Would definitely return next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Chouette restaurant! Grand espace au point de ne pas être tous aglutinés les uns avec les autres.   L'ambiance est propice à l'accueil avec lumière tamisée quand vient le soir.   Le service était irréprochable (nous sommes tombés sur un serveur très appréciable). On ne se sent pas pressés, le sourire (non pas forcé) se lit sur le visage des employés. Est-ce le reflet global du service dans ce restaurant? Je vous le direz lorsque j'y retournerais une deuxième fois ;)  Sans grande surprise, nous avons goutté la sangria maison. Je vous avouerais qu'il y a eu meilleur, mais ce fut tout de même exquis..."}
{"text":"Came here after a stroll in Vieux Montreal and was pleasantly surprised. It's a casual place but it has a great ambiance and servers were all very friendly.  I had the flank steak with eggs sunny side up and my wife ordered the AAA beef burger, as we were both famished. Portions are quite generous and I was really happy with how the flank steak turned out.  We finished it off with a couple of Americanos, which was served with a cube of maple sugar...a lovely touch to end the meal.  Even my kid was happy with the place =)"}
{"text":"Was stunned when on my last visit they had removed the Salad Nicoise from the menu. This also removes my #1 reason for eating at Vallier!"}
{"text":"Service ok. Ambiance ok. Location good. But food is blew average. My salmon was almost white coloured and the eggs were cold and the cheese omelette my friend ordered had barely any cheese at all."}
{"text":"We waited at our table for 15 min and no one came over even to ask us if we wanted water. It looks like the other tables were waiting for the waiter as well. No one in sight. We left."}
{"text":"This was a last minute choice . We got so lucky to be here in this amazing restaurant . Food was heavenly. The best part of our meal was the bread pudding . I almost forgot my name service just simply superb. Paired everything with good red - I'm in heaven"}
{"text":"A standard bistro pub. Quite loud, frenetic atmosphere. Nice menu with good selection as well as daily specials. The chicken breast with maple glaze was delicious and beautifully presented with roasted seasonal vegetables-highly recommended. The pulled pork was OK, maybe not a good choice for a BBQ loving Yank. The burger was good, nicely presented with salad and hand cut style skinny fries. The Sangria  Blanche is refreshing and tasty. The service was attentive, friendly and competent. If possible, call ahead and secure a sidewalk table on a lovely night-tres bon!"}
{"text":"I came here in the beginning of January, wandering the empty evening streets of Montreal when most restaurants shut down after the holiday busyness. Vallier was quite alluring given that it was the only lit up venue in the area - you can imagine how warming the sight of the glow in the crisp cold air would be.  The menu isn't huge and there weren't too many adventurous items, so my choices were basically made for me - bone marrow appetizer and braised lamb shoulder stew for my main. They were good enough although the bone marrow had an odd smell to it and I'm not sure if I was even eating it right (probably one of those things where there's not a right way to eat it).  I was actually surprised that the waiter didn't check up very often and did not try to offer me a dessert. I had to basically beg for a coffee after the meal before I got my check.   I probably wouldn't be back given all the choices in Montreal that offer more unique French-Canadian cuisine with better service, especially since Holder is just next door."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was tasty nothing to write home about but good. Great service and atmosphere. Wine selection needs more selection for my glasses. Otherwise if passing okay to stop by but no need to make special trip."}
{"text":"Oh happy day I get to be the first to review this fabulous eatery.  I can't quite figure Vallier out. It's in Old Montreal which you would think would draw tourists but I haven't seen too many every time I've been there. The space has high ceilings, big windows, cozy tables or a diner style counter to enjoy some of the best food in Montreal at. I love a good counter. The menu is just big enough for variety but small enough to be executed perfectly every time. Gourmet burgers, meat loaf with fois gras (seriously?), mac n' cheese with sharp cheddar, duck shepard's pie, roast beef and the list goes on. The duck salad (with beets, warm potato, greens and raspberry vinaigrette) is quite possibly my favorite meal in Montreal (so far).  Staff is friendly and really knowledgeable about the menu. The last time I was there the bartender (an adorable, bilingual little guy) described so many items from the menu that I had to take a deep breath and not order one of everything. Regular rotation of wines by the glass on the chalkboard near the kitchen.  Oh and the kitchen - small and proudly displayed at the end of the bar - it appears to be a well oiled machine that churns out beautiful food to every plate.  Great for a date, after work, closed on Sundays so don't fight your way through the snow only to be heart broken. Bring the foodie in your life here and watch them fall in love."}
{"text":"Just stopped off for a glass of wine. Good wine list. Lovely lady behind the bar was pleasant & helpful to this tourist.   Like she said...\"glass of Bordeaux, how can you go wrong?\"  Indeed!"}
{"text":"Meh.  My friend had to return his burger twice because it was completely and utterly dry. I took a bite and could hardly swallow it, myself. The waiter was accommodating and kind enough to not include it on the bill, he explained that their beef must be cooked well-done, but that still does not justify it being as dry as it was -- two times in a row. He was completely understanding, and helped my friend out right away.  I ordered the warm goat cheese salad, it was good with a fat slab of goat cheese on top and drizzled in a vinaigrette. I could make the same thing at home, for much less."}
{"text":"J'en étais maintenant à ma troisième visite chez Vallier et mon opinion reste la même quoi que... Premièrement l'endroit. Super belle ambiance, pas trop bruyant, il est facile d'y venir en groupe ou en tête à tête.  Deuxièment la nourriture. Il existe bien bien pire à Montréal que ce qui est proposé chez Vallier et peut être que je n'ai pas choisi encore les plats qui me conviendrais le mieux mais personnellement, je trouve qu'au niveau qualité/prix, il manque quelque chose. Je m'explique... Le potage de céléri-rave est tout a fait correcte mais il manque un peu de goût, d'assaisonnement. Même chose pour le burger. À 20$, on s'attend soit à un peu plus, soit à des ingrédients un peu plus recherché. Quand au dessert, le gâteau au fromage est bien, mais encore une fois ne se démarque pas des autres endroits.  Cependant, mon invitée, elle était comblée. Que ce soit son entrée de Mac&Cheese ou ses raviolis avec Canard, elle a tout mangée (ou presque, les portions étant généreuses) Même son pudding chômeur battait mon cheesecake.  Mais bon, avec une facture de $175 (incluant 1 bouteille de vin et pourboire), on s'attend à un peu plus.  Je n'ai aucun problème avec ce genre de facture, mais j'ai besoin d'avoir un effet wow!  Finalement, et c'est ce qui sauve l'expérience et qui me déchire quant à l'attribution du nombre d'étoile, c'est le service.  Impeccable, extraordinaire, du début à la fin. Le serveur et les serveuses ont fait pour moi la différence. Que ce soit dans l'accueil, dans le service et dans toutes les attentions lors du repas, ils ont été bien au delà de ce que l'on peut s'attendre d'un bon service. L'une d'elle s'est même rendu compte que nous avions de la difficulté avec le vin et nous as proposé de le changer avant même que nous le demandions.  Donc voilà, quelle note donne-t-on??? Si c'était pour la nourriture, je donnerais un 2. Pour le service, un 5.  À mon humble avis, je crois qu'une révision du menu pourrais changer drastiquement l'évaluation que j'en fais. Avec un service pareil, et une table qui s'éleverait un peu, Vallier deviendrais un des grands j'en suis sûre. Surtout qu'il est situé dans un quartier vraiment agréable."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Vallier is very well priced for the quality of the food and the service and was just a few blocks away from my hotel without being too tourist-y.  Before visiting, I was picturing a true diner-type atmosphere but was pleasantly surprised at  the chic interior - a little retro in keeping with the theme, but very sleek and elegant with tall windows and warm fixtures.  The menu has been very thoughtfully compiled and though it is relatively small, there is something for everyone - fantastic comfort food like steak tartare, duck shepherd's pie, macaroni and cheese with bacon - I had a difficult time choosing, but our server was very helpful in pointing us toward his favorite items and he was absolutely right!  I had scallops over parsnips and fennel with bacon and maple topped with asparagus - they were cooked just perfectly; I couldn't have asked for anything better.  I also tried the wild game meatloaf with porto foie gras... wow.  I'm also a fan of the fries with homemade mayo - OK, mostly the homemade mayo!  Along with a nice wine list, there are several good microbrews available and though I didn't make it all the way to dessert, there were some delicious offerings - I was very tempted by the chocolate maple pie (among several other things).  Vallier was really an excellent experience, and a much better value than many other restaurants in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Only thing thats good about this place is their coffee, music and ketchup. Skip the food at all costs!"}
{"text":"Great bang for the buck. Service was great along with her recommendations. The duck Shepard pie is excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite last Monday and loved everything about it. Off the beaten path so a spot for regulars instead of the tourist eateries around the corner. highly recommend Vallier Bistro."}
{"text":"only went here for Grand Prix last weekend because nothing was open. had a really expensive $20 hamburger here that was small and had a really strange tasting mac and cheese appetizer - I think they put tomatoes on it. will never go back here again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but can get noisy when it's packed.  Great go to place for lunch or drinks downtown.  The bar has a good selection of wine by the glass.  Decadent macaroni and cheese, good burgers and caesar salads."}
{"text":"Passed through here on a Tuesday evening on the second-to-last day of the year.  We had just had a 6-hour drive up from New York and maybe we were tired, hungry, and cold, but this place hit the spot.  We got the corner table next to the windows on the far right as you enter the place.  They have hooks on virtually every post, which is something I wish more restaurants offered.  I can't speak to the whole menu, but the appetizers (chorizo and some kind of pork croquette) were both very good, especially the croquete.  My steak and frites were very tasty.  A reviewer below mentioned how the steak was ordered medium and it was closer to medium-rare.  I'll agree with that part, but it was definitely not tasteless.  It came with a plum(?) sauce and was spiced fine.  In any event, it was fresh and I really enjoyed it.  The rest of my table each enjoyed their meals -- silence and clean plates is usually a good indication.  Maybe there's a higher standard in Quebec for good food as I find it is more available up there than the prices we have to pay here in New York for the same quality, but I am surprised at the negative reviews below nonetheless.  Old Montreal is my favorite part of the area and I'm sure there are plenty of good places to eat, but this is definitely one of them."}
{"text":"I would give it 2 1/2 really on food quality.  It's Montreal  I want tasty French food my friend checked tripadvisor instead of taking the concierge recommendations or checking YELP?!.  Boo!! Hiss! terrible! the waitress was ok nice, my pinot was smoking loon eh (what $10 bottle retail right)... This is just to give you an idea of what people here think is good.  I had the calamari eh... and a chicken salad I hadn't eaten all day and its 8pm I'm angry hungry and this was barely edible.  The bread is sustaining my spoiled butt until I find something better tomorrow!!!  I didn't like my chicken salad because it seemed confused.  it was a guacamole salsa cold chicken breast salad with grapefruit.  I imagined a citrus dressing with the grapefruit but I think it was literally mayonaise?! not sure what you call mayo in French but I say NON!NON! no good. Go elsewere Montreal is known for restaurants right... Bonne chance!"}
{"text":"I went there about 5 years ago and I remember it being delicious, so I went back recently. The food was sub-par. The service average. I will not go back."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since my last visit to Montreal, and my visit to Vallier. My husband and I were staying in the area again and decided to try it again. This time, we decided to avoid the burgers. I had the duck confit shepherd's pie, which was quite good -- served in a little cast iron skillet, it comes fresh out of the oven. The duck was a little bit dry, but on the whole the dish was really good. My husband's strip loin was also quite good: well-marinated in lime and smoky spices. The restaurant was also happy to sub the potatoes for extra salad since he's keeping on the Paleo diet these days; the salad was nice and lightly dressed.   Service was pretty good. I still find the prices to be quite high for the quality of food -- there are other restaurants in the area that are better in the price range -- but for casual comfort food, Vallier does the trick pretty well."}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice with music not too loud. Staff was friendly, though my waiter seemed to be a bit moody. I ordered the warm goat cheese salad with a citrus dressing.  It was good but instead of the apples ( which I was looking forward to) they adde carrots instead, which they didn't mention. Still the warm goat cheese was Delish in the salad and dressing was tasty. Had the muscadet by the glass and it was good."}
{"text":"I've been to Vallier a couple of times, both for brunch and dinner. I went for dinner last week and had grilled chicken with a maple reduction, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. The food is always consistently good, but not anything spectacular.   The prices are a little steep for what you're getting but that's pretty common in Old Town. It's a good place to go if the line is too long at Le Cartet, otherwise I would try somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's a restaurant located between old port and Montréal financial district. Therefore, the clientele is mainly from the offices nearby, during lunch hours. I was there around 13h with a colleague of mine. We ordered a bacon & guinness cheddar cheeseburger sriracha fried onions & horseradish aioli, and a beef tartare, that was average. The burger wasn't jucy, the meat was overcooked; I wouldn't recommend it at all!  Service was practically inexistant, the waitress was absent. On a final note, the décoration is nice, a mixture of leather and wood."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo slow .. waited over an hour for eggs and never was asked to refill my coffee in that entire time! Food is ok.. nothing worth the wait or the poor service.. a definite NO!"}
{"text":"Nice place in perfect cartier of Montreal. I liked the cappuccino and atmosphere. Very friendly personnel with jazz music playing all the time."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience. The service is good. Very nice place to have drinks. The only weak point is that the menu is relatively standard and not as tasty as it could be.  I recommend for drinks after work but not for a dedicated dinner plan."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   The Duck Shepherds Pie --- omg. Still thinking about how good and comforting this dish was. Would come back solely for this. However, parts of it were not even warm, while more to the bottom of the dish was piping hot. I can't be sure, but to me, it felt like it was re-heated poorly. Still though, it was delicious.   Service was good, seemed like we had two waiters which was somewhat confusing; but we just got double the love.   Strawberry Sangria was refreshing, but different.   Creme brûlée - very good Apple crumble- too sweet, wouldn't order again   I would come back here to try more of their menu and cocktails."}
{"text":"I and my bf came here for our first dinner in Montreal ealier this month.  My first impression when I looked at the menu was that everything was over-priced.  The dishes that I wanted to order were well over my comfort zone as far as price.  We ended up ordering the creamy vegetable and lager soup with cheddar cheese gratin and the braised lamb sheppard's pie with sweet potatoe puree, mushrooms, corn and peppers.    Unfortunately, the soup was a real disappointment. especially at $9CA.  After 4 spoonfuls, I couldn't continue, as it was much too rich and more like a sauce than a soup.  And where were the vegetables?  I had a few small cube-shaped orange things which I am guessing were carrots, but that was it.  However, the sheppard's pie was redeeming and had great flavor and texture.  If i ever visit again i may come again for the sheppard's pie and nothing else."}
{"text":"We stumbled past this place while walking around in Montreal. Actually it was the only place open on that block. That didn't stop us from having an awesome breakfast. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with salmon and hubs had the 3 egg ham omelette. I deducted one star because there was a piece of hair my plate. The waitstaff and manager were supercool and replaced my food and apologized profusely. I'm going again because I wasn't hungry again until 4 hours."}
{"text":"I visited Vallier for brunch mid-April and all I can think to say is disappointing and disorganized. I was expecting better since I've enjoyed my late dining experiences prior to trying it out for brunch. Everything went WRONG on that lovely Sunday morning. You know, the first sunny and not so cold day of the year, the type that makes you want to go outside and walk for hours while you fill up on vitamin D. Well, I spent that day waiting, waiting...and waiting some more for what would probably be the most expensive and bland brunch of my short existence!   We got there (4 people) and thought: awesome so tables are empty no wait! Boy were we naive and wrong! The hostess said it wouldn't be long, she was clearly busy and shuffling around the restaurant, fine. It went downhill quick from there! She started avoiding eye contact with us as we and people behind us were getting exasperated as half of the restaurant was EMPTY!!!! After 10 minutes, she comes back and apologizes, her kitchen can't take any more orders. She suggests we wait before being seated and waited. We had to literally bargain to at least get seated while we wait. We should have just left then but we were hungry and had paid expensive parking so we stayed.   We ordered coffee while we wait. We were nicely seated and having a lovely chat so we thought we wouldn't mind waiting and sipping on coffee. Wrong, again! Coffee took 15 minutes to get there and it took us another 5 minutes to flag the waitress down to order. She had to go back to the kitchen and verify if they were capable of taking our order, remember the restaurant is still HALF EMPTY!  We are good to go, finally. We all ordered the same thing, the meat lover.  The food was okay, nothing great. The toasts were tiny and bland. A few potatoes and fruits, nothing special!  The bacon was revolting! A very think (like 1\" think by 1 1/2\" wide)greasy slice. The meat part was good but we all literally had to remove the fat since it was inedible. I guess they were going for that old fashioned style but failed.   Last but not least...the bill. I had the meat lover (basically 2 eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, ham, the regular plate) and a bowl of cafe au lait. With taxes and no tip, I was already forking over $30.   Never again, not even for that late night. I don't know if they were understaffed or simply disorganized. If they were understaffed, a little warning and explanation when we were in line wild have gone a long way. At least it decreases your expectations and shows some respect for the customers!"}
{"text":"It was decent.  I would agree this is maybe a 2.5.  There are certainly better places for the area and the price.  We were just tired of walking and hungry so this suited our needs.  The service was okay and the food was decent.  If you have mac n' cheese on the menu it should be phenomenal. . . and it wasn't.  The halibut BLT was much better, but still not enough flavor to be wedged between two pieces of bread.  However, the space is very open and inviting with tall windows and a good view of the street.  I could see myself going back for drinks and appetizers but I would not choose to sit down during my next visit."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and overall the food was good... I would have given this restaurant 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that my last time there (we brought a fairly large group), everyone got sick!  the Mac & Cheese, Foie Gras, Beef tartar, and Shepherds pie were all standout dishes.  unfortunately, the whole food poisoning thing keeps me from recommending this place..."}
{"text":"VALLIER  Terroire cuisine with a comfort food approach? Does that make sense? Well that was my experience anyway. The restaurant is modern but not overly chi-chi to be hip and it's welcoming with all the warm wood, the art and its general warmth. The service itself, I was divided. Our server was being nice but it felt so forced and somewhat pretentious, however all our other servers who visited our table were very nice so I'll chalk it up to that guy. There's also the issue of the chairs. Lots of different chairs of different heights and I had to move some around in order to have a chair low enough to no longer having the table leaning on my legs.  We started out with a cheese platter. It was for one, but we had more starters in mind as well. There was a firm and soft cheese as well as a blue cheese. Some nutty breads and a delicious fig jelly. All very delicious however we would have appreciated an explanation of what cheeses we were being presented with but no such luck.  Our secondary starter was the foie gras served with apple liquor infused mousse. Really delicious. However I found myself salting the foie gras, was a step forgotten? And it was sitting on a mini-baguette that was so hard it was not permitting me to cut into the delicate foie gras. I had to remove it from the equation. I suppose pain perdu or a buttery pastry like a croissant is out of the question? Unseasoned foie gras and tough chewy baguette was unfortunate. But the mousse was its savior and its foie gras... unless you torch it, you can barely mess it up.  I had the meatloaf made of venison and duck if I remember correctly. It was unremarkable but it wasn't bad either. Maybe I'm just not a big meatloaf fan but I followed the waiter's suggestion. I forgot that when a waiter pushes dishes it's because they need to move the product fast. I should have gone with my initial choice which my friend took, a delicious... I mean insanely delicious pulled lamb shoulder topped with a sweet potato purée with homemade cream corn, that's what I was looking for.  Cheesecake, again? Now as a foodie and I use that term loosely, I run through restaurants like Charlie Sheen goes through kilos of cocaine. If there's one thing that have become so ubiquitous that they have lost their relevance its cheesecake (and Crème Brulée). Every frakkin' restaurant has them on their menus, much like Cesar salad in the 90s - if you serve it I won't come - and Tortellini Cardinale in the 80s - now relegated to cafeteria food. I'm seriously fed up with them and are usually manufactured and not made on the premises. But the menu at Vallier calls it the best cheese cake in Montreal and all I could think was \"Challenge Accepted\". I am defeated. It was by far the absolute best Cheese Cake I've had in years and years. Smooth, creamy cake seemingly collapsing under its own weight, covered with cream and salted caramel, it was the best Cheese Cake experience of my life, any more pleasurable and the cake and I were getting a room.  In short, its great place to get a very good meal. There are a few faux-pas; such as a full bar not being able to make the original drink, the Tom Collins. The funky chair assortment. And a pretentious waiter. But all those things are overshadowed by really good grub with really good presentation in a warm welcoming setting in the heart of the gorgeous Old Montreal - truly my city is the greatest city. Please go for it."}
{"text":"This place was decribed by our concierge at the W Montreal as Quebecois comfort food.  It exceeded all my expectations.  The macaroni and cheese was delicious and complex.  The gazpacho, satay marinated shrimp, rosemary cressini & roquette salad was so good, I almost wished it was meal sized.    They also have local cider (cidre) available, and there was one called Perle which I liked better than most I have tried in Canada.  You don't find many tourists in Vallier, which is a nice change from the area it's in, and you can't go wrong with anything you pick out from the menu."}
{"text":"Mmm. This has been our favorite meal in Montreal so far. Great atmosphere and really enjoyable food.  Wine list was a little pricey for us, but not so much that it stopped us from getting a bottle.   My martini was made perfectly dirty and my chicken and vegetables was delicious and just the right portion size. Fries were so so so good here and the homemade mayo was excellent on them.   Our waitress was super kind and encouraging about my crappy French. I was just as encouraging about her broken English. When i clumsily spilled my espresso, they kindly brought me another one without question. No hassle there.  Canada uses the at table credit card machines. Love that. I wish the US would catch on.   Anyway, lovely night. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with workmates, and had a great fish + BLT sandwich. It was only $17 (and came with a big salad and some fries). Gets busy during the lunch rush, but we got a table pretty quickly still  I haven't tried it for dinner - I'd be worried it would be over-priced for what it is (it just has that feel to it), but I would go back for lunch again."}
{"text":"My review is almost exactly the same as Avitania B.'s review on 2/19/10.  I think we may have eaten the exact same night, we were there on the 19th as well around 9:00pm.  We ordered the EXACT same items.  My girlfriend had the Mac & Cheese with Bacon and I ordered the Cheese Burger and salad with wax paper wrapped french fries in a soup can.  Tasty, but as Avitania B. wrote, it was not worth raving about.  I gave it a solid good.  As we arrived in Montreal late - driving in from Quebec City.  We asked our hotel concierge [W Hotel] what they recommended in the area that was open late and affordable - a Montreal feel - which we specifically wanted cheap.  I expected a downtown location would not have cheap/dive type, so above cheap is what I expected.  But, $17 Mac & Cheese was a bit over priced.  The Mac & Cheese could have had something to go with it at least at that price.  Our food was better than average and it was a little better than we expected at 9pm.  We did not leave loving it or hating it.  We were just happy."}
{"text":"Arrivée tardive pour le brunch vers 14h ils ne leur restaient presque plus rien du menu plus de jambon, plus de saumon fumé bref chaque plat que je voulais prendre n'était pas disponible je me suis tournée vers le burger et mon amie à concocter quelque chose avec croissant et oeuf. Service correct mais sans plus je ne vois pas ce qui me donnerait envie d'y retourner mis à part la déco sympa"}
{"text":"Nice waiter and good is really good!!!  Would come here regularly if I lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"Le restaurant nous (moi et deux amis) a refusé l'entrée sous prétexte qu'il n'avait plus de place sans reservation (le resto etait à au 3/4 vide). Je les aurais cru mais juste derrière moi, il y avait deux personnes qui sont rentrés au moment où la dame m'a dit qu\"il.n'y avait plus de place. Elles allaient partir mais la dame leur a dit \"ah non attendez y'a de la place\" et me l'a dit aussi avant de comprendre que nous n'etions pas ensemble. Elle s' est ravisé en me disant ah non y' a pas de place pour vous. Apparemment nous ne reflétions pas la clientèle qu'elle voulait. RESTAURANT DISCRIMINATOIRE pour ma part."}
{"text":"Amazing.  We were wandering around the area looking for a place to get a coffee at night and stumbled across this place. Although it's labelled as a Cafe in Yelp, it's definitely a full-on restaurant.  Ample seating inside and a patio that seats about 10 (although it's where all the smokers from inside stand, if that's a big deal to you).  The latte about on par with all the other latte's i had in Montreal, but the dessert was incredible.  We ordered the pudding chomeur to nibble on and ended up devouring it in minutes. It was the best dessert of the weekend.  Definitely going to be coming back to this place next time i'm in Montreal to see if the entrees are just as good. Price was very reasonable too at $8 for the pudding.  Service was also excellent and didn't mind at all that we only were ordering dessert/coffee and not a full meal.  He even helped us pick it and wasn't shocked to find out we had thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Le Vallier, un de mes endroits de prédilection ; mon spot préféré dans le Vieux, près du centre-ville, pour manger vite (si on le veut) et bien.  J'aime son ambiance ; son staff courtois ; son bon, sa délicieuse et réconfortante ; sa bonne musique !  L'endroit est super autant pour un repas de groupe ou en duo, entre amis, en famille ou même en amoureux.   C'est facile ici ; que ce soit pour un tartare de saumon super frais en plat ou en entrée, un paté chinois revampé, un bon burger juteux, un combo bavette-frites, une assiette de calmars à partager en attendant les plats principaux, une crème brûlée en dessert (ou comme repas !), une pointe de tarte bien sucrée (et j'en passe ; le menu change régulièrement et a donc souvent changé depuis que je le fréquente), c'est bon bon BON [pour le moral] !!  Un seul petit bémol par contre. Si je recommande le Restaurant Vallier pour un lunch ou un souper \"comfort-food\" gourmet mais abordable, le brunch, lui, est, à mon avis, un peu trop \"basic\" et cher pour ce que vous retrouverez dans votre assiette."}
{"text":"Correct. Nous avons essayé ce resto via une offre sur le site vieurbaine. Le Resto est plutôt bruyant, ce qui nous a déplu puisque nous avions un peu de difficulté à nous comprendre. Niveau bouffe: rien à se jeter par terre. En entrée, le chorizo et les calmars frits étaient bons, mais on en a mangé de meilleurs ailleurs. C'était tout de même satisfaisant. En plat principal, mon copain a essayé la bavette de boeuf. Elle était ordinaire et la sauce d'accompagnement n'était pas celle qui était annoncée. Les frites étaient décevantes, mini et dures. De mon côté, j'ai essayé les raviolis au canard effiloché avec pois verts et parmesan dans le jus de viande. Je dois dire que c'était très savoureux, mais la sauce rendait le plat très lourd. De plus, le canard était rempli d'os... Assez ordinaire! À deux, nous ne l'avons pas finie. Finalement, niveau dessert, le gâteau au fromage était correct, mais sans plus. Le pudding chômeur était très bon, il m'a agréablement surpris! Malheureusement trop sucré pour que je me rende jusqu'au bout. En gros, c'est un endroit \"correct\" si on est dans le coin, mais on ne ferait pas de détour."}
{"text":"I like the retro deco and ambiance.  Very tasty Quebec comfort food, like the Pate chinois au canard confit (Sheppard's Pie of duck).  They have a nice beer and wine selection too.  Nice spot."}
{"text":"Vraiment une bonne adresse à Montreal. L'accueil est bon et le repas est très original. N'hésitez pas à demander les olives pour accompagner votre verre, elles sont incroyables avec leur préparation. Le cadre est chaleureux et vraiment de bon goût. I like"}
{"text":"Tried this establishment during my recent visit to Montreal. This place has a good vibe. They have bar area with few seats and rest tables laid out in no specific order. The service was attentive and our server gave us good recommendations. That's where the good part stops.   Food: mediocre. Tried their Veggie burger which was quite dry. Could finish only half of it. My colleague had salmon, which he said was passable.  Beer: Tried some local on tap, didn't really like any."}
{"text":"Was taken here on a business meeting, the service was great and friendly and the food on the menu looked great.  I had the chicken breast meal and it was GOOD! Everything on my plate was cooked perfectly and had the perfect amount of flavour and sauce on it. It was awesome!  My Mom had soup which she seemed to enjoy and my boss really liked the place hence he took us here haha.   Also what I liked was the hot chocolate, it was quite expensive but I wanted it so when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. It was like a BOWL of hot chocolate ! So awesome! Then I tried it, and dang it was good ! It was home made with real melted chocolate not this mixture crap you normally get.   All in all, great place. Maybe a bit pricey, but worth it for a nice dinner/meal."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price!  American food with a french-twist.  I think I had almost everything on the menu and I liked everything. Great burgers(they are not normal burgers no)! YUM YUM  Try it if you are in the area - definitely one of the better places to eat."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a brunch place in the city that is chill on a Sunday and takes reservations. It's a really nice environment with chill music. The food is standard nothing fancy. I would say either the streak and eggs or the salmon eggs bénédictin are the ways to go. Very simple, when it comes to food, but it's a win cause finding a brunch spot on a Sunday is usually a disaster! Keep this in your back pocket."}
{"text":"C'est acceptable, pas plus. La soupe à l'oignon n'était pas bonne... C'est la première fois que je ne suis pas capable de finir une soupe à l'oignon! Le fromage est de mauvaise qualité et le pain est mauvais aussi (très vinaigré). Le tartare de saumon est très bon, simple et frais. Le burger est mauvais. Le pain n'était pas frais et la viande sèche et sans goût. Le pulled pork est bon, mais pas assez pour y retourner. Le service est excellent... Très courtois et poli."}
{"text":"Premier brunch fait lors de mon arrivé à Montréal. Le restaurant est grand et donc peu bruyant. Le service était très agréable et efficace."}
{"text":"Really good service and the food was also very nice! The waiter had no problems with our company's allergies which is always very positive."}
{"text":"Mmm, delicious food.  Friendly service, a beautiful and funky decor.    I liked everything about my meal.  Eggs Benedict were great and the fruit served alongside was fresh!  The potatoes were also a winner.   Great vibe, great food, fun meal.   Our waitress was adorable too. So pretty and kind.  Loved her!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to hear the review below me mention standard pub fare. This place is nothing like that. It is perfectly inspired food cooked in a perfect way. My girlfriend had the vanilla scallops over risotto. Everything was cooked perfectly. While we liked the parts by themselves, the dish was a little non-cohesive. But perfectly executed and displayed. Generous portion as well.  I had a portobello mushroom stuffed ravioli with duck confit. I will say it was the best savory dish I have ever had... in my life. It was perfectly balanced. Some dishes, you want to eat fast because you love it so much... but this dish made you want to eat in smaller bites to savor the taste. The peas, the duck, the cheese, the mushrooms, the sauce... it was all perfect.   We also tried to eat some crême brulé, but we're too stuffed. It was good though.   The atmosphere is great as well, and they do not rush you out. We enjoyed about 3 hours of conversation over this great meal. Cost was about $100 (no alcohol) charcuterie,  2 meals, and 1 dessert."}
{"text":"Déçu un brin de ce resto qui semblait tout à fait intéressant pour un petit lunch business un cran au-dessus de la moyenne. Malheureusement, la cuisine n'a pas été à la hauteur. Le poisson de mon collègue était poèlé et non grillé tel que mentionné par le garçon, mon contre-filet était médium et non pas médium-saignant tel que demandé, les accompagnements étaient ok sans plus... pas un désastre mais pas tel qu'escompté non plus. Et cher!!! $40 ttc pour mon addition avec une bouteille d'eau pétillante, même pas un verre de vin. Parlant de la liste des vins, vraiment pas beaucoup de choix au verre... Décevant donc, considérant les alternatives tout près."}
{"text":"Brunch satisfaisant, belle deco , bon service , choix limité mais efficace, oeufs benedictins tres bons."}
{"text":"So, the mushroom soup du jour was fan-freakin-tastic. It was topped with nuts. Have you ever heard of such a thing? Seriously?  The atmosphere was trendy, but not pretentious. The decor was cool...The crowd was business yuppy-ish when we went in for lunch yesterday.  Let's talk about some other things... I ordered the seared white tuna entree... which was not in fact, seared but rather well done. It was accompanied by toasted sesame seeds, pomegranite seeds, orange and many unidentifiable Canadian veggies...something I was told was similar to spinach and a rhubarb-like item, as well.  Our server was slow and unable to translate some of the items on the menu...but I feel she meant well.  Many items on the table had an antique feel, but not in a good way. The glasses were the same I grew up with in the 80's -- quite ugly actually. The steak knife had a wooden handle and looked as if it quite possibly held bacteria for as long as the glass had been around. The bowl the soup was served in was somewhat french onion-ish -- beige with a brown half.   There were some ACTUAL antiques which were cool... like a type writer by the entrance.   I'd give this place another chance, but considering what I describe above, the prices are a bit over the mark..."}
{"text":"Admittedly our second choice, Vallier ended up being a solid option for a spontaneous dinner for 10 people. They were quickly able to accommodate us around 19:30 on a Sunday night.  The menu was short, but there was something for everyone. The winners at the table were the salmon and burger, though the fries were a bit soggy. A small bite of the poutine was also tasty but a little soggier than I expected.  The gnocchi was ok, a bit more dense than I usually like it. The haloumi was good, but that vegetables that came with it were not cooked enough.  Very nice wait staff!"}
