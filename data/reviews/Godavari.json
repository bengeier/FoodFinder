{"text":"Worst food... Waste of money.. jus spicy raw masala and not cooked well too.... appetizers are horrible.."}
{"text":"Food is certainly delicious!  However, they are very very slow to refill the entrees in the buffet even before 1:00pm!  Plus I feel that a weekly price of $13.99 is too high.  Not sure if I want to go back to the restaurant because I felt that I could not return to the buffet to get more of the food I enjoyed.  I left feeling disappointed.  Sorry Godavari- great food but poor service."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian then it's Better to steer clear of this place especially on friday lunch buffet. If you have younger kids who don't eat and just pick fruit off your plate then don't even look at this place! 
1. The Friday buffet was not that great at all. No pani puri no live chat counter. No appetizer.. no manchurian.. no veggie kebabs...All you get is a small dosa. Nothing was worth going for seconds. And they charge you $28 in the name of \"Friday buffet for two people\" ridiculous 
2. My kid is 4 and he did not eat anything.. and without even asking us the man at the register had the audacity to charge us 8$ for kids Friday buffet lunch!!! 
I have been to numerous Indian buffets all over the country.. never have I ever been charged like this for a kids buffet! 
You can easily give this place a miss. There are many other places worth going."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet has a good variety! Biryanis are really good as well as the live dosa counter. 

From the a la carts menu everything is really good! The biryani, starters, chicken lollipops, any of the non-veg curries, Hakka noodles and many many more! 

I would highly recommend this place as the food is authentic and delicious!! Also, the owner and staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The buffet was not good at all.  The food was really bland.  Hardly any good vegetarian dishes.
I wish they had a better choice of menu  for the buffet.
secondly the seating was too crowded. 
Playing old music on tv from the 60s wasn't very welcoming. waiters  were attentive."}
{"text":"I've been to MANY Indian restaurants across the country and this one is BY FAR, THE BEST INDIAN PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN AT. Went for dinner and every single thing I ordered was INSANELY GOOD! Can't wait to try their lunch buffet"}
{"text":"I had lch today. Only 3 vegeterian dish and mushy. Paneer hard with more sauce. And cold. Rice too spicy. Naan stiff. Dhosa crispy paper thin like paper. Bhajis oily and dough half cooked. Desert questionable as it tasted two days old. I do not eat meat. And worst Sambhar so thick looked like big pieces of carrot in it. I have eaten south Indianfood but it felt like I was in south india eating out on a stall. Never go back."}
{"text":"First time we ate at this Indian restaurant and it was great!  Chicken Tikki Masala was fabulous and  creamy with just the right sweetness and spice with curry! Butter chicken was a 5 star too!  Garlic Naan and samosas both great!"}
{"text":"Worst ever Indian restaurant. No taste, horrible service...Briyani served was reheated one for sure..super spice and no taste...would never go back and never recommend..."}
{"text":"When we first walked in we weren't sure if we were supposed to go into the bar area or stay in the reception area to be seated. Stood there for a few minutes before proceeding into the bar. Once the hostess realized we were looking to dine in we were promptly shown to a table. We started with the samosas for an appetizer. It didn't take long for them to come to the table but we did have to flag the waiter down and request the chutney and Tamron sauce to go with it.  For entr√©e we had the palak paneer, butter chicken, dahl, and garlic nan to go with it.  The food was outstanding great spice and very flavorful. Since it's a new restaurant I will cut them some slack for the service which was very lacking. Can't wait to give them another try."}
{"text":"Starters option was less. We got choices of Mysore bonda and aloo bonda. sambhar and rasam were available as expected with rice and potato fry combination . I am surprised they had dhum biriyani and veg noodles. Masala chai was good."}
{"text":"Best south indian restaurant in the valley. Great place and awesome food. The staff was very friendly and gave us lot of recommendations"}
{"text":"Being Indian food lovers and seeing this new restaurant in our area, my husband and I went here recently and tried a masala dosa. The flavor was good, but the dosa was so crispy that it fell apart/crumbled like a cracker when we tried to rip a piece off (usually it should hold together and be a little chewy) and there was only a small amount of masala potatoes inside. We really enjoyed the tomato chutney that came with the dosa. The dal soup was good, but really spicy! We did not try anything else on the menu. Overall, we thought the food was ok and service mediocre, but will likely not go back."}
{"text":"This is not a place you go for good service or high end dining.  But it is truly authentic southern Indian food. It was very good! Like home made!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when this place opened up around the corner from my house. My neighbor and I tried it for dinner when they were only open a couple days. It was delicious! The staff were friendly and attentive, too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The owner has put in a lot of thought to the menu, decor and ambience. The food was great, better than all the Indian restaurants in the valley, I haven't tasted the dinner menu yet and I'm looking forward to it...The trick is in the consistency and I hope it is maintained. If I can give a feedback, it will be to add more vegetarian options..."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Moved here from central jersey and looking for favorites...and found it here!! Delicious cauliflower appetizer--with a yogurt sauce.  Goat entree and Chicken tikka Marsala both delicious.  Came Home with extra nan to enjoy our leftovers.  I'll be back!  Thank you."}
{"text":"We were here on a weekday for lunch buffet. It was around 1pm. All the trays at the buffet table were empty. I had to call the waiter so many times to refill the trays and the waiter only refilled the trays you asked. He did not fill all the other trays which were empty. Every dish was very salty. And coming to the service, it was worst. While we were eating the waitress comes with your check. They did not even let me finish my food and they come again and again at your table to ask if they can take the check... disgusting.. they need to train their staff some discipline. They need to improve the quality of food and service. If you have not had food here, believe me, you are not missing out on anything."}
{"text":"Best place in Phoenix for India food especially South Indian. Great place, Good Ambience, Tasty Food and on top the best customer service."}
{"text":"Big restaurant with a buffet containing a good variety of Indian dishes. Unfortunately several of them weren't hot, which was concerning. The health inspection sign on the front wall had a score of 90... not good! When I got home, I checked the previous scores and this place had scores of 72 and 75 in 2017!?! 
Finally, the previous restaurant in this location had an open kitchen with wrap around windows. Godavari has draped up black fabric along the inside of the entire length of the window, completely blocking any view of the kitchen. It looks so odd, it makes you think they must be hiding something to go to that ugly extreme.  There are at least a half dozen better Indian restaurants between U-city and Concord Mills. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Tried this place few times (dinner and lunch buffet). With so many Indian restaurants sprouting up in this area, i am surprised that they feel no need to provide quality food and service. This one is the worst. Their dum biryani is the most sub-standard biryani. Other items i have tried here are no better

Another restaurant to cross out."}
{"text":"I ordered here today for the delivery. They forgot to send me the coke and. When I called them the guy he was so rude and told me to pickup the coke. It does make sense I ordered for delivery and I payed for it and the guy wants me to pickup the coke.highly disappointed"}
{"text":"Best Authentic Indian food I've had! It's a great little hole in the wall restaurant! It was a very clean and the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing food... amazing service... great prices... great experience. This restaurant serves one of the most authentic cuisines in all of Arizona."}
{"text":"Food is horrible.  They served the food prepared for lunch in dinner.  The staff are very disrespectful and money minded.  I will never visit them again..."}
{"text":"Best south indian food I had in the recent times. I was on a 4 day trip to Phoenix and guess what! I ended up eating at Godavari almost everyday! Lunch buffet was amazing. Ravva Dosa with onions green chillies and cashews was an ultimate feast to my palate. Don't miss if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up food few days back. Extreme experiences. Pick up was smooth and had to wait for few minutes. Kurnool chicken gravy was top notch, and spicy as expected. Gongura chicken gravy was above average and could be better. Complementary rice quantity and quality could improve. The worst was the chicken tandoori. It is not easy to cook good tandoori and so we generally avoid it at most places; however, considering it was an andhra based indian restaurant, we took chance and failed again. I will give few more chances to the place to have few favourites and reorder them in future."}
{"text":"Flavor was good and lots of rice selections. Variety of vegetarian dish and meats. Come during their lunch buffet if you are not sure what to order. The place is clean."}
{"text":"No wonder, the rating has/is going down for this restaurant.  My second time to this place was for a to-go pick up and it wasn't a feel good experience, importantly because of their hospitality.  They don't greet you, they keep talking over the phone and show hand gestures to you so you don't know if they ask you to wait, sit somewhere, talk to someone or get out or whatever.  
PLEASE greet your customers and be professional.  From other reviews, I understand the taste and quality has gone down a lot.  That's sad!!"}
{"text":"Went for the Sunday lunch buffet. It was really really good! Live dosa station - you can add as many fillings or flavors as you like! I had one with onion and chutney and another with Nutella! Tandoori chicken was really good - had almost an achari taste to them which was fantastic! Lots of good variety and authentic dishes. Super enjoyed the big bowl of papaddams, Limca and Thums Up! It was hard to get the attention of any of the staff members though but considering how busy they were it was understood!"}
{"text":"Best Buffet I had in my 5 years in the US. They make traditional south-Indian food, very tasty, spicy and flavorful. Must try if you like spicy food and if you are in Charlotte. Recently they opened up in Columbus, Ohio so seems like they are spreading. Only con is, while we visited Godavari on a Saturday afternoon for buffet and it was crowded, and the manager/owner couldn't keep up with the billing and it was a wait for 15 mins just to play the bill. Other than that the food is awesome !!"}
{"text":"Well the goat was good, the red chicken was good.  The rice was hardly palatable even after putting heavy gravy from the above dishes on them  the squash was good, the round sweet balls were way overly sweet.  The buffet was not very appetizing to look at, everything was very spicey and would not recommend for the kids, very spicy. The food was palatable at best.  Very dissatisfied with the overall experience and would not recommend.  Water was the only option offered for drinking.  The yogurt used to cut the spiciness of the food was good."}
{"text":"Went for a dinner the roti was amazing, the goat curry was great but the problem was with goat pieces which was very hard and full of bones."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was wonderful. Our waiter helped us in choosing our food. I will definitely be ordering takeout from this place in the future. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I appreciated the Vegetarian and non-Vegetarian menu. The attentive staff and abundance of appetizer and entree choices will keep us coming back for more."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars when it first started which was not too long ago. Absolutely loved it.
I went there last weekend. We ordered masala dosa, uttapam and tea. The dosa was stale, floppy, tasteless. The masala was absolutely bland. Disgusting. We told the server, he came back with crispy dosa but every other flaw remained
I am sure there is better stale uttapam being served in the waiting room of hell. I am not exaggerating. Tasteless, odorless, uncooked, raw blob of dough.
The tea was just stale. The milk was off. 
If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. Hell with this place!"}
{"text":"Had ala carte last week for dinner, was good. Called to order Togo on Sat for lunch, they said I can come in & take Togo from buffet. I go there and the guy at the host stand, tells me to wait for 2 mins and no one to attend for 20 mins. It hardly takes a minute or two to help with a Togo box and then me to make selections. Very bad customer service, at least be courteous. Maybe you can get basic respect if I speak Telugu...P would give -ve 100 stars if yelp allows. Pissed off with the treatment."}
{"text":"Was here for a Saturday buffet. Cool ambience and tonnes of options to eat.

I'm a vegetarian and not all Indian restaurants serve so many options for us. Definitely this place a bomb. They kinda prefix Indian actor/actresses names to food (Ileana Idly for example). This is something I have never seen and is funny.

Good skylight, large place and kinda far from my location. Would love to visit this place again for their entr√©es some time.

Second check-in : Tried Junnu (dessert). The best dessert I have tasted so far in any buffet. 
Hope the quality and management stays the same at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Rough exterior hides a gem inside. The staff was friendly and hit us up right away. We got the lamb and goat curry, with some naan bread. Food was great, didnt take long to come out, but the place wasnt packed either. I enjoyed the curry dishes and the serve style. Rice was brought out seperatly than the dishes and made sharing easy. They also had a large tv that played music videos. The dj kept Indian artists playing with a mix of foriegn language songs and english pop remixes. It was a nice touch. The servers could have checked up on us a bit more, but we didnt have to wait for anything. I would recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely obsessed with this place. Every time I've come here the food has been amazing and the staff is super friendly. 
I don't eat meat so I was very happy to see the menu has vegetarian sections so I don't have to read through everything to find my food. 
Last time I came in I even asked our server how to pronounce some of the words and she helped us learn some of them which was nice. 
Their naan is the best I've ever had and I'll definitely be back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it is the best Indian food I've ever had, but it was close enough. Their buffet had a wide variety of food. I like my food spicy and the food here was just right. I'm not an expert, but the food seemed authentic. The seating was pretty full."}
{"text":"I got the Nallore Chepala Pylusu (Fish Curry) with rice and Garlic Nan. I asked for it Indian Native Spicy and they got it right. I was sweating!
This place is perfect to bring a large group or just a couple on date night. 
The buffet is like something out of a 5 star Hotel."}
{"text":"**Pathetic service and bland food**

The worst indian restaurant i been in the US yet. My friend ordered a Sweet Lassi and they served Salt Lassi. 

We had to call the server everytime we need something. Always unattended by them. Even though it was not a busy night and there were more than 3 servers working. 

We got chicken pieces in an egg biryani. If you are a vegeterian think twice before you eat here. The food was def not fresh and was flavourless. 

Not ever going back. And do not suggest anyone to try this place out."}
{"text":"Great food great place been there twice all been good. experiences.There alway someone to fill your water glass . And order more food that not on the buffet ."}
{"text":"We went expecting nothing but great things as many of you know who are plant-based typically south Indian restaurants are a safe haven unfortunately this is not the case with this particular restaurant I like the idea that someone smaller and more local was opening up a former local landmark and we had very very high hopes I will start by saying if you are a meat eater you would be doing very well as our carnivorous friend really enjoyed his meal. my wife and I have been plant based for years and Indian food is one of our favorites but I have to say the experience with ordering itself made me want to get up and walk out. every time I said the word vegan she pointed to something that had ghee in it.  After we went through a few of the other staff members to try to figure out if our order would be completely plant-based we decided to be polite and stay the course which ended up being a big mistake because my wife and I are both fairly confident we were fed a curry that had ghee in it.  Just to summarize omnivores will be fine vegetarians should be OK but if you are vegan I would definitely steer clear."}
{"text":"As a foodie, I am always \"IN\" for trying new places. Since this new restaurant opened last week, I have decided to try this place to try their Weekend Grand lunch buffet.
I was surprised by the number of people showed up today for their lunch buffet. I must appreciate their marketing team for creating the buzz in the valley. 
 Here are my insights based on my lunch buffet experience

Positives:
1) Food (Very Good). Decent selection of Veg and Non-Veg Options.
  Covered all South Indian Dishes and Biryanis.I personally liked Gongura Mutton and Fish Fry. Food is **Spicy**
2) Ambience (Excellent). I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant with all famous old Tollywood and Kollywood movie stars pictures. (see attached pictures for review)
3) Choice of food in Menu.(Good). I looked their menu for a la carte, Impressive.
4) Parking (Good). The restaurant has ample parking place.
5) Service (Good). Staff was friendly and courteous to our requests.

Things to Improve:

Since they have started recently I must give few more weeks for them to settle down and get used to the huge crowd they are receiving now.


I would definitely recommend this place to all Spice Lovers.                     will update more after my a la carte dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic South Indian food. If you are craving for real Indian food this is your destination. Loved it, can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Very happy to eat good quality authentic South Indian food after a very long time.
Positives:
- Indian style Chinese noodle was amazing
- very good idli
- dal, roti and chapati were pretty taste and spot on
- what I liked the most was the friendly service,l from the nice staff, and the restaurant owner/manager asking for feedback shows they really care about customer satisfaction
- very well done interiors reminding you of simple rural designs and pictures of veteran South Indian stars

We will come back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"The food wasn't? fresh. I ordered idly-wada and pakora for take away. The pakoras literally tasted as if they were made during the afternoon buffet and were simply reheated and given to us. Sambar was wattery. Idlis tasted stale."}
{"text":"Had worst buffet experience ever. The restaurant need to ensure that they serve hot and fresh food. Usually, in buffet, one or two dishes are not tasty and that's OK. But today, all the dishes weren't tasty. 
They kept on playing old music videos on TV, which was very frustrating.
Overall nightmarish experience.

The location is good and the owner should ensure that he keeps a tab on food quality and pleasant ambience, else this restaurant is not going to survive the competition."}
{"text":"Great service and food! My husband and I went there for our date night. We were greeted so warmly. The food came out quickly. The menu is huge! We're vegetarian and ordered the garlic naaan, Palak Paneer, and Veg Chettinadu. Both were delicious although I kept getting big chunks of fennel in the veg chettinadu which was a bit unpleasant. Our meal was just over $30 total. We will likely go next time to try the lunch buffet on Fri, Sat, or Sun when they have a lot of veggie dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant has it all; incredibly delicious Indian food, a welcoming atmosphere & extremely professional service. I took a large group of people here to celebrate a birthday & we had a great time. Each of us really enjoyed it; even the picky eaters of the group. My husband and I shared chicken tiki masala, palak paneer, guntur garlic naan, it was incredible. Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was very welcoming & helpful. We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"The food is as authentically Indian as it can be. The only thing they might want to improve is the coordination between the servers and the kitchen. The last two visits we were served by this young lady Sneha, who went out of the way to take care of us. Indian hospitality at its best. The place was busy and she obviously must have been a little overwhelmed but she remained calm and always had a big smile on her face. 

We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great variety and great taste. Also very clean. Staff was extremely friendly. I tried just about everything at the buffet and it was all great. The peanut chutney is also quite spicy which is great. Most places don't have actual spicy food like this."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the lunch buffet, mutton curry and the fish fry was great..!"}
{"text":"My actual rating for this place is 3.5stars. I have had food from Godavari twice. First, we went on a weeknight, ordered Malai Kofta, Kadhai Paneer, Dal Tadka, Garlic Naan, Masala Dosa, Idli Sambhar and coffee. The food was absolutely heavenly and out of this world. I would say it is the best Indian food in Phoenix at this point. 
Our second time was a to-go party order for a group of 15+ people. Our menu was almost similar to the one above with the addition of 30 samosas and half tray of Veg. Pulao. The sad part was we didn't get any chutney's or raita as promised with the samosa/pulao. Also, we were promised a pickup time of 4:30pm, but the food was not ready until 6:30pm.  
Even though, the food quality is good they need to improve on the customer service. 

Overall, definitely recommend with some quirks as mentioned above!"}
{"text":"Worst South Indian food in the charlotte area. Went there for dinner around 6 and the place was almost empty, still the service was way too slow. 
We wanted to try a new restaurant in the area. Should've gone to Peacock instead, as we'd planned to."}
{"text":"So I called for a to go order and took 2 samosas chaat and it was so delicious even after I ate 2 hours just loved it . I asked for a Pav baji but they dint have that . And the owner was quickly attentive and gave us our food ."}
{"text":"After trying out dinner at other Indian places, was here for a lunch buffet on the day of Christmas and yippeee, loved all the items here. Food was perfectly done, nothing too mild nor too spicy. If you are looking for a good Indian food buffet in Charlotte area, this is the place."}
{"text":"I have been here three times for their lunch buffet. During the weekdays, the selections are good. On the weekends, the selections are great. Even have someone there to make fresh Dosa. Flavors on most dishes are great. Just know some dishes are spicy from mod to low high. Desserts are my favorite. They also have mango lassi and Indian coffee offer with the buffet. This is the best Indian buffet in town, just know that some dishes are spicy. If you go near the time the buffet is over, selection may be sparse."}
{"text":"They have good variety in their lunch buffet.. must try mutton curry and paper chicken, 
Service- ok
Ambience- Not bad
Food- great!"}
{"text":"Ordered haleem from here and and It was similar to left over sambar, no meat, no taste and watery. I haven't had such haleem in my life, worst taste ever. If you dont know how to make Haleem dont sell it instead of serving such a pathetic one.

Never going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We love Indian Food and were very pleased with our first visit last weekend. We had the Grand Buffet which exceeded our expectations. The food was excellent, and so was the service. A couple of times there were lines, but it moved quickly. Parking was good as well."}
{"text":"There is no customer service whatsoever. A lot of food selection but the flavor are just way too strong. And why do you put that jar of water on the table? Saw fly flying around so this place didn't seem to be clean to me. One star for the chicken curry the only thing I really like. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Dont remember the names of everything we order but oh my was it tasty. Everyone in our party loved their food and all was amazing!"}
{"text":"Best andhra food.. This is definitely one of the good Indian restaurants you can find in Charlotte area. Their weekend buffet is good. Quality and service is good. I hope they maintain the quality and service."}
{"text":"I visited the Sunday lunch buffet.  The claim that it is the largest Indian buffet in town is a flat out lie!!!  This exaggerated advertisement would be easily forgivable if the food was good.  However, it was not only the worst Indian meal I have ever had, it was about the worst restaurant meal I ever had.  The food was NOT fresh.  Most of the vegetarian dishes I tried were cold and greasy.  The chicken dishes had very little chicken in them.  I am never going back."}
{"text":"I give this place only two stars. The food is not bad, except that it's too flavourful. So unless you are really used to the strong flavours, you may not enjoy the food a lot. 

Now coming to the ambience part of the restaruant, I think this is one of the worst places. Looks very unhygenic and even the waiter and waitress here don't know how to attend to the customers. They constantly drop the silverware and I've noticed that they don't sanitize the cutlery and plates properly, which leads to a big hygiene issue. I would not recommend this place to anyone! Ever!"}
{"text":"Never order the below combo....They are made with same sauce & tastes same... such a pathetic food we ever tasted... 

Chicken Manchuria
Chicken lollipop/drumsticks
& Andhra kodi biriyani (they serve dum biriyani rice with Chicken Manchuria)"}
{"text":"There's a pretty good divide here between food quality and service. In short, the food is good and the service is horrible. The menu is huge and making a decision is almost more difficult because of that. But not to worry, I imagine whatever you order will be good.

I went with three other people and when we arrived there were only a few other tables occupied. So we figured we lucked out considering they ought to be new and popular. We waited. Finally got our drinks ordered and waited some more. Finally got our food ordered and waited while they brought out each person's meal over the course of 15-20 minutes. The first meal came out mere minutes after ordering and the last meal came out probably 10 minutes after the one prior. It was as if the first one was made and sitting around on a hotplate waiting to be ordered and the last one had to be made from scratch. It would have been nice to just receive all of them at the same time or at least within a few minutes of each other.

To add to the timing issue in receiving the food, we were disappointed with the responsiveness of servers. As the time went on the restaurant packed in steadily and they had no clue at all what they were doing. Just getting a water refill was near impossible. When you'd finally call a server over they'd either look bothered or confused. As if to say you shouldn't be drinking water so fast. I guess we were talking a lot and getting parched because we had no food to eat?

On the food note, it was as expected from an Indian restaurant. I ordered the Paneer Butter Masala and it meshed perfectly with the rice. On the \"Chinese-Indian\" fusion portion of the menu (something unique I've never seen at an Indian place before) there were several interesting dishes. My friend ordered the Chinese noodles and for the table we ordered the Shanghai Chilli Paneer which was spicier than expected but still good. It was also confusing because this was on the normal menu but was actually a small dish app. As for the last two people they ordered a couple of dosas. I'm not a fan of dosa myself but they both had no complaints about them or the sauces. Both had plenty of potato inside and 3-4 sauces to dip into. It was the Mysore Delight Dosa that came out almost instantly and became a bit cold by the time the last dish (the other dosa) came out.

In conclusion on this review though, this would not be my first, second or even third choice when I think I want to try Indian again. They do have a lunch buffet however so I would be willing to come back for that. At least then perhaps I won't have to deal as much with the poor service."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great atmosphere. Wait staff was also extremely helpful with the menu. Best Indian cuisine I've ever had by far"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Great staff also. Very inviting. I highly recommend their fish and goat, especially Andrha Mamaam Goat and Tawa Kachi"}
{"text":"I bet that this is truely amazing food for people from India.  The whole restaurant was full of Indians.  That a good sign for an authentic restaurant.  It was pretty fabulous and not expensive."}
{"text":"Friends who live in the area suggested we meet here for lunch. I guess a Mexican restaurant used to be in this location. I am vegetarian and gluten intolerant so I called last week to ask how they handle customers with dietary restrictions. I was assured that someone would escort me to the buffet line and let me know what was safe. That being said I was ready to get my grub on.

There are VERY few options for vegans so if you are vegan DO NOT GO HERE. There are several dishes that are gluten free and vegetarian. Everything was tasty and I went back for seconds, you know.....to get my money's worth. Overall, it was ok. Because it's nowhere near my house I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Authentic South Indian food with great hospitality. Best South Indian food you can get in Phoenix. Loved their signature dishes Raju gari kodi vepudu and Kakinada chepa vepudu. Will definitely visit again soon."}
{"text":"Menu is grossly misleading. More than half of the items listed in menu aren't available most of the times. The so called special biriyani seems to be too special. It is never available. Even simplest snack items are not available most of the times. There's no point looking at the menu online or at the restaurant to order. I'd rather have people saying what's available like in the old times."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Godavari. I came here for lunch and I believe it is only buffet at lunch.  The food that was served today was good and the temperature was nice and hot as opposed to other buffet places where the food is lukewarm as they do not want to overcook it.  This is not a problem here as there were a lot of people eating lunch and the food turnover was quick.  I liked the tikka masala, paneer masala and the butter chicken curry. The naan was not served fresh to the table but was cut up and available at the buffet line. There was tandoori fish fillet available today but there was no tandoori chicken as you would find in a typical Indian buffet, also missing was palak paneer which is one of my favorite dish.  As far as dessert the usual selection is not available such as gulab jamun and kheer (rice pudding)."}
{"text":"They put this place in several months ago by my house.  My wife and I finally made time to try it.   It was amazing!   We are vegetarians and had tons of options to choose from.  The garlic naan was fantastic!   I don't remember the 2 entrees we had but I have a feeling it's all good.  We will definitely be back for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Service was solid, food was great!  During lunch they offer buffet style, with countless options.  What a great spot to try many different Indian dishes all in one sitting.  Just be careful not to take to much... I needed a nap after!

One concern I should point out, their Sanitation Rating was 90% during our visit.   Typically, we will leave if a restaurants score is below 95ish, but it smelled so good we had to give it a try and I'm glad we did."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend going here for buffet. It is over crowded and food is always cold. They have better service at ala carte. 
The variety of food is very authentic, true to its roots - the southern part of India. Flavors are distinctive to every dish and not like the usual- one sauce for all the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Yummy...the food was delisous and hot and plentiful! Also there were lots of vegitarian options and if u are like me and like it spicy they have that too! I would have given 5 stars but it was more like a 4.5 then a 4 but half points aren't an option so...4 it is (*hint *hint yelp)....my only complaint is that the kids meal was a mini main and not really a meal..there were 5 drumsticks and we had to order fires (which were like 5 or 6 bucks) separate ...is rather had 3 drumsticks and fries but no big deal I guess! I really look forward to going again and trying the buffet!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet.   More options than I could eat in one sitting.  Very delicious food and all very fresh.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I tried buffet, Food was just ok, too much oil and too much red chili in all the dishes. tables were not clean. Couldn't find bowls for soup & deserts, had to use steel glass for that. Restaurant is big but maintenance was poor. All the waiters are super busy and no one listens to you, so if you want to ask for anything then better forget to ask."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last week and I have been craving chicken tikka masala and palak paneer every day since!
I ordered mild spice and both dishes were perfect.  Some of the best I've had.  The basmati rice and garlic naan were excellent, as well.  Yum!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Meh...Food was ok but service was awful. Had to ask for everything (water, specials) and they were serving everyone else first with no explanation. We also ordered chicken wings for kids (no spice) which came out with spice after 45min. of waiting. Probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants i have been to. Great ambience and excellent customer service. Definitely recommend this restaurant if you wanna have some authentic and delicious indian food."}
{"text":"I was very much interested to do a take-out at this location, and unfortunately it didn't work out on a Sunday afternoon. The person who spoke over phone informed me that , they cannot do any preparation for take out and it is only buffet that's available. 
Will dine in soon next time, when I have a chance."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty
Friendly atmosphere 
Worth for each and every penny
One of the best Indian restaurants I had ever visited"}
{"text":"I was happy to see the signs that said that this place would soon open and I'm happy to say that it did not disappoint. We ordered take-out and it was ready as promised, warm, and delicious. The samosas I would say maybe stayed too long in the oven and a little dry, but samosas are samosas...delicious. As we have kids, our go to dish is the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was very good and spicy. The Aloo Gobi was very good as well. This place is up there with the best Indian Places in the Phoenix area so I will surely be back. Especially on a Friday evening when nobody in the family wants to cook."}
{"text":"Great new place in the area. Happy to have you so close to my home. I love the flavors of southern Indian cuisine. Will be back again. My only advice is it's super bright inside dim the lights a little to set the mood. Felt a little like I was in a dentist office."}
{"text":"One of the best South Indian buffets in the Charlotte area. Also, their dosas are to die for. Love their vegetarian spread."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic. Just the right amount of spices and service was great.  Would love it if they could reference what type of chicken they use.  Free range chicken would put this place over the top."}
{"text":"Pathetic.poor service and terrible food.they served stale potato masala in the masala dosa we ordered and the funniest part is when we said it was stale they outrightly denied- verbatim- chef tasted and said it was fresh.I must say I never had disgusting experience like this in any of the restaurants in Charlotte.not recommended"}
{"text":"Boneless Biyarni Chicken rice plate from postmates. Delicious and flavorful!! Asked for spicy and they delivered! I don't care about the other reviews because I ordered it delivered through postmates and I highly recommend it if you don't want to deal with average service. Can't speak for it besides that they forgot my fork. Oh well!! By the way I eat Indian food regularly as I am from San Francisco, CA. Hands down it's very authentic and delicious"}
{"text":"Went to Godavari a few weekends ago with my family. We are vegetarians and heard a lot of good reviews about the place. The place was a total let down. The vegetarian food selection was dismal. They advertise as the largest buffet in Phoenix, but they hardly any choices 3-4 vegetarian dishes. Made to order Dosa was the only bright spot on the buffet. It is not worth the trip...skip this place"}
{"text":"Godavari, Wow! With all the Indian restaurants in the greater Phoenix area, I thought I'd found some of the best ones, until now.
This place is brand new and when I found out it's in my old neighborhood, I just had to try it. If it was here during the 30 yrs. I would have been a regular, no question. Let me just say that the South Indian food here is as authentic as it gets. Vegan/non veg and the variety you have, it can all be a bit overwhelming. Don't worry, these nice people will walk you through until you're extremely satisfied. If you're not a spicy food freak, you will be after eating here. 
A very clean open space with good service and a bar coming shortly is always very inviting. Buffet as well as a la carte choices leave little to be desired. Masterfully prepared dishes are never ending and every bite can be immensely rewarding. Make sure they keep your water filled and ask for the Mango Lassi drink. It's a great way to combat the heat from your spicy mouthful. They offer takeout as well as delivery seven days a week. Every once in a while you'll want to eat this kind of flavor and variety in the comfort of your home. That way you'll take your time and savor every bite. That helps to come to grips with the mesmerizing intensity of rich full on flavors few places can offer.
Truly a delight! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love their weekend buffets and dosa night is amazing. They change up the menu for their weekend buffet. Avakaya biryani and mutton mamsam curry was the best. Must try place."}
