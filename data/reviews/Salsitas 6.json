{"text":"The food is always spot on and so is the customer service. definitely looks like they have cleaned up the place a bit which is always a plus. Get their gorditas they are amazing."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru to order 2 burritos and took literally 35 min waiting for my food .. on top of that worse service ever"}
{"text":"So the guy comes from out of the back doing whatever with gloves on and comes to start preparing the food. They weren't pleased when I asked him to take off the gloves and change them, so eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"This location probably had to be the worst. I was craving a burrito and once my order was done.....the burrito was falling apart wasn't well wrapped or anything tasted bad just the worst burrito in my life. Now I know why I miss California mexican food it's way better than this piece of shit"}
{"text":"In keeping with the traditional Mexican cure for hangovers, I came here for a bowl of menudo Saturday morning.  For you non-menudo eaters, (myself included) I'm not sure how a bowl of cow's stomach is supposed to cure one of those hangovers where you can't bend over to tie your shoes for fear your eyeballs will pop out, but they say it works so I gave it a try.  It didn't work. It was tasty and all, but I left every bit as hungover as when I went in.  Leading me to believe the real cure for a hangover isn't so much the menudo itself, but rather the idea that you're eating something so disgusting and repulsive, you're just happy to get it over with. Lending to the idea of feeling better afterward. You don't though.   Anyway, you've probably eaten things far worse than a bowl of spiced cow innards.... on a Saturday morning...while waiting for the cab to show up.  Not repeating. (either one)"}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix to work and needed something quick and good and luckily this restaurant was across the way from pur hotel! We loved the chicken burrito and breakfast burrito. We went both Saturday and Sunday and whenever we come back to Phoenix we will definitely come back. Keep up the great work and friendly customer service."}
