{"text":"YUM! How can you not like this place? We have visited at least two or three times during each of our Vegas trips and will continue to do so. Cheap, delicious, open ridiculously late (yay Vegas!) and the workers are so friendly. I am not normally a lengua fan but oh my god, the lengua fries and tacos are like an orgasm in your mouth."}
{"text":"It was recommended that I visit Tacos El Gordo, so I took the advice and I was more than pleasantly satisfied. I wanted to try a variety of what they offered, so I ordered the Vampiro with al pastor, carne asada taco, al pastor taco and an al pastor Mula. Everything I ordered tasted amazing. I highly recommend this place, just make sure you get there on a not so empty stomach because the wait time is  quite a while, but most definitely worth it! And make sure you stand in the line according to the meat that you want. There are different lines for the different types of meats. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!"}
{"text":"*Review #2* This place, location, price, people, and service should all get an award. The only way this place could get any better is if they served beer, other than that everything is amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome.  just ate there for the first time and I'll definitely be going back tomorrow.  I only tried the spicy pork because the lines were a little nuts and I want to try something else."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo goooood!!! Must try!!! Avocado creama is bomb. I get the adobada tacos and fries every time. Best tacos in town. The only downside is that you smell like meat when you walk out. The staff could be a little bit more friendly too, but I mainly go for the food and not the customer service."}
{"text":"Today sucked there has been way better times. Disappointed for it being a slow day. But got food fast"}
{"text":"Adobado Tacos are THE BEST tacos they have here!!!  i'll go through 6 of them easy... 

the area here late at night is kinda sketchy... while lining up for tacos, the drunk people behind me got into a heated argument and nearly started a slug fest... too bad it didn't get ugly or else I would have lost my spot in line..."}
{"text":"So authentic!!! It is extremely tasty!! My brother in law brought us here Sunday night quick everything was made right in front of us! Even totillas so that was a plus for sure.  I'm from California n was missing our taco trucks. This is definitely the spot if you're visiting Las Vegas n want some real Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Two Words: Adobadas Mulas.  Pricier than the other tacos but my goodness, it tastes like nothing you'll find at any Mexican restaurant.  We've been to restaurants in Mexico, San Diego, Texas, etc.  that don't offer food as tasty as Tacos El Gordo's Adobadas Mulas.  If you are into healthy eating, don't order this but if you want to indulge, stand in the Mulas line first.  The Tripas tacos is also great if you like offal like I do.  Tried the Cabeza but was mild tasting compared to the Mulas and Tripas.  After we finished eating, saw another customer with a large grilled green pepper and green onions and read later it is free but not on the menu so you have to ask for it.  Definitley returning when in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the service is HORRIBLE. Completely Unorganized , they need to learn customer service ! Other than that it was delicious ! The carne Asada tacos are the best in my opinion ! The prices are a little up there but the tacos are huge !"}
{"text":"This place has some of the BEST tacos in Vegas! And I've tried pretty much every place in this town! Tacos El Gordo doesn't even compare!! This is my favorite place to get a fantastic taco! They are incredibly packed with flavor and served traditionally but with a great little twist. I don't know how they do it, but they are consistent every time. 

I always order the tacos Al Pastor with everything on it! Thee most incredible flavor in a taco you will ever try! It doesn't matter how packed the place is late at night, they are quick, consistent, and above all very friendly people! Ask for the grilled veggies too!

What else is there to say...THEE BEST TACO JOINT IN VEGAS!!!"}
{"text":"The best Tacos hands down on the west coast. So fresh and good. Lucky it's open 24 hours. FYI they have Quesadillas but it's not on the menu at most of the locations and they are so good. Very cheap and allot healthier than Taco Bell."}
{"text":"The hands down the best Tacos in town. Open 24 hrs a day. Give me a orange Fanta  and some Tacos and that's a wrap."}
{"text":"Great place for cheapie food that tastes great! Not overly greasy and the beef tacos tastes authentic to homemade Mexican food."}
{"text":"Want tacos? This is the spot! After a whole day of drinking Fat Tuesdays we got the sudden feeling of eating tacos. We checked this spot out and sure enough it was amazing.  They have all the type of tacos avaliable and trust me we tried them all. Our favorites lengua, tico, Carne asada. I am not giving it 5 stars just because a taco has to have a slamming salsa. Otherwise definitely try this spot"}
{"text":"It's been a few days but this feeling keeps haunting me that I must review this taco haven I experienced not once but twice while visiting LV. 
I'm going to open up with these are no doubt the best tacos I've eaten with no hesitation on that statement. 
So why didn't I write a review sooner? Well I was on vacation and as much as I eat mexican food(almost every day) i do taco's maybe once a week. These taco's stood out in so many areas of how a taco should be put together. From the all star meat to the toppings. They don't leave you hanging here. 
The first day I stood in the longest line in the place not knowing I was in the al pastor line with different meats having different stations until 5 minutes had passed. Too late I was committed and how could all those people be wrong? 2 taco's and a tostada later I'd happily stand in a line 5 times that long. 
Next day, I went back. Normally I love adventuring and trying out new places and new foods when traveling, but I hadn't gave the carne asada a shot yet. Got 2 taco's and carne asada fries. The taco's were again a big hit. If you're like me and feel desire to check a place with great ratings, there's a reason for this one."}
{"text":"Street tacos - fantastic! You walk in the door and the grill smoke greets your nostrils and you begin to salivate. Service is fast and friendly, food is fresh and delicious -- and inexpensive. A great option on the strip."}
{"text":"a couple of their tacos al pastor are all I need for lunch...abolutely amazing...and when my cariologist isn't looking I love a plateful of the carne asada fries.  This joint is the real deal, and I feel like I'm back in Tijuana when I dine there."}
{"text":"It was ok. Kinda pricey for what you get. Its at the end of the strip so if your faded its good!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with friends who absolutely swear by this place but I still can't figure out why... The tacos are very reasonably priced (by Vegas Strip standards) at $2 each but nothing on the menu really stands out as I've had as good or better at my local taquerias in Los Angeles. I also don't like the setup where different meats are in different lines. Makes it more complicated for the customers and inefficient..."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars, but the way is organized to order is not god. The food ia great specially when you want to eat god tacos"}
{"text":"Awesome, authentic Mexican tacos.  All kinds of meat that...er...I wouldn't eat. Did I mention it's authentic ? I had the asada and pastor tacos. I assume by everyone's smiles that the brain and internal organ tacos were yummy as well. Lines for different meats are kinda confusing, but, they help you sort it out. If you are a gringo ( like me ), bring a Mexican.  It helps. ;-)"}
{"text":"Love their tacos but they are pricy also not to big of establishment that makes it hard to eat in a small place"}
{"text":"I don't understand why there's three seperate lines for different meat? What if I wanted 3 tacos with different meat on them? Anyway, this place was an old gas station  before? So down to the nitty gritty! I ordered 3 adobada tacos with pineapple on top, with everything. And adobada fries! The adoboda fries were soooooo BOMB! Hands down best I ever had!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are good, they have all meats just NO chicken which sucks! The customer service I was not to happy with felt un organized. And place is always packed with 1 restroom.  Lots of grease!"}
{"text":"This place serves some of the best tacos I have every had. Authentic tasting Mexican food for a decent price. It's a little strange if you don't speak any Spanish because it is a real Mexican joint! I often pick up four tacos and a half order of carne asada fries to feed my wife and myself. Awesome food, excellent service, not overrated."}
{"text":"So got to say this place is pretty killer. .they have a weird system for ordering and everything is in Spanish. .fortunately my girl spoke Spanish lol

I got the asade tostado, flour taco, masomething.and something else .they have this killer gyro style pork that is amazing. .was all fantastic. .I don't really know what I ordered but man it was great! My girl liked it more than the shrimp and crab from night before lol

Seating is a negative but great food always trumps anything else and these guys have their act together. .will definitely be top of my list next time I come back. ."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever got been going since I lived by Chula Vista so glad they have them here"}
{"text":"Got to come here every time I am in Las Vegas! Love the al pastor and asada, and all the fixing they put on their tacos. Also, a huge plus that it is so cheap!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! Being from San Diego and spending a lot of time in Mexico, I can say this place is it! The style of the place is perfect, simple and humble. They people behind the counter are hard working and know what they're doing. They are all incredible! I don't understand why I can't find anything like this in Colorado! I'm drooling right now just thinking about those awesome little street tacos. YUM!"}
{"text":"Ever had authentic, fresh adobada and carne asada tacos in Baja California? If so, then you KNOW how good they can be. Tacos El Gordo in Las Vegas has got the same thing and they've got it goin' on!
My family and I took some tacos to go last night and shared them back in our hotel. They were served on the typical tiny corn tortillas which means that if you're hungry, you've gotta order up! The carne asada tacos were excellent but the adobada (spicy pork) were out-of-this-world good! Make sure to get limes on the side. They MAKE your tacos what they should be! 

If you love authentic Mexican tacos, you MUST go to Tacos El Gordo.  THEY ARE THE BEST TACOS NORTH OF THE BORDER!!!"}
{"text":"Thank You Yelpers for helping me find this place. These are probably the best tacos Ive ever had, I live in San Antonio, TX and Id say Im somewhat familiar with street taco type places but considering all the high end expensive restaurants I visited while in Vegas, and the fact that the most memorable food I ate on the strip were these awesome tacos says alot. 

They added another side to the restaurant itself to make it bigger, probably due to its gaining popularity. The suadera tacos, adobada and carne asada are the best in my opininion. I wanted to try the Lengua but I was just too full. 

Im just glad this place has enough recognition that they had to make it bigger. They deserve all the business they get as long as they keep up with the badass tacos."}
{"text":"Best Tacos around. The spicy Pork is amazing. Quick cheap and unreal delicious. Not much else to say the tacos speak for themselves."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos!  Just like TJ tacos!  My favorite were the tripa and al pastor!  Must try if your in vegas!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place nestled on a quiet part of the strip. Great authentic Mexican food that won't break the bank. I had the pork, steak, and beef tongue tacos and all tasted great. At around$2 a taco this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Ive had just about everything on the menu. But my favorite. Are the carne asada fries. Awesomeness in a box lol. The line is always a little long but hey when the food is that good. Thats expected. Order kick back and enjoy :)"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall, a short walk off the strip, but what it lacks in glitz it makes up for in deliciousness. 
Everything is delicious and full of flavor! The Beef Tongue tacos and Steak Al Pastor tacos are my favorite. 

If you want authentic Mexican tacos in Las Vegas, this is your place."}
{"text":"its been 3 hrs since we ate at this place, and can still feel them stuck in my throat ... Carne azada too plain, big chunks of onion, salsa has no flavor, tables are claustrophobic small.  I heard people say that if you don't go eat tacos el Gordo in Vegas u don't fully experience Vegas... That's BS ... Well, I rather have McDonald's for breakfast next time ."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos you can get in Las Vegas! The carne asada tacos are the best! The only bad thing is that at whatever time you go, it's always packed! And I mean packed! Seating is also pretty limited so don't really count on it. There are several lines depending on what kind of tacos you want, so don't be overwhelmed by the amount of people waiting. They're usually pretty fast once you get to the window. If you can handle being in a pretty small place at +100° with loads of people around you, the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life and I'm not one to complain like this. After waiting in line for over 30 minutes, I was told I couldn't order asada in this line and that I would need to get in the other line.  No courtesy for customers, especially if your a gringo. These people will never get my business again."}
{"text":"Cheap and fresh, can't beat this place. Very authentic but very long lines. The food is all fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"One of my favorite late night taco spots!

I love me some Mexican food, and this spot just happens to be a block away from where I work! The best part is its open really late on the weekends so when I leave the club around 4am I can get my fix of some of the BEST PASTOR TACOS (Adobada) I've had in Vegas. They have several different lines depending on the type of filling you want: Asada, Adobada, and then Lengua,Tripas, etc. and everything is prepared fresh in front of you customized however you like. You can even order off the menu like Nopales (cactus) which is also very good. They even provide you grilled peppers and green onions that you can munch while you wait. 

I would imaging being drunk as hell would just amplifiy the already super delicious eats here cause I always see a couple people I ended up having to kick out of the club there! Its really busy and loud at 4am and it always makes for a great atmosphere! They have security there too so even if you're scurred don't hesitate to come and get some great food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  This time I tried the Carne asada fries. They tasted great. Tacos are awesome too."}
{"text":"They made me get in line twice just to place one order and the food is not even that great at least be kind to your customers if your food is garbage. Yelp wants more so also not enough seating and the drink I got was watered down."}
{"text":"Always an awesome meal. Don't get sucked into ordering a large fry. A half portion is more than enough to share. You also can't beat 2 buck tacos

Crap, I hate that this awesome joint moved, but...worth the drive, walk or crawl to eat the real deal south of the border grub"}
{"text":"Everyone talks about this place like it's the best, but unfortunately I've been here 3 times and each time the food is shitty and so is the service plus tables are hardly clean I wouldn't recommend this place to no one. Just my opinion if I could give y'all 0 starts I would but I can't"}
{"text":"While looking up cheap places to eat that were good in the city I found this place.  Thought the reviews were by fanatic fans but nope!  
The ambience isn't the greatest but to see your food prepared right in front of you and see what they do was a highlight for me."}
{"text":"These tacos are life. I was so excited when I found out this place was in vegas, because I've been dying to try the one in San Diego. I tried the carne asada and Al pastor tacos, and the carne asada tostada. My dad tried the tripe tacos. Every thing was so good.one of the best tacos I've had, and that's coming from a La girl. . I went here twice within 15 hours. I'll come back whenever I come back. I wish they would put one in La I'd be here all the time. I'll start praying on it."}
{"text":"Absolutely a waste of time and money, it is the biggest let down I have ever had the displeasure of paying for. This is not good food what so ever."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go if you want some good affordable food. It's kind of confusing as to how to order, since the place was completely packed. But basically, there are different lines for different types of meats. It's probably easiest to get friends to stand in each line to get different types of tacos.

I got the carne asada fries ($5 for small portion, $10 for large portion) for which there was no line at all (it's off to the side). I was craving fries hahaha. The rest of my friends got different types of tacos. For the fries themselves were alright, but the toppings were amazing. I would definitely try the fries with adobada (spicy pork) the next time I go and grab a few tacos."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday early in the am for some tacos. It was dead empty which was a plus. Set up was weird since there were different lines for different types of meats. Didn't mind that at all what I did I mind was the prices. Holy cow! 2.25 for a taco? What a rip, there so much cheaper back at home and the meat is better seasoned. The only plus was the tortillas. They looked home made and we're delicious. Wouldn't recommend though."}
{"text":"Great tacos and a fast service considering how busy they do get the seating since a lot of people but he usually busy around the times I go they do offer regular sodas as well as or horchata and pineapple"}
{"text":"MUY SABROSO!!!!!!!! I have been going to Tacos El Gordo since I can remember. I'm from Tijauna Mexico were this company is from and to finally have a taste from back home come here to Vegas brings back childhood memories. My personal favorite Tacos are tacos al pastor, asada, tripas, and lengua! The freshness of the tortillas and the salsas and Ofcourse the meets is the best part of the experience. Last but not least the customer service is great! Props to all the cooks and the staff of el Tocos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"This taco restaurant was great, not amazing as people say though. My all time favorite tacos, especially for cabeza is still El Chato in Los Angeles. 

I ordered:

1 Chorizo Taco - good, but not memorable. It lacked a punch.
1 Cabeza Taco - delicious taco and the green sauce was spicy.
3 Adobado Tacos - the texture was crunchy and the meat was flavorful. It wasn't spicy at all though unfortunately. I felt the meat could have been a bit more tender. When they serve you this meat, they cut it off the spinning rotisserie and crisp it up on a pan. I think the crisping on the pan part of it is unnecessary. 

All in all, I'd definitely come again."}
{"text":"good, quick, & easy place to stop if you've in/out privileges for a club. esp if you need more food to keep you awake/allow you to drink more

got 3 x carne asada and 3 x adobaba tacos. hecka good!! felt like i was in sf or san jose. i think the alibabas were better than the carne asadas

a plus: didn't feel any gassiness or stomach upset-ness later at the club like i sometimes do from taquerias, phew

free chips & salsa would be cool, but i guess i don't really need the extra cals anyway

I'LL COME AGAIN"}
{"text":"Tacos were great! We were visiting from LA and wanted to see what all the hype was about this place. We only tried the asada and chorizo and they were pretty good. The only complaint I have is the wait time, the lack of seating area, and the fact that if you want different meats you have to make multiple lines. Unless you're going with a lot of people you're able to get all the different tacos without having to wait for so long. Since it was me and my husband I decided to save us a seat while he ordered and the line where he was at you could only get asada and chorizo. Overall they were good but not that good to make me wait in 2 or 3 lines."}
{"text":"2 Adobada, 1 Asada taco. Asada taco was very good and the Adobada were excellent. I would recommend if you are in the area. Have some other items on the menu that look worth the visit as well."}
{"text":"Really good tacos on the strip rignt next to Encore Resort.
$ 2.00 Tacos
excellent asada and spicy tacos and tripe is fried. really good tripe if you never had one.
3 different lines that you order first then pay at the cashier.
line for asada ( make sure you ask for grilled chili and onions)
line for pork and last line for tripe or stomach.
very friendly staff. only wish is they could be more generous on guacamole."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas but don't go after 8pm it gets completely packed specially on the weekends. Price and tacos are not bad. Hopefully they get a bigger location for the one on charleston"}
{"text":"Overhyped...I don't know why these guys got so famous...they came from Tijuana (yes, lot of great taco stands there), but this business made the move to Chula Vista (San Diego) and became legends, and grew to other places and Las Vegas, don't understand why...tortillas are thick and cold, street tacos in Tijuana, Mexico, are thin and warm (sometimes crispy), the salsa is so so, nothing special, not worth the line, not worth the hype, i really wish people would stop making them more famous, they are ok, but that's it, the hype and fame are not deserved...El Poblano on East H Street in Chula Vista (San Diego) are the best carne asada tacos outside of Mexico."}
{"text":"The place is so much bigger then the other shops. The tacos are amazing! The workers are super nice and sweet. They where are really helpful. The tacos are really good. The place is always super busy. However, I went on a Wednesday around 5 it wasn't that busy the place looked really clean better then the other shops they have."}
{"text":"Carne asad is decent. I enjoy the atmosphere the most. If Im near by, I will stop by again."}
{"text":"Best al pastor taco's in the world. The line is worth the wait."}
{"text":"So finally I decided to try out Tacos El Gordo yesterday, after hearing from countless people saying \"oh they're the best, all others can't compete!\" Blah blah blah, you can't just believe what people say until you yourself have tried it and I did and well.... They should be called Tacos El Garbage!! Anyone who thinks these tacos are the best should be deported to Mexico just to experience what a real taco tastes like. The carne asada was dry as fuck and the worst part was that before the food hit my mouth you could taste the flame off the heat from the propane! Seriously my tacos tasted like lighter fluid!!! Hank Hill would've shit 4 bricks because he would've preached \"Taste the meat not the heat!\" Biggest waste of $20. For the extra $6.00 I should've gone next door, literally 5 steps to the right to Los Tacos and had real tacos that taste way better than the shit I just ate. Such a long wait in line for nothing. So like they say don't knock it till you try it! Yup, never going there ever again!!"}
{"text":"The food there is good but by the time you sit down your food is already cold. You have to make the line for carne asada tacos you have to make another line for carne asada fries and a separate line for Adobada  tacos. Then after all that you have to make the line to pay. there's hardly any tables to sit down."}
{"text":"There is something to be said about traditional mexican tacos and this is the right place that brings it to you as you can see the handmade tortillas and tacos being made at this fast pace place. Good customer service."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food hands down .the food is made fresh and it looks real authentic . If you ever have a chance to try this place I highly recommend it ."}
{"text":"Never had a bad exp here. I have ordered tongue, asada fries, tacos and every time no complaint. Close by which is always good too :) My favorite are the quesadillas."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better, only different.  Vampiros are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Tacos here is the real mccoy!! Just Order and pay the cashier. Average about $2.25 each just can't beat it. 3 tacos wasn't enough(carne asada, abobada and suadero) so had to get the tripa and lengua). Hits the spot. Opens till 5am too if you're out and about."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Extremely overrated and overpriced. Always crowded. Small portions for high prices. The only thing they can vouch for is 'authentic Mexican food' but it's hyped up too much. Food is really sloppy and messy. Instead of providing quality food for each customer, it feels as if they just make the food to get rid of their long line quicker. This is the kind of place that takes quantity over quality."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here!!! Carne asada fries and tacos are a winner EVERY TIME."}
{"text":"I grew up in the homeland of tacos el gordo TIJUANA n must I say they are on point gets me exxcited to see it here in vegas hits the spot everytime!!"}
{"text":"The taco de adobada changed my life last night! Thee best taco I have ever had in Vegas or perhaps ever. There is so much depth of flavor in such a small taco, I could not stop eating them. I literally dream about their tacos now."}
{"text":"This place has great tacos and the price is reasonable. We were here on a Sunday so it was packed with people. Avoid Sunday."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN LAS VEGAS!!!

This is my favorite taco place, I haven't tasted tacos this good since I lived in Baja California, Mexico. These are truly the most authentic Mexican Tacos I have had in Las Vegas and nothing else compares to them.  I have taken at least 5 people to go eat Tacos with me and ALL 5 LOVE this place as well. 

There are 2 locations, and I will drive across town just for these tacos.  The employees are also very friendly, I went so many times that the employees started to recognize me among the hundreds of people that go eat tacos! 

I guarantee these will be the BEST tacos you will ever have!"}

Came to Vegas from the bay area and we were sick of over paying for plain food so we drove to this place, we arrived and the place was packed but they have alot of staff so we didn't wait that long. I ordered tacos de cabeza and lengua-mindblown!  They are amazing, I also ordered nopales preparados-those were to die for. Would come here again!and again..and no again..buen trabajo muchachos de tacos el gordo :)"}
{"text":"Based on proximity to my hotel and Yelp reviews, I decided to try this place. It looks a little sketchy, but I'm really glad I did... the food is amazing and fairly inexpensive. The nice outdoor seating area is a bonus. The tacos asada and adobada are delicious. I ordered one of each and then, immediately after finishing those, I went back for 2 more. It's not fancy, but it's great food."}
{"text":"Trust me words don't do justice describing how tasty their fresh, hand made tortillas, fresh slow cooking alpastor meat and water truly are. This is a little piece of heaven as far tacos go. As all good places, expect a big line but prompt services by these guys!"}
{"text":"200+ people in there, their cafeteria set up ends up becoming one long long line per meat type and theeen you pay at another line.
So I did as many others were doing, ate my tacos before paying, which pissed off the cashier and a couple of the workers so now everyone was happily joined in pissedoffness over their ridiculous set up. Maybe after giving away tacos and giving customers and workers a terrible time, they'll get smart and do business the normal way. The tacos were good of course,(anything is good in a tj style steamed meat greased tortilla) but not worth the hour you'll waste trying to get a couple of different meats.
I suggest driving a little further down to Charleston ave where the other gordo is at, wich is busy, but you'll be eating in ten minutes tops."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy.  Enough said.  Tacos El Gordo es muy bueno.  I wished I payed more attention in Spanish class because I could not understand most of what the cooks were saying to me.   I had only a vague idea of what I was ordering and got confused where I was supposed to order from.  But, where's the fun if there is no element of surprise.   I had the mula (sp?) which was the best!  The orange bang was awesome too.  They had horchata on the soda line but the orange bang was much better.  I wish there were a Tacos El Gordo where I lived."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever eaten! Live the machitos tacos and the pastor tacos. Overall all of them are delicious! Salsas are freshly made and have a great kick. I've had tacos all over Mexico and tacos El Gordo are far out the best."}
{"text":"You cannot go to Vegas and not eat Tacos El Gordo. They're guacamole salsa is a staple and their al pastor is to die for!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. What is the hype about this place?!! Please read the rest (im generally very adventurous with new eating places) and take my review seriously.

 First of all the wait was ridiculous. Having to wait in each separate line for a meat is just crazy..who wants to wait in one line for over 30 minutes to get one type of taco and then go wait in another line for a different meat taco..no one! It was extremely hot and felt like no air conditioning was being ran. Service was terrible and very very slow. My wife and I were thinking if the line is so long it must be good..we couldn't have been more wrong. Tacos were soggy, meat was fatty (al pastor/adobago) and overly seasoned and I usually like al pastor back home. I honestly have made better tacos at home and I'm far from Mexican. Having to wait in a huge line to get the tacos and then wait in another line to buy a drink and pay is not efficient. 

Very little amount of tables and people were rude stealing tables/chairs from other people who waited in line. I felt like I was in prison having to sweat and fight for a table and protect it from getting stolen when my wife went to get a drink. With the amount of customers they should have an attendant to making sure tables were cleaned and given to the next paying customer. 

This place was the worst place my wife and I have eaten at in vegas and disappointing considering Yelp has rarely if ever lead me astray. You couldn't pay us to go back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this joint at all cost. Maybe it's better if there was no line, but in reading reviews that'd doesn't happen often."}
{"text":"They have some pretty bomb tacos here! It was really good and not too expensive either. The only thing is if you want a variety of things you have to get in a lot of different lines. Each line offers different type of meat. On the plus side, they give you free grilled onions and peppers!! The downside is that its super packed, and it takes awhile, especially if someone makes a big order. We ended up lining up for ~30min until we got to the front to order.

I ended up eating 3 tacos, a quesadilla and shared some carneasada fries. It was the perfect amount for me."}
{"text":"Coming to Vegas can get really mundane, especially if you never leave the Strip. Luckily we had a car & so off we headed to a hole in the wall taco shop called Tacos el Gordo. What a fantastic find! The bf & I came here based on other yelp reviews & it proved as delicious as people claimed. The tacos are stuffed w/meat which makes the price very reasonable. I had the carne asada tacos & the bf had the chorizo tacos. My only regret is not being able to put away more of these in one sitting. 

Two words of advice for those coming for the first time: (1) there are 3 different lines depending on the meats you want so pay attention to where you're standing & (2) try to go during off hours because the lines get long & confusing otherwise."}
{"text":"This place has the best damn tacos in town! The lines don't detour me. The language barrier is easily overcome when your talking tacos. I can easily spend $25 in here just on myself. Adobado fries are killer! Vampiro is amazing! Lengua is chalk full of flavor! I drive far out of my way to come here! It used to be a Wendy's, so seating is limited and it's always packed. When the place is full of Hispanic people, you know it's gonna be good! Open late and good til the last! I want some now!"}
{"text":"At least one racist employee. 

I went here once, and thought the asada was terrific. A few days later, I went back. I was ordering when the guy behind the counter stopped to take someone else's order, and he said to me that she was first, and his look and tone of voice made me suspect that he was implying I tried to push in front of her because I'm Anglo and she wasn't. I said sorry, I thought I had been here first. (I still don't know whether I was first or she was first. I thought she had walked in after me.)

After she ordered, he proceeded to ignore me for a few minutes, and this time there was nobody else near the ordering counter. I finally asked, \"Did you put in my order?\" He said, \"Oh, yeah, you were next, right?\" It was clearly done on purpose. 

I won't be back. I wish I'd taken my name so I could tell you who to stay away from. I'm sure they're not all like that."}
{"text":"This place is organized chaos. The tacos are some of the best in Vegas and that's all you should care about. 

All of the tacos are great but my favorite is the adobada tacos, which is 'spicy', not actually spicy, marinated pork. And consider yourself lucky if you get a slice of pineapple off the top of the grease spindle, the sweetness really helps the flavors pop. 

Since this place can be overwhelming at first my advice is to find the guy that's slicing the pork off the grease spindle and load up on adobada tacos. MAS MAS MAS!"}
{"text":"This is place is great! It's as close as you can get to TJ tacos without crossing the border to their tacos stand in TJ. I wish they had one in LA. We have to drive to Las Vegas or San Diego. I tried Asada, lengua, adobada , and mulas. The mulas are a quesadilla with your choice of meat. They were awesome! All the tacos were great! Ordering is a little strange because they have different lines for the different types of meat, but it is well worth getting used to it."}
{"text":"It was very confusing to come in for the first time. The staff was very helpful and friendly, considering how busy it was. They have separate lines based on the type of meat you're ordering. I really recommend anything from the adobada line! I got an adobada tacos and split a loaded adobada fry with a friend. The loaded fry was amazing! I recommend getting that. It's big but 2 people wouldn't have a problem finishing it."}
{"text":"This is a must every time we go to Vegas (whether it be this location or the other ones) My husband always orders 1lb of Al Pastor to go. Yes, there is a long line. Yes its worth the wait. Just remember, split and conquer. If you go in a group split up for the different lines."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever first thing when I come to Vegas I think about coming here  ! Meat has a lot flavor . Pastor one of the my favorite ."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had, you need to try as much as you can if you are visiting and that's what I did . Will be back when we are in town."}
{"text":"Tacos el Gordo Vegas style! I love that I can finally get good tacos without having to go to California. The set up is the exact same as you'd see at the San Diego locations. The adobada is amazing I have to get at least a couple whenever I come here and the carne asada is very flavorful without being dry like most in Vegas. 

The Vegas locations have carne asada fries too which I haven't tried yet but will the next time I go there (probably this week haha)"}
{"text":"Worth the $20 taxi ride... It was super good my family all loved it,,, one of our favoite places to come, cheap prices GREAT Authentic food! Adobada :) yummy! SLiced right in front of your eyes

****the only negative kinda thing is it isnt really that organized, everyone cuts in front  of each other. each station has a different meat so you may need to get in line a few times or seperate your family and have each order from each station. ALso the case register is in the little corner and they do watch you to make sure you pay. They dont sell beer but people bring in their own and they ask that you cover it"}
{"text":"The El Pastor Tacos are the best in town! And don't forget the napale"}
{"text":"Don't go here if your not Mexican.  My husband told me I needed to try this place so I took my three kids with me.  The wait was over a half hour long.  When I got to the counter the man would not even acknowledge me for at least five minutes while he tidied the counter and busied himself with anything but helping me.  I patiently waited.  When he was ready to take my order he called me a \"Gringa\" to his co-worker and had him get my tacos.  I ordered the adobada pork tacos.  My kids wouldn't touch them and the meat was chewy and nasty.  We threw them away and went to Del Taco.  When I told my husband about our experience he looked at our recipe which stated that I had ordered the tripas tacos (beef guts taco).  I wasn't in the beef line, I was in the pork line and I very carefully ordered something that was kid and family friendly for first time customers.  This was a racist joke on a \"Gringa\".  I'm sure these tacos would be delicious if you can earn their respect which obviously is not earned by a white woman with her children."}
{"text":"First time was awesome food was great ...... Second time and last time ever  was a mess , a total mess , the tacos was running grease and the vampiros was horrible the cheese on the vampiros was not even melted it was hamburger cheese to be exact, that also was running grease , my wife was so pissed even my kids were disappointed ... Sorry but I was so disappointed"}
{"text":"Soooooo goood! 

Tacos El Gordo started as Mexican Fast Food in Tijuana. There are now locations in San Diego and Las Vegas. Now, these aren't fancy restaurant tacos, this is fast food. Tacos El Gordo is precisely Mexico's version of McDonald's. Unhealthy, greasy, and DELICIOUS.

When you walk in, there are taco stations making different types of tacos. Each meat comes with a unique blend of sauces to enhance the flavor. So, for example, carne asada comes with guacamole, adobada does not. When you order your tacos, they'll ask if you want everything on it, if you say yes, they give you all the sauces that are recommended with that meat. I also ways go for \"everything on it,\" haven't been disappointed yet.

Tacos are $2 each. It's simple, it's fast, and it's yummy, yummy, yummy."}
{"text":"cant believe how any times I had been to Vegas and never heard of these tacos! A couple people mentioned this place to us during our visit in June and we decided to check it out. Its a bit far down in the strip like f you were heading downtown. the tacos were so delicious and if I remember correctly they were only $2! Will be getting some more next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had..definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas. The pastor tacos where the best"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos I've ever had....ever! So worth the wait in line! Don't go anywhere else! The asada tacos are to die for, with the guacamole on top! O m g! Now I want some!lol"}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing the lines insane! You have to stand in line according to what meat you want. I did not want to stand in 2 lines so decided on the spicy pork. It was so good!!  Tips- be patient and ready to wait. Divide and conquer if with friends"}
{"text":"Woow is all I have to say. These tacos were amazing !! The line was long but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I love me some
Tripa tacos and these were delicious. The tacos al pastor were awesome. Be warned. The line is out the door late night."}
{"text":"If you think King Taco is good? Wait until you try Tacos El Gordo. You'll be amazed how much these tacos are. I'm coming from East LA and before I went back home I had to eat from here, the food is great, good variety of meats. 
I will definitely come back to this location on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and this is the place everyone said is a must go. Came in and was confused. if your in the mood for different meats, better come with friends because they have different lines for most meats. By the time you get your food and pay, it's cold and you still have to fight for a table. Ordered a quesadilla and I got what looked like a sope, it wasn't even folded in half. This is not worth a 3 hour drive. Waste of gas and money."}
{"text":"Yes they did taste like Tijuana Tacos (it is a compliment)and yeah reminded me of TJ where one has to shout out their order and they were good but wait was about hour and a half, dinning area was too small, (psst some outside tables can help) the service  was horrible, need to hire more people, and my order was wrong. They had enough staff to clean tables and they were pretty friendly. Would come again for the yummy food but thinking about the wait makes me think twice."}
{"text":"Great find thanks to Yelp! The food was very fresh and delicious. I would highly recommend if your looking for something fast that is good and authentic. A++"}
{"text":"Best tasting tacos in america. I only wish they also had tortas for more variety. 
    
   This is the closest i've seen to mexico tacos,really love tripas and al pastor. The best."}
{"text":"Oh my f***ing god. Amazing. We tried a fries plate with two different kinds of meat on top. Plus cheese, guac, and used their Verde sauce for dipping. Sounds simple but is one of the best things I've tried in a long time. We didn't want to leave any behind on the plate. Come set roots in Miami!!! You would do really well here."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had. Service is excellent extremely clean and the mulas are yummy"}
{"text":"A really fantastic taco.  Efficient & delicious.  I've eaten at 3 of their locations.  The food here was good, but not quite on par with the El Cajon location (now closed).

I'll say this, even a mediocre Tacos el Gordo taco bests 99% of another taco.  They're my favorite taco, and I'm nearly sure they'll be yours.  I honestly wouldn't miss the chance to eat here.  It's an authentic taste of real Tijuana tacos, without the fuss (or beheading) of a boarder crossing. 

I highly recommend you hit them up, for what's likely to be the best taco you've ever had.  Start with 4... but be ready for 6+... bring your stretchy pants people."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Ordered asada tacos and fries, hit the spot! Meat was good, fries were that perfect crisp on the outside, soft on the inside and the tortillas are made fresh in front of you and makes the tacos so yummy. Went at midnight and it was packed, you have to wait in  different lines to order certain meats, but totally worth the wait. Would definitely come here again and again."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas, staff could be a little friendlier and not talk bad about me in Spanish laughing (little did they know I'm fluent) still food was awesome, still tipped, still will be back..."}
{"text":"OMG!!! By far the most authentic and delicious Mexican street tacos I've ever had in the US. My husband and I we're in Vegas visiting for the weekend and came across this taco parlor one night. They have every possible kind of meat you can think of: asada, chorizo, adobada, tripas, suadero, buche, lengua, cabeza and more! 

If you ever find yourself in Vegas, you HAVE TO check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food is really good the tacos are on point I just wished they had variety of salsas. The Carne Asada tacos are awesome but I wasn't so much into the salsa. It was not a deal breaker the tacos were great.Tortillas are made on the spot. The place is cool and people are friendly. 


I am a cachanilla I know good tacos de Carne Asada!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. I've never been to a place like this. The tacos are super authentic. The people there make everything fresh by hand. You can get in one of three of lines, depending on what kind of meat you want. The choices were excellent but if you're looking for chicken, you won't find them here. The fries were also really excellent. If you go with two people, order size small. The portion is huge."}
{"text":"the food was pretty good.. but the most outstanding thing i found about this place was the cleanliness.. wow everything was sparkling and spotless which makes your meal go down better.. the staff was tiding up the whole time i was there.. thank you"}
{"text":"Wait was a bit long, but worth the wait. Cheap prices and amazing authentic food. Get the spicy pork or asada tacos."}
{"text":"After reading fantastic reviews we went searching for this place. Great greeting, bright, clean but I was a little sad because I am a picky eater n do not eat pork or organs. I was really looking forward to chicken but alas it was not to be. Please go but be aware that if u r picky or with someone picky, might want to go elsewhere. Sorry all."}
{"text":"Best meal I have all weekend in Vegas it beats most expensive buffets"}
{"text":"The tacos el gordo off the strip is way better than this location.. sacrifice 10mins to Get there and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tacos are really good but there's a huge problem. The line just to get your tacos is chaos. Different line for each type of meat.  They need a better system where these guys can move the lines faster. Not only that to pay is a different line as well.  So food is good but there system is just not working."}
{"text":"Different lines different meats but worth the wait...al pastor tacos are some of the best I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"This is basically the spot to try. They have the best tacos beef, chicken, pork or lengua. All so yummy and tasty. There are no words to describe how flavorful the tacos are, you just need to try it to understand. Plus, it is so affordable! Skip the fast food and choose this instead. Your tastebuds will be thanking you for it."}
{"text":"I think this place even beats out old home favorite chicos tacos...ya ya the mixes in aguas is better ...and the place in Juarez is maybe a little better...but hands down best tacos in vegas"}
{"text":"I love Tacos El Gordo! Their adobada tacos are my favorite because they taste like they came from heaven (I'm positive that heaven has tacos).  The lines can be long but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Osea que onda con todos los gringos diciendo que son los mejores tacos obvio nunca han probado un taco decente! Los tacos honestamente estaban dos tres no asi de que uff que sabrosos. El servicio muy bien, menos las cajeras (con sus jetotas.)"}
{"text":"This is my fav. when craving for lengua fries and taco de tripa. But pls Yelp change the hours. They are open at 10am not 9am! Thank you"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. The food is excellent and cheap. \"Tacos al pastor\" my favorite."}
{"text":"Great little find not far from where we were staying for the week. When a place has a line up all the time it says they are doing something right. Tonight the line wasn't too bad, just up to the door.  All the tacos being served looked good. I wasn't very hungry tonight so just tried the Abados (spicy Pork) tacos and they were was delicious!  I can't wait to come back to try the others."}
{"text":"This literally is the best place to go for tacos. The tacos are about 2 bucks each. The adobada fries are the business!!! If you go before 8 the place does not get crowded. The people are friendly and they close late."}
{"text":"The Best Taco Place to Hit up in Vegas!!!!
A must stop. Very affordable and the Tacos Al Pastor is the BOMB!!! Asada Fries are also very filling. Lines and parking are a hassle.. Seating is a crap shoot also. Just be prepared to eat standing up.. hehe"}
{"text":"The workers are fast but the tacos weren't that great . The guacamole was super mussy . And the meat wasn't as seasoned as I thought . The hype about this place isn't worth it"}
{"text":"While we were staying in Las Vegas for a trip we had a craving for tacos, so my husband found this place by doing a search on urban spoon. I was a little skeptical at first because my husband has a tendency to take me to sketchy areas for food while we're traveling which usually leads to a spat because I worry something bad is going to happen to us. It was a small trek and it's a little bit off the strip, but it was well worth it.

This is hands down the best tacos I've ever had in my entire life! These were even better than the food we had while staying in Cabo. I still have cravings for this place. If this place was near us we'd be there at least once a week if not more! 

When we go back to Vegas we'll definitely make our way back here. Don't be skeptical if you're from out of town, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"good tacos - but if you want more than one type of meat, you have to get in two different lines - which is rather silly.  

The food was great - watch out if you have an avocado allergy, as they put a thin guacamole sauce on everything - but the taco was great!"}
{"text":"Came here after a buddy recommended a good taco spot. Upon arriving place was packed and super hot inside. I'm usually very impatient but my buddy swore it was wore it. 

Line went pretty quick ordered four tacos de el pastor and an order of carne asada fries. Also got a plate of grilled jalapeños and grilled green onions which were on point. Couldn't find any seating so we ate in the car. The food was on point and I'll be returning for sure!!! 

Don't leave sue to the long line the wait is worth it, trust me!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times but the food is not as good as I expected it to be. I have tried their cabeza and also their tripa dishes"}
{"text":"This place serves the best Mexican food I have ever had!  Can't skip on the Carne Asada Fries and any of their tacos!"}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant has taught me what it means to eat good Mexican food.  Tacos de adobada were my favorite.  Very friendly staff.  I didn't try any of the more exotic meats (beef head, tongue,...).  I stuck to the more traditional cuts of pork and beef in tacos.  They have horchata at the drink fountain which was my first time to try and it was very tasty. 

I will DEFINITELY revisit this place everytime I come to Vegas.  It's nowhere near where my hotel usually is, but the trip is worth it."}
{"text":"I came  here with my kids and wife yesterday. They have amazing food and the best service . Best taco restaurant in Vegas . Go check it out ."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the Adobada tacos. 
SO. GOOD. 
The  cooks are in different stations so it's not too long of a wait.
Only downside is that it gets really crowded.. But for Adobada, it's worth it. 
I'm so sad they only have 4 locations, and none in the Los Angeles area.. Boo.
Oh, and don't forget to ask for a slice of pineapple on top of your Adobada taco!
I wonder how many times I said Adobada in this post.. Adobada. Lol"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic tacos.  It's just anorth of the Encore hotel"}
{"text":"Really!! Uughhh!! Never again!! So we paid $13 for a taxi to take us to this place because according to yelp reviews these tacos are suppose to be the bomb!! Guess what!! They are crap!! My husband and I had carne asada and Al pastor tacos!! The asada has the fake grilled taste and the Al pastor did not taste like Al pastor it just had the Al Pastor color but no taste!! The tortillas are hand made but the meat that goes on top of the tortillas suck so no point in having hand made tortillas!!  Best thing there is the fountain drink!! I think all the people that say these tacos are good must go when they are drunk!! Because Everyone knows that any tacos taste delicious when your drunk!! So if your sober don't waste your time or your taxi fare!!"}
{"text":"The best Tacos I have eaten in a restaurant. Only my mom can make them better. By far the best. Taste so good, smell and look good. Lines-wait time- well that does suck but hey quality takes time right. But damn I drove two hours and waiting in line one hour and I can tell you it was worth it!!!!!! They have a customer for life. Have gone to San Diego by I-5 and to TJ MEX I love it. All places have long wait time. No matter what time of the day. There is a line waiting before they even open  but worth the wait."}
{"text":"They are delicious! We got 8 pork and beef tacos to share. We also got a couple of beef tongue tacos. My favorite is the beef tongue, I can never beyond 1 taco because it is so full of fat, I would have to pick out the fat pieces before eating it. Beef tongue was super tender.

It is crazy inside, lines everywhere, and difficult to find seating. But we still come back everytime we are in vegas."}
{"text":"My second time stopping at this business but a different location.  This time I ordered 2 Lengua Tacos, 2 Al Pasor Tacos and a small Asada Fries.  The Lengua meat was so tender and flavorful and really like the green sauce that came on the tacos. Reminded me of a place I grew up enjoying where I lived.  The Al Pastor tacos were smoky, lightly spicy and I can see why they're a local favorite.  The Asada fries were loaded with meat and the smoky flavor went really well the fries and the same green sauce an the Al Pastor tacos are on there as well.  If you're coming to Vegas and love tacos, Tacos El Gordo is a no-brainer!!"}
{"text":"Word of mouth this was a great place to eat. But, in my first experience, I thought it was over priced for 3 small tacos. The meat was mostly fat and spent a lot of time spitting that fat out in the middle of eating all 3 tacos, flavor was average. Don't believe the hype. Save your $$ . There are way too many options out there."}
{"text":"this place rocks! so many yummy tacos. come here often with my kids and my hubby. def check it out"}
{"text":"Oh yeah. Tasty and cheap and clean and the people are nice. Homemade tortillas. My favorite meal in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Food was great! The service was fabulous the cook was really nice helped me out with my entire order. The facility is clean which is great and important for this type of food.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for tacos at a reasonable price! My favorites were the tripas and buche the cabeza and lengua are also great. I highly recommend it here."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had in a long time!!!
We came here because a friend of mine highly recommended us this place.
The tacos were so juicy and the meat was really tender and fresh, that my mouth is watering right now as I am writting this review.
We had tripa, cesos, lengua and cabeza tacos and all of them were really flavorful!!
The only downside of this place is that it gets super crowded and is a big hassle to place your order, and the worst part is that if your craving one more taco you will have to line up again.
The wait was worth it though!!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos!  Other reviews don't lie.  Somewhat awkward ordering process but food awesomeness makes up for it."}
{"text":"Hands down, best tacos in town. Okay, it's possible that I'm biased as I'm from south San Diego and love Tijuana style tacos. They'e the smaller \"street\" tacos, but in my opinion, are made the way tacos are meant to be eaten.   

Because the tacos are smaller, it's advisable to order at least three -- or more if you're a hearty eater.  I, of course, recommend the carne asada tacos.  The pork adobada is also really good.  Also, try the mula; it's quesadilla meets taco.  I'm not quite sure why the carne asada french fries are $10.  In San Diego, carne asada french fries are $5, tops.  However, if you're feeling like a baller, the french fries are also an excellent option.  

The place is very casual (read: not fancy), but authentic as it comes in 
Vegas.  In short, it's well worth trying."}
{"text":"Originally had this in the bay at the hole in the wall taco truck, definitely brought all the flavor to sin city.
I would give it 5 stars, but the guacamole was so bland. 
Buche is a must"}
{"text":"I only wish I  had a Tacos El Gordo where i live. Came here last week for a family vacation.The service was very good .Very nice cooks. The Tacos adobado were fantastic!!!  Highly recomended.The asada tacos were pretty good. The tacos de lengua(tounge) were very good!!! $2.00 bucks a taco.The place was packed for lunch, I always take that as a good sign.They also sell paletas de michoacan,YUMM!!!  The rum raisin, coconut, arroz con leche(rice pudding), vanilla,& walnut. $1.00 a piece. They even roast fresh chiles & onions for you."}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot. It's delicious, clean and affordable. The lines move very fast and the quality is amazing."}
{"text":"Taste exactly like the street Tacos in Tijuana...! Especially the 'al Pastor and Carne' Asada' ones...! The $2.00 tacos are to die for...! What's only missing is the brothels, in Mexico. Lol!"}
{"text":"If you're on The Strip & down to your last $20 - or you somehow got the late-nite munchies - this is your spot. Fresh, authentic grub in a super casual setting. Food is made to order in front of your eyes & the crowd is mostly from the country of origin - always a good sign, right?"}
{"text":"Tried the adobada fries for the first time and it was amazing! Service was fast and the workers were nice and friendly. I took my order to go since it was packed for a Sunday. Highly recommended if you want to grab a quick and cheap eat!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to slow down a little after their opening and it was well worth the wait. I used to go to the location on Charleston so I'm glad the one in North side has finally opened up! I usually get the adobada fries and man, were they good! The spicy pork was so delicious especially with the green sauce on top of my fries. The only thing that bugged me was that this location doesn't give you as much fries as the other location. Other than that, I will frequent this place more for the adobada! Yum!"}
{"text":"The kitchen is sparking and the tacos are authentic! They have tacos adobadas, asadas, de lengua, cabeza, suche and more! We always come here when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best taco!! We hit this joint at least 2x every visit.  Don't forget their location in Chula Vista near SD Zoo.

Keep in mind they have separate lines depending on the type of meat that you want. SOMETIMES they will be nice enough to bend the rule and get you the meat from the other lines but most of the time...forget it!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing but their system for ordering is severely flawed. I stood in line for  45 minutes for tacos. Good tacos! But tacos nonetheless. And you can only order the type of tacos that each particular one is for. So if you want the asada AND the adobada then you'll have to wait in line again to get those."}
{"text":"This place is SO amazing!! Get the pork tacos? They are $2 a piece and are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Taquerías ! Carne Asada , Quesadilla De Lengua and Tacos al pastore"}
{"text":"This Was a Great Place to eat was very Busy But Worth the wait sev was Great Food was Outstanding I would Eat There Again I Had the fries with steak and sliced pork cheese sour cream and all the fixings."}
{"text":"As usual, I'm a fan of Tacos El Gordo.  This location is a bit smaller than the Charleston location.  Also, the parking is kind of a pain and in a shady shopping center complex.  Even so, it's a great spot for Mexican food and they're open late.

There's two lines to order, one for asada and one for the other meats, like adobada.  Make sure you get in the right line.  If you're unsure, ask the cashier to the right upon entry.  

Don't forget to ask for the grilled green onions (cebollitas) and yellow peppers (chile gueritos) with your tacos to have an authentic Tijuana experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a late night date after a movie and OMG!!!! The carne asada tacos changed my life. Can't wait to go back, I just wish it was closer to my house!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the the location in las vegas and compare it to the one in phoenix there is a difference. The tortillas are different. The meat is the same. The al pastor is amazing I really recommend the al pastor tacos. It's still really good."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap open till 5 am yum we went everyday in Vegas it had a bit of a line but it goes fast the food is great yum"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos, I liked that tortillas were homemade, it's kinda hectic in here, pretty loud however the staff was very nice and the service was super fast especially the cooks behind the counters were incredibly fast preparing orders. I tried the crane asada tacos only so I can't say much about the rest of their food."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Vegas period. Always packed and can be a little confusing for first timers as hordes of people seem to be haphazardly standing in random locations but fear not there is an order to the madness. There are different lines for each of the different meats. I'd say the hectic atmosphere even adds to the charm of this place. Great place to end a drunken night or grab a cheap but delicious bite. Order the Pastor with pineapple!"}
{"text":"awesome! Tijuana style tacos in Vegas, I thought I was dreaming when I saw the sign. So refreshing after days of expensive mediocre food and buffets with taco-bell style Mexican food (WTF???)

fresh made corn tortillas....grilled onions and peppers...amazing grilled meats and salsas. That's all you need."}
{"text":"Adobada fries are a must try! 
The tacos are delicious and the service is quick.
Clean dining area even during busy hours. I don't tho k I have ever entered this place when it's empty. So if the have many people eating here it must be good right!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic Mexican meal you can get in Vegas at a good price. After you order your first round of tacos you'll be going back for round two. Tacos El Gordo rivals anything I've had in So Cal the Mecca of authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Came to vegas for 2 days and came here 2 times they are just a bit unorganized so many lines and everyone and their moma is all over the place but food wise one of the best taquerias in vegas"}
{"text":"The best steak tacos and tostadas that I ever had. I purchase 5 because I was very hungry, they are about $2 each. A good tip: If you go with somebody, one should make the line and the other one should find a table. Because this place is always full, that way when the order is ready, both have a place to sit and eat.  Great place to eat real mexican food. Absolutely Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Can I just say something? THESE ARE THE BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER TASTED!! My love for this tacos is humongous lol! I'm serious though this place is my first stop when I get to Vegas. 

I think the Adobada(spicy pork) tacos are the best ones! I kid you not I eat like 5 of these ! Haha anyways their fries are really good too! This place is good & it's cheap!! At first if you're unfamiliar with this place everything is going to be confusing! They have 3 separate lines for different kinds of food. Anyways this place is amazing & I recommend it (: !"}
{"text":"Not the best tacos.  For the drive off the strip i would expect better. If your drunk you'll probably think there the best thing in the world.  Too much hype,  too long of lines,  too crowded."}
{"text":"I personally don't like this place. I've been to a place where the meat is top notch quality and  has no nerves so this place doesn't really stand up."}
{"text":"Straight to the point..long wait time.. tacos were too simple. I would expect a Mexican place to provide salsas but didn't receive any even though we asked them to.. we had our order to go so we were stuck eating plain tacos with just simple guacamole. I only ate a taco of al pastor because their asada sucks in flavor. Disappointing by first impression."}
{"text":"Second visit to Vegas, and this is the first place we went back to.  It's awesome!  Must try the VAMPIRO, a tostada with cheese and special salsa. Love this place."}
{"text":"There are a lot of wild things that we couldn't translate on the menu.  We played it safe and went with spicy pork tacos and a beef taco and tostada which were great.  Next time we will be more adventurous and order a bunch of items."}
{"text":"Taco heaven.  Eat tacos like a Mexican.  You must get the al pastor tacos (shwarma style spinning meat thingy).  Go stand in usually the biggest line because thats where the good stuff is at.  Skip the asada (this ain't amateur hour). Then go see the lady about some roasted chili peppers and green onions.  Get yourself some limes, radishes, and an horchata.  Sit down and indulge in the best tacos in Las Vegas.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"If there's a taco place that gets me every time-- it's Tacos el Gordo!! I love this place with a passion and would recommend it to anyone who was in town.
  
Hands down best tacos ever! And my tummy always agrees :) 

If you're new here the spicy pork tacos are a must!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat tacos in San Diego, the quality of the food at this Vegas location is not the same.  The sauce used on the adobada tacos lacks flavor, the meat is cut into small cubes vs strips like in San Diego. The  tortillas are cold.  This place is just too busy, I think it suffers because of that. If you are craving an OK taco, then this place will do just fine.  The wait is not worth the taste."}
{"text":"Wow! We love $2 tacos. Good selection of meats.  We had the asada and spicy pork, with a side of the grilled peppers. 

Tip - each type of meat has its own line. So, don't stand in the lengua/tripe line if you want spicy pork. 

I had three tacos but should've had five. :-)

This place is a huge bonus to staying at the Wynn/Encore. It is literally across the street."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos. Straight from the grill. I am Mexican and this has been the most closest tacos from Mexico.  Must try!  Will not be disappointed.  Tip: there is no actual line to order.  Proceed to grill stations and order.  Unless you have people waiting. Sometimes cook will just nod so you can order. But ENJOY!"}
{"text":"tacos , quesadillas and OMG! to the al pastor mulitas, place was Bomb lol no lie not just any tacos lol and prices are good"}
{"text":"These tacos are as good as it gets to an actual street taco from across the border.  The adobada are my favorites, whether in a taco, quesadilla, mula, or fries. 

Late night on the strip, after a long day of walking, partying, and gambling, this place hits the spot like no other. 

The variety of meats are great, more than the typical carne asada or carnitas option. Suadero, tripas, or buche are something worth trying along with cabeza and  lengua.  

Due to the variety, there are 3 lines to choose from and during peak times, which is all the time I've gone with a line out the door and a security guard controlling entry due to fire code, you cannot order from another line without getting in it at the end. Meaning, if I order adobada and want asada I have to get in that line then get in the suadero line if I feel like trying those, in the meantime and 45 min later my tray with tacos is getting cold. 

The 3 lines are the carne asada & chorizo line, the adobada line, and the everything else or sweetbread line.  The security guard is also well versed on all the meat options and she will point you in the right direction. 

My gripe is that due to the same variety, the system of ordering from possibly 3 different lines then paying at a different line before you sit and eat is archaic. With so many people crowding to order and being limited to order from a single variety is not a good business model. It's a simple fix from my p.o.v. - order and pay at a counter, then pick up when ready. Or, do the Subway/Chipotle/Pieology method and just move on down the line and order any cut of meat you'd like and skip the ones you don't. There just has to be a better way is all I'm saying and with that many people paying, the resources should be there to give the customers better service. 

I try and get here every time I come to Vegas, and I'm sure under normal circumstances you would be able to order anything you'd like. But since this place is so good and so crowded, ordering from the 3 lines of meats is not practical, hampering the experience."}
{"text":"Pastor Tacos are AWESOME here. Well worth the wait!!! We look forward to coming here when on Vegas."}
{"text":"Really good taco place for vegas. A little wait since it's always packed. But the food is amazing and the staff is very friendly. You first have to make a line to get your food and then make another line to pay for it. But it is definitely worth every minute. The price is pretty decent for being on the strip, with 10-15 dollars you'll leave really satisfied."}
{"text":"Their Food (Carne Asada Tacos & Campechana  Fries) Was Delicious, It was freezing and both entrances were open and blowing wind, our food was cold. You could see that it was freezing yet no one offered to close one entrance, the cashiers wore their jackets, too. Try to go to this place when it is not  freezing cold maybe during summer hours."}
{"text":"This is where I fell in love with authentic tacos and the fries are heavenly. If you are visiting Vegas this is a great place to eat but be ready for a line. It was around 2 in the morning Vegas time and my husband and I had to wait an hour in line to get to our food. It was nice getting to know people in the process. Lots of locals. Total Dive. Get the tacos and the fries. The prices are phenomenal as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The asada tacos, spicy pork tacos, and asada fries were all really good. The lines for food were long even at midnight but it was worth the wait.  We knew the food would be good when we saw a lady making tortillas on the spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor, fast cutting cooks, but long lines. Strategy in standing in line will help speed up the process. Must try when in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Awesome place, they keep it very clean, the food was too good for words, they are cleaning nonstop, wow what a place!"}
{"text":"I love tacos and fries, and this place knows how to do tacos and fries. My favorite meat is the marinated pork adobada (which I still can't pronounce), and I get that with everything. Their portions are ginormous, esp with their fries; guacamole, cheese, sour cream, pork adobada, mhmmm. It's all there. Their tacos are crafted to perfection and omg, I crave the tacos from this place 24/7. T_T

This place is also extremely busy at night, and I'm not fond of their ordering system at all. There are lines for different types of meats, and that prevents me from trying other meats. Regardless, I'm still satisfied coming here just for the pork adobada fries and tacos!"}
{"text":"On the strip next to the Wynn. This is the real deal. I wanted to keep ordering more tacos. My wife and I tried 5 different tacos and loved each one. Then we went back for more. Great price. Great location. Great food. Why pay for the buffet when this place is on the strip?"}
{"text":"Ok I went based on yelp reviews. Interesting place tacos were very good but small don't let that cheap price fool you. Very casual.  For what it is I guess it is ok.  To me unexciting."}
{"text":"The tacos are great but the system sucks big time. You have to wait in three different lines if you want three different types of tacos and don't get me started if it's a Friday! C'mon people, modernize and make it one line for everything! 3 stars is all I can give you guys until you change your system."}
{"text":"If you're ever in Vegas you need to check the spot out best tacos on the strip very good service these people really were card everything is great here I love the food very close walk from the Wynn Hotel and very very affordable"}
{"text":"delicious \"Carne Asada\" you can ever tray in Vegas, I'ii find the way to go back soon"}
{"text":"This one star is because if how I was treated there. After walking in the heat with a group of friends we stopped in for food. No air conditioning!! Just hot air blowing, and in Vegas this isn't a good thing. 

I started to feel very lightheaded waiting for a log time in the huge crowd to order. There was no drinking fountain in site and I had to ask three people for a cup of water, because I could feel that I was going to pass out. They said they were out and I asked if they had ANYTHING to put water in, a lid, a chip tray, and they said no, and refused me anything even though I told them I was going to pass out and saw a stack of cups behind the counter. 

I found a chip tray and drank from the fountain drinks water tap. By then it was kind of too late. I had to find a seat and try to chill out because I was on the verge of blacking out, my vision was blurry. So, never going back."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos made to order. Clean establishment, Friendly. This really taste like the real deal from Mexico. A bit confusing to order but once they are pretty quick."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off!!! $2.25 for a small taco which the meat is undercooked. Not worth it. Not to mention a guy threw up in front of everyone in the middle of the restaurant and the employees just looked at it for 8 mins deciding what to do. They didn't know what to do. They left the puke out for everyone to see. Everyone lost their appetite. Worst place ever. Oh yeah, all they give you is 2 little cheap napkins for all the food they give you. Very cheap place. Don't go.."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious.... carne asada quesadillas... yum! One of those local spots not frequented by tourist... but delicious... a 3 am snack"}
{"text":"Algo cambio en el sabor antes eran más buenos tienen mucha grasa y se te enfrían por haser filas en un lado y otro  y además no hay lugar y tienes k esperar"}
{"text":"I ordered one ado ads, two lengua, one casa asada with piña colada drink cost only $10.27. Excellent food and I went at 11:45am, it has no line."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise!! My wife and I visit Las Vegas quite frequently and had decided to try a new place to eat that was recommended to her by a work colleague. However, she could not remember the name...only the general location. While walking on the strip looking for this particular eatery (which turned out to be the Peppermill that was a block up), we stumbled across Tacos El Gordo. A small hole in the wall place in front of a strip mall. The aroma of carne that filled the air and the amount of people that were going in and coming out immediately caught our attention. Since we were unable to find our original destination, we contemplated whether or not we should try this place. We were a little skeptical at first, not knowing what to expect since its surroundings were a far cry from the Wynn/Encore where we had just come from. But my wife had checked on Yelp and surprisingly it got great reviews, so we figured what the heck! And boy, did it not disappoint!! My wife had gotten the soft tacos and I had the sopes. I could not believe my taste buds after the first bite! Amazing!! Mind you, I know Mexican food from my background and where I live, and this is the real deal. This is authentic, not gringo Mexican that you would think would be on the Las Vegas strip. Plus they have a variety of taco meats to choose from. And the prices? Extremely reasonable...a couple of bucks each. It was so good and inexpensive, we took my parents and and their local friends days later and they also agreed...delicious cheap eats!

This is definitely one of our new \"go-to\" places when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Super good tacos and low prices!  Had a carne asada, adobada and El pastor tacos!  Love this place."}
{"text":"If you have a local taco stand, they are probably just as good. At least you wont have to wait in multiple lines for 40+ minutes for 3 tacos (and that is if you picked the right line). It's good food, but not memorable for the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"So, I had to come to Vegas to discover a restaurant that is also in San Diego!!!  Found this place mentioned as a top choice on several websites, especially when researching the best cheap eats in Vegas.  Granted, they are not necessarily cheap for street tacos ($2 to $3), but compared to prices in Vegas as a whole, Tacos el Gordo is a bargain!  During a lunch break during a business conference at the LV Convention Center, my friend and I came here.  Expecting huge lines, we prepared for a long wait, but it turned out that lunch time is a pretty good time to visit.  According to my friend, the lines are absolutely huge during the late night hours, after the clubs get out.  Anyway, I ordered two of their famous spicy pork tacos, one beef shoulder taco, and, because I wanted to be adventurous, one beef brain taco.  I had each one \"with everything\" and all of them were delicious!  Without a doubt, the two pork tacos were the absolute best...sweet, savory, spicy...full of flavor!  The beef shoulder was excellent to, a bit stringy, but overall very tasty.  The brain taco was...interesting.  With all of the accompanying toppings, it was very tasty, but it was the texture that was the most different.  Creamy is probably the best word to describe it.  Would I order one again?  Probably not, but I am very glad that I tried it.  Was it filling?  After eating my four tacos, I felt thoroughly satisfied.  I was by no means full, but happily fed (for about $10 mind you) and looking forward to a future visit.  

When in Vegas, I will visit again and now that I know that they are also in my home town, I will be making a drive down there soon as well!"}
{"text":"Great food that was worth waiting for! Long lines but tables continually becoming available so there was somewhere to sit. The chefs are fascinating to watch!
Don't go here for a romantic dinner as seating is mainly outside on the pavement - more of an eat and go place than somewhere to linger. However for great food at a great price this is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. First time here and a worker says if you have any questions to ask. Food is yummy. Love their tacos."}
{"text":"The tacos are authentic and delicious. I am staying at the palazzo so it is a short walk, and totally worth it. It is actually nice to be able to walk of the food coma induced by inhaling 8 tacos. Adobada taco is my favorite but asada tacos are great too."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had! Al pastor is amazing! Cooks are great! Fast and friendly but I can't say the same for the cashiers. They are not friendly and not helpful but I still eat here anyways cause I usually don't go back to a place if the whole staff isn't friendly but the cooks make up for it. Also the place is very clean. A must if you like street tacos!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. I've been to numerous taco shops and Mexican restaurants and no one has compared to these tacos. The way their marinate their food is what makes the difference in their meats. If you love tacos, carne and adobdo this is the place to go. Don't miss out!!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious and cheap 
Staff is Friendly, 
Definitely worth it and the place is clean"}
{"text":"What to say. Absolutely the best tacos I have come across in entire east coast. Prices are on wallet friemdly side. Must recommended for anyone vsiting vegas and is on a budget. Forget the buffets."}
{"text":"Overrated!  The taste is good I do not like their lay out an their customer service needs more training.  Not my type of tacos or environment."}
{"text":"Best tacos in The USA! Cleanest facility I have ever visited. Soooo busy that it blows my mind. Well worth the wait! Everyone needs to eat at Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries!!! Yummy!!! Wait everything is good here.. Went in March when we got married and that's our 1 reason we wanna go to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"yummy yummy and more yummy...probably the best mexican food i've ever had...i would recommend everyone who loves mexican definitely check this place out...from a quck glance it seems like any other fast food place but as soon as you taste it it's a different story altogether...it almost has a gourmet flair to it.  I will be coming here again very soon!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but after waiting in line for one hour and I ordered a bunch of stuff, I was very disappointed with the taste. With all the people there I was expecting some amazing tacos, but honestly they were the worst tacos I have ever had. 

The service was amazing and the staff was very friendly but I will never go back"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is the spot . Best tacos in Vegas! It's like they brought  TJ to the strip ! If anyone thinks other wise they must not know what a Great taco taste like. It might be alittle confusing to order and the wait might be long but I'm telling you it's well worth it . Oh and make sure to tip the cook if you want some extra meat! It works every time ."}
{"text":"Went there on Monday 12/1 was closed....
Red tent taped off with yellow tape. Anyone know what happened?...love this place was looking forward to having lunch there..."}
{"text":"Great straight forward Mexican street vendor style food. Nice salsa, good meats (spicy pork-awesome!) and super cheap. This will be a staple everytime I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and authentic I love coming here the only downside is it's a very limited variety in options it is not a Mexican resturant with rice and beans it's a taco shop but definitely a place you have to try once every time I go I get al pastor anything"}
{"text":"I legit love this place!  It's definitely a go to spot after a night of partying.  I ALWAYS order a couple of the Spicy Pork tacos which I think is the best type of meat they serve.  Their Spicy Pork fries are also a great choice, but I will suggest ordering half of a full size order because even their half size fries can feed about 2-3 people.  They also provide grilled peppers and green onions for free and they go great with just about anything you're eating at the place.  

This place definitely is the best taco place in town!"}
{"text":"Craving TJ style tacos at 4 AM while on the Vegas strip?  This is the place to be for your taco craving in the City of Sin.  Finally, I found a place in Vegas who serves street tacos and is open after a night of drunken bliss.  We stumbled into there about 4 AM and saw the line pouring outside the door on a Saturday night/Sunday morning.  A crowd mainly comprised of Latin descent and a good mixture of other cultures was a clear indication that this was the place to be for authentic street tacos.  

READ THIS PORTION CAREFULLY!!!!!

Okay so when you make your approach to the restaurant you need to determine what kind of tacos you want.  From what I remember (I was pretty inebriated), there were three UNIDENTIFIED lines.  Starting from the left as you face the kitchen, line #1 consisted of the carne asada line.  You tell your order to the taco chef but be aware that the designated lines represent the specific type of meat you want on your food.  Line #2 is the adobada line, and #3 is the tripas and cabeza line.  There were other types of meats but I can't remember which line you can get them at.

So if you are a taco eating machine like myself, you want to try all the meats strictly for the purposes of providing fellow yelpers a true, well educated opinion on the good and the bad of services provided to the general public, more specifically an educated opinion from me regarding street tacos.  Not to nurse your future hangover in Vegas, because hangovers NEVER happen in the City of Sin.  

Unless you only want one type of meat on your tacos, be sure to tacticallly plan your approach to the taco masters and be sure you are in the right line.  Unfortunately we learned the hard way and did not split our resources to different lines.  We ordered the asada tacos and had to fall in the tripas line to score my tripas, cabeza, and adobada  taco fix.  I wasn't  going to fall in the herrendous adobada line, so I worked smarter not harder and had someone much better looking than me who wore heels and had bigger and better goods for these taco guys to look at than my taco eating mug place the adobada taco order even though she was in the tripas line.  Apparently it worked because we scored what we wanted.  Till next time Tacos El Gordo.....We shall meet again and hopefully I won't have to resort to the egotistical motto that women always get what they want and how men use them."}
{"text":"There street tacos are super good. I could eat like 6-8 though before I am full! So they add up price wise. Really good al pastor! Right up there with taco y taco as the best two Mexican joints around."}
{"text":"Best tacos for your buck hands down but be aggressive  seating is limited due to how many people are there."}
{"text":"I tried 5 different types of tacos:
Beef head, tripe, spicy pork, tongue, chorizo

Beef head had a very Offal taste to it.  Enjoyed the tripe, was surprisingly tender and didn't have that offal taste.  Spicy pork, not really spicy, chorizo was good, not as oily as some other chorizos that i had tried..  For condiments, they had lime, radish, and salsa.

I would eat here again.  Tacos are good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic mexican tacos Baja  California style this place is definitely where you want to eat."}
{"text":"They live by their famous name I guess, food is not that great, expensive and the herdez salsa they use doesn't help much, make sure you ask your tacos without onions and cilantro otherwise you will not get much meat on them"}
{"text":"Amazinggggg food!

My favorite thing to get is the Carne Asada Fries. Literally, so delicious."}
{"text":"07/08/16 Del 1 al 10 le doy un uno en atencion al cliente Este Jueves fui al que esta locaalizado en la Charleston de las Vegas primero para ordenar tienes que hacer linea dependiendo lo que deseas comer
, hay una linea para dos o tres diferentes carnes,despues de 10 minutos en linea ordenando tienes que volver a hacer linea otra ves para pagar, ya para ese tiempo los tacos ya se enfriaron,el precio es de $2.25 plus tax cada taco con todo medidito,servilletas,salsa , luego tienes que buscar mesa para comer,despues de todo esto probablemente te van a ir a preguntar a la mesa si ya pagaste lo que estas comiendo, a mi me paso.llego la de de el aseo y me pregunta pago los dos ultimo tacos que ordeno? Le dije que si y me pregunto por el recivo cosa que me molesto y fui a hablar con la cajera y me dijo esta bien haci dejelo como diciendo si no pago esta bien al fin ya se los comio y no quiso ver el recivo le dije que queria hablar con el Mgr. Me dijo que no habia nadie en ese momento y que les hablara por telefono y que les dije ra todo lo que yo quisiera que al fin a ella no.le importaba la verdad no regreso jamas arruinaron la cena de 8 personas"}
{"text":"In a place where it's rare to find decent Mexican food (being a chef too) we are always surprised about the poor quality of the offerings here, plus if you add the 33% Mexican population, it's incredible! But for a little taste of home (unless you know how to cook and make it at home like we do) this is it."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating dinner at gordos tacos...it was really busy...it smelled so good when I walked it.  I saw the pastor being freshly cut off... And the tortillas were all being hand made and thrown right on the grill and then immediately filled with the fresh meats...I tried them ALL...pastor, chorizo, chicken, carne asada, it was all delicious...I didn't understand why the fry plate was but later when I saw people eating it I wanted to try that too!  I will get that next time!"}
{"text":"best carne asada fries!!!!! we have to stop here every trip to vegas tons of meat and cheese and not pricey for the amount easily enough for two ppl with leftovers and they let u take beer inside"}
{"text":"Been here a few times to date and it has yet to disappoint. Granted the tacos aren't as cheap as the ones in LA, the portions are bigger with loaded guacamole on top. You can also get the grilled peppers on the side for free, which is nice. 

I normally stick with asada, lengua, and cabeza tacos, but last time they were out of lengua at 430am. Their Asada fries are pretty delicious as well. The best part about this place is probably the unlimited horchata and orange bang fountain drinks.. So good! 

The place gets pretty packed in the wee hours after everyone leaves the club. It's within walking distance of Wynn/encore, so if you go to any of the clubs there, go to gordos after!"}
{"text":"When you're in Vegas !! Must Try Tacos el Gordo!

The BEST Mexican Food ever!! 

Everything Fresh & made to Order: tacos, quesadillas, vampiros, etc.
Cheap Eats $2 Tacos $4 Quesadillas/Vampiros

Next time I'm in Town~  I will Definitely  Eat Here Again!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested Tacos El Gordo when I mentioned Las Vegas so I came on yelp to check out the reviews. I read that the wait was crazy long. We were here the first week of May and not sure if this is a slow month for Vegas in general but we walked right into Tacos El Gordo and there wasn't a line- both times we went. It was great! I was expecting at least a 20 min wait. I love lengua in general so of course that's what I ordered and it was delicious. My husband ordered carne Asada and he loved it. We came back again for lunch the next day. I would eat here everyday if I could. Don't forget the horchata drink for just $1.50!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The sesos, lengua, tripa are a few of my favorites. So glad they opened up this place near my work."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm extremely disappointed! I ordered a quesadilla but apparently they don't know what a quesadilla is or how it's made. I received a taco with cheese. The tortilla is the same size of their tacos. I'm from Los Angeles and to all my fellow Angelenos don't WASTE your time and money here. Remember you are here to enjoy yourself and if you come here or to one of these places expecting a quesadilla you will be fooled and scammed into paying for something you did not order. When I told the cashier about it let's just say, \"then you wonder why they call you a b!\" Never again!"}
{"text":"This is THE place for delicious and amazingly cheap tacos. While we were in line for a while, it was fun to watch them make the tacos and gave us time to figure out what to get from their surprisingly extensive menu.

Highly recommended - some of the best tacos I've ever had - definitely the best for the price. SO YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"This is one the worst restaurants ever came across. I have to get on separate lines just to order my food it literally took me an 1 1/2 hrs to get my food and then to eat my food with my family they were already done eating and my food was cold . This place needs to get more organized and have better communication. I was just visting ,not coming back again ... Ps I rather not give them no stars but it doesn't let me"}
{"text":"As others have said, the ordering process here is just WEIRD.  Awkward and really inefficient.  That.... and the fact that their tiny street tacos cost almost 3 bucks a piece.... is what earns this place 2-stars in my book.  The tacos taste good and seem very fresh, but just not worth the price or the experience!"}
{"text":"This taco spot is OVER rated , its the only REAL mexican taco spot on the strip so i get why , the food is good but not the best ! My experience here WAS COMPLETELY HORRIBLE that security  of yours was being RUDE to everyone who was trying to find a table INCLUDING ME she made a scene being loud and obnoxious when not needed she was VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and threatened to  go \"86 on yo ass\" to a customer who was simply trying to walk in the gate and be seated IS THAT A THREAT???  And when the whole scene was over she was STILL talking about the problem to OTHER CUSTOMERS GET RID OF YOUR SECURITY!!!!!!! She ruined my dinner and couldnt even enjoy my food !!!"}
{"text":"I usually eat at this place every single time I go to San Diego, so naturally in comparison it's not as good. But amongst other taco places in Vegas, it's still super good. Only problem is the workers are super slow most of the times that I've gone, inefficient and all over the place. One guy was super rude as he was making the taco. Almost made you want to walk away. But if you catch them on the good day, it's really worth it, and good prices too!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass tacos!!!! I personally love the spicy adobada....carne asada was a little salty but still delicious!! Come here u wont regret it"}
{"text":"Best value on the strip. The fries can't be beat. The large order is probably too much for your average person."}
{"text":"Tacos not as big as presumed. But the tortillas are amazingly fresh and they are packed with filling and toppings. Disappointed they didn't have a pollo taco. But asada good."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  I used to think I would never find tacos like this outside of Tijuana. I first tried Tacos el Gordo in San Diego and now this is a MUST stop in every trip to Vegas.  

My favorite tacos are the al pastor and their quesadillas are to die for (I get just cheese on a corn tortilla).

Thank you Tacos el Gordo for making my taco dreams come true!"}
{"text":"Buzzed or walking the strip drunk? tacos el gordo is the place to go for a late night craving. All the times I have gone (weekday or weekend) they have been busy. This hole in the wall offers indoor and outdoor seating. They have one of the top street tacos in Vegas. Its located right off the side of circus circus and the wynn. 

The tacos are $2 a piece and are loaded with meat, salsa, cilantro onions and possibly pineapple if you get the pastor tacos. They also ask if you would like grilled onions and jalapenos on the side. The lines are quick and the cooks don't waste time standing around, if your not ready to order move aside. The roasted and marinating meat are waiting to be chowed down on."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype...Had the adobada fries...was pretty good...Tacos were excellent. Grilled onions and jalapenos are on the house. If you don't mind driving in the hood for a great taco this is the place. Probably better to go during the day if your not a local or ____."}
{"text":"I ordered asada tacos. The guacamole was good they need to cut the meat more it was to big also they put the onions in big pieces."}
{"text":"Never had Tacos El Gordo until my friend took me. WOW. Most outstanding pastór I've ever had. The pineapple on top of the taco. The quesadilla so deep into the tortilla was tremendous. Can't believe I've never had it until now. MUST try this location & their food! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The Al Pastor tacos here are arguably the best I've ever had and the salsa just made it that much better the carne asada tacos were ehhh but I will definitely come back whenever I'm in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"YES the lines are long but what do you expect when these tacos are delicious!?
Yay for Vegas to have some GREAT QUALITY TACOS!
Taco Bell/Del Taco/ Robertos aint got nothing on this place!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Real authentic Mexican food. The tacos are small but they really pile up on meat and toppings. Hard to find a seat after you order but understandable for it being such a busy place all the time."}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing. Push your abuela's tamales and your tia's frijoles to the side and leave the house and drive here. This place makes the best tacos in Las Vegas. The line proves it, but don't let the line scare you. The folks in the kitchen are chopping away at stacks of sizzling taco meats and fresh veggies at lightning speed and it always moves quickly. Do yourself a favor and show up hungry, ready, and unafraid to read a spanish menu. If you can't understand what it is you're about to order, that's when you know you're gonna get some legit food."}
{"text":"Crowded like the border. That's when you know this place is really good. Can't go wrong with anything. If you are new to this place then I would recommend adobado. 4 stars because there arent enough tables."}
{"text":"They have started jacking up the price....but still the best adobada tacos I have ever had.  Always worth a visit any time I come through Downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I do love me tacos and thank goodness this spot is not far off the strip.  its actually on the Strip!!! I can stumble my drunk ass over there from the Wynn casino.  If you go ne time pass 9p there will be a long ass line guaranteed.   I came here cuz my friend suggested it and thank goodness I did.   tacos go about $2 ea.  There are 3 different lines for certain meats so pay attention to the line your in.  people on yelp talk about the spicy pork but I suggest the cabeza and Tripas.   yeeeeeeeah boy were they good.  The two tortillas can't hold all the meat they pile on there!  Grab ur soda from the souvenir store next door and grab some tacos.  U will not leave hungry. you can put your $ on that."}
{"text":"Love it!, no need to say more. Everything on the menu is good but if you're coming here try something different and don't go for boring carne Asada just saying.:-)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Tacos in all of California! Would recommend the Mula de  adobada!! If you come to Vegas you have to try this place"}
{"text":"Good tacos but quality can be hit or miss depending on how busy they are. Be warned, they're always busy. The price for each taco is a little high but they're definitely worth it. The only disappointing thing for me was their steak tacos, they  weren't as good as the others. I've yet to try their carne asada fries but that's next on the list."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good reviews about this place I decided to make a trip towards downtown and check out these tacos. 

This place is a Tijuana based chain so I knew this place was going to be authentic. As you first walk in you immediately see the boiling baths of meat and the rotating pork stack for the tacos al pastor. This place reminded me of my early days of partying in Tijuana and finding taco vendors on the street.  

The ordering system was a little confusing but the guys behind the counter were helpful to clear up the confusion. Each station has designated meats to choose from so you line up behind the station of your choice of meat. Me being the adventurous eater we decided on three meats, Cabeza (cow head), Lengua (cow tongue), and Tripas (tripe). Each taco is served on freshly made corn tortillas with cilantro, onions and salsa. 

The cabeza and the legua were cooked to perfection, so tender they melt in your mouth. My favorite was the Tripas which were deep fried which gave it a rich fatty taste. MMMMMM soooo goooood!! I had a total of four tacos but could of went for more. 

Tacos El Gordo is one of the best taco spots here in Vegas. So if you ever find yourself downtown or looking for some good grub after a late night of drinking head over to Tacos El Gordo for some authentic Mexican street tacos."}
{"text":"The place was full of people. Staff was friendly. My wife end up with diarrhea after eating there for 3 days. That was all we ate since the morning so couldnt had been breakfast. Im not sure of other peoples experience but ours wasnt the best."}
{"text":"This place has amazing tacos, but there are definitely pros and cons you should know before you come...

PROS: the tacos are absolutely incredible and the reason for the 5-star review. They are also cheap! 

CONS: the ordering system can be flawed, especially if you go alone. The line to order is generally out the door, and you are separated into different lines as you get closer depending on the meat you want. If you want two different types of meat, you must line up TWICE at different stations to get your tacos. Then you line up again to pay. This whole process took my partner 20 mins from when he was served the first taco. Needless to say it was cold by the time he sat down to eat. Bring a friend if you want the process to go smoothly so you can wait in separate lines!"}
{"text":"Best place for taco great customer service teal traditional food from Tijuana best hands dow tacos in vegas"}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food. You have to order at different stations which was really frustrating for someone wanting a bunch of different options. The prices are extremely low and really affordable for lunch. I felt incredibly ill after eating it. If you have an iron stomach, you can handle it."}
{"text":"Best Al Pastor in Vegas. Thank god I live 5 min away. 4 tacos and a HORCHATA please...."}
{"text":"Very good tacos. Took the walk down to it and it was worth it. Not expensive. No wait time.  Just wish I had found this sooner."}
{"text":"ALWAYS A MUST FOR EVERY VISIT TO SIN CITY.  I cant leave without having these baja tacos.  The Al Pastor BEST EVER! With the spcial guacamole sauce.  The. you have the mulitas Aaaaamazing! You have to try one of each to see which you love the most!  Whichever you select YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.  On the downside the prices are a bit hi for tacos But they are so good it wont even matter!"}
{"text":"Busy place even for lunch but the tacos are cheap and really good!

Most tacos are $ 2.

As you get in the door:
1. Spot what you want on the boards
2. Line up according to what you prefer
3. Pay the food & drinks (they'll give you a refillable cup)
4. Get drinks and condiments
5. Enjoy your meal

Repeat if you're still hungry :)"}
{"text":"Wow. That is all I can say....

Tacos El Gordo will knock your taste buds into an all out Mexican frenzy of goodness! If you want the best taco, get in line for the spicy pork that is freshly shaved off of the skewer. They top it with cilantro, onion, and a creamy cilantro sauce, and also pineapple if you choose--it is heaven in your mouth...seriously! My boss shared the news about this place and I have taken my whole family now! The carne asada is really good too--a little on the spicy side, but still great. It has guacamole, onion, cilantro, and a red sauce. The best part is that you can taste the flame grill on the carne asada!

I promise if you go to Tacos El Gordo, you will not regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Highly recommend it.

You can't get every item in every line - you have to stand in line for the type of meat you want.  Clearly labeled with signs, so not hard to figure out."}
{"text":"went to vegas for the weekend found this great taco place the tacos and mulitas were so delicious my new taco spot when  I come to vegas!!"}
{"text":"Service was fast no line no wait.... but the flavor was all bad!!!  Pepe's tacos is way better! !"}
{"text":"This joint is amazing. I ordered 8 tacos and a drink for $19. I ordered beef tongue, pork stomach, asada, and pastor. I have to say the ingredients are fresh and service was fast and friendly. Also you can BYOB. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great tasting tacos al pastor, tripas and asada a lil.pricey but gotta be realistic there on the strip will be back next time im in town..."}
{"text":"Places like this need to be all around the city. Everything was great ! The food was cooked fresh, the staff has a good attitude."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Too bad they don't sell burritos."}
{"text":"Must be some good tacos.. Their ordering service is kinda weird...different line for different tacos then you pay. Order them to go when they are busy cause they will get cold."}
{"text":"No calla te!!!  Tacos el gordo, when ever passing through Vegas we always stop here, get some tacos a Mexican Coke in the botella and let's go!!! Try the \"vampiro\", it's basically what you get in a taco but with cheese in between to tostadas.  Pastor is one of the best I've tried and I have tried many!  The green salsa is excellent and the tacos de tripa are also a must, order it!
I would have gave them 5 stars but seems like you have to check your order when ever your there or they will throw in a few tacos that you didn't order!  Watch out man food is good but if your not careful you will be paying for some extra tacos you didn't enjoy, I'm just saying check your receipt!!!!  Comelones Roll Out!!!"}
{"text":"These taco's are great. Place is really clean. Reminds me of tacos in Tijuana as a kid"}
{"text":"This place has peer unprofessional people their all rude and ignorant I have gone twice and both times were very bad experiences !!!my experience on this location was horrible I had to walk out and eat some were else cause of the bad customer service they have ...so I went their with my family it was like 13 of us so I go in the my first time their I ask a lady in Spanish hey how do I get to the tent outside were the door and she said well walking how else that is the rudest thing an employee can say to a customer so I asked for a manager and she just walked away I was shocked of how rude that lady was ....so I let it go me and my husband go to the adobada section and my husband told the guys hey what do you have here it was our first time their the guy didn't say anything he just hit the menu sign with his hand and said don't you see ...that was it my husband just walked out and went to 7/11 to buy a sandwich when he was craving the tacos but they were very disrespectful ..I'm a manager for multiple businesses and their management have to get on top of things and show those people great customer service cause they don't
 have one bit of customer service ....they have to understand that customers are everything with out them your nothing they have to understand that they have a salary or a check because of customers I will never go to this place again very unprofessional and disrespectful people their...."}
{"text":"The tacos are good, probably the best you'll find in Vegas. The service is always fast, and the place is always very clean. I just wish they had some more spicy options like spicier salsas. I have tried both their red, and green salsas and while they are tasty, they don't have that spicyness I expect from a salsa."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, not worth the wait. The beef was okay, have had better. Typical Food, so so place"}
{"text":"It takes a long time but the foodit amazing. Go there atleast 2 times a month. Its open everything i go and staff are syper nice"}
{"text":"Plain and simple. The tacos were good, the lengua and sesos were comparable back home in LA.
Only issue is..one dollar sign does not mean $2 for a 2.5oz taco. Back home I can get FREESH corn tortillas for half the price with double the serving."}
{"text":"Not much of a variety when it comes to meat choice. There was no chicken or fish. The only thing that was really on the menu was tacos, quesadilla or fries. Definitely it was overpriced for the amount of meat they give you. Also, the communication between the person taking your order and the cashier made it way more difficult to explain and pay"}
{"text":"Not as good as their Tijuana spot but it'll do.  Hubby and I ordered one of each. My favorite was the cabeza and hubby liked the al pastor."}
{"text":"If you don't eat meat skip this place. Head, tongue, pork, and carne asada tacos galore. My cheese quesadillas were really flavorful; probably because they were cooked on the same grill as the meat! Some people's reviews commented about the place itself- who cares? Go for the tacos, 'cause that's all they serve anyway (except for quesadillas). Recommended."}
{"text":"Being Mexican I can only say is like being in one of those Mexican Taquerias downtown somewhere in Mexico; and yes only where the locals would go. So after almost twenty years in Vegas I can finally say I've eaten a good ass taco in the states!!....(excuse my french.)"}
{"text":"Tacos - adobada/pastor, asada, lengua, grilled onions & peppers.

We saw this place while walking down the strip and there was a big crowd so we had to try them out. The lines moves very quickly, so don't be turned off by them. We were at the front of the line before we even decided what we were getting. The food was ready immediately. I saw the person next to me order the grilled onions & peppers, so I asked for them and was surprised to find out they were free. I wish they had that on the menu because I wouldn't have known if I hadn't seen someone else ask for them. We got our tacos with everything on them and the sauces were perfect.

I really liked that they told us we could bring our beers in here. So, we sat in their outdoor tent with our tacos & beer!

Fast, affordable, convenient, authentic, and delicious, love it!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and can say without hesitation that Tacos El Gordo deserves 4 stars. The restaurant is small with only a handful of tables inside. It has a nice comfortable feel to it which is only made better by the amazingly friendly service that I have received every time I have gone in. 

Everything I have tried has been excellent but the standout at this point has to be the taco de cabeza. I am a big fan of tacos and I can say that these are the best I have ever had. I have tried 4 or 5 different tacos which have also all been excellent. Tacos El Gordo is exactly what a small restaurant should be. Great service with great food. I really can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"One of the best Al Pastor tacos I've had. $2.25 each. I'm Mexican and I know my tacos. These by far exceeded my expectations. This was my first time here and will be coming again.

We tried the Al Pastor tacos with all their fixings and they were awesome tasting! We tried the Al Pastor tostada, but it wasn't as great as the tacos. The tostada was a bit bland. 

SEATING: There's about 10 tables for about 100+ people that are regularly here. Plan on taking your food back to your car unless your lucky enough to find seating. That won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious!:) and really friendly service from the workers there. Very busy, workers are quick to clean up when they see a customer leave. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Drive thru is close. Don't get discouraged by the long line tho... It goes quick. These tacos are worth standing in line for. Not greasy. Great tasting."}
{"text":"Food is ok...very over priced thoo for some tacos,good spot for a late night meal when ur turnt up."}
{"text":"LINE SUCKS...but worth the wait!!! It has become my go-to spot in vegas for authentic street tacos."}
{"text":"I eat there, and take out often, and the authentic Mexican food is as good as it gets...
Very easy  on the wallet too!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people eat tacos in this place wait in line more than 30minutes 3 difference lines for meats you get some tacos first then you have to wait for the others and get another line to pay when you eat them their freaking cold. the chorizo and adobada tacos was raw meat disgusting!!"}
{"text":"I AM OBSSESED WITH THESE TACOS!!!! Right now i dont live any where near any of their current locations, but I ALWAYS make the trip. Im so excited for the new location opening 10 mins from my house!!! Anyways, my fav are the tacos de adobada with the guac dressing topped of with abit of lime and radish....HEAVEN!! I know a couple of the employees there and they are always very nice! Definately a MUST TRY for authentic tacos."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas with out a doubt. I don't know why the one on Las Vegas Boulevard closed, but I wish it was still there."}
{"text":"Best tacos this side of the border. 

Obviously it won't beat the prices in Mexico, but well worth the $2 a taco. 
It's hard to find places that cook the al pastor on a rotisserie anymore."}
{"text":"amazing amazing amazing tacos!!! we need one in la puente asap!! Best tacos I've had a must visit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Omfg.. this place never fails!! I come to Vegas quite often from phx and wow just wow. Spicy pork tacos.. amen. Compliments ;)"}
{"text":"As someone who's traveled through Mexico, I can say without a doubt that these are authentic Adobada tacos.. Everytime I come to Vegas, I make sure I visit this spot. You will not be disappointed. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Whoever knows mexican food should know this place is fukn AWESOME!! the best !! The asada fries are pricey but keep in mind they have a small order which is still a good amount for $5 ... These are true TJ tacos ! I never leave vegas without eating here!"}
{"text":"Best fu/k/ing tacos on the strip.  

Fast.  Easy to order.  Tastes good.  Open exactly when you want them to be open.

Can walk to it from the Wynn/Palazzo/Venetian.

Did I say tasty?  HELLA tasty."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm too picky but after having eaten at the original place off of H street in San Diego... Nothing comes even remotely close to it. Overall food was ok; priced just right. I say try it you'll probably like it!"}
{"text":"Anybody who doesn't give this place 5 stars was either drunk as a skunk when they went there and therefore couldn't enjoy the food or just doesn't like good fresh mexican food at an incredible price.
Come on........pork tacos at two bucks each. It can't last, but I sure hope it does."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Just absolutely delicious!  I knew that although its still on the strip, there ain't a gringo in sight.  The first thing you'll notice upon arriving is the aromas of freshly made tortillas, al pastor, asada, grilled scallions & peppers, and a long ass line!  Once you combat the line of indigenous personnel and finally get to order, go hard guys...go hard!

Our spread consisted of al pastor, tripas, lengua, & stomach....all of which are gracefully wrapped in freshly made tortillas that melt-in-yo-mouf!  I couldn't stop talking about these tacos even weeks after my virgin visit, but has since been a must have every time I visit Lost Wages.  

Don't let the long lines discourage you, as a delicious reward will be awaiting at the end....oh did i mention they give you complementary grilled scallions and peppers?  And as much of it as you want!  Having said that, be sure to chase each taco bite with a slurp of grilled scallion \"noodles\" and a grilled pepper.....you've now discovered the best fucken tacos, prolly in the wasted state of Nevada!  Pictures are included..."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas eating authentic Mexican food... If you want real Mexican tacos and food there's no other place within a thousand miles!!!! Well of course unless you're in the real Mexico...
You will not be disappointed..........
The restaurant is extremely busy with a lot of workers working and keeping it clean and maintaining a top notch service and attitude. ... they're very friendly and pleasant....
I cannot wait to go back.... A MUST trip to it...."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT! My campechana fries took 30mins since the guy who works at the al pastor station was too busy flirting that he forgot about my order."}
{"text":"Over priced tiny tacos... . spent $28 on 9 #goldentacos  then the guy cutting the meat chops up the meat to tiny pieces and gives us the part full of fat and chopped it tinier. no life to the tacos, just 1 little corn tortilla and the meat. my 14yr old could've done better"}
{"text":"I read the reviews on yelp about tacos El gordo. So I had to try it out. When I drove up there was a crowd of people ordering. Coming from California I expected this place to be like King Taco. We ordered the Carne Asada fries and some al pastor tacos.  The Carne Asada on the fries were burnt and to salty. The pastor on the tacos were actually good. I will continue to look for a good taco place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh man thought it was something like really good, but was turned off. There was a drunk homeless guy who sat next to us and they couldnt tell him to go out. Tacos werent that great. Place wasnt too clean. I am not coming back."}
{"text":"I've never had better tacos anywhere else in the states. The Al Pastor is straight from Heaven."}
{"text":"Came and there was a huge huge line so I thought these were going to be the best tacos I have ever tried, sadly these are the worst!!!! Are you people dumb or what???? These are the most terrible  tacos I have ever tried in my life! Taco Bell tacos are better than this! By the time you pay they are super cold.. Why is it always so packed ??!! I do not understand you Las Vegas people:/"}
{"text":"Went once, that's enough.  They don't make burritos.  And their method of ordering is crazy.  They were okay.   That's all."}
{"text":"Finally made it here..
An HOUR AND A HALF wait. .. Try to refrain from going late night on Fridays and Saturdays.
During the busy hours they have you separate into three lines depending on the type of meat you want to order. So bring along friends to divide and conquer those lines. 
The restaurant is fairly big and spacious in size but not big enough with the amount of crowds that roll through here with roughly 10-15 tables inside/5 tables outside. 
Make sure you know what you want to order and be ready to yell out your order to the cooks. It is pretty loud with the amount of people talking over each other and over the loud music. 
Again, i waited 1 1/2 hours to order: Carne Asada Fries. Good amount of meat. Meat was juicy and not dry at all. Fries were not soggy at all and that was a PLUS! Overall pretty tasty.
Cashiers were friendly and quick. 
Totally recommend this joint. (just avoid busy hours)"}
{"text":"Cheap good tacos is why my husband and I come here.  We splurge on lunch and come here for a quick bite before a show.  I have to say the quality of their meat is pretty darn good it's not all full of fat and gristle.  We tried a variety of tacos and a mula which is a quesadilla with meat. At $2 a pop you can't go wrong. Seating can be a problem sometimes it can get pretty crowded, they also have outdoor seating but with the heat I prefer the ac. It's a noisy hole in the wall but I like those kind of places.  It is clean,tidy and we at least make 2 stops here while in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place makes delicious tacos and tostadas! Great variety of taco meats and toppings. The price is pretty affordable and provide fast service. There is also a large sitting area. If we return to Vegas will definitely visit this location again. It is located towards the south end of the strip close by Circus Circus hotel."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and found Tacos El Gordo on Yelp. So happy that I did! Huge 2 dollar tacos, quesadillas and fries, (no burritos), your choice of cow head, tongue, brain, tripe, steak, or spicy pork. I'm not an expert on Mexican food but I've eaten my share- this is pretty authentic, huge portions, super cheap, and most important: incredibly delicious! They also sell Mexican soda flavors like Horchata. Ended up going back again and again. This will be a stop whenever I'm in Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"Los tacos estan muy buenos pero el servicio a el cliente es muy malo empezando con el señor q atiende en los tacos al pastor el tiene muy mal servicio y solo abienta la comida"}
{"text":"The asada tacos were really good.  I liked they offer authentic Mexican soda but I didn't care for the flavors.

I had a tough time communicating while placing my order.  I got 2 asada tacos and I'm pretty sure the 3rd one I got was beef tounge.  It was pretty gross.  (I wouldn't have ordered beef tounge) 

This is real authentic Mexican real fast."}
{"text":"When I worked in L.V. my son would come in once a week for his company.  He found this place and took me one lunch.  The place has the feel of an Ensenada taco shot with line to get each different type of taco. We ordered several fro the different lines, Pastor, asada, adobada, tounge, and Suadero (brisket).
Walked to the cash register. Paid for hot tacos and purchased a cup for drinks. No seats! this place was packed. Because I'm disabled and with a walker we were helped instantly by the lady that keep the dinning room cleared and clean!  
My son would come in each week and all I wanted to do is go there! I no longer work in L.V. but anytime we go this is one stop we must make!  Everyone in our family love the tacos! Real Deal Mexican street tacos! Worth every bit of line, seating driving off the strip."}
{"text":"Casi una hora esperando en la linia los cosineros con su carota exepto 1 deveriande tener un manager de verdad no chafas  como los que estan ahi"}
{"text":"Finally open yes...!!!!
I have eaten of other locations price is a little high but the tacos are delicious. Carne Asada fries. Yum . 
If you never try tacos El Gordon go try it now. Boom blow your mind taco's."}
{"text":"Best Alpastor tacos I've ever had. The ordering is a little confusing but the workers are very nice and helpful. In wish this place was closer to my house because I would go here every day if I could."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas period. Just like the ones  in TJ Mexico."}
{"text":"Love the tacos! Just don't like how they run their line system! You have to wait in separate lines for different types of meats and on top of that wait in another line just to pay."}
{"text":"Spicy Pork Tacos! Service was fast friendly and no frills.  This place has great food- street tacos just like my fav places in LA.  Super clean and plenty of seating inside and out."}
{"text":"This place is the best taco shop in Vegas I have found! The spicy pork! Damn son! Love this place go there every time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I once ordered $200 worth of Tacos El Gordo tacos, took it home, dumped it all in my bathtub, rubbed it on my body, made sweet love to it, then cuddled it for hours. 

Sure, most tacos are good enough to make sweet love to. But cuddling it for hours afterward? That's really special. 

This place is that good. 

Don't stand in the long line. Get in the short line for the lips and eyeballs tacos. Order one lips and eyeballs taco and ask the same guy for everything else you really want. It'll save a lot of time, plus the lips and eyeball taco is pretty good."}
{"text":"Can't believe I just found this place after all these years of visiting Las Vegas! We went there around 11 pm and again the next day for lunch before heading out, it was that good! The carne asada tacos are great but the adobada is an absolute must have! I have Mexican food quite often and I've never had anything like it - SO YUMMY! There might be a wait depending on the time you go, but totally worth it. Also the place is very clean, which makes it that much better. I'm really, really picky about taco places and this place is by far the best. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas. Lines go by quick and the prices are fair. I got tacos of carne asada and adobaba, and a half order of carne asada fries. Everything was great."}
{"text":"I came here for my second visit on a Sunday morning around 11:30 am to beat the line. From my first time I found out it takes 45 minutes to get tacos on late weekends which I didn't mind.
 I live in Riverside, Ca and come to Vegas twice a year. I know that Tacos El Gordo are a big thing in TJ which I am very familiar with their quality and authentic tacos. 
Anyways, I ordered 8 tacos de asada and 1 de pastor. As I took my bite (bang) sub-zero temperature tacos. Took the tacos back to the taquero and he blame the aguacate and salsa for making the tacos cold. There was no way in 3 minutes that took me to pay and sat down that could be that case. Nevertheless, I got them replace with everything on the side including cilantro, onion, salsa, and aguacate. Thats the reason they got 1 extra star. 
I wont be coming back to this location anymore I'll rather safe my cravings for the real TJ Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Well Larry Hernandez (Mexican singer) raved about how awesome this place was well Not!!! We walked 5 miles down the strip to eat here and it was not all that at all!!! We would of been better off eating at Taco Bell don't waste your time eating here"}
{"text":"The tacos are to die for! They dip their tacos in butter, along with the homemade tortillas. Delicious..If you are in town I would try them out."}
{"text":"An amazing lunch.  Out for a stroll and looking for lunch when I find this place.  I had no idea what I was in for - amazing street tacos.  I had a steak and a spicy pork, ate those and then ordered two more of the pork.  While not a cheap street taco, with horchata I spent $10 for lunch, which is not bad for Vegas.  Even better that it was for fabulous tacos.  Love the flavors!  I need to go back and try the tongue..."}
{"text":"the last time i went to this place was i have to fight for a taco they re expensive the tortillas were cold as fucking hell the cashier thinks shes the last person on earth but at the end no my kind of place to eat or pay for those tacos they re not good as i expected"}
{"text":"Horrible fuk this place lol they thought we where gonna run out when we where eating here fuking ass fuks that was my 1st time there and last lol i aint waiting in line with my food to pay after smh"}
{"text":"Delicious Adobada Tacos and asada/Adobada fries. Crowded, order first then Pay. Find a seat if you can."}
{"text":"OMG, the best tacos I've had. Only had the carne asada and adobo and the adobo was my favorite. That's all I'm going to order for next time. One of the cook was super nice, while he was putting out my order it slipped out of my hand and fell behind the cooks counter and he said it was no problem and remade my order. Order concept is a bit unorganized in my opinion, I know it's suppose to speed up the ordering process but not if you're ordering for a large party/family. Some wants this and some wants that and you will have to stand in all three lines, if you're there by yourself ordering to-gos. Might be good to rethink the ordering concept!"}
{"text":"I visit Vegas a couple of times a year and I always stop by this place. The carne asada tacos are my favorite, they are very flavorful and the tortillas are always hand made. The wait can be overwhelming but the food is worth it. So if you have time and have never try tacos this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada fries I was kinda skeptical at first but blown away on Awesome they were.. the small is plenty for 1 person and still have enough to share.."}
{"text":"Yes I know ...5 stars. Seriously? Yes!!!! These are by far the best tacos I have ever had!!! Fresh tortillas and grilled carne asada and if you are having a fat day order the carne asada fries. Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally authentic Al Pastor here in Vegas.

I worked in Mexico and then moved to Vegas 16 years ago.  I have searched the entire city since then to find true Mexican \"street\" tacos.  El gordo has them.  Fantastic Pastor, Asada, y Lengua tambien!

Roasted chilies and green onion at the end of the counter is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Authintic tacos and Carne Asada (Steak) fries, SO DELICIOUS! I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone loves this place. I guess it's because it's on the strip and everyone has the munchies late night. The food is pretty good and location is conveniently located right next to Encore/Wynn. I guess it's also a bonus that they're open late and on Las Vegas Blvd, but I think there are better places to get tacos than here. The flavor of their al pastor isn't bad but not great, and you have to request the pineapple (other places put it on without asking). Their fries are just ok too. If you're on the strip and you have that craving for tacos, this place can definitely satisfy those cravings."}
{"text":"The most memorable tacos I ever had in my life! Authentic, affordable and amazingly delicious!
I highly recommend el taco adobada, and el sope. And you cannot leave without trying the horchata.. Mmmm just typing this makes my mouth water.
Also,a heads up, try to avoid lunch time. We were lucky and arrived at 11:30am right before the rush hour.
The only thing I regret is finding out about this place a day before leaving back home."}
{"text":"Everytime i go to Vegas, i go to this place for sure. These are the best tacos ever. Im from Mexico and they have the closest flavors and looks from the original tacos in Mexico.

You can choose from too many different meats: asada,adobada,lengua,chorizo,tripa,sesos. I usually order adobada tacos,they're the best from my point of view.
 I also order a Vampiro, its like a quesadilla stuffed with carne asada, highly recommendable. They offer free grilled onions and chilli peppers. I also get
 horchata its ok and not that sweet.

If you go to Vegas,this place its a must go. Its very affordable,opens after hours 
and closes at 4 am in the morning.Tacos are just $2 dlls.....and they are worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the second time here , I can't believe I did not write a review thanks yelp for reminding me. We have had the carne asada tacos and the adobada sopes and carne asada fries 
           
The soft taco's are great , we got them with everything on , some kind of avocado sauce , onions ,cilantro. 
The adobada sopes were also good it's a spicy shreded pork not very hot spicy but flavorful spicy . Sopes are corn disk that are soft about 3/4 inch thick. We got everything on them avocado sauce, cilantro and onions. 
            
The carne asada fries are covered in the same avocado sauce with of course carne asada , they also have them with the adobada pork, We got the 1/2 order which is more then enough for two. 
Pretty neat place you order your food from the cooks , who make it right there and they also have grilled green onions and jalapenos that you can ask for , I think it was free. 
             
           They also have different Mexican drinks at the soda fountain as well as regular sodas . Pretty good place to grab a meal or snack"}
{"text":"This place is not worth the hype. FIRST OF ALL the lines were ridiculously long , I was waiting 40 minutes for a fucking taco when I asked for a quesadilla. They don't make the tortiillas hand made instead they were using \"El Super\" tortillas which are very nasty and dry. The tacos were really small and I had asked a lady for some onion and she kept ignoring me. I kept calling her and she would look at me and ignore me. The quesadilla was not even a quesadilla it was a cheese taco NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR!! The quesadilla had a hard tostada on top and I was not able to bite it without hurting my teeth. I was trying hard to enjoy my cheese taco but I couldn't because at some point it started to smell like rotten meat. I would not recommend anyone to come here , I don't understand why everyone saids it's good. I rather go to tacos de Gavilán."}
{"text":"Being from Los Angeles I've had a lot of tacos in my life. These tacos I never want again. The chorizo taco had chopped up foil in it. I had to wait 45 minutes in the beef line and my food was cold when he handed it to me. They make the carne asada then chop it up into tiny bits like rice and it was filled with grissle and it doesn't taste great. I hate everything about this place and food."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. A real gem hidden on the Las Vegas strip between souvenir shops and tattoo parlors."}
{"text":"Don't worth the wait..  too busy! Not the best tacos. They do not provide extra salsa..  authentic Yes! Cheap maybe!"}
{"text":"Went with friends for lunch. Authentic tacos, fast service and very reasonably priced. 
Good selection, guacamole tasted great. All food is being made as you order it and it is going out the door pretty fast so very fresh. We ate outside under a covered area, however the air conditioner was not working so it was a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at Tacos el Gordo to try them out. There were 3 different lines and you can only order what the sign says at each line. We had the intentions of trying different tacos but decided to just go with carne asada since we would have to stand at different lines for about 30 minutes.

It took us 30 minutes before it was our turn to order. I would say the tacos are not worth the wait. They are decent but I have had better. The tacos come with guacamole (which doesn't taste like anything) a red salsa, cilantro and onions. I was expecting more flavor based on the reviews. The tacos would probably taste a lot better if they seasoned the meat and guacamole and if they made a salsa that is spicy. 

We did enjoy the free grilled onions and jalapeños. Which is a plus!

Based on the wait and taste we probably will not be back. If there wasn't a long wait we would probably stop by again, but they are definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The ordering process can be a bit daunting for first-timers. Just watch everyone else do it and jump on in the queue. Extremely delicious and affordable. Highly recommend the el pastor and the asada tacos.

also.. TRY THE DESSERTS! They're hidden behind the cash register."}
{"text":"Service sucks, confusing to order and pay, food has no flavor, I will never come back."}
{"text":"Line was a little long but that just showed that it would be worth the wait.

 Al Pastor, Chorizo, and Carne Asade were delicious. Add a cold coca cola to it and it was a party. It really hit the spot for my taco craving. Pricing was fair too. Great way to end my Vegas trip :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service at this particular location! I've been in Tacos el Gordo in San Diego and in Mexico and I never experienced the constant harassment of the cashier to pay for my food. When I got there, she told me how to order and then to bring back my food and pay for it. Good, I got it! However, I ordered some tacos and while I was waiting in a table for the carne asada fries for my boyfriend, she again approached me to tell me that I had to go and pay for the food. I told her I was still waiting for my order and she said \" yes, I know but you still have to go and pay at front\" anyways, we got our carne asada fries wrong! Because we told the lady twice not to put sour cream on it and she did. We told her but we didn't wanted to wait another 15 minutes because my tacos were already cold. So, I stayed at the table and my boyfriend took the food to the cashier and paid. He came back to bring the food and left to grab some soda so I started eating and the cashier approached me for the third time to tell me that I had to pay for the tacos, I was so mad!!!! I didn't even looked at her but I told her that we already did, she demanded the receipt and I told her that I didn't have it because my boyfriend paid for them, and she asked me where he was!!!! So I told her, I was very uncomfortable and I didn't enjoyed my food at all. I left the place and while my boyfriend was looking for me he heard the cashier talking to the security about me! That I left without paying, until my boyfriend told her that I was with him. She didn't even apologize, she just said that is because a lot of people leave without paying. Awful customer service because you can't judge based on other people's bad behavior. Besides, if you're new to this place, there are three different lanes which are very confused due to the amount of clients allowed that over reaches it's maximum capacity! We got there at 11 am and got our food 45 minutes later! The food it's not worth the wait, if you're really hungry go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! The best tacos de cabeza!!!!! And hecka cheap!!!!! Service is great!!!! I love tacos el gordo! Open one in northern calif like napa valley to b exact!!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are just as great as the strip location.  But be ready for a wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"Spicy pork tacos are a must try!!! The best $2.00 tacos money can buy."}
{"text":"Our las Vegas Blvd location is closed we have moved to 3260 losee rd 89030 same food bigger location .we moved because the owner of the property changed our locks to the doors because they want to open a taco shop like ours"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times! The food always hits the spot! I like that they got some REAL tacos in this shiznit! I ALWAYS order the tripe, beef brain & pork stomach. Food will never let you down. There were some drunken times where we drove 25 minutes to get there because we were craving their tacos!

Awesome drunken or sober food. Take your friends and family there but NOT a first date! Comprende?

Stay awesome my friends."}
{"text":"Only given 4 starts because we feel it is a bit over priced. The food is so good though and always cooked very well. If you ever come to eat here try the quesodillas there very very good."}
{"text":"The sopes are delicious.  Don't feel intimidated if you don't speak Spanish- someone will help you."}
{"text":"Great food best tacos a had so far here in Vegas / tacos al pastor - a+ / if you visit Vegas you should really go there"}
{"text":"Hella good tacos - especially al pastor.  Been here a few times and I occassionally have day dreams of this place during my taco craves :)  Theyre open late too!"}
{"text":"Therevare soooooooo many taco spots in this city...you want the BEST one el gordos is where to go layers of flavor in every single dish. The ceviche is amazing ANY TACO AT ALL agua fresca ugh this llace really is the best!"}
{"text":"Oh man! Tacos el Gordo it's a must for me and family to come to when in Vegas! The tacos the pastor are really good. The only down side it's the lines for every meat . If you come with a large group have someone get into a line and one getting a table . Finding a table is annoying is you have to stand and wait for someone to get up . So get one before ordering your tacos ."}
{"text":"These are the closets tacos you will ever get to taste in regards to eating tacos in Mexico. The Al Pastor tacos are amazing and the tortillas they use are oiled down to the perfect flavor. My favorite that a lot of people don't know about are BUCHE they taste so delicious however you have to put some lime on them just because they can be a bit salty at times. Hands down my favorite taco spot in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"To people who don't live in Mexico and are not Mexican like myself, this place really is a treat. I can definitely see orthodox Mexican people who see this place as \"nothing special\" or its \"ok\" but I think this place is awesome. I usually line up at the offal counter, which I see the least amount of people.. People have no idea what they are missing. My favourite among the offal tacos is the tripa the texture is unbelievable, and what seemed to be a \"salsa rioja\" was perfect for it. Cabeza taco was my next favourite, I loved it because I am a fan of artery clogging, \"eat it in moderation\" kind of foods. This taco had a very soft beef flavour presented shredded and chopped, served with I guess a salsa verde sauce and cilantro if I remember correctly. I then had the tongue taco, which was okay, not my favourite texture, it had a slithery like texture going down the throat which was interesting. Beef brain taco was an experience; I would consider it to look clumpy and the taste was very neutral, it was somewhat rich and cooked fork tender. Moving on to the standard meat tacos(San Diego location), my favourite was the steak. It had a pleasantly chewy texture, served in strips, I think it has again the salsa verde cilantro mixture and I cannot remember if it was spicy. Tacos adobadas was also delectable, the pork was crispy on the outside, cooked nicely on the inside. Unfortunately I do not remember the sauce or the ingredients but I do remember they all worked in harmony. It's been a while since the San Diego location so I cannot remember the others I tried, but everything was perfect."}
{"text":"This place is all hype, tacos aren't that great. They have two separate lines depending on what kind of meat you want and there is not enough seating."}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles so there is an abundance of restaurants to get tacos so I have pretty high expectations.  I went to Tacos El Gordo as a spontaneous trip and it happened to be on a Saturday night.  It was very busy and the lines were long.  The wait wasn't too bad but there were 3 separate lines (different meat in each line) which isn't clear at all until the cooks yell it out.  So you could be in the front of the line and find out at the last minute that you are in the wrong line.  I had to constantly deal with other customers pushing through the lines to get to the soda machines.  Other than those things, the food was good but definitely try different meats.  I have gone twice and once I made the mistake of ordering 3 different items but with the same meat so everything tasted the same.  The menu isn't big but items are made to order and the tortillas are homemade.  All employees were working hard and I didn't notice any with attitudes."}
{"text":"Very Authentic tacos. Not your typical Americanized Mexican food. Place is very casual.
Price around $2.5 for small tacos so you will need 3-4 tacos. 
They open late so great after clubbing. 
Every option tacos grill has its signs  so you order and you pay in a separate location. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Reading about their carne asada fries is what brought us in here - my husband judges every taco shop/stand by their carne asada fries. We stopped in during lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't busy at all. We ordered the campechana fries - comes with both carne asada and spicy pork. 

It is a bit confusing about how/where to order, seems like that problem could be solved with just a couple signs over the ordering lines?? We must have looked confused cause one of the employees came over and told us what each line is for, and when we told her we were just wanting the fries she stepped up and ordered for us. They then told us to go have a seat and they would bring our order out since it would take a few minutes. 5 stars for the great service!

We only tried the fries, and you definitely get a lot. I would say they are worth the $10 price. Not the best ones we've ever had, but still really good. They top them with cheese, sour cream, what looked like an avocado sauce as well as guacamole. I think they would have been really great though  if they had a selection of salas to top them with, it seemed odd to us that a taco shop wouldn't have that, and honestly the fries were missing it. 

If I were to go back I would probably try some of the tacos, and also just order the fries with the spicy pork, I enjoyed that a lot more than the carne asada."}
{"text":"Great place to eat real Mexican style tacos. Can find lengua, alpastor, cabeza ect.. It feels like if your in mexico!! Great service!! Pretty clean and it's cheap.ive tried other tacos places but not as authentic as tacos El gordo."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! I was in line for the Pastor tacos for about 20 min. Once I got to the front they were all out, instead of just serving me Asada tacos from there they tried to make me stand in another long line, so I left without ordering anything. The tacos are good but I will never return because the way I was treated today. It was really unfair. It was my favorite taco place now I will never go back. It was around 5:15pm Saturday November 26th."}
{"text":"Not the classiest joint in town, but certainly the best street tacos you will find, love the spicy pork!"}
{"text":"Still really good flavor but not as good as Cali :(. The meat seems to be different but the guacamole, marinade, and salsa make up for it.  But after a long night in Vegas I'm sure it hits the spot."}
{"text":"They are probably the best tacos in Vegas! You definitely have to try the adobada tacos, delicious and authentic mexican styled tacos!!! Greasy and juicy meat melts in your mouth, they are inexpensive and the line to order is always long !!!! What that tells you?"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! I am Mexican and from LA so I KNOW my tacos. Not even LA has better tacos. Their style is what I am used to eating while visiting family in TJ and Ensenada. The first time I tried these was while I was in San Diego and I have fallen in love with them ever since. The location here is a MUST GO anytime that I am in Vegas. They're a little pricey but let me tell you that they are worth every penny. My usual order consists of 3 Al Pastor tacos with everything, 2 tripa tacos extra crispy and some cebollas and chile. This location is one of the best since I have been to all of theirs. The location in Temecula, CA is the worse! Re-cap. You cannot get better al pastor tacos anywhere especially in LV. YOU MUST GO HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Their service is seriously the worst. I dot understand why get your food and wait in a long line, while your food gets cold, and pay before you eat. The entire system confuses me, but the mulas are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Legit taco place on the strip!  Worth the line - be advised; beef or pork only - no chicken.  

Al pastor/Adobada = pork and they are fantastic!
Can't beat this place for the price, perfect break from the overpriced restaurants on the strip.  We are here around 10:30pm and only waited 20 min but if you get here around 1-2am you'll be waiting up to an hour with the \"club\" crowd.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a great taco place.  There are always families there, the staff are friendly and the meat is of decent quality.  Bottomless Horchata.  Good place to sit down and eat some authentic Mexican tacos.  They keep the place clean as well so I don't have any worries about bringing my children there.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best taco spot ever!! They closed the one by the Wynn, lucky for me the new place on losee is closer to my house!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the original Tacos el Gordo in Tijuana MX so my review is because I'm comparing it to the original location. Tacos are overpriced here in Las Vegas $2.25 each vs. $1.15 in Tijuana.  The taste is almost similar . Here is the worse part, the amount of meat they put in these tacos is half of what we get in Tijuana. However they are not stingy on onions & cilantro  even if you say \"little bit\" half of the taco is onion & cilantro. So in Vegas I'm paying twice as much, for half of a taco .  It satisfies my craving but I rather go to the original location. Parking is hard because it's all shared by 1 shopping center."}
{"text":"Tried the ones in TJ. Had to try them in Vegas.  They did not disappoint.  Great tacos. Best tacos in Vegas. Forget the overpriced tacos in the casinos."}
{"text":"Food is good but system is bad make line for one another line for other meat other line to drinks and pay then fight to get a table"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here every year on our anniversary and stand in line for sometimes 40 minutes.  And that's at 1AM.  Very good, traditional tacos.  They are as good as any street taco I have had in Mexico.

There are only two downsides here:

1:  The wait can be very long

2:  There is very little seating for the size crowds that form at both doors so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries were delicious. The place was packed on a Sunday afternoon, so be prepared to wait. The meat had good flavor and not too much fat. The portions were big and we split the fries. The hubby was excites about the horchata soda they had. Next time I'm not sharing my fries though ;)"}
{"text":"Good quality street tacos offering plenty of meat choices from beef tongue, brains, tripe etc. The Al pastor is delicious and the tacos are fresh."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Finally made it over here for lunch after several recommendations from friends.  The place was hopping!  Fortunately I had read some reviews and was able to navigate the line system, but I can see it being confusing for the uninitiated.
Ordered a mix of carne adovada, carne asada & suadero tacos.  Adovada was by far the most enjoyable.  Suadero was tender and smoky.  Carne asada was passable, but not my favorite in town.  The corn tortillas were pulled fresh off the grill, and the various sauces that accompanied the tacos were flavorful.  Everything here was good, but outside of the carne adovada I wouldn't classify anything as great.  Maybe my expectations were too high, as the tacos had been described as a \"life-changing experience.\" Who knows...
Service was definitely friendly and the lines move relatively quickly.  Bottomless horchata is a plus.  All-in-all, a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Buen sazón,Calidad,buen servicio,menú muy variado,pero falta mejorar la forma de pedir los tacos es un poco confusa si es la primera vez que vas a este lugar,En general buen restaurante."}
{"text":"I always get the adobada meat! I've tried their fries and taco with the adobada and both were equally good. Can't have Roberto's anymore, gotta drive all the way here for some tacos!"}
{"text":"Very good carne asada tacos. I went on may 5th to  celabrate the  Mexican holiday. The whole 2 line thing is a little weird,but the staff was very helpful. I can't wait to go back and try the spicy pork tacos.
***update-I went back a few days later and tried the spicy pork tacos .They were awesome I can't stop thinking about them. I could eat them all day every day .I have a new addiction and my body craves them."}
{"text":"Their food was ok but it made my friends stomach sick. It must have been undercooked food or not fresh food. They ran out of the most important thing for a taco cheese."}
{"text":"I am a fan! This place delivers on pretty much everything they promise. The people are friendly, the food is delicious and they are open late! The spicy pork is my favorite! They would be getting 5 stars from me but there are times my order is wrong. I go out of my way to repeat my order a few times to ensure accuracy.."}
{"text":"Just go!  The experience, the food, the people are not to be missed.  The process of ordering, paying for your meal, and finding a seat are a unique experience.  Watching the preparation of the tacos, mulas, and quesadillas is like watching artists at work.  And I absolutely loved the tripas--best I've ever had.  Everyone in our group of five was happy with their respective orders, and I certainly will be back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Didn't know they had a Tacos El Gordo in Vegas!!!

Being the ONLY one on the strip, this place is chaotic after a night of clubbing. Bigger than the locations in San Diego, but essentially the same menu. I always get the adobada tacos so I stuck with that, but the line is pretty ridiculous. The only thing that keeps this from a 5 star review was that the meat was a little dry compared to what I'm used to in SD. Other than that, bombdotcom!"}
{"text":"great tacos, all the meats taste great I had asada, pastor and suadero, all i can say its delicious."}
{"text":"Probably the best taco place in Vegas. My favourite is the Al pastor but j recommend you try something different every time you visit. Thats what i do and i usually like what I get."}
{"text":"WOW just WOW!!!! after a night of drinking tacos always hit the spot but these tacos are made with crack cause Im addicted!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I first found out about this place last year after a friend recommended it and have been going regularly to enjoy the food. I usually get al pastor tacos, which are so good! I also get some green onions on the side, which are complimentary, just gotta ask for them. The place is sometimes crowded, but the wait is definitely worth it. Great food, great service, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect from this place but they were seriously the best al pastor tacos I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"The Pastor is the same as in TJ. AMAZING. Try the soaps. They have a very crispy crunch to it."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever had. It's like being transported to Mexico when you take that first bite. The spicy pork tacos are so delicious. Wouldn't have ever expected tacos this good when I first saw the joint. A true gem in Vegas."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 1 hour and 45mins on monday night,
Still worth it!!

Tripa, Buche are my favorite from here.

I tried number of Mexican restaurants but No comparison. Best in town!"}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite go to restaurant in Vegas.  Found this place today and had an awesome meal which was real authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"God dam then tacos was good but the whole time had to fight against all these dam flys man! Plus no mofo A/c what thy thinking it ain't summer! They got some shitty swamp coolers"}
{"text":"Extrem gutes Taco-Schnellrestaurant. Absolute Empfehlung!"}
{"text":"Truly tijuana style tacos. Affordable and great. The system that they have sucks though. But as far as the food, Excellent!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I wish I could come here at least once a week. I love their cow tongue tacos, yes I said it! It is super amazing. Also, el pastor is just as good. Will come back soon, my taco!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Pastor!!! Cheap, Open late, FAST, When we live in town we would go at least once a week!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in Las Vegas. Give yourself plenty of time at night because it gets super busy all night long"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype.   Try the suadero,  beef,  on a tostada it is incredible. Definitely worth the drive off the strip."}
{"text":"There is no way that I am the first person to wonder just HOW many people have primarily experienced the magic of Tacos El Gordo buzzed or drunk. 

Open till 3a on the weekdays and 5a on the weekends, this is a go-to spot for folks with the late night munchies. The place's no-frills menu is the first thing through the door, with tacos being its shining star, offering choices including adobada, carne asada, cabeza for two bucks a pop. There are other items like quesadillas, mulas, and carne asada fries, but you can't go wrong with tacos. 

Ordering can be a little tough if it's been a few years since you last sang \"La Camisa Negra\" by Juanes in high school, but the language barrier is minimal. There are several service stations and you can see them slapping on the ingredients in front of your very eyes so you know the STUFF BE FRESH. 

\"Me encantan!\""}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I've ever had. Tacos are made in front of your eyes when you order them. There is a different line up for different tacos. I had the Lengua (beef tongue) and Al Pastor. Al Pastor tacos are worth the wait. Meat is cut off the kabob and pan fried again before being put on a warm taco topped with onions, pineapple, and sauce. Warm and juicy with tanginess from the pineapple. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Definitely get the pork tacos with pineapple slices! They are delicious. We always order 10 or more every time we go. Place is always packed and busy but the wait time isn't bad at all. Price is also a plus. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"NOT IMPRESSED & POOR SERVICE, tacos de lengua good and soft. 
Be ready to wait in line to order different types of meat. While you're waiting for tacos de lengua, your tacos are cold. This taquero needs to be efficient and faster. But the way you order your food hoold the customers to coming back.


NOTE: Is so simple to order at the register and call your # and get your food."}
{"text":"Interesting find. Referred by the shuttle driver. Real Mexican Fast Food. Delicious food friendly employees. Very popular so be prepared to wait during the day."}
{"text":"Ok food,terrible service unless you are Mexican you can see how much they hate white and black people"}
{"text":"Great place for a late snack. Lines are always long and no where to sit but the fod line is fast and food to good."}
{"text":"I hate to say this but Taocs El Gordo is simply average at best. The tacos are way over priced; however, so are most that you find this side of the boarder. There is a lot of hype around this place and after I tried it for the first time this weekend, I really must question why. Overall the quality was decent and the food tasted decent. But in this case that's the problem, it was decent. I expected great, but still it was not bad. Its worth a try jut don't be so quick to give into the hype!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are good little pricy, took us 30 min to get some tacos. Good to bring people to make line in the other types of meat or else you're gunna be there all day"}
{"text":"The best place for tacos on the strip. Hands-down. Late night does get busy sometimes but it's worth the wait. Friendly staff. Excellent cooks"}
{"text":"Let me get all the bad stuff out of the way...

They have a drive thru that isn't in service.
The way they have the lines set up is a pain in the @$$.
The seats and tables are awful.
The parking situation is terrible. 

Ok!!! Now let's talk about why I love this place so much!!

FOOD FOOD FOOD FOOD!!! I don't think I've ever ordered anything here that I didn't love. I'm particularly fond of the pork mulas with flour tortillas. 
I have a hard time driving by this place without stopping in for a taco or 4. 

This place rocks.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the way they have the food ordering process set up. The \"one line for each type of meat\" business might work in TJ, but this is America baby. We like our food hot, cheap, fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Some of the best Carne Asada Fries I've ever had. They've got two sizes, either at $5 or $10. Do expect the restaurant to be packed at all times though. Their food ordering system could be a lot better. You order your food according what type of meat you want, wait for it, get in the cashier's line. They've also got some radishes, green and red hot sauce, and limes available. Gets really busy around midnight"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Love the adobada tacos! Lines are crazy, but I don't mind it."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit and tacos are good but nothing out of ordinary and their best tacos al pastor weren't even available due to machine being broken or something I asked but the taquero wouldn't provide much info his face was showing that he didn't wanted to be here or something. I'm just wondering why if you don't like to interact with people get a job like this or if you not feeling good go home but don't ruin customers day if yours ain't going that good. Good food goes along with great customer service. Also hot sauce was salty again like two days ago that's terrible."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were delicious. The smoky flavored meat was so tender and moist it literally melts in your mouth. Can't pronounce the names of the other tacos I ate but they were just as amazing. Reminds me of a place I ate at in San Juan Capistrano where the girl called my number for five minutes and due to lack of translation I didn't know it was me. Simply put delicious!"}
{"text":"The ordering process was a bit overwhelming, so make sure you know what you are going to order before you pick the line you stand in! But it is well worth it!!! The chorizo tostado was amazing, the salsa, cilantro and guacamole they put on top were also really good. And definitely get the horchata!"}
{"text":"This is where it's at!  WOW!  This is the real deal.  The Tacos Al Pastor are out of this world!  Yes Yes Yes!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, finally a taco place where my tastebuds can run wild"}
{"text":"The best street tacos north of San Diego!
Homemade tortillas 
Real Charbroiled carne asada 
The most favourable tacos anywhere!
Also,the chorizo and Al pastor are just as amazing.
Always busy,worth the wait.
Not cheap,but worth every cent!!"}
{"text":"Last night in Las Vegas and my white washed Mexican friend recommended this spot. Me sorprendió, ordene tacos de tripa y suadero, ricos es todo lo q puede comentar. I recommend this spot for anyone craving authentic Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"Best taco I've ever had in my life.  PERIOD.  The price is so far below the astronomical prices of the Strip it isn't even funny.  Authentic, friendly and excellent food quality make this place the best and one of the cheapest meals I've ever had in Las Vegas.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Devoured most of the carne asada fries. Definitely  a taste I'll never forget and reminds me so much of Mexico"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Different meat has different line. Carne Asada line is always longer. Tripas was the best. Don't forget to order the pepper and onion plates it's free. Definitely will be back here next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Hell no I wouldn't recommend this place at least I the mornings, I try the pastor and it just taste like weird and the try to make tacos like the Mexico City but they are far far away from it, the pineapple is from a c"}
{"text":"Best tacos ive ever had and I love in central California where there are taco trucks are at every corner. The asada fries are so good!! But beware they're a sharable size."}
{"text":"It's a taco joint alright. At 230 am there was a line out the door. we tried the pastor and Diablo and they were great. I have heard about this place for a minute and can't believe I haven't been here sooner. great for any time of the day for a quick bite. if you are coming for service and plated food you will be disappointed.  but if you are coming for good mexican food and an experience you are at the right spot! highly recommended...."}
{"text":"Holy mother of delicious meats, this place takes the enchilada. Amazing flavorful meats, you could blindly pick anything off the menu and be satisfied with it being tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. You know it's going to be good when you see plenty of local Mexicans and Hispanics frequenting the place. Open late but word to the wise the best meat is earlier in the day though the crowds are insane. Well worth it anytime."}
{"text":"i dont always eat tacos, but when i do, i prefer Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"today i went on a food tour around town ...  and i first went to a Shanghai restaurant and this place is the second spot i stop in .... gotta tell ya it was just so good ...i ordered a cow brain taco, a pig stomach tacos and one carne asada taco .... the cow brain i dont really recommend it ,wish they coulda doing somethings better with the brain other than just boil it .... but the pig stomach and the carne asada was so good with grilled scallion and fried jalapeno and their salsa ...."}
{"text":"Oh my Yum! It's like organized chaos when you get in to order, you place yourself in either the pork, beef or \"other\" line (can't think of the name) and you tell the staff behind the counter your order. They prepare the food in front of you, then you pay. Make sure you have others save you a booth. It was packed both times I've been to the restaurant. First was during a late dinner hour, the 2nd was around 5:30. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall: still the best late night tacos


Pros
-abodabo
-al pastor


Cons
-buche is extra funky, not my fav here but others liked it
- tripa, again not a fan

Sidenote:
- if you like eating innards you probably will enjoy the buche and tripa
- if you are getting crazy amounts of food, be sure to get a tray"}
{"text":"I'm not a taco fan in general, but this place is AWESOME!!! The taco is made fresh without strong corn taste. The meat is juicy and hot! The only thing is you need get into different line for different meat. When the line is long, your food will get cold after you check out. Other than that, very delicious taco!"}
{"text":"Everything from quesadillas to beef brain tacos, everything is tasty! I love this place so much! My friends and I were all getting tired, but we had to drive back to Saint George that night and everyone wanted tacos. We tried other places, but most of them were 21+ and one of my friends wasn't 21, so we found Tacos El Gordo. 
When we got there, it seemed to have a long line trailing outside, but it didn't take long until we were inside ordering.
Their spicy pork tacos are to die for! And if you order peppers and onions, beware! They are super tasty, but way spicy (and I can handle a lot of spice)!
I have recommended this to everyone going to Vegas because it is totally worth it and is super close to everything on the strip.
Go to Tacos El Gordo, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"get the tacos al pastor or anything al pastor,such good flavor. its sort of in the king taco realm,but most definetly better then tacos mexico. though they are pricey,some what. you order where the food is being prepared and then you pay at the cashiers at the doorways.i had a quesadilla de carne asada, 2 tacos al pastor and a med drink for $10. also if you like grilled green onions and chiles, ask for them. the line goes pretty fast. and this spot gets full after 12am obviously.they have mostly all the flavors of BANG..its located right after the wynn,"}
{"text":"Amazing! I've been coming here for years and am absolutely in love with the food! Although this time, since I came close to closing time, they missed the Guac and regular cheese they use and used shredded cheese for my carne asada fries (I had to get because they ran out of the adobada fries) I have to give them a 5 star review JUST for the guy who was serving the tacos alone with all the people waiting in his line. Adrian!! That guy deserves either a raise or promotion. He filled an order of 30 tacos in under 2 minutes! He's so fast and was able to get to us crazy fast! I even asked the lovely cashiers at check out for his name just to write this and they joked around with me and were super friendly and funny! Ambience is great! If you come in late and this guy is working, you won't have to wait long for your order. Thanks Adrian!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos El Pastor in LV. The wait times are typically anywhere between bad and terrible but if you want the best then you will need to wait! Prices are reasonable and worth every penny. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Vegas.  Went around 2pm on a Wednesday.  No line, fast service, and lots of choices.  $2 tacos with fresh authentic ingredients.  We tried the beef head, beef tongue, spicy pork, and the steak... they were all great.  The location is a bit far from center strip, near The Wynn."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers once again! We were looking for a taco place to eat while we were in Las Vegas this past weekend. After reading all the reviews, we decided to try Tacos El Gordo. 

As we were walking up to the place we noticed it was packed. That is always a good sign. There were also a lot of Mexican people there, usually another good sign. As busy as it was, the line went quickly. The menu is pretty simple and I chose the asada tacos and the adobada tacos. They were filled with meat, onion, cilantro, salsa and an avocado green sauce. It was almost hard to pick them up since they had so much meat in them. I like they don't skimp on the meat :) Both tacos were very good, although I liked the adobada better.

I highly recommend that if you're in Vegas and you feel like tacos you hit this place up."}
{"text":"So I'm from so cal and obviously we have the best Mexican food right?! No! Las Vegas does apparently! This place is amazing! I had the spicy pork adobado? I think that's how u spell it buy anyway it's amazing!!!!!!!!! Carne asada... Amazing!! So juicy and tender!!! Ugh! I've been craving for this since I had it... You know what? I'm Guna leave oc right now to get some..."}
{"text":"Food was great, we ordered Carne Asada tacos and fries. Cooks have a great personality and make the environment fun. The reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the lack of customer service by the cleaning lady. We decided to eat outside and before we even took our first bit she came in front of our table and start sweeping. Who likes this being done when you're eating?! After I polity asked her to please do it after we finish eating because we do not want dust on our food, she states this is her job and will continue to sweep. I couldn't believe this. Some people have no consideration for customers. Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but me and my girlfriend got food poisoning.... Like the meat must not be at the right temp. So eat at your own risk"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to eat tacos! They are delicious and by far the best in America. We drove all the way from Washington State to try these tacos- NO JOKE (and also visit Vegas) 
This was the highlight of my trip, and I hope to visit again very soon. Oh and the Tacos de lengua were totally out of this world- AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! I visit vegas as often as possible ranging from once to twice a year and its an absolute MUST to stop by here no matter what time!!!"}
{"text":"Holy shit this place is heaven I  don't like pork a lot and I can only it the spicy pork at this place"}
{"text":"So good!!  Just make sure you get in the right line to order.  Not gonna lie, had to google a few of the items on the menu since there were unfamiliar to me.  Reasonably priced, quick, fresh, no frills, definitely a winner."}
{"text":"I live is Southern California, we know a thing or two about tacos. Tacos El Gordo may be the best tacos I've ever had. I wish they had a location here

The best taco is probably the adobado tacos. 
It's a huge piece of meat on a rotating spit, where they will shave pieces off and put in on the tacos. This is really the only reason you need to come here, I  think all the food is good but when you have perfection, why chance it.

Please, please, please, tacos El Gordo, open a Southern California location!"}
{"text":"Get the PASTOR...

OK now that we've got that out of the way, having lived literally dozens of feet away for 3 years, this is the single most thing I miss about my name old hood. The food is a top notch hole in the wall. With my homeboy always (usually) behind the counter, the service is always friendly, and this became the go to quick dinner spot for virtually all my friends coming here for their pregame dinner (which often led to the round 2 trip, post game drunken snack). While I almost always got the pastor here, both the chicken and steak are good quality and I'm partial to the Costillas en Res con Papas (sp?) You'll see a picture of it on the menu, love the grilled jalapeño.

Short story long, and not just because I have more than a few drunken (and sober) memories, but this is by far my favorite pastor in the city and I will always keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Well that was a disappointment!!! We decided to try this place out instead of the one in the strip...and I regret it!!! We asked for everything on the pastor tacos and we only got onion and cilantro with salsa on the side and no guacamole salsa anywhere to be found. I didn't want to go back and ask because I know how that goes so I said fuck it and we are. Oh and waiting in line for like 15 mins for asada tacos. That's ridiculous!!! Only waited because my kids wanted asada and to top it off it had no flavor. The horchata tasted like water with a hint of rice and sugar. Ugh never again going to that place. I rather wait an hour in line at the strip than come back to this one."}
{"text":"The most delicious asada tacos anywhere! Last month we visited Vegas from Cali & tried their other location. Their tacos al pastor were amazing. I was afraid they may have tasted so delicious because I'd been drinking a lot lol. However, we went back to Vegas this month and gave this place a try. YUM! Their asada tacos are fully loaded and the salsa is delicious. They also have grilled chiles and onions. Mmmm can't wait to go back this month!"}
{"text":"so what the one on the strip closed. its vegas people .. drive down a bit and go to the orginal spot. Same great flavor and by far the best taco in vegas! I drive out from Henderson to eat at this place and I speak noo spanish but i sure as hell know a good street taco. I was raised in San Diego and spent many nights on the streets of TJ after hitting up the clubs.. This place is the closest you'll get without needing a passport to real mexican tacos. My belly says it all!! I can't stop at just one. If your a white and have no clue what they are chopping up behind the grill. Just ask any of the cooks and they will share a little piece of meat to try and explain what it is. I keep it simple to the carne asada and the slow cooked pork (abodabo) ."}
{"text":"I never give this place enough good reviews.. it just doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for an uncomfortable time!

The food here is really good, but the restaurant itself leaves a lot to be desired.  First off, they have a chaotic system of ordering food on one side, then paying on the other side of the room.  It's not a common setup, and it seems you have to be a bit pushy to order your food.  People here seem to ignore you, or people cut in front of you.  It seems either people have bad manners or this restaurant has employees who only respond positively to other spanish speakers.  It could also be that my friend isn't the pushy rude type, but the people taking orders wouldn't acknowledge him.  

I think it's tragic that even though the food is pretty good, but the organization really sucks!  If you want one type of meat, you stand in one line, if you want another, then you have to stand in a different line.  They had 4 different lines!  I wish they would just handle orders in the back.  It's as if they think their employees are too dumb to handle orders of different types of meat.  He might mix up the carne asada with the adobada!  They look totally different, but who cares, my employees are too stupid to tell the difference!

 I really don't get it.  I might expect this sort of chaos at a food truck or an outdoor swap meet, but in a restaurant there's a much better way of running things.  It's not like the way they have things setup makes things faster or easier.  In fact, I could see someone easily ordering food and just walking out without paying because it would be impossible to tell who's paid and who hasn't especially when it is busy which it seems to be  during lunch and dinner hours.

I also found the prices to be a bit high in light of how terrible the service runs.  I'd understand paying more for food in a restaurant that is organized and nice, but with all the chaos and terrible service, I don't know why I\"d pay any more than any taco truck.  Overall I'd say stay away unless you find the place mostly empty, then it wouldn't take you forever to order your food.

Also your choices are pretty much taco, tostada, sopa, and carne fries."}
{"text":"best meat ever! its extremely fresh and flavorful.

theres 3 sections with 3 different meats. you wait in whichever line you want tacos from. the only downfall is that its kinda pricey at $2/ taco. but its definitely worth it. after getting all your food you go to the cashier to pay. 

the fries are AMAZING. they pack it to the rim, i almost couldn't close the box! i think they're far BETTER THAN ROBERTOS carne asada fries. and you get to pick from different meats, such as spicy pork (YESSS!) carne asada and a combo of both. ($10) 

its pretty packed most of the time with actual mexicans, so you KNOW ITS GOOD.

cross streets:
BRUCE ST AND CHARLESTON"}
{"text":"The million other reviews for this place sum it up nicely: Tacos El Gordo is awesomely delicious.

As prior reviewers have said, the superstar is the adobada.  The adobada line is the closest to the door and always the longest for a reason -- it's a flavor explosion.  Just make sure you ask for the pineapple and everything on it, those little additions just put it over the top.

My other faves are the carne asada, suadero, and lengua.  If you're in the mood for lengua, I'd suggest refraining from ordering the other tacos.  The simplicity of the flavors in the lengua taco -- complimented with just a sprinkling of cilantro and onions--might get overwhelmed if you flank it with an adobada which has a lot going on. 

The price for this place is also phenomenal.  I'm always stuffed after two tacos, which are $2 a piece, for a grand total of $4.00 plus tax. 

 My mouth is watering just typing this review...maybe I'll head out there for lunch..."}
{"text":"Oh my god!!! These are some of the best tacos I have ever had! The flavor of the asada tacos was perfect. Great seasoning, cooked perfectly, so good!!! The adobada tacos were very flavorful and satisfying. Ingredients were very fresh and service was great! Get there with some time though because they get extremely busy. They have 2 lines depending on what you want to order. The prices are very good, not expensive at all. I told my friends I want to go back tomorrow but I might go back tonight!!! Bring one of these to Modesto, California and I guarantee they'll be just as successful there."}
{"text":"Simply the best I love going to this taco shop people are always very friendly and the food is great"}
{"text":"Great $2 tacos, right on the strip! I tried the horchacha it was was pretty good too.  Like all the other reviews note, beware of the line-ups. Tried the beef shoulder, spicy pork, and steak tacos.  The spicy pork were the best by far.  The smokey flavour of the steak was very overpowering."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!  Im currently not getting around well do to an injury however when I entered the resteraunt the staff was quick to help. Winded from leaving my crutches in the car, I sat down. What usually is a walk up to order establishment quickly accommodated me so I wouldn't have to get up. I Knew They Had Great food, But I Was Just Completely Blown Away How Much The staff Went Above and beyond to make my experience yet another great one."}
{"text":"Is this the same taco joint as the beloved Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista?  The taste and quality of the tacos today sure didn't taste like it!  

What a complete disappointment!  I hyped this place up from Day 1 and we all braved the torrential downpour in Vegas and nasty morning hangover so that my friends could finally taste these infamous tacos.  Wow, I'm embarrassed now... They tasted like garbage.  The carne asada tacos were drenched in guacamole and the combination just tasted off.  Oh, and the spicy pork (adobada) tacos were just...different!  

I gave the Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista 5 stars, but this place deserves 1!  One star for the nice lady who handed us a roll of paper towels to dry ourselves because we looked like someone threw a bucket of water on us."}
{"text":"The best  tacos , I have ever tried 
Definitely was worth the wait and line ....
Hand made tortillas the salsas are delicious the lengua tacos are delicious as well 
Would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"I work next door at the Wynn/Encore, so Im at this place often. A top 5 place in town hands down...maybe higher for Mexican food. Believe the hype and visit this place. They are famous for their adobada ( spicy pork....not very spicy), but its delish nonetheless. Their adobada or carne asada fries are great an their tacos are authentic. 

Place gets very busy and dirty. So dont expect your meal to be perfect. Sometimes your tacos will be thrown together too fast and be below what they might be on other visits."}
{"text":"I love the asada fries!!!!!! I'll travel across town just to go to this taco restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could marry this place I would. Being from Cali, I think this is as good as its gonna get here. Skip their other location on the strip. This one is 10x's better!"}
{"text":"Horrible absolutely disgusting! This is an insult to Mexican food. Wouldn't eat in this restaurants even if it was free."}
{"text":"Holy hell, I want to make sweet, sweet love to these tacos. It was well worth the 40-min-one-way drive from Henderson. We got the chorizo, adobada, and carne asada tacos. Each one was a party in my mouth - a party catered by Hubert Keller.

In all seriousness, these tacos were amazing. I've loved Mexican food most of my life, and having lived in the southwest, I thought I'd gotten a pretty good sampling without actually going to Mexico. These were fawesome and made me a little sad that I had \"wasted\" 88 tacos' worth of money at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon the night before. The meat was succulent and flavorful. We requested \"everything,\" so each taco came with its own unique combination of fixings. I was a little nervous when I saw the heaping guacamole, but it was quite good and accentuated the meat flavor well. The giant rotating adobada is the first thing you see when you enter, and it sets the atmosphere perfectly. There's one giant counter. but there are four separate lines (in front of each grill) for ordering. Be mentally prepared to receive your tacos in hand in less than 30 seconds.

Do not be tricked into going to Los Tacos which is right next door. I haven't tried it but I can only assume it's inferior. I mean, it has a drive thru for God's sake!"}
{"text":"BEST TACO'S YOU WILL EVER EAT:

Call us Taco connoisseurs, if you will. We know how to find the best tacos anywhere and have had them everywhere form the boarder to the middle of Nebraska but if they have them, we will find them. At Tacos El Gordo we found them indeed!

This place has two dollar tacos which is a price hard to beat anywhere on the strip. They are expanding their store so you MIGHT not have to stand outside, but with as busy as this place is, you probably will have to for a short time. They serve ALL kinds of delicious tacos ranging from if you are brave or just want the amazing NOT average taco. By that I mean you can have the cow brain or carne asada (beef) and anything in between. They add a slice of pineapple to it which seriously makes the tacos out of this world and your meal would not be complete without horchata served perfectly cold to you. On the side is fried onions and peppers and add their avocado sauce to anything and everything! Also, many times the best Mexican food must be found in, forgive me, more ghetto looking areas so you know it is legit or out of a taco truck. Here, it is so clean and they serve things so well! 

I don't care what kind of food you love or where you generally like to eat, this is a MUST for you to try. Get your radishes, limes and napkins and get in line!"}
{"text":"Be ready for some street tacos. \"Delicious tacos\" & Carne Asada fries to boot. Be fore warned a small order was big enough...lol"}
{"text":"This place. I can't even speak of its flavor and deliciousness!! I wish we'd eaten here the whole time we were in Vegas. 
Since I live in Georgia, we don't get very much authentic Mexican food. The tacos are the most authentic I've eaten since I lived in Puebla, Mexico. Handmade tortillas, pastor, chorizo, and asada. Make sure to double up on the limes and radishes! 
Our Lyft driver insisted that we go because it was so good and he even waited for us! I wish we had one in Atlanta!! Perfect end to our Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Best taco's I've ever had in my life!!!! Anytime I am in Vegas, this is my to go place. Pork and steak taco is bomb!"}
{"text":"Since we haven't been 2 TJ for a few years whenever we're in Vegas we make it a point to stop in and have tacos...  The best freakin tacos I swear"}
{"text":"Heaven in a soft corn tortilla... super delicious and authentic.  

I loved the spicy pork, and the cabeza was also delicious!"}
{"text":"First time at this place, great concept great flavor on the food, and good salsas. Over all a good taco place a definitely must try for me a definitely come back. Sesos ,tripa and al pastor the bomb"}
{"text":"I had heard amazing things about this place. In all fairness the group I was with said the food was alright. However, they did not offer ANY chicken or vegetarian options which are more my style so I did not eat here even though I'd been dying to try it. Additionally, the lines were insanely long. For me certainly not worth it and my party agreed, there are a million other taco places where I have at least one option."}
{"text":"Place is on point! Especially after the club! Enjoyed the tacos and carne asada fries. My favorite was the chorizo and steak tacos. They're quick with multiple lines that serve diffeeent types of tacos. and decent price. Definitely a spot I need to go to every time I'm down in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Did i mention this place is AMAZING!!!  If you want real mexican tacos....  look no further!!  Try suadero tacos"}
{"text":"If you are a tacos person, like myself, then Tacos El Gordo is definitely a MUST if you're in Vegas! Best part (besides their food being made right in front of you) is that they're open late! The food at this location is so good, you may even come across a 45 minute wait time for it. Not always, though. They also offer other items, not just tacos. For example, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, and even asada fries! And it's reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. You do have to wait in multiple lines if you're getting different meats, but their ordering system works. So give yourself a few minutes to figure out what you're going to get and then hop in line. The last time we went I did notice they added more seating outside, so that's good, they're lines can get pretty long. Especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"On my recent trip to Vegas I was looking forward to visit this place. Sadly, I did not get the five star food I raved so much on my first review. Unfortunately, they are no longer on the strip due to parking issues with the other businesses. The tortillas are great tasting, however, the meats were very disappointing. We bit into several \"chewy\" pieces. My husband order 3 alpastor tacos and I ordered 3 asada tacos and we shared a large asada fries. My husband disliked his alpastor tacos because he said it was flavorless and they tried to covering it by drowning it with chile. All the asada tacos and fries had chewy pieces. We  ate only 1/4 of our asada fries. The meat was so full of oil that I was not able to taste the seasoning. I use to recommend this place to people before their vegas trip, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it anymore. The new place to eat in Vegas for us is SkinnyFAT."}
{"text":"Wasn't the  \"BEST\"  tacos like everybody told me. 
But one thing for sure everyone's gonna agree to many freaking lines I give them 10 stars for disorganization"}
{"text":"Tacos... tacos... tacos... I actually was really excited to try this place. I always heard such good things. \"Amazing tacos. So delicious. The best. We have to go. Good after the club munchies...\" 
Am not here to talk about the wait or how small the place is.

Maybe it's because my family is from a different mexican state, but the quesadillas were pretty small and simple. And the tacos were Ok. I was really hoping for a \"Wow\" experience. They weren't great. I will however give them big props for the guacamole on the tacos! That's a plus you don't get that on just any taqueria. 

For 7 tacos, 2 quesadillas and 3 drinks we paid $40. I feel like we got a ripped off. I've gotten better tacos for way less.

Yes, I do understand its on the strip so it has to be expensive. But this place is really over rated. 

Anyways enjoy and you can always say you crossed this off your bucketlist"}
{"text":"We tried Mulas, sopas, and quesadillas, and they were all amazing. We'll have to go back again for the tacos. 

The downside is that the whole place is a bit chaotic and there is almost always a long line. If you can get past the struggle that is ordering, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"pretty authentic style tacos, a little disorganized but nevertheless its a delicious place that is always enjoyable."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place.. It is definitely a MUST! The food is excellent. The place is ALWAYS immaculately clean! You will see the hard workers there mopping the same area 10 times! The staff is amazing! The carne asada fries are delicious! This place makes me feel like I'm at a taco spot in real Mexico! Prepare for a line! But it's well worth it:)"}
{"text":"One of the better eateries for Mexican food in town though I prefer their alternate location on Charleston Blvd."}
{"text":"Me gusta mucho ir a este restaurante es muy deliciosa la comida  y los empleados muy amables"}
{"text":"This place sucks! The hype ain't even that real. The tacos are salty af. The salsa has no flavor, the customer service is horrible . You literally have to fight for a damn table, they take for ever to get your order and once they give it to you you need to go to a separate line to pay for them. And keep in mind that shitty place is always packed so you have to make your way the register to pay for your order with your tray that has food . Would not recommend. Oh and one thing also my friends quesadilla was burned and the cheese had a weird  pink color on it. Would not recommend, don't waist your time and money on a shitty place like this."}
{"text":"Came with some friends to grab some tacos ... there was only one cook ... said it would take about 15 to 20 min ... one gentleman stood up and said he's been waiting and the cook started yelling and cursing at the guy ... he was so loud and we ended up leaving and didn't order anything ... I felt so bad for the man .. it was the worst customer service ever ... very disrespectful"}
{"text":"Such delicious tacos and fries! We got tripas, lengua, carne asada, adobada. I'll have to say though, the process of ordering is unorganized. The reason why I knocked off a star was that we spent over $100 worth of food. The lady that serves the onion and jalapeño (wearing Nike hat) was so stingy with the onion and jalapeño!!! It was about a party of 10 so we definitely needed more than 4 plates. We love jalapeño and onion! the girl at the cashier clearly told us it was FREE. The lady that served it was giving us the worst fuchi face in the world because we wanted more. She even threatened to charge us as if it was coming out of her pocket! Come on we ordered so much food and she gives us that kind of service? Not cool."}
{"text":"Their Pastor meat is GREAT, but other than that everything is mediocre at best not to mention their service organization is by far the worst I've seen, to order different meat you have to get on up to 3 different lines, so by the time your done ordering from the 2nd or 3rd line your food is cold and place has always been packed when Im there so many people end up having to wait like sharks just to find a seating spot. Will not go back here."}
{"text":"Place is bomb. Always packed no matter what time! They never skimp on the meat. I always get my taco fix here for sure. Carne asada fries are a must! Be sure to get roasted onions + jalapenos when you get your order~!!!!"}
{"text":"Adobada (spicy pork) fries get the job done my friends. Oooey, gooey cheese, perfectly marinated spicy pork, sour cream, and spoonfuls of guac top the perfectly fried and crispy fries. I've always been one to get carne asada fries at the Mexican joints down in SD or any other noteworthy spots comparable to those in SD. However, after sampling an adobada taco and a carne asada taco, I was up for trying the adobada fries and I'm glad I did! In my opinion the spicy pork was tastier than the carne asada (which can be seen on a rotating spit), although the carne asada wasn't a bad choice either. Note that an order of adobada (and I assume the same goes for carne asada) fries can be ordered in a medium ($5-$6) or large size ($10). I didn't know the medium existed until the server asked which size I wanted. I'm glad they offered this since I was already full from the two tacos I had sampled earlier!

Yeah, this joint isn't in the best location in Vegas, but that's part of the \"experience\". Hey, if that means there's less tourists, then I'm in! The servers can talk English, so just speak your order without any frills and you should be fine. Or, you can always test out the old Spanish-speaking skills you learned from school or Rosetta Stone!

It's true that there are several lines depending on the meat that you want. The far right corner was for spicy pork and I think carne asada, the next one was for the more \"exotic meats\" (tripe, cabeza, lengua, etc.), the third one to the right was for chorizo, and the last one was for grilled onions, quesadillas and such. Drinks are ordered in the center counter found toward the middle, back part of the room which is where you pay for your items. It's amazing what $2 can get you at this place!"}
{"text":"Best Dam tacos EVER !!! Theirs a lot of pple for a reson..b/c the tacos and food is on HIT !!' Yummy ...2 tacos"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best for tacos! It is also open during the wee hours of the morning. Whenever a friend comes to visit I take them here. This place has amazing carne asana tacos and does not lack on quality and the spices are very flavorful. The horchata fountain drink was also amazing. Some restaurants will \"water down\" this drink and the taste gives this away. However this place has unmatchable BOLD flavor in their drinks and tacos with reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"A bit expensive for tacos imho but totally worth it bc they were the best!!!! The owner saw I was taking one to go and asked why and if I didn't like it, I explained they were so good I HAD to take one home to my husband and he said oh no way! He insisted I eat the one I had at the table and made me a fresh FREE one to go for my hubby! #customersforlife"}
{"text":"Bad service, ask for specific order and when they got my order wrong they decided it was funny to put pan drippings on my order. Would give a zero if I could."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo has great food. Carne Asada Fries and Pastor and Adobado Tacos were as advertised.

However, I don't care how good the food is. I'm not coming back until they fix that line situation. 

At TEG you have to get in a different line for every item you are ordering. After waiting for 15 minutes to collect all of your food, you have to fight your way back through the line toward the cashier, near the exit. Then, after paying for your food, you fight your way back through the line to the far corner of the room to fill up your drink. Then, you fight your way back through the line again and hopefully you can find a seat in the always packed dining room. 

It's just not worth the hassle. And if you can't speak spanish, I would bring someone who can. It will make things a whole lot easier."}
{"text":"Went here based on reviews and was not disappointed. Delicious burritos and tacos. Carne Asada is juicy and tender and the guacamole is super fresh. Used the drive thru and the man at the window randomly gave us fresh juices squeezed from real fruit...delish! Would definitely recommend to anyone in the mood for good food and matching service."}
{"text":"Everyones revoews sound great for this place so I went to check it out. The food needs so much flavor. There was no salt, no salsa and worst of all I ordered tacos al pastor (spicy pork meat) and they told me it would be 20 min for them when 3 others ordered it after me and got them right on the spot. I would not return here at all... once I got home I opened the tacos, they fell apart, all I did was take it out of the foil... worst service ever."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today as drove by and remember the excellent food I had at the Chula Vista location in San Diego. I had high expectations coming in and I was disappointed. This was nothing like the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego. No handmade tortillas wtf! The meat selection was not what I expected. The tacos weren't bad, but nothing like the SD locations. Maybe they will get better with time but it will be a while before I come back to this one being that there are much better tacos in Phoenix than these."}
{"text":"Incredible, authentic flavors. MUST try the adobada mulas style (animal style) on corn tortillas...it comes with salty Mexican cheese, salsa, cilantro, fresh lime and creamy avocado sauce. This is by far the best taco I have ever eaten! Corn tortillas are homemade, flavors of the meat, salsas, and cilantro combined are such a vibrant taste. Reasonable prices and an absolute must stop!"}
{"text":"Tacos were fantastic and at $2 a pop too. I had the spicy pork, which weren't too spicy. I had the regular pork and didn't really taste much of a difference between the two. The one drawback is if you want different types of tacos, such as the pork and the spicy pork, you have to get on different lines. My friend got the half order of carne fries. They were huge, it was full styrafoam container of fries, cheese, pork, guac and sauce. We couldn't finish them. The lines move pretty fast, but it is a hassle to wait on more than one line. Then you still have to wait on another line to pay. They had a tent for extra seating, which was heated. We arrived near closing and this place was packed and more people were coming in. I guess it was the place to grab some grub after a night of clubbing."}
{"text":"If you're not a patient person I don't recommend you come to this location.  On an average I have waited about 15 or 20 minutes to order my food. But being a foodie I appreciate good food and especially when it's tacos. None of the staff ever seem to be overwhelmed with how many customers they have. It doesn't matter what the wait is you know you're going to get great food great service and overall it's just a fun experience. It's always extremely clean as they have employees Around the Clock cleaning up and putting everything in order. For as popular as they are, they should really consider expanding the location that's located on Charleston and Bruce. I love their tacos al pastor with everything on them...and i tell anyone that enjoys a good taco about this place."}
{"text":"Where can you get authentic, fast, cheap tacos in Vegas? TACOS EL GORDO. There's one on charleston, but this review is for the one on las vegas blvd.

Typically $2 tacos for a variety of meats: cabeza, lengua, adobada, and many more incarnations. Sad thing is I've waited so long to have amazing, real tacos until I've been introduced. Been here many times since then. 

WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A TACOS EL GORDO VIRGIN/TOURIST: Standing around awkwardly trying to figure out where to order. 

HOW TO ORDER: It's simple: one line for all other meat (cabeza, lengua etc.). One line for adobada (at least at this location). I believe they have more lines open to order, but I've come here a few times when it was just two lines. To those griping about the format of the lines, get over it. It's understandable that you want instant gratification and to get all your tacos at once, but the food comes out quick enough. If anything it's a bit more efficient. 

If you come with at least one other person (and chances are you're here with someone else) here's an idea: have one person stay in one line for a type of taco, and another person in another line waiting for the other tacos. Simple. Meet up at the register to pay for your tray. For $2 tacos and this delicious AND on the STRIP (lots of overpriced food places on the strip), it's not all that bad. You're free to try swankier places on the strip if you're that peeved. 

PERFECT FOR: Drunk people! Tipsy people! People-watchers! Night owls! Broke people! You might get a heart-attack if you ate here everyday, but you cannot beat the prices and the prime location. It does get super busy, but luckily, it's got late-night hours for that after-club/after-party bite. 

FOOD: The adobada tacos are deliciously marinated. It's fun watch it turn spit-style on a pineapple as it's being sliced for you. Flavorful, fattening, quick, and cheap. They don't skimp on the tacos either. Loaded with marinated meat, lettuce, tomatoes..my mouth is watering just remembering it. 

Carne asada fries are disappointing, yet still tasty for me. Crackly, torn adobada instead of soft mixed with guacamole and green sauce loaded (key word: LOADED) with cheese, sour cream, and fries. Nothing too special, but very filling and good for sharing. Wished it had more guacamole and green sauce. Might be a miss for some people. 

VERDICT: For the price you can't beat it. For the flavor, it's some of the best tacos in town. Overrated? Yeah. Best tacos ever? No, but it's better than Roberto's or a taco bell. This place has performed consistently for me that it's always perfectly moist, flavorful, rich meat. For others, the rush hour and lines might throw some off. Not a bad place for tourists and locals alike to try out for late night eats."}
{"text":"Great place! The tacos are authentic! The basics are covered (Steak, Beef, Prok) so anyone can go and enjoy a fantastic taco, but what adds to the experience is that there are more adventurous options available as well. For example tongue, head meat, and brain!  They are all worth trying.  Make sure you get a plate of veggies! You get grilled spicy peppers and onions that you just eat with your hands as you eat the tacos! If you live in vegas it is a must to try and if you are visiting it is well worth the 5 minute cab ride from the strip."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. This place is as close as you'll get to true tacos al pastor, short of flying to Puerto Vallarta. Authentic, roasted on the stake with pineapple. The price is great too."}
{"text":"I had a carne asada taco and a sopes with suadero. Came for a late night snack. Portion is no problem. Didn't wait at all (weekday around 10:30). 

I thought it was just okay. Nothing special and WAY too much salt. Very salty to the point where I think the flavor was actually salt. Will try another places next time. Hard to compare to all the places available in LA."}
{"text":"After all the hype I was pretty disappointed... Final verdict is that they are just ok at best. I've had better tacos at food trucks and all over SoCal. The one taco I surprisingly enjoyed was the chorizo. Expect to wait in long lines and poor service."}
{"text":"It was fine. I don't get it. Adequate tacos on the greasy side. I'd rather go to los tacos or a roadside stand."}
{"text":"My 'experience': visited this shop greater than 5 times

On the first visit we tried the beef tacos, they were amazing.
On the visits after, I tried the pork tacos with the works and pineapple! These were fabulous!! Everytime I visit vegas I make it a plan to visit this shop (near the tip of the strip). They are always open! 

I would advise against the spicey salsa they offer since it over powers the flavor of anything they put it on. 

They offer flour and corn tortillas"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo authentic. Beef tongue, tripe, brain tacos. Of course I kept it simple and ordered the spicy pork and steak tacos. I love love love this place. it's so good, you must go the next time you are in Vegas. And don't bring much money here, you won't need it! (good deal!)."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of crowds or waiting, but the tacos here are totally worth the wait! Be prepared to get in line, but it does move pretty quick. The tacos al pastor are the best I've ever had! They have 5 different stations with 3 different setups. You just get in the line of what you'd like to order and there it is. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Zero stars it was the worst.. food cold no flavor... do your self a favor and don't waist your money or time in this place"}
{"text":"Tried many taco places in Vegas and Tacos el Gordo is absolutely the BEST TACO place period!! The one drawback as others have mentioned is their ordering procedure, they must change it! It's frustrating and it doesn't make sense. I hope they change it someday."}
{"text":"First time eating here it was A-1, huge portions and the food was soooooo good best tacos I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"If I could give half a star I would, this place is ALL HYPE. I came here on a recommendation from someone else, I'm Mexican just so you know... The food isn't even authentic, they're making a killing because it's busy and it's super and I mean SUPER OVERRATED. The carne asada is the worse meat I've ever had, dry like beef jerky and zero flavor. The salsas blow too, no heat or flavor and you can't even self serve the chili, oh did I mention you have to wait in separate lines to order depending on what meat you want ? Save your money."}
{"text":"The VAMPIROS are to die for! I went there last weekend with my friends and they introduced me to arguably one of the best mexican places I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. The only question is, what's better Taco's el gordo or Roberto's? They are both awesome and if you like mexican food you should go to both!"}
{"text":"Everything here is great, the tacos are delicious.  I would recommend to anyone in Vegas.  Only issue is having to wait in the line for different items. Should be 5 stars, but those dang lines."}
{"text":"The line was long,but the food is very, very good! I recommend eating the beef tongue. Since the taco is very small, I recommend getting 3-6 tacos.If you want more or less, go for it! If you live out of Las Vegas, this is a must eat!"}
{"text":"As much as I want to give this place a four star I can not! The wait time is ridiculous!! Ordering system is so complicated. There's different lines for different types of meat. So if u want tacos de tripa, al pastor, and sopes  you are looking at three different lines ...to complicated! 
I waited more than an hour for some delicious carne asada fries and four tacos de tripa that were way too salty! Never again."}
{"text":"Such amazing food! If you're within an hour or Vegas, go! Totally worth the drive or traffic! Best Mexican in Vegas"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. The tacos here are awesome. It's $2.25 each but think it's a bit overpriced. I am used to the 2 tacos for 1 price. The tacos are small but taste wise. It is one of the best tacos I have ever had. The flavor is unique. I only get 2 types. The al pastor and the cabeza. You can't beat the flavor but be prepared to pay the price. Ordering is fast and easy. This place is always crowded so be prepared to wait just a little."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo has several walk up windows, it's cafeteria style. They're known for adobada or spicy pork tacos. The pork is sliced off the rotisserie and topped with cilantro, onion, and a creamy cilantro guac sauce, and also pineapple if you'd like. They have carne asada, too, and more rare finds like tongue, head and tripe. All tacos are $2.

The Adobada was good, but not spicy nor tasty enough to order a second.

The Carne Asada earned no stars, the meat had an odd flavor almost musty and the runny guac helped it none."}
{"text":"We stopped into what is known as the \"Truck Taco\" resturant in downtown las vegas. As we entered the room it was clear this place was pretty popular! We were a party of 5, & ordered 17 tacos & they were made with haste ! Very quick & amazing flavor its Worth every minute, I highly recommend the carne asada tacos !"}
{"text":"Got myself al pastor and tripas , and they were pretty good , but never compared to the tacos el gordo from Tijuas.....I will recommend still , but be prepared to spend above average"}
{"text":"Pure delicious awesomeness. Where else can you get cow tongue, brain, and head tacos? Don't worry, they also have excellent (normal) beef and pork options. Very nice people too. When I was told that they don't have tamales, a sweet employee even gave me one of hers that she brings in for her fellow coworkers. Skip the overpriced casino eateries and grab a couple of tacos for just $2 each (and you might even get a free tamale)."}
{"text":"Este lugar aparte que se están volviendo más caros y los productos los están haciendo más pequeños, el servicio está muy mal y los taqueros son antihigenicos. 
Mi esposo y yo fuimos a almorzar y el taquero se estaba tocando su cara y rascándose su cabeza y no se lavó las manos o cambio sus guantes cuando ese es el procedimiento adecuado. 
Nos quejamos con la gerente y ella no hizo nada al respecto al contrario se mostró argumentativa, conflictiva y a la defensiva.
Al final nos fuimos muy molestos y ya no regresaremos a este lugar."}
{"text":"The #1 Taco Spot in Las Vegas. These are legit, authentic Tijuana tacos. Tortillas are corn, hand-made all day, everyday. Their meat is straight from the grill to your plate. They have carne asada, adobada, cabeza, tripa, buche, azteca, suadero, lengua, and chorizo. Their adobada is spit-roasted with juicy pineapple on top. On top of authentic flavors, they offer a variety of dishes including soles, mulas, quesadillas, tostadas, or, if you're having a cheat day or just a fat kid like me, have your choice of meat on top of a to-go container of fries with guacamole, sour cream, and shredded cheese. That'll finish your night perfectly after the tequila shots. However, I can't say your morning will be any better. A must try for Vegas visitors and a must staple for Vegas locals."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos.the best n town.if u love tacos go here..I'm from compton California they have good street tacos Las Vegas NONE well a few but NASTY.
Believe I try them and it's not good."}
{"text":"Price ass tacos ever 5 tacos 2 asadas fries and 2 can sodas $40 dollars I was expecting the best flavor for that price but guess what no even close to $20 dollars flavor I better go to the taco truck for the best flavor"}
{"text":"I just to love coming  here. Not anymore the service I got was horrible.one of the guys at the Carne asada station  he was  so rude!!  And  when i was letting the manager know about the service  another customer had the same experience.and the food is not the same anymore ..the only good  thing is the guy at the Carne al pastor he is friendly and fast. I'm never coming back!!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy!!! The customers were super friendly to this girl who didn't know how to order non-spicey tacos!!! LOL The Asada fries are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Yo people. Tacos take about 10 to 15 minutes max to eat. Don't be a jerk and snipe a table while your friend gets in line. People could sit down, eat and leave by the time you get your food and pay for it. 

Another tip, you can order any tacos from any of the counters, not the the one listed. Seems that was confusing for people as they were jumping from window to window. 

The tacos here are crazy delicious and the lines of faithful lined up to get at them shows that. Ultimate drunk food snack. My favorite is probably Tripes as it has a crispy texture, but you really can't go wrong with any of them. Sesos or Brain I am a bit wary of so I can't speak to the quality of that but I'm sure its good if that's your thing. 

Everytime I'm in Vegas I need me these tacos."}
{"text":"We found this mexican restaurant by accident while walking down the Las Vegas blvd. Since there was a long queue of peole waiting to order their food we thought: that must be a good place to have diner. The menue is in spanish with only a few english translations. Depending on what you want to eat you have to line up either at counter 1, 2 or 3. With zero spanish knowledge I mamaged to order to tacos with spicy pork. The tacos were super delicious with plenty of fresh herbs and a spicy sauce. Two tacos were about 5$ and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"The best tacos I have ever had, and I'm Mexican so I know good Mexican food. The carne asada is my favorite--it's seasoned and sliced to perfection. I honestly don't want to eat any other tacos unless it's these, and I don't even live in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My first stop once I get my car rental is Taco El Gordo. Win or loose in Vegas this place gets a minimum of 3 visits during a 5 day trip. The pork tacos are out of this world. I feel like I am in Mexico from the first to last bite. I would give this 10 stars if I could. Thanks for making this a must whenever I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is an excellent place if you are mexican and missing your tacos. I'm mexican and got to say this restaurant is more mexican then beans and wetbacks, they have food at great price, its clean, they have natural flavored water like jamaica, horachata, and naranjada. The price ranges from 2-3 dlls in tacos, 8-15 dlls in carne asada fries, and their attitude is great, eventhough non of the cooks speak spanish. they have tacos, carne asada fries, tostadas, even tacos de chorizo and that is even rare in mexican taco shops, they have cebollitas asadas and chiles tatemados. It\"s great for the money."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore the tacos. They are SO worth the wait. And there is almost always a wait. I highly recomend tacos ' al pastor'."}
{"text":"a whole in the wall where the area around it is kind of shaddy but the food was WAY batter then i thought!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pastor tacos in town. The restaurant is small and seating is hard to find. You literally are waiting for people to finish eating in order to take their seat. Besides the crowd, the place has good street tacos. My first time here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I liked the system that they have where you order your tacos directly from the kitchen, it makes the service faster. After you get your order you go the cashiers and pay and you can order your drink as well.
I tried tacos al pastor and honestly the quality was not quite what I was expecting, it was chewy. I also tried the sopes w/carne asada, cheese but it didn't had any beans. The cranes asada was better, but a bit on the salty side. I might try one more el gordo taqueria in a different side of town (I went to the one on the strip)."}
{"text":"Best tacos you could get on the strip. My recommended order. Tacos adobada extra crisp aka dorada (so you get the crunchy top of the rotisserie) everything on top plus pineapple & ask for a side of grilled onion heads

You're welcome"}
{"text":"Not as good as the old place on the strip. Merely adequate, for the long ride there. Be sure to get in the right line and be patient. The place kind reminded me of International Blvd in O-town. Might be too urban for the non city crowd."}
{"text":"The only place from keeping this place from being the bomb is HOTTT sauce.  
Pork check
Steak check
Stomach check
SMALL fries check, yes the small is more than enough!!!
This will soak up all the booze after a long day and night of drinking.

Did I tell you I was here twice in 26 hours???"}
{"text":"Read the online reviews, had to give it a shot, place was packed but the line moved quickly, good prices, pastor tacos are on point, will def try and go back while im in town!"}
{"text":"So this place came highly recommend , it did not disappoint !  I haven't had a good taco like this since I was in tijuana.  Went with the Al pastor (pork) , they had a line split up for each type of meat (even though it seems like you could have ordered from any of the lines , but I rather give my order directly to the correct guy.   Meat was great , sauce was great.  Will def be coming back."}
{"text":"Tasty food made fairly authentically.  The cut the meet in front of you, make the tortillas from scratch and offer you a friendly smile as they serve you.  The food is really good...not the best mexican I ever had, but certainly a dependable option if you want to get away from the mainstream vegas joints off the strip."}
{"text":"Nothing special, really. The meat on the tacos  is tasty and not overbearing with the charcoal taste. They'd be better if the guacamole didn't feel too processed. Careful when you select tortillas with the mulitas. I accidentally ordered tortilla de maiz and completely compromised the mulita experience.

If you're planning on coming, don't forget to bring your patience. The lines are pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"Yes, 2 dollars/street taco is a little steep. But it's still cheaper than most food places on the Strip.

I ordered 2 carne asada and 2 spicy pork tacos. then i went back and ordered 2 more spicy pork tacos.  If I were to go back I'd order 6 spicy pork tacos.

Maybe I've been on the East Coast for too long but after the first bite of the spicy pork taco I felt like weeping for joy."}
{"text":"This place was awesome small Loki great food great prices the menudo was off the hook perfect for a nice Saturday hangover staff was friendly the service was awesome"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place!

I have to visit every time I come to vegas and it seems like I always get the same thing. The Adobada tacos (spicy pork). The creamy green sauce makes the taco even more delicious.

I've also had the half order of the carne asada fries. For two people, this is usually plenty because they fill up the half togo box full of fries and they give you a good amount of meat. And what makes it better? THE CREAMY GREEN SAUCE! The fries are crunchy and they come right out of the fryer.

I'm going to keep coming back until this place either disappears or stops making good food (hopefully that never happens) =]"}
{"text":"The best place to eat in Las Vegas. The food was fragrant and looked great. The service was on top. Great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place after hearing my friend rave about it and knew i had to come try it for myself.. my friend got the carne asada fries and I got two carne asada quesadillas..I was not impressed... maybe because there was a long line but when I got my tacos the meat was completely burned and hard."}
{"text":"i got a quesadilla from here and wasnt even close to it. not even carne asada by the way more like steak"}
{"text":"What a find! We were stopped by the security guard asking us to bag our beers. He was very polite so we decided to go in. We've now eaten there 3 days in a row! Not only is the food cheap, but it tastes great! Everything we try new we like better. And the \"flip the sauce\" flair is a fun bit to watch. Makes this end of the strip worth a visit."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas I will definitely make it a point to come over here. Authentic TJ tacos. Very flavorful and reasonably priced. About $2.10 for a taco. Go in and pick a line according to the meat you want. Doesn't matter if you want a burrito, taco, quesadilla, or fries. From there being your tray to the cashier to pay. Also don't save seats until you are done paying for your food, or just leave your kids at the seats. They no longer have the outdoor patio so seats are limited. Overall great place. Probably the best Mexican food in Vegas. Go there you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Had four meals here in three days. 2 dollars a taco. These seem authentic. Each order comes with a plate with hot peppers and green onion. Really notches up the spice. Limes and horseradish sides by the pop and straws. My favorites were the steak and spicy pork. Beef shoulder wasn't nearly as good...a little more dry.

Each comes with guac, usually a condiment specific to the taco you get, onion, cilantro. 

If you want to really treat yourself, arrive when they open at 1030 AM and get the steak fresh to order. Great to have an alternative to the over-priced/under-valued food options on the strip.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Overrated!!!! We heard that these tacos are the best in Las Vegas so me and my Girlfriend decided to check it out... It's way off the strip and its like you walked into Paisa Heaven! There was Moms and Tia's who just got out of a quinceñera, paisas outside bumping corridos peeling out in there old dropped on switches Chevys! But I'm from the hood of LA Highland Park to be exact so that's like going home for me! Anyway we stood in a long ass line, we got tacos de cabeza, Adobado and asada. The cabeza was on point really good!!! The Adobado was ok I think your paying for the show of el compa taquero cutting the meat of the spinning rack and dumping all that guacamole and chile on it and it makes you believe your in TJ show! It was just ok nothing spectacular or anything! The Asada was bad! The best part about that taco is the tortilla and the guacamole other than that it Taste dry like it was boiled asada... I've had asada 10 times better from one of our mediocre taco trucks in LA! So it was ok but nothing to drive way off the strip for! To be honest I'd rather go to Tacos Mexico by the stratosphere if they we're open That late."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos ever! Meat is cooked and sliced in front of you as you order. Whatever you order, it's EXTREMELY TENDER! Plus it has all the fruit drinks you love including horcata! This is a MUST DINE when in Vegas and all the time if you live here."}
{"text":"The tacos are ridiculously good if you get them with all the toppings. I had the al pastor tacos with everything and they were really good. I also tried a mulita with al pastor pork and it was good as well. These tacos have a different taste to them and that's what keeps me coming back. 
The downside is that lines are huge and the lay out of the interior of the restaurant causes chaos. I was waiting in line to order while people were sitting down and eating next to me and others were trying to get through for drinks or other items. 
I would recommend this taqueria though."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I have ever had.  This place is a little gem in the middle of the bright lights of the strip.  Awesome find and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"This seems to be a very popular and busy taco place and for good reason as they're pretty darn good.  Their tortillas might be home made and the meat and fixings they use are very tasty to.  I think it's hard to stand out when you make tacos but they do a fairly well job and I can see myself coming back for more.  I'd suggest you try to get inside seating during the winter time to avoid your tacos getting cold as it happened to me.  Although that may be easier said then done as this place seems to be busy most of the time at least."}
{"text":"this place is the Bomb. Tacos just like from Mexico. now it's larger since they expanded the side to the left."}
{"text":"Thanks again Yelpers! 

After reading a few reviews of this place at work, I had to try it on my day off. 

I really like the idea of ordering from the cooks, which is how this place operates. On April 5th, at around 9:30PM, I ordered 3 Carne Asada and 3 Adoboda tacos. The order also came with grilled green onions and yellow chillies on the side. Their green chili sauce is SO good too. 

The tacos were fantastic. OK in size at first glance, but after eating a couple, they pack a good punch. Still no match for my appetite on this day. I never tried Adoboda before and it looked so good roasting in front of me, so that was easy to order. The Asada was also looking good just off the grill. Both tacos were really good, however, I did enjoy the Adoboda more than the Asada. Also, the side onions and chillies are mandatory (for me) after tasting them with my meal. 

Overall, I can't wait to back to this place again. I'm definitely going to get more Adoboda tacos and try what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, slightly chaotic process....

The tacos al pastor are crazy delicious. The abadoba fries cannot be beat (I did not eat any, but the person I bought them for ate literally non stop and with a vengeance). 

Some people don't like the $2.00 per taco price, but most places are around $1.79 - $1.89 and don't come close. So  less than a quarter more per taco for 10 X's the flavor is still a good deal to me. 

The only drawback is the process. You get to the window, belt out your order, hang back and wait. You need to keep an eagle eye on your food otherwise it might unintentionally walk off. After that you wander over to the cashier and pay. Don't get me wrong, it works, just a bit unorganized is all. 

With that said, the staff is great and the place is very clean. 

Also, I would (as mentioned in my other reviews) hit the tip jar when you place your order. It not only helps the staff out but almost always insures an exceptional meal."}
{"text":"The food is good and very authentic.. However...... On my visit today( it's been like 6 weeks) today me and my bf came for lunch.. The tacos are on a smaller tortilla and :) thy no longer double the tortilla because you won't get as full of course so you'll buy more!!! Morale of the story another greedy ass company!! Smh"}
{"text":"Be armed with patience and two friends. The ordering system is stupid. You can only place certain orders at certain windows. 

The tacos look like Tijuana tacos, but they are not worth the wait or headache to even get an order in."}
{"text":"These tacos were the most authentic tacos i've ever had outside of Mexico....and they dont skimp you with the meat either...keep it up you guys"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Just north of Encore on Las Vegas Blvd, it was a cheap $6 cab fare from The Mirage, (ten minute walk back afterwards) The Tacos were out of this world fresh. Meat sliced right into the tortilla from the spinning rotisserie of spicy pork or beef. Topped with fresh homemade salsas, cilantro and onion. The small but comfortable outdoor patio was perfect for the sunny day. We only wish we had gone sooner, not on our last day before heading home! Delicious, and only $2 a taco is a steal so close to the strip. Most delicous and cheapest meal you will find."}
{"text":"The line was not that bad when I went but worth the wait. Delicious food at a very reasonable price. Overall a good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place gets four stars from me because it was literally steps from the hotel we stayed in, and they opened late for the late night drunks. 

I am a very conventional American Mexican food consumer.... give me tacos, enchiladas, burritos, even a suiza and I'm happy. I do not venture into the exotic and wild Mexican dishes of tongue, head, brain... ahem... sounds kinky but I digress.

I stayed safe and tried the steak taco, and it was tasty. I would have tried chicken, but to my dismay, el pollo did not appear on the menu.

It's a good, clean, typical fast food spot if you're looking for Mexican food. Especially if you're drunk and need a place which opens late to absorb some of the alcohol you've consumed."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN THE WORLD!! If you come to Vegas make sure to stop by here! They close really late so it's super convenient. I love tacos al pastor!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We orderd 12 tacos for 2 people and finished 8. Line was long so anticipate waiting for a while; plus there are 3 separate lines for whatever flavor you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"The tacos are authentic but they are not great. I'm sure the adobada taco is the reason why they get such good reviews, but the different lines are ridiculous. The lines at the strip location were unbearable. I am not sad to see it go. The prices aren't that great when you consider everything is a la carte. There are better Mexican options in town. I'm sure most of their reputation is in the fact that the strip location was cheap in comparison to all the things around it."}
{"text":"The first time I tried it on the strip I wasn't a fan because the food was somewhat cold and I tried the carne Asada fries and tacos. I am definitely not a fan of the carne Asada here. However, gave it a second go, and I tried the adobada. It was reallllly good.

Here's my second time in Vegas with my BF and we ate here twice. Ordering a whole bunch of adobada tacos. Their sauce is really good. 

One thing I hate is how packed it gets and having to swoop up on a table as soon as someone leaves. Thank goodness the nice ladies clean the table as soon as they can :)"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town 
Love the al pastor tacos with the green sauce 
And the quesadillas are good as well"}
{"text":"OMG, so good.  Spiced pork to die for.  This place is no secret... packed!"}
{"text":"Adobada is great but other meats are just ok. Very pricey. It took 8 tacos to fill me up. With a drink $20. could have ate at red lobster for that much."}
{"text":"I love these tacos especially with pineapple on top! The cashiers are always nice. Love getting this late night meal!"}
{"text":"The tacos took me back to Tijuana! Tasted exactly the same....excellent!! Be prepared to stand in line for quite some time (because everyone wants some lol). Only gave 4 stars because they need to come up with a better more organized way to order. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying Tacos El Gordo and it was definitely worth the wait you have to endure if ordering lengua, buche or tripa. 

The lengua was one of the better ones I have ever had. Soft, tender and tasteful so it  was well worth the wait. The grilled onions, radishes made a perfect combo with the lengua.

The tripa, which I had not had in a while, was perfect. It was crispy, chewy and just enough salt to being it all together. 

Having to wait for service isn't terrible because it is a small place and what looks like a popular destination. Definitely a place to try if Mexican is desired."}
{"text":"If this review was based solely on their food then they would get 5 stars easily. Their tacos are the only items I have had here and I must say they are delish! The meat is very succulent, the tortilla is just right, and the sauces are not too in your face if you know what I mean. The cooks work very hard and prepare your food right in front of you which is a huge plus, so tip them if you can afford it. The problem is the area, it's extremely hot, it feels like you're on the surface of planet mercury and the air conditioning in the joint is inadequate. I saw the poor cooks sweating balls, the owner should provide additional air conditioning units for them. Other than all that this place is really good, if you happen to be in the Las Vegas area please give this place a try."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade type food. Makes you feel like your in Mexico! This place is really good for a quick homemade type meal. I got 3 Carne Asada tacos and a Sopes. Everything was made to order fresh and clean. My friends got Carne asada fries and chorizo tacos. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Meat was not cooked all the way , was definitely not  impressed at all with the tacos here heck I make better tacos at home!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said in the myriad of reviews of this place?  I come here as often as I can for one item only - the Adobada tacos. They are uh-maze-ing!   The carne asada tacos are pretty good as well but the flavor compared to the spicy pork (adobada) pales.  Come here, order some spicy pork tacos, thank me later."}
{"text":"Soooooo tasty!!  Only $2 a piece?!? Worth the wait line. After having these tacos I felt it wasn't fair to pay more than $2 for a taco knowing these are on point!! Asada tacos taste GREAT and have salsa and guac on top and the adobada with pineapple is AMAZiNg!!! You cannot miss put on this gem :) eat there now!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican tacos.  Not your carne-asada tacos, much better. Great selection and fast service."}
{"text":"I've been to this place in Tijuana and the last time I tried it here in Vegas was about 6 years ago. The food definitely does not take taste like it use to. Extremely salty lost its original flavor. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. Customer service is great.
The only dislike is the long wait to get food from three different lines and to get a table to sit and eat. Overall it's worth the wait and we'll be coming back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food. Limited menu, but what they do they do very well. Wanted to eat here for a long time after hearing about it from friends and reading the reviews, I was not disappointed. Great value, and tasty. If you get the adobadas with everything be sure they include the pineapple bits."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever. Period. The manager or owner was very welcoming. He gave us free samples of all the different meats. I was very pleasantly surprised by the pork stomach and the cow tongue. The spicy pork tacos are a must. They are cooked on a rotisserie like a gyro yummy"}
{"text":"This place is a cluster f@*#. We got in the Adobada taco line because my husband wanted those. I wanted Carne Asada, So then we had to get in the Carne Asada line. How lame is that!? So while we are waiting for the Asada, the Adobada is getting cold. Thank God we didn't want a different type of taco that was in the third line. We asked if the same red sauce that is on the Adobada is on the Asada, we were told it was. Then we get the tacos and walk over to yet another line, the Pay Line. Turns out they did not put the same red sauce on my tacos. They put on some chunky ass tomato stuff on top. I can't stand that stuff. NO WAY I was waiting in that line again so I didn't get to eat. My husband ate my tacos. I did however taste the Adobada taco, not bad but it's not worth all the praise this place gets."}
{"text":"Wow, spicy pork = Mexican shawerma incredible, best tacos I've ever had no competition."}
{"text":"I've only been here once with my girlfriend (aka my future wife), but it was hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had. The adodaba (spicy pork) tacos were amazing, but what really surprised me were the fries that had both adobada and carne asada and some amazing sauces whose name escape me, but all I know is they were the best fries I've ever had. I will be coming back as often as possible."}
{"text":"The BEST TACOS IN LAS VEGAS.
I like this location better because its right next to main street and its convenient. It does get very crowded during lunch time you would most likely have to get in line to order but it is very worth it because they are so good. They do have a lot of variety in food. You can tell the tortillas are fresh and hand made. I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Okay so my friends and I were curious about when this place closes since we were out around 10 pm. We read some reviews and looked at the websites and some said it closed at 10 and others said it's 24 hrs. When we got there, it said when it opens until \"late\" - there's no specific time they close. Also, there's an honor code there. After you wait in line for your tacos you go to the cash register to pay for them across the room. The tacos are okay and it's price is kind of high for tacos. Their marinated meat was pretty bomb. I waited in line for 15 mins or so and the cook quickly made the tacos when I got there. Overall my experience was good."}
{"text":"These are the best tripa tacos ever, and tripa quesadilla! Every time we come to Vegas, this is a must stop. Today we stopped on a Thursday and it was nice to not have to deal with the hectic crazy weekend crowds.. The older gentleman cutting the Al pastor was very nice as well as the younger guy serving tripa. Everything was delicious like always."}
{"text":"Hands down best taco spot in Vegas. My favorite are the tacos, mulitias, and vampiros adobados. Might be the most delicious and affordable meal on the strip."}
{"text":"The best place for carne asada tacos, they have many choices. Worth the wait in line. The employees are friendly.  Order in line and pay in a different makes it quicker."}
{"text":"Lines can be long but they go fast and it's worth the wait.  Tasty and inexpensive.  Yum"}
{"text":"Really good tacos! You could tell a lot of locals come in here. The have multiple lines. You must get in line based on the type of tacos you want to order. You order get your food then pay.

I got pastor and carne asada along with carbe asda fries. Everything was fresh and delicious! They were carving the meat as soon as you ordered it. The fries were so American but so awesome!

Would definitely return for some great food!"}
{"text":"As a fat guy, I've gotta love the name!

Stopped by at about 9:30 on a Sunday morning and there was a pretty good crowd.  Thanks to the other Yelp reviews, I kinda/sorta knew what I was doing.

Had the adobado taco and a couple o' lengua tacos with everything.  Very good and reminded me of street tacos in Mexico that I consumed in a former life.

Solid food, and a very friendly staff!  I'll make the trek down Charleston to Tacos El Gordo on my next visit."}
{"text":"It's nice to see an El Gordo on the Strip!  If I get a little too drinky, I can just take a taxi or the Duece to the north end o' the Strip.  As a tourista, I just feel a bit safer here than at the Gordo on Charleston.

I was at Tacos El Gordo on a Saturday afternoon and decided to strap on the feed bag:  one adobada taco, one cabeza taco, and a small order of carne asada fries.

Sadly(?), something got lost in translation between the beef guy and the fries guy and I received a grande order of carne asada fries.  Yikes.  They only charged me for a small order, but still...

I devoured the tacos and made a pretty good dent in the carne asada fries.  Couldn't stop eating them, even though I knew I should.  

Had to nap up for a couple of hours after getting back to the hotel due to a carne asada-induced coma.

Lost a couple of hours of gambling time, but I won't hold it against Tacos El Gordo.  Everyone is very friendly, even to a gringo gordo such as myself.

Five stars."}
{"text":"Was not thrilled at all...the tacos were bland and the fact that there is limited seating is horrible because then you have to stand outside and eat.  The way the ordering is its horrible 4-5 different lines to get tacos.  If you want 2 different types of tacos you have to go on 2 different lines."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have had from a restaurant. I recommend anyone who is from Las Vegas or visiting Las Vegas to stop by this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is dabomb.com! I always order the al pastor tacos and eat a few bites of my husbands cow tongue tacos. (The cow tongue is extremely tasty, but I can't get rid of the mental barrier enough to eat whole ones). We've tried random taco places and vendors around town, and none of them are as good as this place so we keep returning. My husband lived in Mexico for a few years and even said these are the closest to authentic he's been able to find. You can get flour tortilla's instead of corn if you just ask."}
{"text":"I had huge expectations for this place and it just disappointed. The place is over hyped, the way people talk about I thought it was gonna be the best thing ever. It was mediocre at best. It's expensive. You're better off going to Robertos taco shop for the quality of the food. I would recommend Taco Y Taco over this."}
{"text":"Fast food environment but best tacos I've ever had. No frills kinda place and you're not going to get full on rice and beans because there are none. And you don't need em. Tacos are that great!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best friggin taco I have ever had! The spicy pork was all I ate! Little confusing layout (ordering tacos from different sections) Love the mexican soda fountain machine too with all the odd cream based sodas! Tip ask for the handmade tortilla instead of the prepacked ones! Its WAY better and fresh!"}
{"text":"The al pastor is good and everything else is bland 
The service itself sucks A$$ big time 
The old lady with a vest behind the register seems to be the owner 
She's rude as hell , I have never witness someone ever being so danm rude and unfriendly. Won't be going back ."}
{"text":"This was a great quick lunch spot!  The food was really tasty- more authentic Mexican than I am used to and very flavorful!   We had the pork Sopes and the Tacos de Asada.   I really didn't know what exactly was coming on what I ordered- but it was delish!    Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"great spot for tacos. gets very crowded. its hot as hell inside. tacos are ok. not true tasting like the tacos from TJ but the average person will love them. mulas are awesome (sincronisadas, quesadillas with your choice of meat). my fav taco joint in vegas so far!"}
{"text":"I finally got around to Tacos El Gordo. The tacos were fairly good and tasted authentic although I'm not really sure what authentic is but have had excellent Mexican food in California and Texas. My only problem with them were that they were small. I also tried their quesadillas, which is one of my favorite Mexican foods, but I wasn't crazy about the open face style, which seems to be typical at these authentic places and maybe because this is the authentic way of cooking them. I probably will go back and give Tacos El Gordo another try."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Vegas! $2/taco but worth it. If you come with another peraon and you both want diffferent types of tacos i would recommend each of you getting in a line since there are 3 different lines. This place is always full and long lines so be patient!"}
{"text":"The place had a different approach to Mexican food than what I was used to here in America, and I've been to many. The tacos were small but good with lots of stuff on them. The quesadillas were just OK with a different spin on them. They were open face with a small crunchy tortilla on top to give it some crunch I guess and they used a mild type of a Mexican white cheese. Be careful because the food is very messy since there's a lot of stuff they put on it. It's a super busy place and  very unorganized. It was confusing for the first time and I didn't know where to start to order. Not being fluent Spanish doesn't help and I don't think they care to help because you're in their territory so figure it out yourself. I found it was kind of cafeteria style where you order from one station and go to the next. But when I went to the next, some new arrivals were there trying to order things and I thought they were taking cuts. Maybe I was wrong because there were different starting points. Who knows but the food was OK."}
{"text":"This place has the worst ordering service ever! I don't care that they are so called, \"the best tacos in town\" they're just tacos! The wait is too long and you have to make different lines to order different types of meat tacos..Wtf! And people continue to go even though everyone complains about the same thing. At the end their tacos are not that great! I don't care what anyone has to say! Go to Taco Y Taco in Henderson. Now that place has amazing tacos, great service, and the place looks very upscale for the same price!"}
{"text":"Best tacos outside of Tijuana.  Actually better than most Tijuana tacos!  The Al Pastor is a must!"}
{"text":"Hi Tacos el Gordo!
Just wanted to let you know that the only reason we came to you for tacos (and knew what to do/to get/how to order)were the reviews you got on Yelp...to think we could have driven by and scoffed at your establishment like the gringos we are!! Everything is so freaking good...the adobado is like crack, the grilled onions and peppers great additions to the best fresh tortillas we've ever had.
If there were more than 5 stars avail we'd give it to you BUT for the decor, smell, and overall chaos inside this kinda-shady location off the strip.  Seriously, TEG, clean up your act a bit (place smells a bit like a latrine, no clear lines for food unless you are \"in the know\" and are prepared to eat whatever is handed to you wherever you end up at the grill, and we're not certain if there was carne asada or dirt on the floor everywhere)...clean it up just a smidge and you would be millionaires by months end by our visits alone.
Mucho besos,
Us"}
{"text":"We had a lot of tacos, half lengua fries, and horchata.

Fries: good, but lots of sauce and sour cream on top. The meat was good, but towards the end, the softness/fluffiness started to bother me. Would skip next time and get another taco, since we were stuffed as well.

Tacos:
1. Adobada x2: delicious
2. Suadero: great
3. Buche x2: chewy, good
4. Al pastor: good

Horchata: not as cinamon-y as I like, but good.

Price: $21 for 2 people

Verdict: We tried lots of different things, so that was fun. The different lines are annoying. The food was greasy, but you already expect it. I'll stick with Taco y Taco since that's closer (and because I think I prefer it)."}
{"text":"Food is good but tacos overpriced. Incredibly inefficient order taking process! Expect to stand in line for a while!"}
{"text":"this place sucks, flys everywhere the tacos were small the meat cold, no hot sauce no rice or beans as sides, what kind of taco joints is this, stay away expensive for what you get cold food and very small portions. Two big thumbs down."}
{"text":"Everything about this place seemed terrific but man, my two Asad's tacos were too salty for my taste. I couldn't eat them. But this place seems like it should be in Tijuana it's so Mexican including face meat and beef brain Taco options. Maybe I shouldn't have asked for everything on it. That might have included a extra dash of salt."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a local and Tacos el Gordo satisfy this gordo lol. Take tacos, good selection, open late and even offers a shuttle to other location if too busy. 

Only downside is that it's always pack (that should say something about the food) so line can get pretty long at times. Best time to go to avoid the crowd is usually as soon as they open or around 10pm as everyone is either getting ready for bed or getting ready to hit up the clubs

*the long line is the reason for only 4 stars"}
{"text":"This my favorite taco place hands down. I'm from So Cal and it beats all our taco stands there. They have a wide variety of tacos! Everything fresh and clean. All staff is super nice and fast. I recommend the Suadero, Tripa and Buche!"}
{"text":"We went here Tuesday around 5pm and there was no line. Ordered adobada & Carne asada fries! They were the best! Meat was fresh and tender. No wonder there's a very long line especially on the weekends because their food was great."}
{"text":"The place is pretty crowded, so you have to wait a long line but it's worth it. The food is very authentic and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"These are real tacos el gordo from tj!!! Delicious tacos with lots of guac!! Home made tortillas this place is the bomb. If u want real tacos come here."}
{"text":"A long overdue return visit to El Gordo. Went post MNF / drinking at a local tavern - the perfect reason to get a plateful of tacos ! 

At first, didn't recognize the place - the store lay out basically flip flopped ! That didn't affect the enjoyment of some asada tacos, linguica, pork, etc. it was ALL GOOD ! 

why can't you be on the westside ,El Gordo, Why ?!?"}
{"text":"The best tacos I ever had! The tongue taco was my favorite and costs about $2.50. There are three different lines to stand in to get the food you want; However, the lines move fast."}
{"text":"Came here twice (some guys three times) with a bachelor party for my big brother in the same day.  Inexpensive, quick, and hit the spot.  Reasonable walking distance to Palazzo if you're staying there and worth every penny.  Wish they had one of these near my hometown."}
{"text":"this place is amazing! best authentic tacos north of the border. the spicy pork (which isn't at all spicy) and the lengua (tongue) are the best tacos in the house. if you're one of those types that doesn't eat tongue just because its tongue, lose that attitude because you're missing out. you can also get a \"quesadilla\" which is basically a taco with yummy melted cheese. great stuff. \"vampiro\" which is basically like a taco sandwich tostada, more deliciousness. a couple knocks though, no chicken tacos and the carne asada is average to below average. but trust you go there for the lengua or the spicy pork"}
{"text":"Amazing tasting tacos, meat is soft and very well prepared, tortillas prepared in front of your eyes! only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because tortillas are very small. I don't care if that's the style,  it sucks to get itsy bitsy tortillas.... Give me big tortillas packed with meat, then you get 5 stars"}
{"text":"I love how they make their own tortilla  and their meet is all soo fresh and juicy.   

I cannot believe I have yet write a review for this place!
This place is unforgettable; from the long lines to cooking in front of customers, they are as good as it gets! I've eaten numerous Mexican Foods in Arizona; but to me, nothing is ever comparable to them. Every time I go back to Vegas, I have to at least get a horchata there.  Okay, that's a lie! I have to get at least one taco...no, make that two!!
I totally recommend the Adobada (spicy pork) Fries because not only is the line shorter, but....it is roasted on a metal rod!! All their meets are cooked to perfection in front of everyone; that way, they have to stay even if it's a long line. 
Their workers are pretty nice; I've heard they are actually from main Mexico so their techniques are directly from there. This explains why they are so authentic, at least in my opinion. 
I get so excited for places that are super delicious and this place is definitely worth the lost of water coming running out of my mouth. *drools!*"}
{"text":"Either I have been misled how a quasidilla look like or this place is just a hype. I have way better tacos compare to this place, even taco bell or dell taco is better than this place. Salty , tasteless , super confusing and expensive. When they pack four of your taco on a smallest plate , you know you aint getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"So you've made it rain at the Wynn and/or Encore, and now you're starvin' like Marvin (who is this guy, anyway?). Now what? Well, you have the choice of 1) spending more money on food at the restaurants inside either hotel or 2) head a little further down The Strip and get your taco on here. I'm sure the latter is a much better choice. My friends never tuned me on to this until now (thanks a lot, guys! *sarcasm*). Made sure I made the most out of my first visit and got 3 tacos: lengua, asada, and adobada. All of them paired up with a large Horchata made it the best late night grub I've had in Vegas. Ever. It's probably saying a mouthful (and no, I kept classy and had those tacos one at a time), but it's true."}
{"text":"Delicious street style tacos! Nothing on the menu but amazing food!! Don't think about it just order. It will please.  I promise!!!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival I saw the line out the door and thought \"geez, another hype train for me to hop on\".  The tacos (around $2.50 per) were a buck or so higher than other taco places near my home.

The line was roughly 15 feet out the door but we made it inside in 5 minutes.  We waited inside for another 20 minutes to order and retrieve our food.

But my goodness.  I've had lengua and cabeza elsewhere, but this place tasted much better for some reason.  The lengua was fresh..they took it from the boiling pot and sliced it up right in front of us.  The taste was unreal..so fresh, so steamy, and so greasy in a good way.  The cabeza was the best I've ever had.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We ate the lingua, tripas, carne asada, adobada, and chorizo tacos.  All were delicious, but the Lingua was my favorite.  Prices are very reasonable, and service is quick.  Also doesn't hurt that the place is super clean.  I will return!"}
{"text":"I recommend not to go here. For starters the line is toooooooo long and their idea of a quesadilla is a tortilla on  the bottom,melted cheese and then meat. If you want good food I suggest going to Golden Nugget hotel and trying their restaurants. If your in 3049 South Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Terrific food, great location on the strip (near Dispensary :) Wish it was open later, please check hours before you go.  If you like Mexican like me you will love it, little pricey like everything on the strip."}
{"text":"We came in for the weekend from OC, and had been wanting to go eat at this place. I had Al Pastor, Lengua, Asada and Buche. And I will do it again! Good spot it started getting busy but they keep the place clean for how busy it was! Good tacos for a Vegas Hangover."}
{"text":"We always make a point to stop when visiting Las Vegas!! I want to order everything off the menu, but love the el pastor quesadilla and my hubby always gets the asada tacos!! The lines may seem long but move fast. Great late night eating after going to the Vegas clubs!!"}
{"text":"As a lifelong lover of the TJ taco, this place( hands down) is the best in all of Nevada.Tacos El Gordo will knock your socks off! Every taco is hand crafted from the finest ingredients. Depending on what protein you want, you line up at the appropriate station. I am a big fan of their adobada. Spit roasted pork seasoned with chile and pineapple. That of course in served on top of a made in front of your face tortilla. I get mine \"con todo\"which means with a sprinkling of diced onion and cilantro with a drizzle of their house salsa and liquid magic green sauce ( a avocado/pineapple aoli) FOOD HEAVEN.Want to be WOWed? Try the Campachana fries. What is champachana fries you ask? They are basically shoestring fries with an Adobada taco on top."}
{"text":"Wow the best street tacos in Vegas and possibly north of actual Mexico...If you are in Vegas and are tired of the high end gourmet stuff or just want authentic street tacos come here...They pretty much only have tacos beef and pork..Didn't see any fish or chicken...Enjoy"}
{"text":"Thanking them for having awesome tacos!  I thought moving from Cali no one out here would have great tacos.  Thankfully I was wrong!"}
{"text":"Adobado.  That's the only word you need to remember.

After a loooong night at XS,  we were too hungry to even think about sleep.  Generally, we'd hit up Earl's, Grand Lux, Ellis Island, or any other 24/7 places around the strip.  This time around, a friend from UNLV told us we gotta try this tacos place out.  There was no way I could've refused since tacos are one of my favorites and we figured... gotta trust the locals!

After a short drive, and it really is a short drive from Wynn properties, we were there and it was still packed at 5am.  Two lines, one for adobado and one for everything else.  The reason there's a line for the adobado is that the spicy pork is cooked on a vertical rotating spit, just like how it would be in Mexico!  The pork is shaved directly onto fresh warm tortilla, then they add all the toppings for the tacos: lime green cream sauce, salsa, onions & cilantro.

The spicy pork has a ton of flavor and the cream sauce just works so well with the salsa and the pork.  Oh!  Also, if you look closely you'll see a chunk of pineapple at the top of the vertical spit.  You can actually request to have pina in your taco!  Definitely wouldn't have known if it wasn't for our friend and that sweet warm pineapple in the taco was definitely what makes this taco one of the best I've ever had! 

We also shared some carne asada fries.  I've lived in San Diego for a few years and I have yet to find carne asada fries comparable to the ones I've had in SD.  Tacos El Gordo's fries do come close though!  Fries are covered with carne asada, shredded cheese, and the same lime green sauce with a few dollops of guac!  Heavy, yes, but very much needed after 6+ hours at XS :P

So glad my first Mexican food experience in Vegas was such a legit one.  El Gordo is now a must.  Affordable and tasty, can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!  I had the beef, spicy pork and chorizo tacos.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the BEST carne Asada tacos I've tried! I discovered this place thanks to a friend on my last Vegas trip.. and boy have I been missing out! Only downside to this chain is that is always busy! Be prepared to wait a while... totally worth it though. I am definitely making a stop here from here on out. 5/5 :)"}
{"text":"Whenever we visit vegas, tacos el Gordo is a must have. The spicy pork tacos are absolutely outstanding and the service is always fast."}
{"text":"Huge lines can only mean one thing. Amazing and authentic tacos Mexicanos. The food was flavorful and looked great. Just be prepared for long long lines and limited seating."}
{"text":"Hold up, Wait . a . minute. Amazing Legit Tacos for $2 each , RIGHT ON THE STRIP?! Yep, that's right. Right by Encore, just a few steps from the taxi waiting area.... you'll find a plaza chock-full of eateries, including Tacos El Gordo. 

My friends and I tried the Carne Asada and the Pork Adobada (Spicy Pork) tacos, and we were not dissapointed. On a hot day in Vegas, the refreshing horchata helped too. The tacos are topped with this amazing green cream sauce, onions and salsa. It's so simple yet so AMAHHZING. and the homemade tortillas? perfect consistency. I'm definitely coming back here soon, and adding this to my \"Vegas Diet\" list. 

CAAA CHOOWW!"}
{"text":"No problems of food quality they are amazing you want spicy! Make it your damn self and add the onions and cilantro! Never go wrong with the  perfect tacos"}
{"text":"Lengua (cow tongue) tacos were so soft and delicious, but I would skip the adobada (spicy pork) because the meat was so tough. 

It's really interesting inside the place because they have separate lines for everything. I guess it makes sense since they're so popular! But that means that you have to stand in line multiple times if you want different types of tacos/fries. The asada (beef steak) line was the longest (went straight out the door and started going against the side of the building) and the adobada was the shortest. Almost no line for the cashier, though! It does get really crowded in there and there are no designated exit doors, so be careful not to drop the food you waited ~15 minutes for!"}
{"text":"wow, what a great place! loved the authentic atmosphere to complement the next to perfect food! will be back forsure!  makes you feel as if you're south of the border. so impressed, i thought it was time to start on my yelp account!"}
{"text":"Best tacos de pastor north of Tijuana MX.... hands down the best! Las Vegas is a place of glitz and glamour, fine dining and awesome entertainment, yea, yea... but sometimes you need to have the simple things in life to make your day special! That my friends is Tacos El Gordo! Don't be fooled by imitators, or copy cats, Tacos El Gordo are a must have and are simply awesome!!
Be prepared to wait in line and make sure you educate yourself before standing in line. They have a great system which separates the customers based on which types of tacos / food you want. At the store near the Wynn on the strip, tacos de pastor only goes to the left, all other meats are to the right. Stand in the proper line and you'll get served pretty quick. Once you order and get your food, you find a spot to sit and then go pay. It's kind of like an honor system to letting the cashier know what you have ordered, so don't try to jip them!! 

The tacos de pastor are my favorite as are the Vampiros. The corn tortillas are hand made for all tacos so get ready for that!! The vampiro is sort of like a taco sandwich. The tortillas are over cooked and turned into a tostada, then the meats are piled on the bottom one, melted cheese follows, then salsa and onions and cilantro. Topped off with another crispy tortilla and there you have it.. vampiro awesomeness!!

If you like tacos, you'll LOVE Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"Adobada tacos
Adobada/carne asada fries

Dammit!!! Its so good, I'm glad I don't live near one!! I'm sad that I don't!!! 

If you're in Vegas, you have to try this place out! Your tummy will thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here back in April , absolutely loved it .

Had another Vegas trip that started today. Made sure not to eat all day (drove  from la ) , so I could pig out here .

According to their website , and sign at the door , they are open until 2 am. I was here before 9 pm , and it was closed .

Will never come here again !"}
{"text":"best food, best prices... just a bit confused about the ordering process. each station has different meats. find your meat station & order there."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've tried in USA, next time we're in Las Vegas we are stopping by El Gordo. My husband likes the pastor and carne asada. Quesadillas where a little different than we're used to but they're delicious! Service is really friendly!"}
{"text":"great food!!! But you must be willing to wait. Poor customer service. Cashiers were rude!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while traveling. Waited for about 25 minutes for food, and I would have waited longer. Bravo!"}
{"text":"We went on Sept. 4 Thursday evening. It was our first time. 
A bit confusing with different lines you have to stand in base on what you want. 
We asked the cashier and she explained it well. 
You can pay ahead of time or pay after you order and get your food. It's $2 a taco. 

We got the beef tacos (Carne Asada)- It was okay. Maybe overly cooked, kind of chewy.  Not memorable.  3/5 stars.

We also tried the park tacos (Adobada)- mmm... taco heaven. Tender. They refer to it as spicy pork but it's not spicy. The taco tasted amazing. You can have pineapple on the side or on it. Same for the cilantro.  Throw some lime on it and boom ...5/5 stars! 

We didn't try the other items. 
We highly recommend the pork tacos. Went back again just for them on Sunday sept7 evening.  The second time we went, they were cooking the pork at both stations and had to wait 10mins. This was around 6:30pm. Both evenings the line up wasn't too long. 

Negative- Most of the cooks were wearing hats. One was wearing a hair net.  It can get pretty hot and they were working hard. Lots of sweat. With the cook sweating that much on his face, it was not appealing to fear lots of the sweat dropping on to the meat as he was chopping it up.  Our cook wiped the sweat off his face twice when it looked like it was going to drip on to the food. Luckily none did. But a bit hunger killing seeing that. 

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"After going to Vegas so many times all I would ever hear about is Tacos El Gordo so I decided to finally give it a try I was let down a little now before I start would I go back ? Yes I would now I'll explain my 3 star rating I had a few different things wanted to get a taste for a little of everything I had the al pastor and boy was that amazing I recommend that 100% now I had a \"quesadilla\" big let down it was basically a taco with a sad little strip of cheese on it if that wasn't enough I had gotten it with chorizo it was so burnt!!! I couldn't even taste the chorizo why even serve it ? Now as for the salsa nothing is spicy but so much flavor !!! Now if you want some heat they do provide grilled peppers as well as onions the onions didn't seem grilled more like steamed wasn't a fan of the flavor the line set up is very ridiculous to say the least it's a mess and needs to be fixed to be honest I don't see how it works all and all I rate this place a 7/10 just for the al pastor I would come back because it's that amazing and definitely check your chorizo before paying lol"}
{"text":"Had to try Tacos El Gordo because lots of people recommended them and the reviews were mostly good. 

The food is cooked and chopped right in front of you and that is a breath of fresh air because its just really fresh and you just know the food isnt just sitting under a heat lamp for hours....but the three stars is because the food just didn't deliver all the hype it gets. Between the six of us we had the carne asada fries and tacos, the chorizo tacos, and quesadilla. The meat is kinda fatty so I found myself spitting out some of it. The chorizo was a bit sweet and I really like my chorizo spicy. The quesadilla was kind of a joke it was just one small  flour tortilla with some cheese and a super hard  tiny corn tortilla laid on top. The fries were decent but again there is a green sauce that they put over it and it was sweet too and just didnt compliment the food that well. 

On another note though... all the employees were pretty nice and even though I thought I wasn't speaking loud enough they were very attentive and could hear me good and if they needed us to repeat anything, they were nice about and didnt get frustrated which was nice."}
{"text":"Not that good! And the portions are so tiny! And a 15 minute wait for just 2 tacos. Not to mention that there was on 2 people working. One cooking and one working the register."}
{"text":"The closest you will get to real authentic tacos from mexico.  Best tacos in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Food:
Awesome tacos! I would highly recommend the Al Pastor, Adobada, and the Cabeza. They also offer assorted grills onions and peppers. Ask for their orange spicy salsa. The tacos would not be compete without it. 

Service: 
Eh. Not great but not bad. 

Atmosphere: 
Tacos El Gordo is extremely busy so plan accordingly if you are going with a big group. Seats are first come first served basis and tables are limited. 
The vibes are loud and popping, so if you're a prune, you'll probably want to order for take out."}
{"text":"Don't let the outer appearance of this place scare you away. This is NOT Las Vegas chic, but the food is great and very inexpensive. Whenever I am in Las Vegas I make it a point to visit this place at the \"rough\" end of the strip."}
{"text":"The AL pastor meat if delicious........ the salsas everything is good ...... what really takes the 2 stars is that they dip the tortillas in lard. If the tortillas were plain with no lard I would of given this place 10 stars. I have been watching my oil, fat, and lard consumption and it is not acceptable and unhealthy to dip tortillas in lard to make a taco. Consider quesadillas With meat if u don't want tortillas with lard. But if u don't care to clog ur arteries  they are good tacos. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Tacos are ok. Buche tacos were too salty.  Al pastor tacos were tasty.  Asada tacos alone would get 5 stars, they were awesome. 

Having said that, this place is a cluster. There has to be a better way to organize the distribution.  You have to get in separate lines to get different tacos. This system does not make sense. I felt bad for a lady carrying an orange tray with some tacos then had to get back in line to order asada fries. I gave her cuts in my line. Probably won't come back until they figure out a way organize for a better customer experience."}
{"text":"Overall, bad service and bad attitude from the cooks. Don't get the \"tacos de tripas\". My father-in-law and I ordered them and they had little rocks (it turned out they weren't \"rocks\".....)in them. When my in-law told the cook he said,\"That's how they were.\" Don't recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"Yummy street tacos with an attitude. I sampled as many as my gluttonous tummy could hold. My favorite is the adobada (pork with a statement) but the carne asada was good too (good charred carbon flavor). Reasonable prices too ($2.25 for most tacos). And yes these are (only) slightly larger than the tacos you'd buy south of the border. Highly recommended. Oh and the suadero (brisket) tacos were good too but a bit underwhelming. 
Go!"}
{"text":"Me gustó mucho  conocer las vegas pero más me encantó comer tacos el gordo los de pastor son mis favoritos"}
{"text":"Longer walk from the Westgate but worth the trip. Delicious. Try everything. It's all good."}
{"text":"One of the benefits of staying at the Wynn is it's close proximity to Tacos El Gordo.  

Tacos El Gordo is a must visit place for my buddy and I when we're in Vegas.  It really is that good.  

All the tacos are great, but the spicy pork is something special, which likely explains why the lines for pork are ALWAYS longer than the lines for beef.  Each line serves pork or beef, but not both, so you need to pay attention to what line you're in.  

This place pulls a crowd more or less ALL THE TIME, so be prepared.  But, they are set up for a crowd, and the lines move pretty quick.

Note:  No alcohol is served, only soft drinks."}
{"text":"The line is long, but it goes by quick! They're fast and authentic TJ tacos definetly worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The tacos al pastor con piña is killer here be warned this spot is always packed ass hell but when your getttjng the best that's the only thing you can expect from it long ass lines no seats anywhere it is what is but is worth standing or eating it in your car whatever's you know! But the food is bomb!! Don't forget to order some al pastor fries too!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best tacos in Vegas!!!! The adobada tacos are amazing and so are the adobada fries. Out can get a half order of the fries for $5 and 2 people can be more than satisfied sharing!!! One of Las Vegas' best kept secret!!! Try it now, I'm sure their open!!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly. I've never had this good of a taco in my entire life. Words can't describe how each bite of their tacos taste like. I think I can finally die in peace now that I have experienced this godly food."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas! Best drunk food period."}
{"text":"The adobada meat is by far the best in the United States! I can eat anything on the menu from sopes, mullitas to tacos it is truly delicious. The environment reminds me of my trips to Baja California.  The taste in food plus the variety of meats blows the competition in Vegas out of the water."}
{"text":"BEST AL PASTOR TACOS EVER!!! Good service as well, I just docked one star cause I hate the set up of the restaurant! I really wish they would've thought of a better system. You have to wait in a different line for each different meat and then head to yet ANOTHER line to pay for what you just waited in line for. Sound redundant??...well, IT IS! 

The al pastor meat line is always the longest, and then people from the other meat lines, think they can jump in front of the al pastor line cause they waited in one (of the shortest) line already. So annoying. I think if you know you're going to get al pastor and (for example) carne asada as well, you should wait in the longest most popular line first, then make your way to the smaller lines, right???...you would think that would be common sense. But apparently there's ALWAYS someone who tries to cheat the system...and next thing you know, it's monkey see monkey do."}
{"text":"LOVE me some Tacos El Gordo!! I previously lived in San Diego so this is a staple there. Came here late night and it was poppin. The lines get crazy long but move fairly quickly. 
If you have never been you must stand in the line with the sign of the type of meat you want, FYI...
Their Adovada is bombdigghty, and prices are very affordable. Hits the spot especially after lots of drinking!"}
{"text":"For the Strip, this is a pretty good option for food. It's a bit out of the way (like a mile from the center of the Strip) and compared to the trucks that abound around LA, the price is high (about $2+ for a tiny taco with only one tortilla if my memory serves me correctly, while LA trucks use two), but the flavor is pretty darn yummy. Try out a few including the cabeza (cow's head), which is tender as can be. The al pastor on the other hand is tasty but a bit overdone. My co-eater pal like the crispiness of the meat--and I can always appreciate meat cooked to the point where I can't feel the fat, but this made it a bit tough to eat... I prefer a little more tenderness. 

Bottom line: Compared to the mediocre buffets all over the Strip that cause you to indulge to your stomach's limits, this is a quick and easy place to eat just enough while getting some bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Wow! These tacos are some of the best tacos I have ever eaten. The only reason I don't give Tacos El Gordo five stars is because they were a little bit expensive, there was a huge line to get the tacos, and they were out of a lot of their meat options. 

Bonus points to the security guard who got us in front of the long line because we had a stroller with us."}
{"text":"Lived up to its hype, best tacos I've had since Mexico."}
{"text":"Warning: You first visit will be confusing if you aren't prepared. Three different lines to order depending on what your ordering. Word of advice, just head towards the Adobada, the spicy pork sitting on the spit, so delicious! The carne asada was good but i've had better, next time i will try the chorizo."}
{"text":"One of my local favorites in San Diego is Tacos El Gordo. Of course I had to venture over add try the one in LV.

First, the lines goes through pretty quickly, much faster than SD. Two carne asada and two adobada line really keeps the line short. Also, when we went, there were plenty of seating, no table reserving and scouting required.

I am sure both tacos in LV and SD are made the same, but something about the tacos in SD were more flavorful and fulfilling.

With that said, the tacos were delicious either way. For the LV folks visiting SD, stop by a Tacos El Gordo and find out."}
{"text":"As authentic as your going to find in Vegas at 4am with the last $10 in your pocket. DRUNK FOOD!"}
{"text":"The food is just awesome.  6 stars for the al pastor tacos.  But, c'mon..you can't find a bigger restaurant or find a way to speed up the lines?  You guys closed the restaurant on the strip, which just made this one busier?  Makes no sense.  But, you definitely know how to make the best tacos in town..I'll give you that."}
{"text":"This place is terrible for vegetarians. The only veg option had bits of beef in it."}
{"text":"We usually stop by Tacos El Gordo whenever we're in Vegas to get tacos.  Yummy tacos but today tacos don't have much flavor."}
{"text":"Best tacos!!! Hands down. If you are in the area, Do not let this one go. A must try! We came a Saturday night around 3am and was super busy. Also went during the day and wasn't as bad a wait. But it is worth it!! Remind me of tacos from TJ."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious Mexican resteraunt  in Las Vegas.. I have never been disappointed.. GO EAT HERE. Get the adobada tacos and the campenchana fries.."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. My wife and I just moved to Vegas and was told to try this place out. We did and fell in love. You should go and try it out."}
{"text":"Really long lines, but definitely worth the wait. I just got spicy pork (adobada) taco, which I had in around 3 bites. They're small tacos, but really flavorful."}
{"text":"Favorite taco spot in Vegas! There's a couple locations to choose from usually the one on the strip is very crowded but their all good."}
{"text":"There are plenty of taco shops in Vegas, but Tacos El Gordo is one of the best. The lines are always long, but the service is quick and there is plenty of room for customers in this former gas station.
 
Speaking of the lines, when you first visit Tacos El Gordo, you might be a bit confused. There are three lines, each of which offers a certain type of meat. Bad news if you want carne asada, tongue, and pork, because they are all in separate lines. But if you go with a bunch of friends, you can each hit a line and order for the group, then take your trays to the cashier to pay up.
 
My friend tackled the carne asada line, and I hit the tongue (one taco each for each of us). Both were great: smoky steak and tender tongue. There is no salsa station, and the condiment bar consists only of radishes and limes (what, no carrots?), so ask for your order with everything on it if you want more than meat.
 
This is a bare-bones establishment, but the bone structure is solid. As I and the dozens of diners around me can attest, if you're looking for a fast, tasty taco (or a tostada, sope, or quesadilla), this Tijuana-style eatery is among the best in the Valley."}
{"text":"I missed this place when they left the Strip. The remodeled place is ok. But the tacos are the best. A good variety and best prices on the Strip."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever had. They're small but packed full of flavor. The tortillas are light and delicious. In fact, these tacos were so good that when in town, we went twice for lunch in a three day span. Look forward to going again the next time we're in Vegas! So good!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the USA. Ordering can be a little intimidating but you'll figure it out. This is a very authentic and traditional taco shop so don't expect burritos here. They do however have carne aside fries that can be ordered with al pastor pork as well. The high light of this awesome place is the al pastor (marinaded pork roasted on a vertical spit) and the fact that the carne aside is cooked over wood fire. I've lived in California and Las Vegas my whole life and I can honestly say these are the best tacos. Nothing really comes close to Tijuana tacos like this place."}
{"text":"HOLY HELL!!!  THIS CARNE ASADA FRIES WAS ON FIRE!  GOOD AS FUCK!  coming from Los Angeles, I know whats up if that carne taste authentic.  By far, this is the one!  Good job!  My carne asada looks so good, I ate that in my car quick!  Cali Peeps, give this a try.  Damn it is the bombdiggity bonefrizzle my nizzle."}
{"text":"I was crying on my way back from Vegas not because of money I lost but because of Tacos that I will miss so very much...
If you like tacos from Ensenada Mexico, tacos that are not Americanized, you will love this place.
When you walk in and see how your Al Pastor is being prepared, tortilla being cooked with fat from the pork, you know you came to right place for Al Pastor taco.
 
Must go place in Vegas now....I can't wait to go back there... 
Sorry about poor quality of my review.. I just can't get over the excitement of finding this place in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Best Taco place in Las Vegas... It is kinda hard to figure out the system is you don't speak/read spanish but once you figure out that every line serves a different meat you are good to go. They just serve Tacos and they are dang good. This is a no frills type of place but the tacos are to die for. You have to try the spicy pork it will change your life."}
{"text":"We had spicy pork tacos , really good the sauce was simply amazing, very authentic!!! It is a must"}
{"text":"The food was delish!!  The meats were all great and the tortillas were freshly made and the salsas were great on flavor and spice!  The only issue is the ordering lines are but confusing! They need a new ordering system especially as busy as they are!  If you go by yourself you will be stuck in different lines ordering different meats so could be a long wait!!  Bring friends and stand in all the different lines!"}
{"text":"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE??!?!

I'm from a state where REAL tacos like this doesn't exist. Taco Bell?? SCREW THAT!!

This place is amazing!! Cow tongue taco?? Spicy pork taco?? Cow stomach taco?? Regular beef taco?? AMAZZING!!! but don't try the cow brain taco....yeah..it's not that great. But all the other stuff, AAAMAAZING!!!!!!!!!

And so cheap!! Only $2 per taco?? That's insane! I'm so excited thinking about this place, I wanna go back.

I WILL GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Encore so this was within walking distance. We came here on our last day. We knew it was going to be good because it was packed with Mexican people. I asked the lady in line behind me about the different types of tacos and she explained which ones were spicy. If you're not sure you can also ask the security lady outside. We ended up ordering 9 tacos total which was too much for me and my husband. It only cost us $26 i think. His eyes are bigger than his stomach, lol. There are different lines for the types of tacos you want to order so we just split into two different lines. I could only eat 2 and a half and I was full. There are a few tables inside but we decided to just eat outside standing. Out of all the places we ate at in Las Vegas, this by far was the tastiest and cheapest. Even compared to the fine dining restaurant we went to at the Venetian. If you want something authentic and cheap, come here."}
{"text":"THE BEST CARNE ASADA I HAVE EVER EATEN!

I ate in stunned silence soaking in the mix of favors, aromas, sights and sounds.  This is yet another example of the inescapable rule - if you see all of God's children flocking into a restaurant indifferent of race or socioeconomic class - go in, take it in and EAT WITH THEM - the world would be a better place!  This place is incredible... The taco standard hence forth!

The only thing that would make this more authentic would be to move all to Cabo and put in on wagon behind a truck!  

Ok... So down to the glorious details...

When you first walk in you see that you can order various item at different stations from around counter, but if you're a newbie have no fear, just ask someone and they'll be super happy to yell to the right part of the kitchen with what you want.  After your attention is averted from the large menu (not that there's a lot on it... It's just huge!), you notice 2 massive rotisseries with layer upon layer seasoned pork, Al Pastor topped with a signature pineapple.  Much like Gyros or Shawarma, Al Pastor, the Mexican version of the same is serious indicator of being in place that cherishes flavor and authenticity.  Unlike the other two meats, how Al Pastor is seasoned varies widely based on he tradition and locality of those making it... Which always makes it somewhat of an anticipated reveal!  This al pastor was highlighted with a very mild version of its common seasoning namely Guajillo, ancho, cumin, garlic onion, and pineapple allowing the charred meat shine through a bit more on its own.  Seared in the traditional manner with cilantro and onions on soft FRESHLY MADE corn tortilla only made it that much better!  The carne asada tacos were even better which was honestly hard to believe even possible!  The lightly seasoned and thinly sliced steaks are flash grilled over a fire that defies the term HOT to be then placed in a warming container next to the girl where magic clearly happens here.  The steaks, being close to the grill, continue to slow cook and steep in the smoky sooty goodness from the grill making hands down THE BEST CARNE ASADA I HAVE EVER EATEN!

Check out my pics ...  The tacos are generous and juicy.  Tortillas are all freshly made.  

No matter what you do in Vegas, this will be one of the highlights... If I'm wrong call me out... If I'm right, just smile and pass it forward !"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo. We have been planning a trip to Las Vegas for 6 months. So far most of what we have done has been great. We had to try Tacos El Gordo since we are mexican =). Well, I have to agree with most of the reviews. The way to order tacos is a mess. 
I can see why they do it the way they do. Sopes are made a certain way, Tacos al Pastor come from a certain grill, Lengua, cesos from a certain bash and so on..... 

With that said the lines are horrible. This place is in such high demand that they need to put up more of these in Las Vegas Strip area. We were in line for tacos about 30 minutes, and it was only one line. 
Me and my wife had 4 Suadero, 2 Cesos, 1 Lengua, and 1 Cabeza. They were DELICIOUS!. The meat was cooked to perfection.......

I cannot say the staff was at fault because all of them from the servers behind the line to the ladies cleaning tables (well... cleaning as best they could because tables were never empty more than 1 minute) were working their a$$3s off. 

I would have easily rated this 5 stars but the wait to get tacos and the wait to pay was a real inconvenience. 

TIP: as soon as you are next to order tacos and your party is more than one, send another member to the pay line to save you time. If more than two, have another save you a table!!!

LOL, worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of tacos in my life but nothing like the tacos de el pastor here.  These were by far my favorite tacos.  The meat was tasty and tender.  The salsa had a little bite but not too hot.  The bright green cream sauce pulls it all together.  I also was able to try one taco made of tripas and I like that they deep fry it so it's extra crunchy.  I tried the cabesa also and it was ok.  It was also pretty good.  My only complaint was that they have different lines for each order.  If you want asada you stand in one line, el pastor another line, trip as another line.  It sucks if your alone.  On my trip I was in Vegas for 3 days and made it there 2 times."}
{"text":"Great tacos! They go perfect with the \"tamarindo\" agua fresca."}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles, home of Mexican food restaurant heaven.  And I love tacos.  These are BY FAR the BEST tacos I have ever had.  THE BEST.  The Mulas are also amazing.  The tacos azteca are OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Fresh handmade corn tortillas and they are generous with the toppings.  I can't recommend this place enough.  They are open late and worth that late night cab ride over to have a perfect snack or really anytime of day if you are looking for great authentic Mexican tacos.  Seriously, I dream about this place and count my days anytime I'm going to Vegas just so I can go here!"}
{"text":"Crazy wait, for crazy good tacos! It's hard to believe that a street taco can draw such an interest, but Tacos El Gordo does just that. After a long day of volleyball, tacos were in order. The wait was nothing short of one hour (8:45 p.m. on a Saturday evening) but worth every mouth watering bite. Enduring the phenomenal smell was pure torture while waiting to have your order taken and made, but once it was your turn, you felt like you were the only person that mattered. The chef was friendly, took time to get your order perfect and portions were plentiful. Food, service & atmosphere equal a ten!"}

{"text":"Ah what a perfect place to eat after a 6 hour plane ride. 

First off, beware the lines can get pretty long. Wayyy out the door. It's almost always packed unless you come super early. 

When you enter, the counter to order is directly in front. There are 3 separate lines depending on what you want. 

I ordered the Taco De Asada (steak taco). It comes with guacamole, chives, onions, and salsa. 
They are very cheap here. No more than $3 per taco. 
They cook the steak right in front of you which is awesome. 

These Tacos are by far the best tacos I've ever eaten. 

After ordering you pay at the counter to the right of the store. This process is pretty quick. 

They have tables inside for you to dine at. 
They also have a bar area to pick up lemons, limes and sodas.

If you want a good and cheap taco meal come here!"}
{"text":"Not worth waiting 1 hr.
They made me wait in 2 lines for different meats. I ordered 18 tacos, asada fries and a burrito. Really gonna make me wait in line again? I was already there and hangry. I couldn't go home empty handed to my starving kids. 
Food is way too Greasy. Service is wacked!  Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"For a more mature palette, stay away from Del Taco and Taco Bell and visit Tacos el Gordo, because let's face it; unless you're high or a 16 year old girl with a eating disorder there's no reason for you to bear the burden of 79 cent chulupas. Make the trip; you won't be disappointed. Try the brains, intestines, or head. And if you're upset that they are priced at 2$ a piece, I'm sure you'll find Taco Bell a more suitable establishment... Just don't forget to have you're girlfriend hold you're hair back when you purge yourself behind the dumpster in the parking lot."}

{"text":"I've had Tacos El Gordo a couple of times , The first time I had it I really enjoyed it and the second time I had it I was a little bit disappointed because my tacos were given to me cold."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! Busy location. I would recommend they change the way they operate in terms of food-payment. You order your Tacos and you make line to pay.  By that time I paid, my food was cold"}
{"text":"My family sued to go here when they only had a location in Tijuana, Mexico. We were SO happy to find they have opened locations in Las Vegas. The restaurant and cooking areas looked very clean, the staff was friendly, food was quick and  the tacos are the most authentic you'll find north of the border. I was so happy that they somehow managed to make traditional mexican taco stand food meet american health code standards :)"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp (and Misti Y) for helping the better half and I find this place.  I don't really know \"Authentic\" Mexican, but if this place isn't, they are the best fakers on earth.

It was very busy at lunchtime, and we were certainly bumbling around trying to figure out what to order.  But we finally settled on the Tacos de Adobada.   They are rather small, so we each got 3.  I could have easily seen eating more if you were hungry, but we felt pretty satisfied.

They have a huge rack of Pork complete with Pineapple dripping down onto it, and it is hand cut as well as the Tortillas are being hand made right before your eyes!

I'm knocking off 1 star because for some reason we ended up with canned Diet Soda even though they have fountain Coke. Not sure why they did this to me, but I didn't notice it until it was too late.  Don't get duped.

Otherwise, seriously this place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Tacos El Gordo was a damn good one.  Let me summarize my experience:

Cheap prices = check
Delicious food = check
Good service = check
Open 24 / 7 = check
Authentic = check
Cleanliness = check
Strip convenience without strip prices = check

This is not your average taco stand.  The staff all dons branded company T-shirts, the service is friendly, and it's not a hole-in-the-wall.  It also feels to commercialized to be authentic with it's stainless steel walls and fixed furniture.  Nonetheless, they've taken a simple concept and have executed it very well.  

My sister and I came here around midnight.  We ordered two taco's each and one quesadilla to share.  Each taco (steak and pork) was succulent and full of flavor.  The quesadilla was the best I've ever had (full of steak with some excellent cheese).  Every order also comes along with grilled green onions and grilled whole jalapeño's... which were delicious as well.  You also get your choice of green and red salsa and accompaniments such as limes and radishes.  The food was so good that I could have had probably had eight tacos to myself.  Unfortunately, my stomach told me I was full after two tacos and half a quesadilla.  The total price of our meal for two?  Under $13 including tax.  This is how you win in Vegas.

I'll be back soon enough..."}
{"text":"A half order of Adobada fries will hit the spot!

My favorite Mexican spot! If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting for?

Adobada, carne asada, lengua and adobada fries are a must try. Eat the adobada last cause it's the best! I went to Mexico and came back. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously stop reading reviews and go have some GREAT tacos!! 

We were there last weekend and could not believe how awesome the tacos were! I ate 6 tacos! 

I recommend the pork tacos that they cut off of the spinning stick (name?). You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food - GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The setup - RIDICULOUSLY STUPID......wait in umpteen different lines for different dishes while holding previous orders then carry all that to a different line to pay for it then find one of 10 mini tables to sit down and eat cold crap

The reviews - way overhyped 

The staff -  ummm

The clientele - OMG 

tacos are about two bites...but thats all you need to know that you never want another one"}
{"text":"Best damn tacos in the while state.  It's just like eating tacos in Mexico I love the food it's so very fresh and the services is just great.  You want some real good tacos in Vegas hit this place up you won't regret it I promise you that.  There isn't one item on the menu that you won't want to try.  Oh it's true it's damn true!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cons: it's super packed, Don't come here if you don't have time to wait.. It took us an hour to get our food There's not enough room to sit Pros: This place is so yummy, I'm definitely a fan of tacos el Gordo  Tacos are so bomb!!! The best Mexican food in Vegas"}
{"text":"Ohhh my goodness!! The food was Ahhhhmazing!! Don't let the long line discourage you. I'm never ever disappointed to stop here and wait in the long lines because I know the food is going to be worth every minute waiting. Also, the staff is so upbeat and humble. Definitely a 5 star in my book."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos!!!  Great flavor...  not sure how much I was breathing during the feast but I'm sure it wasn't much. Tummy is full and satisfied. Definitely recommend that you bring your full appetite with you."}
{"text":"Tacos were so good we came here twice during our week long vacation.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Walked 1.5 hrs down the strip to eat tacos here arrived at 9:30pm. The shop's posted hours are until 2am on Thursdays yet they randomly had decided to close with no explanation to customers although the doors were open and had about 30 people inside. What a waste of time. Would never return."}
{"text":"The best, most authentic street tacos. They're small, on corn tortillas. Do yourself a favor and try the spicy pork... wow! Lots of flavor, and not too hot. This place is very low priced and worth the walk. You can get a cheap bottle of water here too."}
{"text":"YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY, I got love in my tummy!  This place rocks! I have to say, we almost skipped over this place, it just sort of gave me the eh, who cares vibe. Boy am I glad we tried it anyway! The prices are good and the food is awesome, plus these guys were open in the wee hours of the morning. SMART. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My go to spot in Vegas for authentic Mexican tacos. Very fresh, authentic, and cheap. A must try! The Al pastor is cut fresh off the hanging rotating rotisserie."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places of all time. Very authentic street style tacos and just absolutely delicious. The line is usually very long, but well worth it. The al pastor tacos is cut right off the rack and served hot and fresh for you to eat. Very reasonably priced as well. Perfect place for a quick snack or after a long night of drinking."}
{"text":"Ahhhhmazing! Best asadero tacos!! The sauce and onion cilantro mix make these tacos bomb! A must have."}
{"text":"They started off really small with no wait, now you have to plan on waiting in line for 30-40 minutes until they take your order on a good day plus wait an additional 20min to get it... Frustrating but there's a reason why there's a line everyday now. They are the closest they get to the real thing. Not good for groups because there's not enough seating. We came here once but had someone standing waiting for tables to be cleared to save them for us lol think in and out in Hollywood blvd after the club..."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go for tacos. We have been going since 2012 and never have been disappointed. Judging on the number of people waiting in line, we are not the only ones that think that it's a great address."}
{"text":"Love this place! Lines get long on the weekend but worth the wait. 
Tip : Stand in one line, when it's your turn to order ask them for all the types of tacos you want. You don't  have to start a line over again they'll get them for you."}
{"text":"If you happen to be walking drunk (or sober) around the strip , you need to visit Tacos El Gordo.  I made my first trip over here when staying at The Encore a few years ago, and now make an effort to visit whenever I can.  These are legit street tacos, at a very affordable price (especially compared to the other crap you'll get on the Strip).  Make sure to try the different type of rotisserie style meats, and grab a good amount of salsa and limes.  You'll wanna pass out after this.

Also, be prepared for the lines.  That's the only downfall."}
{"text":"Food is very good. We ordered 6 Carne Asada tacos, 1 Mula, and 1 sope. We were very satisfied with what we ordered and the price was reasonable. A bit more than your average taco shop but then again this is technically on the Strip. 

One thing to keep in mind, which can be a major annoyance if you want different items is that you can only order certain meats in certain lines. So if you want Carne Asada and Al Pastor, you have to get in one line for the Asada, and then another line for the Al pastor. If you're with someone, then split up and have everyone order something different. The line was long, moved slow, but overall the food was great. I'd definitely go back if the lines were shorter and if they moved a bit quicker. 

Place gets packed so not much seating. We called a Lyft and took ours back to the hotel. Would definitely go back if we are on that side of the strip."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Tacos El Gordo...

When I heard they've moved from their old location, I was devastated!! Now that I'm here for the first time at their new location, here's a few things I've learned during my visit....

1) their crazy ordering line is still in place. Try opting to try some crazier stuff like their head, tongue or even tripe. There is absolutely no line for this window

2) grab a buddy. The more the merrier. Split up and grab a buddy for the carne asada line, their adobada line, and a SEAT!  They've increased their seating but people seem to be grabbing them fast so it's best if you have a body to secure one

3) don't be rude. Don't be that guy trying to cut in line. People will cuss you out. (I've seen it happen) lol

4) a lot more somewhat organized than the old location...in a weird way. I remember at the old location it was kind of a free for all and people were just yelling out orders but it seems a lot more tamed this time around...

New location, same taste!! Still delivering some of the best tacos I've eaten!! Never disappointed when I come! Just wish you guys were closer to the strip like before!"}
{"text":"Food was good but lines are very bad you have to make line to get different kind of meats so make sure you go with friends so they can stand in the other lines,"}
{"text":"This place is awesome legit Mexican. This place is full but it doesn't matter food makes up for it. Definitely a place to go for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a drunken night in Vegas. Just try everything."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos, different kinds of meats to choose from, definitely food worth waiting for!

Time and time again, my friends and I always stop by Tacos El Gordo because it's an absolute staple. We get it every time it's in the area, whether it be San Diego or even a little off the Strip.

Food: My go-tos are usually 4 al pastor tacos and 2 carne asada. Though really greasy and oily, it's nice in moderation every so often because it can get tiresome time to time if you have too much. Overall, the food here is one of the best tacos you'll ever have. Everything is really fresh and made-to-order!

Service: Service is a little less average. Each meat is split into different lines and the al pastor lines are usually the fastest so if you want quick and easy service, opt for the al pastor tacos. If you want others, expect to wait longer. For example, the slender mustache-clad guy working the carne asada taco station worked extremely slow compared to his coworkers. He kept looking around instead of doing his job quickly and efficiently. Took us 30 minutes to place our taco order. The other lines are quicker though, and the people behind the cash register are even faster than the carne asada guy on June 23, 2018 around the afternoon.

Overall, I do enjoy Tacos El Gordo a lot. Every taco I've ever had was consistent and I've never had any problems with the food."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about this place and decided to give it a shot. Got the steak , beef tongue, along with carne asada fries. This hit the spot, the food is good in quality and price !! Will come every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! 

Every time we visit Vegas this is our spot!
This is a must in Vegas! 
I most definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"After a night clubbing in Vegas, we needed a taco NOW!!  So after searching Yelp we decided on this place after reading some of the reviews. At least what I could comprehend after a night of drinking.  We got a Lyft over from our club or somewhere and there was a huge line and I thought my taco craving was about to be handled.  Man was I wrong. We ordered pretty much one of every taco except adobada which I really wanted and they were out of.  The meat was crunchy and over cooked. Plus no salsa!!!!  Let me say it again, no salsa!!!  WHat The Freak!!!  My wife and I are thoroughly disappointed.  Well, we are in Vegas for a few more days so our search will continue. Stay tuned yelpers!!"}
{"text":"I come to Vegas a few times a few times to eat good food and I fell in love with the food. The ordering system isn't up to par, but the food is delicious. I tried a little of everything, but the carne asada fries is the one for me. 
I co-sign all the other positive reviews"}
{"text":"Bomb place to go.  Sometimes a line, but I don't care. Worth the wait. Awesome prices.  Friendly staff. And extremely clean!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! These were some of the best tacos I've ever had! I even tried the lengua tacos and they were pretty good. The Pastor were my favorite with the cactus salad. Overall very clean place and friendly staff. The horchata was definitely a plus."}
{"text":"The adobada tacos are my favorite (pork) sliced to order. If you have a CCW, I would bring it here. Pretty ghetto."}
{"text":"CARNE ASADA FRIES!!!!Amazing inexpensive food. I'm from Chicago and it's like being home for dinner"}
{"text":"Yes yes baby Jesus so yummy ! Make sure you guys ask for the onions with the chile!! My favorite has to be tripita !"}
{"text":"Love this place. Authentic and very fresh. Everything is made right in front of you including the tortillas."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! only problem are the long lines and that each line is only assigned to an specific meat, ex. If you want carne asada you have to stand in the carne asada line, you can't order any other meat than asada in that line."}
{"text":"greasy toritillas
burned/dried meat
long wait lines
food resulted in emergency stomach problems
not worth waiting for 
probably tasty if you don't need to wait long"}
{"text":"I went to try this place after reading many great reviews but, I was very disappointed after I tried their tacos. First off it is very crowded in the shop. The customer service of the chefs was terrible and the food was gross. The carne asada tasted like they haven't cleaned the grill in a while.There was no where to sit and the chefs can barley hear you unless you are yell at them. I was very unhappy with the service and the food and would much rather eat my tacos elsewhere. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"My mexican family loves tacos. My mom makes tacos at home all the time and we have gone to at least 15 different taco places in Nevada.
I am SO sick of tacos and hate eating them...but..this place is the only exception. 
This place IS the best taco place in Nevada. 
These tacos are like no others. They are just so delicious.
The \"El Pastor\" tacos are to die for.  These are incredibly good. 
I usually get 3 El pastor tacos..they are a bit spicy and they come with creme yum yum m getting so hungry thinking about them.
I've had carne asada tacos..which are very good. The tacos de lengua (beef tongue) are sooo good too. These are my moms favorite. Dont be afraid to try it because it sounds strange. 
The tacos \"de sesos\" have to be my second favorite. Yummy these are my dad's favorite.
I love them all but just the el pastor tacos are worth going. 
They also have \"aguas frescas\" They have horchata which is delicious and i always get it and they have others..there is one drink that taste like oranges and creme which is super good too."}
{"text":"This is fake.  It is NOT Tacos El Gordo.  They have now changed the sign to say Tacos El Gordito. The food was ok, but not great.  This is a rat hole shop in a bad area.  The owner is closely affiliated with several that are flying gang colors, prison tats and patrolling the parking lot armed (handguns clearly in their waste-band and under their t-shirts.  Might be a good place to buy drugs and get car jacked.  Stay away if you are with anyone you care about.  

If it was a real Tacos El Gordo it would be worth risking your life for some tacos.  But I definitely won't risk my life again for this dumpy knockoff.  I hope they get sued.

They were very slow making the food and the owner kept signaling his gang buddies who started circling my car.  My wife got nervous enough that she activated the car alarm to spook them so we could escape.  We started to leave and they finally brought our food to our car as we sped off to find a safer area to eat.  If I get murdered anytime soon, this business owner is the suspect.  Hope he can't track me down for writing this accurate review!  Nothing personal Homie, just didn't like the danger my family was in while I was there."}
{"text":"SUPER authentic Mexico tacos!!! Definitely it is the best you can get in the US"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hype on yelp. Obviously people on this have not tried good tacos. Not even because I was drunk I thought they were good"}
{"text":"No los recomiendo para nada la persona de seguridad me trato con la punta del pie los q están x la charlestón te tratan mejor y son mejores en todo"}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos I've ever had. I'd like to explain exactly everything I ate but I can't. My cousin ordered us a huge tray of food and I couldn't stop shoveling tacos and quesadillas in my mouth.  The tacos were a pork and the quesadilla was straight cheese.  Very flavorful.  Place was packed, seating was limited. Sat under the bull and waited for my cousin to come back With the food. She lives in the area and thought I'd like this place...she was right.  Eat here, it's good and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Tacos are good but not worth the line and time spent. The system they have is horrible, and they allow people cut in line. Won't go back, It's not a must go place like people make it seem. If you have never been there, you should try it for yourself just to see what all the hype is all about."}
{"text":"Two stars for extreme inconvenience. The food was ehhh. I've had better asada fries at home. The layout for this place is just plain stupid. There's different lines for different meats and if u accidentally get in the wrong line, because it isn't really obvious that u have to stand in a certain line for specific food, you may be turned away and asked to stand in a much longer line. It's ridiculous. We sat inside and every time you need to refill your drink or get napkins, whatever, you have to fight through people waiting in lines. After you order and get your food, it's then you go across the room to pay for it. They're asking for shady people to walk out the door without paying. Whoever designed that place needs to never design another establishment."}
{"text":"I had no idea Tacos El Gordo was also in Vegas! I went to San Diego for college and discovered Tacos El Gordo there. So, when I found out there's two locations in Vegas too, I was pretty stoked.

I've been to this location and to the one right on the strip. I went to this one recently because one of the cab drivers we had that day said this location was way better. Anyhow, it's all about them adobada tacos! I always eat 3 of these when I go. Gets me pretty full, too! And this time, my friends and I shared the carne asada fries. I thought they were good, too. The fries were crispy and not soggy, so that was a plus for me! If you want some pretty bomb tacos that you'll ever have in your life, you have to hit up Tacos El Gordo (in Vegas OR San Diego!)."}
{"text":"Best tacos.  Hard to say anything that hasn't already been said.  I'm just here to backup all the other 5 star reviews and it's mainly for the pork tacos."}
{"text":"So goood that I went there twice in one weekend. Agobada fries are on par with carne asada fries in San Diego, maybe... maybe even better!!! Highly recommend any of the tacos and the agobada fries is a must!!

The fries couldn't be any better. They were crispy, covered with plenty of guac and sour cream, and topped with the fresh cut pork right off of the spinning pole. I don't know how to explain the uniqueness of the meat, but it was kind of a hybrid of bacon and cha siu (chinese pork). It was crispy like bacon and flavorful like cha siu. omgiwantsomemore!"}
{"text":"This place has some bomb ass fries and tacos.

I decided to try this place because I was craving for some late night tacos in LV so I decided to travel down the strip to find some.  

The tacos here are on the pricier side ($2.00) but they are GOOD!  But, the carne fries or adobado fries here are A STEAL! I got the half for $5 and it was huge!!!!! Totally worth the money!!!

If you want some bomb tacos in LV definitely venture out and try tacos el gordo! I must say it's just as good as the tacos over here in Socal!!"}
{"text":"BLASPHEMY!!!

I've been eating at Tacos el Gordo in Chula Vista for over 10 years and I'm ashamed this place is here.

People eating here must be DRUNK or something.

You guys don't even get a star. You guys get a FART from me. You get a star because yelp made me do it. I give it to........ THE HORCHATA.

I understand this is Vegas, on the strip, so it was packed. Understandable. I love this place so much I chose to wait the 35 min for my tacos... TWICE!!

One of the things that baffled me was how the ADOBADA HANDLER was slicing the meat, and instead of this delicious meat going on the taco as he's slicing it, HE LET IT FALL ONTO THIS TRAY WITH THE REST OF THE MEAT THAT HAD BEEN SITTING THERE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG. And this meat kept cooking on this tray. -____-

WHYYY??? please tell me why you would do that??? 

The right way? from the rotisserie into the taco

ROTISSERIE INTO THE TACO !!! not rotisserie to heat griddle... all the juices...GONE!!! 

The cheese on my MULA was burnt -_______-

Is it because they're busy??? No that makes no sense!! People are already waiting anyways !!

The other thing that almost made me cry was the ONIONS... They mass cook the onions so when you ask for them they are already soggy and taste more of oil than anything else :_( 

Chula Vista location cooks the onions to order so they're fresh, delicious, and tasty.

I wondered once again if this was because they were extra busy but... NO because people wait either way!! So why not serve quality over you guys being lazy and mass cooking onions in quantity??

The only thing I had from here was ADOBADA... which made me sick and I had such a bad stomach ache last night I cried.

This place is not Tacos el Gordo I'm sorry."}
{"text":"Best Tacos in Vegas!! I love this place! I haven't been back to Robertos since I discovered El Gordo! The spicy pork tacos are theeeee best...seriously!! Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the lines are always crazy. Its well worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for tacos in Vegas! Always worth the drive any time of the day. Love the homemade tortillas for the asada tacos. Love the mulas and their quesadillas as well."}
{"text":"Best original mexican tacos in Las Vegas - does not get better then El Gordo's!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, Carne Asada Fries kick ass, delicious tacos, bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Cashier was super friendly and nice. The food was good I just wish their salsa was a bit hotter."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best taco I have ever had in my life. Cannot wait to get back to Vegas to have another!!!"}
{"text":"HOW THE FUK does this place of SHIT have over a thousand reviews with 4.5 stars ?!

Line organization to pick up and pay: absolutely disgusting and unnecessarily complicated.

Carne Asada Tacos: marble and cartilage served on a greasy ass tortilla 

Carne Asada Fries: A vomit of a sauce served on a bed of cheap, cold and uncooked frozen fries 

ONE star because i LOVE my Mexicans and because customer service was helpful with a smile.

IF you love fresh and seasoned tacos THIS IS NOT YOUR SPOT. 
IF you love lard on top of lard served with a side of lard then this is your SPOT :D

Honestly this place is a disgrace and a disrespect to my Mexican people. It HURTS me to write this review but as the Mexican of the family in my Peruvian family i feel that it is my duty. 

Sorry."}
{"text":"Affordable, great selection, and delicious. What more could you ask for? It's not too fancy, for the fact that it's in the midst of the Las Vegas strip. Looks more like spot you'd find in a rural area driving along a long highway. That's what adds to the \"back home\" charm of this place. The tacos I had here are the top 1 or 2 tacos that I've ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was super tiny and overpriced.The tacos have almost no meat, and the quesadillas are so small with almost nothing on them. It's literally one small tortilla with a little bit of cheese and some onions on top, and they charge $4.50 for it. I had three ($13.50!!) and wasn't full. Also, the lines are so long we were there over an hour to get served! My boyfriend used to go to the original location in TJ and loved it, so we were so excited to try it out here. Seriously don't bother. You'll ruin all your fond memories of the original location, and leave hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"So I've been wanting to try this place forever since I love authentic mexican food. I know it is a Friday and on top of that it's New Year's Eve but I went anyway. This place is extremely extremely extremely busy!!!! There are 3 separate lines depending the type of meat you want. I got in line about 4:30pm and walked out the door with my food at 5:15 which was 45 minutes. My favorite is pastor so that's what I got.

They trim the meat right in front of you and you have the option to let them know exactly what you want on them. I got cilantro, onions, and sauce and they were delicious. I really mean DELICIOUS!!! The tortillas tasted so fresh like they had been just made today. They give you a fair amount of meat so I was full after 4 tacos which were the typical size \"street tacos\".

Service was okay and difficult to find a place to sit if you wanted to dine in. Although it was a long time standing in line, the people making the tacos are extremely fast and thorough however it's just crowded. Hats off to the cooks! 

I will be returning again as these tacos were A1 and will continue to make that sacrifice 
(my time), to get some more of those yummy tacos. So I highly recommend to give them a try if you have the patience to wait."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I have ever had. I had the tacos de lengua, adobada, al pastor, and carne asada. They were all delicious, with lots of flavor, and their own unique sauce for each meat. 

The carne asada fries were so good. They actually put carne asada not like other places. My wife and I shared the small size and it was more than enough. 

My favorite was adobada. It was full of flavor and really good sauce. The lengua was perfect, which I have a really hard time finding. Their al pastor was bomb with a really good sauce to go with it. 

This place is legit, and a everyone needs to try it. The line is long but worth it."}
{"text":"So after reading some reviews I thought it was gonna be amazing. It's alright! Not all that at all. I got the carne asada fries and it's ok. I got a pastor taco and it was good . Their horchata is a joke. It's not even homemade it comes from the fountain drink dispenser. Such a disappointment! Just got their tacos and a soft drink and call it a day."}
{"text":"If you can eat pork: Al pastor. Do it. 
If you can't eat pork: carne asada
If you can't eat meat: quesadilla with that amazing cheese they serve. 
If you don't eat: make an exception for Tacos El Gordo. 

I've been to 4 different Gordos el taco stops now (2 in SD, 2 in Vegas). Honestly, they all taste the same to me. What never changes is the length of the line, because it's always going to feel too long especially when you've been saving your appetite just for this moment. 

This one is closest to the strip, so it's probably longer than the one in downtown LV. If you have means of transportation, I'd recommend going to the one downtown which may have a tad shorter of a line."}
{"text":"Sloppy place ... w a bad bad really bad management (bomb tacos don't get me wrong ) but it seems you gotta go tru loops and hoops tryna get to pay for your tacos and then go back in action to get your drink....trust me by when u finish the mission they put you tru the tacos are cold"}
{"text":"Over priced for mediocre tacos plus its always to packed standings in different lines is dumb cause if you want 2 different tacos by the time you sit to eat your food is cold."}
{"text":"Damn I really hate hate long lines and was not looking forward to this line this past Saturday.. but dang these tacos and mulas are worth every second in line. Wow .. wish we had one back home. The handmade tortillas and meat and cheeses are delicious. These are truly authentic. Highly recommended ! I don't know of a better taco spot now!"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas Thursday 4 December, parked the car and went straight to Tacos El Gordon on the strip and it was closed....we didn't see a sign about remodeling....anyone know what's going on????  Thankfully we live 3 miles from their Chula Vista location but we were really looking forward to our favorite tacos (adobado) while on our mini vacation."}
{"text":"Been to Vegas many times and never got the chance to visit Tacos El Gordo! I've been missing out on some of the best tacos I have ever had in the USA... They are fast and always fresh. Tortillas are hand made while you order! Guacamole is delicious (actual avocados) !!! A need to try!!! Especially if you love tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Breaking....my New Year's resolution.
So this year's resolution was to eat healthier and to rid myself from any kind of addicted dependency but how can I do it when there's a f 'kng taco dealer in almost every corner here in Vegas? Specially tacos El Gordo where they can hook you up  with the purest and tastiest al pastor, asada , lengua and tripas tacos. So delicious and so addicting you would think that Walter White was actually doing all the cooking for you.
 Service is great friendly and efficient, the place is also very clean there's always an employee going around picking up trays and cleaning tables since this place is always packed with taco junkies. Every time I feel the urge to move to Colorado I stop at tacos El Gordo to remind myself of a reason to stay in Vegas. I swear nothing could beat a rolled taco with cilantro at tacos El Gordo. I only wish they were open 24 hours since is usually at the very late hours of the night when I start getting all those taco withdrawals after consuming a few spirited beverages.
They open late till 2am on weekdays and till 4 am weekends so make sure you leave the party or the club before that time so you can ingest some alcohol absorber. sometimes I get there late ( yes, I'm the one who knocks ) and end up looking for Roberto for an inferior fix.
I have tried other places and this are the tastiest and best street style tacos in town by far for the price. 
Take a break from that treadmill, throw those diet pills away and get yourself some antacids instead and drive to tacos El Gordo right now for some instant satisfaction.
Why?
 .....Because I say so!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! I wish I knew how good their Taco Tripa was!!!!! I would've eaten at least 6 of that!! Sooooo delicious and addictive"}
{"text":"There are SO many restaurants to chose from on or near the Las Vegas strip, but none will give you as much ethnic dining authenticity- especially at a good value- as Tacos El Gordo!  Just like Abuelita used to make!  The only problem with this place is that they don't serve beer.  Anywhere else in the world, this would cost a taco shop a star in my book, but in Vegas, it's almost a welcome break!  
No need to repeat what others have said in detail: it's clean, it's friendly, it's fast, it's relatively inexpensive, and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this damn place. I always come here after a video, photoshoot, or having completed a project. The food is always rewarding, literally order ANYTHING its great!"}
{"text":"excellent! I highly recommend the pork. The fries were surprisingly delicious. They look like a mess on the plate but they taste absolutely amazing. The service was fast and this is some of the cheapest food that you can get on the strip. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"DUUUUDE YAAAASSS! Hot damn, I didn't care much for Vegas Strip but will gladly go back for these BOMB ASS tacos. Bring a few extra stomachs and each can wait in each taco line. Seriously these tacos are what taco dreams are made of. Blew all your money at the slots? Psssh go to Tacos el Gordo and know you are still winning ..at life! 

Food: 10/5 
Service: 3/5
Place: 3/5"}
{"text":"Very good tacos. You would think beef tounge is gross... but its melts in your mouth and has a strong beefy flavor. I highly suggest those. But really you cant go wrong. Nice service too."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place make so much business, those tacos are disgusting and definitely not worth 1 hr wait on line to eat this garbage.
I was there last night for the 1st and last time the following day I went to Chipotle instead.
I feel sorry for those calling this place the best mexican food, they obviously haven't try real mexican food.
This is the opinion of a paisa who is into tacos not trash."}
{"text":"Just found out they not only have another location in Chula Vista, but in Lake Elsinore! Why didn't you guys TELL ME!?!"}
{"text":"Food was ridiculous, best lengua tacos I've ever had. If you've never had lengua before but are feeling adventurous, this is place to experiment! The staff was super helpful, they have some off menu items available that they will gladly tell you about. I want to eat all the language tacos they have. I will be here again and again and again. Best Mexican food in Las Vegas in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"- FOOD: The food is good and flavored. The portions are reasonable for the price. I understand why people are waiting that long to eat there. 
- STAFF & ORGANIZATION: The staff is nice, but everybody speaks mostly Spanish. It was difficult for me and my husband to be understood. So we could not order everything we desired. Moreover, the organization is very bad. The place was packed, and we could not figure out where to go and wait. The menu is not clear for people too, and one more time no one was here to guide us. 
Overall, I and my husband won't come back because we feel that the service did not satisfy us. However, if you speak Spanish and know what you want to order, this place can be good for you."}
{"text":"For the sheltered American, it may take a bit of bravery to experience Gordo. It is not in the most pleasant neighborhood, it is very authentic Mexican, and there is a little bedlam going on when ordering while the place is busy. Be a little more brave when you get up to the counter and order things like tongue and tripa (intestines). If you can get your mind past your American upbringing, explosive flavors await. Do not expect anything past bare-bones decor and service at Gordo, because it certainly does not care about them either. This place is driven toward one goal: fast, tasty, authentic Mexican fare. And it not only reaches that goal, it kicks it in the balls and then stomps all over it (in a good way)."}
{"text":"Sorry these tacos were terrible. Worst street tacos I have ever had!  The carne asada meat was burnt and very salty. What a disappointment. I cant even finish eating them, they are so bad. I have no idea how this place has 4+ stars. It deserves zero stars!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for a long while from various friends, specifically one friend. Finally decided to try it when near the area. 

Super busy location. First time ive been to a restaurant like this. There are different lines for different things you want. Top favorite meat among a lot of people is the spicy pork (adobada). Then of course, you have the usual carne asada, as well as the more \"exotic\" eats like stomach, tongue, etc

Their taco's are priced pretty much around the same price ~$2/ea with exception to the tongue being $2.25

Aside from the tacos, another popular thing that was suggested were carne asada fries. Being one who has tried carne asada fries in the past from another place (Roberto's), i was eager to try these ! 

Adobada - spicy pork, freshly sliced off the rotating spit. Seasoned nicely. Not spicy (sadly) but still delicious

Carne Asada - Freshly cooked on the hot plate and sliced. More towards the medium  to medium well but still fairly tender. Would like a less meat temp cook but they probably use a better quality or cut of meat to produce a nice tender texture. 

Pork Stomach - simmering in an unknown broth, cut upon order. Very tender and flavorful. 

Beef Tongue (lengua) - same as the stomach, cut upon order. Super flavorful and tender. Tongue has a different texture than normal meat but its porous in a way to soak up some of the broth it was sitting in

Nice location, which they'd open one up on the west side of town. I believe there's one on the Strip as well."}
{"text":"These tacos are so delicious................ I wish they had a location in Los Angeles. I ordered a taco de lengua and chorizo. The lengua was one of the best I've ever had. It was topped with onion, cilantro, and green sauce that made it taste amazing. My boyfriend ordered a mulita con carne adobada which was also delicious. The cheese that they use gave it a rich flavor. If you are ever in Las Vegas I recommend this place. I looked up their other locations which are in San Diego so I will need to visit them when I am out there."}
{"text":"The most bang for your buck!! I love that the tacos are only a dollar each, I payed 8$ for a meal that filled me up more than I thought it would. They don't short you on the meat either. The staff is also friendly and very Mexican lol or should I say \"authentic.\" The only complaint of mine would be that its hot as ballz inside there but that's what adds to the authentic experience."}
{"text":"I didn't like their system of ordering tacos. I had my boyfriend stand in line while I found a seat to rest my feet and apparently there are different sets of lines, I wanted pastor and he wanted asada, he came back with asada and had to go back in lkne and wait in other 30 minute line. I finally told him forget it and for him to come and eat his Tacos before they got cold. I was so mad that night i could cry I didn't end up eating."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Al pastor but this one did it for me. I enjoyed them more than the carne asada ones."}
{"text":"Hands down amazing Mexican food. El pastor tacos are delicious, no need to get anything elsr."}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw that Tacos el Gordo opened more locations in Vegas. I love the original location in San Diego and came expecting the same great taste. 

The line was long, but the wait was always worth it. Sadly, this location let me down. The  flavor was definitely lacking compared to the original location. There was something missing, and my meat was kind of dry. We also tried the fries, which were new. They weren't that great, and I wouldn't suggest getting it. 

If you've never been to the location in SD, then you can't compare it. But if you think these tacos were amazing, go to the original if you get a chance and you'll be blown away."}
{"text":"Read so much reviews of this joint that i recommended it to a couple of my friends and received great feedback from them, and i was determined to try it out.  I'm a fan of King Tacos in LA, a 24hr taco joint with great lengua among other stuff, and had not found a comparison in Vegas.

So i dropped by there last week and ordered a lengua, carne asada and of course the adobada tacos, chasing them all with an iced horchata.  Mucho delicioso is all i would say! Very entertaining as well to watch the guy carve up the adobada and dressing it up so colorful with pineapple, salsa and this creamy green sauce.  Do ask for the grilled jalapenos and green onions to bombify the tasty tacos! 

I have yet to try the very sinful looking carne asada fries, but since fries is my lil addiction i'll just bring a unsuspecting friend next time and get help trying the tasty treat.

I'm definitely a fan and will bring my friends there to cure their late night alcohol induced cravings~"}
{"text":"The most amazing tacos I ever had. Went on a friday afternoon and the place was packed. Not easy to get a table, long lines that move really slow, but it's worth the wait and the pushing. The \"must have\" are the Tacos de lengua and tacos de tripa. Sopes and quesadillas are good. Don't forget to ask for your free tostadas, guacamole and salsa."}
{"text":"I'd never expect to find such a great taco joint on the strip. This place gives some of the big name taco shops in LA a run for their money! The chorizo vampiros are a must try and for about $2 an item, it's even more worth the try!"}
{"text":"We came here because of recommendations and when we walked in it was packed so we figured it would be good, I stood in like to order for 1 hour and about 15 to 20 minutes for my food to get ready then had to get in another line to pay. Honestly the food was not that good. Very disappointed. Asana tasted plain and the asada fries were gross. It's not worth it. I should have known when a lady in line said it was whatever nothing to brag about. And the employees are thieves, a lady sitting eating dropped money and an employee walked by and picked it up and put it right in her pocket! That is so dishonest. Smh. There is a first and last for everything"}
{"text":"They're Back... Like most people Gordo moved because they raised the rent, but like most people they didn't like the new place in the cuts so they came back to the strip in the old location near the Wynn. The same Amazing 5 star taocos and the same long lines. Who knows how many DUI's they avoided by moving back. Thanks for coming back Gordo. We missed you. The one on Charleston just isnt the same."}
{"text":"Food was ok, the wait is not worth it at all. Plus the seating is very limited inside, which forces you outside. And when it's freezing cold and windy, that is not appealing. Plus, their system for payment is backwards.. you go from the line to the tables and behind those are the cashiers.  So if you are fighting for tables, you still have to pay first (because they need to see your order tray) and then you can go find seating. It just wasn't well organized, and the food is not worth the fuss."}
{"text":"YUMMAYYYYYY.

SOOO great for drunchies. It's literally across the street from the Wynn/Encore, so super easy to access. The best part is that the food is DELISH and CHEAP!

There was a short line when we went, on a Thursday night around 1am (I know - I'm old now, can't hang!), but well worth it! Yummmmmmmmsssss."}
{"text":"Best authentic taco spot!!! Its hard to find a legit taqueria but this one is it people ! They are so friendly and quick!! Please do yourself a favor and have a sope!! They grill the cheese on the sope and then add the meat of your choice. Only wish they had one in Henderson !!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best lengua Taco I've ever had carne asada was pretty good too both or Tender love that they make the tortillas in house and the place is cheap and fast and get a watch and make your food great place to go I wish they had one in Phoenix would be there at least once a week"}
{"text":"Two things I recommend:

1.  Tacos Adobada 
2.  Fries con Adobada

I love pork on my tacos and Tacos El Gordo does it right.  Adobada I guess is a relative to al pastor or is very similar hence my love for this place.  The adobada comes off a huge rotisserie, that they carve it off the rotating piece of meat and satay the carved meat.  The tacos adobadas are topped with this spicy green sauce and pineapples [if requested].  3-4 tacos are an adequate amount for a meal and a half order or french fries with adobada is a must.

Service is excellent - Make sure you tip them!

Best times to come - After lunch and before dinner otherwise it's a madhouse."}
{"text":"This place is equivalent to a fast food restaurant to a Mexican. I was extremely disappointed. There is too much 'hype' but nothing impressed me. 

The food does not look anything like the pictures. The food is made way too fast, it lacks in ingredients and flavor. If you want a cheap version of Mexican food that is affordable, sure... try it if you must, but personally I would not recommend. This place is in walking distance of many hotels & clubs since it is on \"the strip\" hence explaining how busy it gets. The lines are incredibly long and move way to slow since people get multiple items. They should hire more help. They only have 1 restroom which is absurd. Not a lot of space when it comes to tables. Be prepared to eat outside, standing up. Ordering your food and then paying (in separate lines) is chaotic. Don't know how they make it work. This place also lacks in customer service. Staff could be a little friendlier. 

I really wish they had chicken as an option. The adobada had a strong red color to it... I've never seen it that color, so I stayed away. I had the carne Asada fries. As soon as I opened the box, I was upset. It looked nothing like the picture that made me crave them in the first place. The meat was not well seasoned or cooked to my liking. Some meat was darker than the rest. There was not enough cream or guacamole salsa. I thought it came with pico de gallo as well, I guess I was wrong. The salsa wasn't as hot as I expected. I only ate about half, there was way too many fries and not enough toppings. Good portion, but not worth my money. 

I would not come here again."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles so I know a decent taco when I see one. This place was recommended to me so I took their advice and came by to see for myself.
It was super packed and the lines were separated by the choice of meat you want(weird). I wanted asada but the line was long for that one. I waited for half hour and ordered 8 tacos and one Azteca taco because I like Nopales(cactus). 
4 stars for the Azteca taco, it was semi decent, I wish I had ordered more of those instead of the asada.
The asada is not marinated in anything but salt and pepper. I guess they want the charbroiled typical asada flavor you get in Tijuana and want the meat to stand out like this. If you're okay with that I guess it's okay, I personally would have liked the meat to have some sort of marinade, no I'm not picky but giving my honest opinion. Sorry but tacos have no flavor.
I wasn't a fan of the avocado topping, it should be optional to have it on your taco, here all tacos come with avocado, I didn't know that. I like mine straight up just the meat, cilantro, salsa and onions with the option of adding guacamole and extra hot salsa.
I guess I got spoiled from growing up with King Taco and having amazing tacos from just about every taco place in LA so these to me were average, nothing to write home about.
The price per taco was okay, 2.25 each. Taste was a 3 star. Cured my tcraving but for the long line and wait, not somewhere I would go out of my way for next time I'm in town.
By the way, I hope the cooks working in high heat get paid well, they work really really hard. Make sure and leave them a nice tip because they do deserve it. I was very impressed with that. For them I give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Taken there by a couple of good friends, I enjoyed the food, but can't imagine ever returning there on my own.

Lines are long, it's crowded, the ordering process is convoluted / painful, and seating is limited. 

I seriously can't think of a single occasion when this would be an appropriate choice restaurant for me. Too crowded for a group of friends. Too much of a hassle to go alone. Too loud to bring a girlfriend and enjoy her company. 

I have nothing against the place. Again, I liked the tacos, but it's popularity is working against it."}
{"text":"Eh it was okay. Not my type of taco joint and Ive been to a lot even some all over México.  Tacos are made fresh in front of you and they are pretty quick. Didnt care for the Quesadilla preparation. Its like a tostada with melted cheese....never had it like before and ive had a lot of em. The lady behind me ordered the same and was surprised. It was good but not what i had in mind. To their credit they make the tortillas right in front of you.

FYI Robertos makes better Carne Asada fries and they are cheaper. 




Ill stick with Los Compitos and Tacos Gigantes."}
{"text":"Excellent flavor. The al pastor was incredible, the meat was perfectly burnt on the ends to give you that crispy texture and the meat was tender. Chorizo was great as well but al pastor was the real winner here. You can ask for sides of sauce if you'd like as well. The line situation appears confusing at first but it's basically: wait in line for which meat you want and use a tray to move to different lines for different tacos. The final line is to pay. Large style table seating but the lines can be long. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I must rate this place one star because of the service, the tacos are good, but I recommend the Mula over the tacos.

The reason for the low score is the service. There are 5 lines, ONE LINE FOR EACH MEAT option, that upset me big time. We were in a line expecting to be able to order any meat, but were sorely mistaken. After waiting 20 minutes to get to the front of the line, we asked for 4 asada tacos. The attendant said \"sorry. The line for asada is 2 lines down\". We were like WTF!!! He then said \"you are in the adobada line\". ***how does that make any sense????***  therefore you need to get in one line for asada and then let those tacos get cold as you get into another line for adobada and then let those tacos get cold as you get into another line for tripas. WTF!!!  How does this make any sense?  Oh and did I mention it took us 20 minutes to get to the front of the adobada line (which was the shortest of all 5). 

If you want to go to this place you need to take the amount of people with you with the amount of different meats that you want. Example: you want two meats take 2 people. One person stands in asada line and the other in adobada line and you order each other's tacos. Do not take kids because it is packed and it is a true cluster. You can't expect kids to be patient as you try to stand in each line to order a different meat.

Like I said. Food is good, but honestly not soooo good that it is worth dealing with the crouds and multiple lines and confusion.

That is just my opinion but I always recommend you find out your own experiences. Good luck.

Will my husband and I go back \"HECK NO!!!\""}
{"text":"I couldn't tell if I was still drunk or hungover. Either which, my diminished blood sugar filled rage went ahead and decided to order everything I possibly could.

The neat thing about this place is that they separate the lines into three, so different stations serve different items. I didn't dare venture into the soup looking thing, so I stuck to the tacos and loaded french fries.

For the price, venue, and how drunk I was this place was freaking awesome."}
{"text":"So yummy! Very overpriced but you get what you pay for! $2.25 per taco for food on the LV strip it's not that expensive. There's a bunch of these exact restaurants all over Vegas all of their lines are out the door but the strip location is the busiest!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great prices and portions!!! Took my wife and she loved it! I've been here several times and they have yet to let me down!"}
{"text":"Best taco shop in town if you know tacos you know this good job tacos el gordo I love this place the customer service is ehh bt I mean there always swamped when I go I dont blame them if you haven't tried this spot you honestly need to its my go to taco shop they stay in point must trys cesos tripas buche cavasa bomb"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the rave is about this place. Tacos were not good at all. We didn't even finish what we ordered. I got the carne Asada which was plain. And the BBQ pork was also plain. Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"My favorite tacos in Las Vegas! Perfect for lunch or after a night out. It's really cool how you can see them making everything  to order with fresh ingredients. My favorites are the El Pastor tacos and carne asada mulas. Depending on the time the lines may be a little long but it moves fast and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Walked in by chance and was blown away.  The place was packed and the food was great.  I had a lengua, spicy pork and asada and all were some of the best i have ever had."}
{"text":"Good place for street tacos 24×7 on the strip. Some times the line is way out the door. Especially on weekend nights. This is a no frills this is what you got place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is great, was in town for SEMA and a friend brought me here. I was definitely hesitant, but man, the tacos are delicious. Despite it being fairly busy, they're made fast and the people are nice.  Definitely been craving these tacos now that I'm back home in Wisconsin. I think it will always worth a stop and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Definitely worth the wait. You get in line based on the type of meats you're ordering so, better to go with someone else so you can eat different meats. Once you order, then you go to pay. Seating is limited but not a big deal. We got our food and sat outside enjoying the nice breeze and watched others waiting in line...  
I've been in Vegas for 3 days and food along the strip has been highly disappointing and over priced. But this place totally fits the bill, hits the soul, and it magically takes you out of Vegas and in a taqueria in Mexico!!! loooooved this experience"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The line may have been long. But it was worth it. I had lengua and tripa. It was very good. If we go here next time, I want to get Tacos El Lengua. Which is Cow Tongue. The only downside is that its 6 miles away. And there are lots of people in line. I suggest you should go here if you're for something and somewhere to eat"}
{"text":"Fabulous tacos. Very authentic. Great price."}
{"text":"If only I lived closer! Best tacos in Vegas. The Cabeza tastes like bone marrow doused pieces of Beef. The Adobada is flavorful as well. With every bite came a sadness that the end of the meal was that much closer. 

The lines are long but it's worth it.

Note to management: open up a location in southwest vegas!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town, my husband and I love this place! Specially tacos el pastor and grill nopales!!"}
{"text":"So worth the wait!

Waited in line about 5 min it was a tad longer once you got inside!  You are put in a line according to what type of taco you want. So yummy. The meet was tender and full of flavor 

The security guard that was directing people was kind and courteous. She did a great job. 

The cooks! All I can say is WOW!  He knife skills are amazing!"}
{"text":"I wish this place existed back in Miami. There is no words that does this place justice! It was amazing fresh home style Mexican food. We tried almost all the tacos. My favorite was the al pastor and sope! It gets super packed and you'd think doesn't look like much but definitely not to be underestimated"}
{"text":"Had the carne asada and al pastor tacos. Amazing, steak was my favorite. They also had horchata out of the soda fountain, strange for me but tasted great!"}
{"text":"It was okay...I don't know what all the fussy is about.  I ordered like 4 taco sized things and 1 Carne Asada fries.  $35 with 2 drinks."}
{"text":"Tacos el gordo, what a great name. Made our way over here by uber and arrived at 11am. They open at 10am and the place was packed. When we left there was a line forming on the sidewalk. There are several lines to order from. If you want carne asada/steak there are several lines, then lines for other types of meat. It was confusing at first but then we got the concept. Personally, I thought the concept was a bit weird because if you want a carne asada taco and a lengua taco you need to stand in 2 separate lines. Probably not to cross contaminate the meat but it was kind of lame. The line I stood in took like what it seemed forever and a day. When you finally make it to the front you need to shout out your order. It took us 20 minutes to get to the front of our line and another 5 to prepare the food. The cooks are pretty good about getting everything but they will more than likely ask you again. It is very hot inside so be ready for that. 

Once you get your food make your way over to the register and pray there is a seat available. We got lucky and scored a couple. We ordered a total of 6 tacos and 2 fountain drinks for $18. One of the least expensive meals I have ever had on the strip in Vegas.  

Tortillas are freshly made. The portions are generous. At $2.25/taco you are getting a good deal. Mainly because the guacamole is not an additional charge and you get a huge portion on top. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 1 taco Azteca which is a carne asada taco topped with nopales (cactus). I loved my tacos. I thought they were phenomenal. People were friendly. I would go back if the lines were shorter. It is 5-stars for the food but ordering food in different lines wasn't my thing. I'm sure it works for them. Give them a try. The tacos will not disappoint. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This place has some good authentic food. I like it, especially the street tacos. Every taco places are different but the same. Different flavors of spices or the way some things are made can change the taste of the food. Various tacos you get in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, or California have some distinct taste and flavor of the food. For me, this place has some good food. Like or not, try it or not, that's your opinion and your choice. I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"The food is great! But the wait is horrible. No matter what time you go its always packed ! And once you have your food its hard to find a place to sit and tables are always dirty since they're so busy they don't bother to clean them."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite taco shop in the states, and that is probably because my all time favorite is the Tacos El Gordo in Tijuana. For some authentic & delicious tacos this place is a must, plus you can't beat the prices for the amount of food you get. I was in Vegas for 48hrs and literally managed to eat here on 3 separate occasions, and I plan for next trip to have a layover in Vegas just so I can stop thru and get my fix."}
{"text":"FABULOUS....no other words needed. Tacos were incredible - carne and carnitas. Food was hot and fresh, the employees friemdly, if hurried - it was crazy busy but they were hustling!! We will definitely be back on our next trip"}
{"text":"Nice taco place that is right across the street from Encore in a nice little strip mall. There are different lines for different meats, but I always get tongue and head so luckily for me that line is always the shortest! This place is always packed though but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes. It was a good experience. Enjoyed supporting a fast food chain that originated in Tijuana. I don't think we will do it again but we enjoyed the carne asada and al pastor tacos."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the famous Tacos El Gordo. Walking in to the building it's kind of confusing as you first order and certain lines are for certain meats or dishes . The security guard explained to us how it worked so then we proceeded to get in line. I ordered tacos se adobada and carne asada. The adobada was my favorite. The asada was also good too. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This was the first time i've been to this location. Was in the area due to work and decided to pick up some food up here. Located on the NE corner of Cheyenne and Losee, and beside the I-15. Its a convenient location for those who live on this side of town or are in the area. 

The restaurant itself, design is a bit different from the other two that are in town. Upon entry, to the left is where you get the food, to the right is where all the seating is at. Of course to the left, there are some seating areas as well. More seating in comparison to Charleston. MUCH less busy than both of them. I came here on a Wednesday early afternoon, granted the weather wasnt all that great, gloomy, but the skies didnt crack open yet (it cracked open like an hour later). \"Windows\", there are very limited amounts. If anything, it may be less than even the Charleston location.

Decided to get some fries and tacos this time. Small adobada fries, a lengua taco, and a buche taco. The fries were freshly fried upon order and an ample amount of the juicy, fatty adobada meat was sliced off the spindle. The tacos were made to a \"window\" over during the time the fries were being made. Everything looked great ! I paid for my food and decided to eat in my car and while snack on while driving. Meat flavor wise, seemed to be a bit lacking and underwhelming. Even the adobada meat, all i could really taste was a mild sweetness and fattiness. 

Overall, still a good location though. Wish they'd open one on the west side of town. Closest i got is the one on the strip T_T"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Tacos are way to expensive for what you get, $2.20 per taco. No where near TJ style tacos... fast food and fast service however setup is lame. You order and get hot tacos (food) than you stand in long line with food in hand to pay. By the time you pay your food is cold. They have to come up with a better plan, totally inefficient business process. However I don't think they would care since it's always packed in there."}
{"text":"I always come here whenever I visit Vegas. The prices are a little higher than most taco trucks, but I would gladly pay 50 cents extra for some good quality tacos. I've also tried sesos tacos here; never tried brains before but they were actually not that bad."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this restaurant from my San Diego friends and I'm glad I finally got to try it.  The lines when we got there on Sunday at 1 was crazy but by the time we got our food and finished eating at 2:15 the line was just at the door. 

The restaurant has a interesting setup in that different lines serve only certain types of meat.  So the spicy pork is in a different line from the carne asada.  The tacos are typical small sized and most guys in our group had about 6-7 and I had 9. 

My Favs:
Spicy Pork
Lengua - tender but still has that tongue texture

Decent:
Carne Asada - a bit dry and not as much flavor
Cabeza - slightly on the fatty side imo
Tripe
Suadero - too salty

Didn't like:
Pork Shoulder - I thought it was too salty and the meat was dry
Carne Asada fries"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I had 4 tacos.. 2 spicy pork.. 2 tongue.. so disappointing. I think most reviewer's must recall these on the tail end of a Vegas Strip drunk. Probably the bomb after all nit w your drunk on. Sober.. I seriously prefer Taco Bell. Wow! That's ugly..lol.."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Street Tacos!!!!!!! Cheap, quick, hot and always delicious. Open til 5am on weekends for those late night cravings. I recommended the tacos al pastor (pork)  or the carne asada (steak) fries. 

One of the cheapest eats around, 3 tacos and a drink under ten bucks!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! My boyfriend, friends, and I go every time we are in Las Vegas!! Best late night place and even Sunday morning spot. The food is authentic and good."}
{"text":"Some of my friends were here a few weeks ago for the Canelo vs Amir Khan fight and recommended this place to me. I'm sure they glad that they did! I ordered three tacos of al pastor and a Carne Asada vampiro with everything on it. The food was absolutely amazing! All of the ingredients were fresh and the meat was grilled on site. The food was well priced and they even had a horchata drinking fountain. My only gripe was the seating. There were a lot of people there but I guess you should expect that a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"If I am totally craving tacos... and don't mind getting into some 'Las Vegas Blvd.' traffic... COME HERE! Normally, my husband and I come here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. It is still a packed crowd, but not as bad as the Friday/ Saturday night crowd. Out of the handful of times I have came, I have only came on a Friday night ONCE! That might be the last time we do that. 

Don't be fooled by the small appearance of these tacos... they can really fill you up. Order what you can honestly handle. Then if you are still hungry, it will be a matter of \"how hungry?\" and \"how long am I willing to wait?\" 

My go-to items are the pork \"adobada\" tacos, Steak 'Carne Asada' tacos, and pork sopes. I have tried the carne asada fries, but it is quite overwhelming (and that was just the 'half order'). If you do order the fries... it should be a) the only thing you eat... or b) you are going on a Man vs Food challenge. 

Tacos are $2/ each. Specialty items (i.e. Sopes) are $4. 

Seating can be a challenge here (esp. if you come during the Friday/ Saturday night crowd). We ended up eating at the car that night."}
{"text":"Always packed but the food is delicious. You have to stand in line! It is worth the wait. These are the best tacos north of the border in my opinion. Definitely recommend to ALL!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. Great late night drunk food. As long as I live in Vegas this will be my go to late night place."}
{"text":"This is a must do in Vegas. Especially when you get tired of paying 45 dollars for every decent meal. I lived in Mexico City for a few years and the one dish I have missed since returning to the states is Tacos al Pastor. They have them at a number of different places but El Gordo does it right!! Cut right in front of you! Heaped with onion, cilantro, and pineapple. I will definitely be stopping by every trip to Vegas to get more! My mouth is watering as I am writing this review. They have lots of options but pastor is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, the wait was not long at all. I ordered 2 spicy pork tacos. And my fiance ordered a half order of the Adobada Fries. This totaled to just under $10. 
I watched one of the workers shave the pork right onto the tacos. They were very flavorful. The pork was juicy with a slight crisp to the outside, SO good. 
I didn't try my fiances fries but he ate ALL of it so I'm pretty sure he loved them.
Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love a perfectly executed taco. I know there are lots of fancy tacos and unlimited combinations by my favorite is a carne asada taco with guacamole, lime, a little hot sauce on a handmade tortilla. I am very picky when it comes to tacos, I grew up in Mexico and I had tacos at least 3 times a week. 
Tacos El Gordo has some of the best tacos I've had here in the states. First off, their meat is fresh, some places use cheap meat and they try to mask it with good salsa. I get my tacos with salsa on the side, drenched meat is not appealing to my taste buds. I went to Tacos El Gordo and I tried a vampiro which is a toasted tortilla with melted cheese and carne asada on top. Similar to a quesadilla but the tortilla is toasted instead. I also got a carne asada taco and hubby got lengua (beef tacos) the meat was tender, the salsa was spot on and the place was clean. The reason I gave it one star is because people have to make line according to the type of taco they want, so if I want three diff kinds of meat I have to make line 3 times. I'm lazy so I only make one time, hubby made line for another kind. It was really good, next time I will try the al pastor one."}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle. We don't have a lot of options for good, cheap Mexican food. Tacos El Gordo hooked it up with spicy al pastor-style spicy pork, rotisseried to perfection. They threw on some good onions and sauce and veg, some guacamole on the side, and even a cut of pineapple on top. Also got a carne asada taco, which was awesome as well. Service was friendly, prompt. 5 star would eat again."}
{"text":"Meat taste like the grill.  Could do better with cleaning it before grilling. Overall. Clean.  Friendly.  Would recommend"}
{"text":"This place was very very good .... excellent taqueria ... leave u wanting more gr8 selection and Long lines but quick dispatch from the taqueros."}
{"text":"GROSS!! Where do I begin. I was hoping for some awesome food. My homies from work had mentioned about going here. I decided to finally give it a try. They said delicious and huge stuffed tacos. Cool, im a taco kind of guy. You walk in it a normal place. Old style fast food kind of place. The menu is basic, tacos with different kinds of meat. I saw meats I wouldn't touch but knew enough to choose the Carne Asada, Spicy Pork, and Pork Tacos. Staying away from the tongue and other things that are scary and gross tasting to me lol. Anyways, I get my order, pay and get a drink. I should of figured something was up when one of my tacos was covered in foil. I sit down and start on the Carne Asada taco. Pretty decent, mild flavor and hardly any fat. The onions and cilantro was fresh and the salsa was tangy. Cool, Im thinking maybe the spicy pork taco should even be better. It to was decent. Nothing spicy about it. It was more colored pink as an illusion to spicyness I guess. Kinda bland in flavor. Im starting to think that this place isnt as good as my friends said. Especially for the price of a couple bucks per taco. Which are small and not worth the price. They werent even stuff like the name claims lol. I take off the foil to the last taco. Its the Pork Taco so I thought. It was fatty, smelt weird and had greyish chunks in it. the texture looked like some kind of sea creature. I asked an employee is this pork? Not pork tonuge or kidney or some strange animal part, just is this PORK? She said yes. I took a piece of the so called pork and took a small bite. THATS NOT PORK!! If it is, they have some nasty ideas what pork is. I think some health inspectors need to investigate and see what they are selling as Meat, especially the pork. Eat at your own risk, this is one place I will never, ever go to again!! Until next time, Let's Eat!!"}
{"text":"Super busy, the line is usually out the door. The meat is very thoroughly marinated. The atmosphere is great. The tripe is a bit dry, but the other meats are great."}
{"text":"When your looking for speed, quality, and price, this place hits on all marks. Some of the best tacos i've ever had in my life. I like that you can try all sorts of different meats from head, tongue, leg, and even cheek meat. On my last visit I think that I ordered almost one of every style of taco. What was really outstanding was the grilled green onions and peppers you can get as a side, probably the best version out of any taqueria in Vegas. The corn tortillas are very good as well. Everything is very clean and the prices are right on point. Everything tasted fresh and well made, I liked it. This place also seems to be packed, and there is a good reason."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've had on the Strip. It is annoying that one can not order all the different types of tacos from one person. If you want Carne asada you go in one line, you want lengua you have to go to another line, again, annoying. But if you're going as a group, best way to try everything and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"24 hrs and great food. We had the tacos, some burritos and a torta and they all tasted great. Definitely recommend the place"}
{"text":"These tacos were delicious ! 

It is however super packed 
And you have to wait in different lines which is stupid 

You can't order your food in all lines 
There's a taco line 
And then a line for quesadillas and tostadas and I think the other line in burritos and fries 

The system just doesn't work 

However... The food was so delicious I couldn't even be mad ! The gave us whole Carmelized green onions and I feel in love eating them on my tacos !! Wish they had one closer to home in Cali

It's worth the wait"}
{"text":"Whenever I get the urge for some tacos I'm at Tacos EL Gordo. The line moves quickly even if it's out the door. Food is cooked to order and the cooks are cool with variations. I'm an Asada guy but the al Pastor is great also. I had the tacos but since I first tried the Mulas that's all I get now. I'm from Cali and it's my best experience with Mexican food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food! Very authentic! The meat was nice and juicy. The tortillas are warm and not sticky! If you eat lots of tacos you'll know what I'm taking about. My uncle works at the original Tacos el Gordo in Tijuana and I must say I did not expect them to taste so similar to the ones he makes! This place does tend to get packed on late weekend nights so be aware. The price is a little higher than the average taco shop but it's nothing crazy. Go ahead...ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic tacos in Vegas. They have a variety of meats to choose from but make sure you know what you are ordering. Some include tripe (pork stomach), lingua (beef tongue), and sesos (beef brains). I tired the stomach and tongue and it was delicious but if you aren't as adventurous the spicy pork and steak are more mild. Very long line and crowded but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is because you have to know that the wait is endless, and there's no air conditioning, and the way the lines are \"organized\" is ridiculously confusing. I think it's on purpose so there's not 100 people waiting, just 50. But we keep going back. You have to. The food is amazing. Get the mulas. Get the abodabo.Go in a team and split up for speed. Allow extra time. Eat like a local. And order more than you need, because you don't want to go back for seconds..."}

{"text":"Being a fan on Tacos el Gordo now, i wanted to try their Strip location, located a little north of the Wynn Casino. You may or may not pass it the first time but once you pass Wynn, and the little overpass (desert inn), there is a parking lot that leads to a Church . You can either park here (before Tacos el Gordo) or park in the lot after passing the restaurant. The restaurant itself faces Las Vegas Blvd, so not hard to spot it if you are looking for it.

Unlike the Charleston location, this location also has outdoor seating. Something different from the other location as well, they have double the amount of lines, but as you can probably guess.... this location can be MUCH MUCH busier. But if you want tongue/stomach, i think there is only ONE line for that (far right off to the side). 

First time i came here, mid day, not really busy at all. Later few times, were in the evening, SUPER PACKED ! ! You'd think there was some sale or something ! 

Some people say the quality of their stuff is less than of the Charleston location. Meat quality, i think is the same. If you were to order fries, i've had varying experiences with that. Sometimes fresh out of the fryer, sometimes not. 

My favorites to get is beef tongue, pork stomach. Super flavorful and something you usually dont get at your chain store Taco Bell (rarely go fast food anyway, esp not Taco Bell)

Good idea, if you are going with other people... is if you want different meats, have each person be in different lines and get the order. Otherwise, you'll be in line for a long long time... 

Surprisingly, even the outdoor seating, there is always someone cleaning up. Great service ! Not like that was something i was looking for anyway, but it was a plus ! A lot of times, while sitting there after eating, and just talking, they'd come up and help us take our trays and trash away. 

Good central location to go to if you live on the West or South side. Fairly easy to get to, unless the Strip is busy due to a holiday or weekend."}
{"text":"Good taco spot on the strip. Usually go for the Camepechana fries which are like Carbe Asada fries but use half Al Pastor meat and half Carne Asada.

Usually this place has a long line extending outside. If it's that long, it's not worth it to eat. It ain't that good to wait outside in the hot Vegas sun. 

Also noticed they raised their prices recently."}
{"text":"We ended up here late at night after partying from a tip we got from our cabdriver from the night before.  I'm not sure how he ended up telling us about this place, but I am SO happy he did. 

It's not far from the main part of the strip, just a few minutes past the Wynn in this janky strip mall area, but you can't miss it since there is a big sign at the front of the building.  

You walk in and order right from the guy making your taco/burrito/nachos/fries/meat, and you can watch them making everything fresh.  I was especially excited that they were pressing and cooking their own tortillas on the grill right in front of me.  The way they cook their meat reminded me of a churrascaria, including the pineapple heads on the ends.  You could see the juice dripping allllll the way down the meat as it cooked on the spit...oh man. *drool*

We had just 1 carne asada fries to share between 3 girls and 1 carne asada taco to try.  This was more than enough food for us for our late night cravings.

Forget the crap fast food places on the strip after drinking.  If you want legit Mexican food late at night after partying hard in Vegas, do yourself a favor and grab a cab and tell them to get you to this tacqueria."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and was happy to find out it was in Vegas on our trip. I tried the adobada tacos and they were amazing. I'm craving tacos all the time now."}
{"text":"Large variety compared to a lot of other Mexican food places! And for a decent price! The menu ranges from $2-$12. The best thing about this place is that they're pretty much ALWAYS open!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. Their tacos are the best what do we all expect? I'll will wait in line for the best tacos in Vegas. Everyone will! And all of us do! We enjoy this place and their food. 5 stars for the employees that work here. They work hard all day and night. You guys rock! I know what it feels like to have a restaurant full of customers waiting in line for food. Overwhelming at times. They make it look like a piece of cake. Good job guys! I enjoy the food every time. I was born and raised in Vegas. Any local knows that this is the spot!"}
{"text":"The line was worth it. I wanted to surprise my boyfriend because he hadn't eaten there since he lived in Tijuana, Mexico. He was super excited and when we got there it was packed. The hype is true. The tacos were amazing, defintely recommend to anyone looking for authentic tacos made from the heart."}
{"text":"Incredibly packed for a reason. My partner said he used to eat here as a kid back in the original location of Tijuana. Surprised him with this for dinner, he loved loved loved it. As a first timer myself, I can see why he loved it. Everything was soooooo good. I was literally licking off everything from the foil. They're not the most endearing people but how can you be when there's always a line out the door? They're super efficient and precise. It is a little loud but it's part of the experience."}
{"text":"OK, it's not Nobu, no celebrity chef behind the kitchen doors and no fancy plates or tablecloths but this was the only place I visited twice during my stay (and can't wait to go back to). Nothing fancy, just Mexican families, bikers, normal people enjoying true Mexican tacos: delicious, greasy, spicy. And at $2 each, best value in Vegas!
To order you have to queue in different lines according to which tacos you want: one line for spicy pork, one for tongue, etc. and then bring your tray to the cash, pay and hope for a table to be available (or take your order to go). 
Crowded at all hours so be patient! no alcoholic beverages, just sodas and \"aguas frescas\" (horchata is my favorite). My favorite tacos, it's a tough choice because all are delicious but I guess the spicy pork and tongue are the most special (the double tortilla is great, that way you don't spill the filling all over). 
It's just a 10 min. walk from the Wynn/Palazzo/TI/Fashion Mall intersection."}
{"text":"BEST. TACOS. EVER.

Actually everything there is good.. the lines suck sometimes, but just be patience because it is TOTALLY WORTH IT. 

I always love coming here after a long night of drinking... I just love coming here... PERIOD."}
{"text":"The drive is worth it to get these delicious little babies in my belly! (South Point area)

Suadero to AlPastor equal all the yummy-ness

Wish they kept the white onion; purple onion tastes odd on a taco.

Husband and I do constant foodie adventures and who doesn't like a good taco! 

Definitely a must try. Just don't go on Friday nights-Sunday the wait is ridiculous. ?"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had!!! Almost as close as the tacos from TJ. The best LENGUA tacos!!!!  Recommendation: Lengua tacos with a side of roasted chiles. DAAAAALICIOUS! !! 

NEVER MISS GOING THERE FOR TACOS WHEN IN VEGAS!!!

Worth $2 a taco! !!"}
{"text":"Too busy and over rated! I don't think people eat very many tacos cus they're just aight :)"}
{"text":"A must when you are in town! There was a long line but when through pretty quickly. Ordered the Al pastor fries and carne asada fries. In this match, the al pastor clearly won the competition. And don't forget about the Al pastor tacos. Soooo gooood!"}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos in Las Vegas. They are a little bit pricey compared to other taco places but 100% worth it they are always fresh and the restaurant itself is always clean and staff is very friendly.I recommend the spicy pork Mula with everything on it it's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 and we tried one of every thing . After devouring it all we went up for seconds and thirds. The large fries were huge an delicious. Spicy pork with pineapple tacos were amazingly good. Flavor bomb in your mouth!!! Friendly staff . Huge line almost out the door at lunch. Unique and delicious beverage selection along with your standard fountain drinks with refills."}
{"text":"Best tacos. Every time I come to Vegas, I must stop here!!!! The people there are super nice, the line is long but definitely worth it. Get the al pastor and asada fries for sure."}
{"text":"Good food on some days. Food is very inconsistent with flavor. I've gone there multiple times during the week it almost never tasted the same. I will go back because it is a good authentic taco, when they are on point they never disappoint"}
{"text":"I've been to another tacos el gordo in California and they all have the same set up. Order your tacos then pay. I think it was a good idea if there wasn't lines. I went to the lengua/buche/cabeza line and my bf made a line for the al pastor line. He got his tacos and I was still in line. He made the next line to pay for the tacos. I was still in line. He ate his tacos I was still in line. By the time I got my tacos made it to the paying line another 5 minutes all my tacos were cold. Set up is all bad. Not to say the taquero making the lengua and buche was slow asf. Ponte las pilas compa. I'm sure they are making mad cash they should figure out a better system so I could enjoy my tacos warm next time."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its reputation.the taste is authentic Mexican food.i usually go to the place in tijuana and it tastes the same.If there are people putting negative reviews out means they aren't Mexican.definitely 5 stars"}
{"text":"Make sure you get the red sauce- in any case I have to say not the best tacos I've had. I'm Mexican and live in LA - I can get better tacos any day somewhere else. Not worth the 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Wow. just wow. I thought I expected some sort of king tacos but totally different. taste just awesome. This place will be on my favorite list in Las Vegas.
      .   ..."}
{"text":"This review is for people who are not used to eating authentic Mexican tacos (because I have no idea what an authentic Mexican taco is). 

We were starving after visiting the Valley of Fire, and craving tacos, so decided to stop here. At first I wasn't sure exactly what to order since as an East Coaster this is not a style of taco that I'm used to, but we settled on the adobada, carne asada, buche, and the chorizo. I had NO idea what the buche was - it's pork stomach - and while it was my least favorite (so greasy), it was still good. 

Everything was super good, although everything was a bit greasy. My favorite was the chorizo, followed by the the adobada. Tip for those who don't usually eat this type of taco: Let them put all the toppings they usually do on your tacos because it helps cut the grease a bit. This may be inauthentic but I think it helps immensely. 

If we came again I would try the fries, since they looked amazing. 

Lastly, pretty cheap - 8 tacos and a soda were less than $20."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles CA, and even though we have some amazing taco trucks, I think these might just be the best tacos I have had in my life. The spicy pork (adobada) - but called pastor elsewhere, is knock your socks off fantastic. The chorizo and pork shoulder are great as well. I was adventurous and even tried the beef brain (sesos) and the beef head (cabeza). The brain is super unique,. It is extremely tender, almost mushy, and has a nice gamey aftertaste. The cabeza has more of a shredded beaf kind of texture, think pulled pork, but with some gaminess as well. I wouldn't order either again, but they were fun to try."}
{"text":"The walk from TI to Tacos El Gordo just beyond the Wynn was quite a trek (in my book) but to have these delicious tacos waiting for me at the very end was all worth it.

Upon entering, you grab a red tray and follow the signs to what kind of tacos you want to try. I got the lengua (beef tongue), carne asada, and al pastor--this is probably the same order in which I liked the tacos (from most to least). Each taco is about $2 so you can get by with a cheap Vegas meal. Love the fact that you see the meat being cooked right in front of your eyes. The tortillas are super tasty and you can tell they are made with care.

Yep, it's not quite upscale dining if you're into that for a Vegas experience but you came for the food right?"}
{"text":"I've been hearing so many positive things about this place, I was in Vegas and decided to stop by. To start of, this place did not meet my expectations, very small crowded and not much room for guest to sit. Aside from that, the food was not tasty at all very bland. And let's not forget about the service, the lady at the cashier charged us for water bottles and when we corrected her and told her we didn't want them she told us she could not take it off and we're forced to pay for them, and was very rude afterwards as well. How ridiculous is that, let's just say we're never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego and it was very good, although a little disorganized.

You stand in line for the type of tacos that you want and then pay at the cashier after you get them. My favorite are the tacos Adobada (Baja style spicy pork tacos with salsa, cream guacamole, onions and cilantro).

The Vegas location was a nightmare; After waiting in line for 15 minutes, it became apparent that they were not going to serve any more tacos because their equipment malfunctioned. They did not close the line or notify us, they just let everyone stand there until we figured it out on our own.

I went to the other side where there was another adoba line, and waited for 15 more minutes. One guy was ordering like 30 tacos, and then other people kept coming up to the people ahead of me and asking them to get them some more tacos so the line seem to get longer as I waited.  When I was about third back, the taco maker said something in Spanish to the person ahead of me who said \"there are no more tacos you have to get in another line\".

I didn't want to get in another line after waiting in wto fruitlessly, so I walked up to the front and talked to one of the girls making tortillas. She said something to the guy in the Adobada area who then made me three tacos, which he had enough meat for after all.

I then got in line to pay and get a drink. There were two cashiers but they were not very efficient so this took a long time as well. Finally, I got my cup and got to go get a drink. Well, they were out of ice and co2 as well because the drink was flat and warm.

I sat down and ate the tacos, which were pretty good (although not as good as the ones in San Diego). Overall this took an hour and a half of my life, not including the time it took to find a parking place on such a busy street. The quality of the food is the only reason I gave them any stars at all.

 I hope they train their staff better so they can get at least as organized as the other location, and learn to communicate with their customers when they have a problem like running out of food or CO2."}
{"text":"One of the best cheap and late night options in Vegas. I just go for the phenomenal adobada al pastor. That big spinning cone of meat. It's mesmerizing watching these guys work as they pump out al pastor tacos like a factory. Meat, vegetables, and sauces are literally thrown into tortillas. It's like watching teppanyaki at Benihana"}
{"text":"I mean it's Tacos El Gordo ... isn't that enough said?  YUM"}
{"text":"So good!!!! This place keeps it simple. One line for one set of meats and an other for a different set. Tacos are a good price for it being Vegas and after eating a few I was well past full."}
{"text":"Must visit when in Vegas. There open late and it hits the spot. Tacos are a bit expensive but cheap for Vegas in my option.  This location is busier then there other ones but this one is closer to the step. There are different lines depending on which meat you want but you pay at the end. The best way to order if you are in a group is to send people in different lines then pay once everyone is ready."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out as we LOVE tacos and sometimes it's hard to find a good taco place that serves Tripa & Lengua tacos. This place did not dissapoint! It was no wonder as to why the lines were so long. We went back two different times we tried; Lengua, Tripas, Sesos, & asada tacos, we also tried the Lengua fries. They were seriously the best I can think of that I have had. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you LOVE tacos. Also if it's your first time there the lines have signs so you could know what station serves what kind of meat."}
{"text":"On the strip but it's worth the visit in the winter months; aka, the line is short. My go-tos are the al pastor, tripe and cabeza. Those are just so dang tasty."}
{"text":"Get one each of everything line up 3 times - one for pork, one for beef and the last line at the far end serves offal etc. 

One of the best authentic Mexican places I've been to. Top notch. 

Had to come back the second time in 3 days. So bloody good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Sometimes there's a wait but it's because everyone goes here because the food is legit. My boyfriend always craves the carne Asada fries. Heads up--it's helpful to be able speak Spanish here to order and for them to verify the order."}
{"text":"I came here on Christmas Day and the line was WAY out the door. My friend and I waited in line for almost two hours for carne asada tacos and fries (other meats had shorter waits), but they were worth it. I had never tried carne asada fries before and I'm afraid to try them anywhere else now, in case they don't live up to the ones from Tacos El Gordo. 

I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas so I can eat from here again. I still dream about those fries."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the famous Tacos El Gordo! Albeit in LV, I was quite excited to try this popular taco spot. We came on a Wednesday around 2:00ish. There's a parking lot. Not big, but we were able to get a spot.

There was a line, but not bad as this place usually gets. You need to get in line according to the meat you're ordering. I got in the Abodaba/El Pastor line. I ordered 7 adobada tacos for three ppl, but the guy accidentally gave me 8. No problem! I asked for everything with pineapples. If you want pineapples, you need to ask for it. He chucks a thin piece off the whole pineapple that's roasting on top of the spit. 

I was watching the man make the tacos. It was a thing of beauty. He first grabs about 20 tortillas and lathers the sides of it in the drippings of the pork fat. (Heart-eyed smiley face emoticon inserted here.) After heating up the tortillas, he masterfully slices off slices of the unctuous marinated pork, tops it with onion, cilantro, salsa, and their famous green sauce. Using his long knife, he clips the pineapple and tosses it onto the taco for a perfect finale.

My sister was in the beef line and got an order of carne asada fries. You take all your food to the cashier where you pay. We also got an horchata. There's also fresh radishes and limes to help yourself to.

Upon my first bite, I knew why this place was so popular. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was everything I wanted in a taco and much more. The pork was flavorful and perfectly cooked. I loved the green creamy sauce. The pineapple offset the spiciness from the onions and sauce. Squeeze some lime on it. Take turn eating the radishes in between bites of the taco. Taco heaven. It was so good that I ordered an extra one to the two I ate. 

Also, FYI, you need to ask for grilled peppers and green onions as well. I forgot with my first order, but remembered to get it for my second.

The fries were okay. I found the asada a bit dry. I think the adobada fries would taste better. The horchata was very delicious too. Creamy and cinnamony.

Plenty of seating. People eat quite fast and clear the tables quickly.

Oh, boy. As I'm writing this review, I wish I could be eating a taco right now. Definitely try this place!! I'll probably look for an excuse to go to SD now, just to eat this masterpiece."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten tacos in Tijuana and these definitely compare to them. Best tacos you can find in a big city like Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, street tacos, etc on the north Las Vegas strip. The wait staff was a little bit grumpy, the process was disorganized and tough for someone who had not eaten there, but in the end it was great food at a good price. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the lines were very inefficient since they break their meats into 3 different lines. So if you plan on getting 2 or more different kind of tacos, they might be in different lines, which is a pain to wait in."}
{"text":"So we were told by boo's dad that we must visit this place in Vegas...so we did.
I can tell you that it is super easy to pass on the strip but it is in a plaza adjacent to Walgreens and they have little tents out front where you can sit and eat.

The menu is very basic, you tell the cook what you want and they cook it up right in front of you. I think I had steak tacos...I can't remember. I think boo had the same thing. They were pretty good but it was nothing exciting to me. I think I was still on a high from the 24 hour joint in San Diego. I guess I should have gotten the spicy pork tacos?
Apparently we beat the rush because there was a super long line of people waiting to order after we sat down and ate. They have soft drinks that taste like floats that are pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Great food. Tacos are simply awesome. Inexpensive delicious food. 2nd time here while on vacation. I'd recommend this spot to anyone for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"MOTHER OF JESUS I THINK I JUST CREAMED MYSELF.

No seriously, it's that good.

Whenever an establishment has several hundred reviews, and averages 4.5 stars, you can bet that their shit is pretty good.  Tacos El Gordo doesn't disappoint.

There is nothing that I can write in my review that other Yelpers haven't already told you.  The food is fucking good.  It's fucking filling.  And it's fucking cheap.  That's like the Yelper dream trifecta.  So instead of sitting on your iPhone, go now, and thank me later.

Warning: I'm part Mexican.  Which means that I fit in well in this part of Las Vegas.  This is NOT your Las Vegas strip by the Bellagio type of crowd.  This is your recently immigrated type of crowd.  So if you're not comfortable amongst ethnic folks, then you might want to hit up the location on the strip."}
{"text":"Great find on Yelp!  I suggest you bookmark this one for you next trip to the strip."}
{"text":"These are hands down the best tacos Las Vegas has to offer. I have a craving for these just about once a week and it's just so good every time. We usually get them to go and even after the drive home, they taste so amazing. We only ever get the spicy pork tacos and they are so flavorful and come with the yummiest sauce. Sometimes we also get lengua friends and oh my god the meat is so tender and the toppings just go so perfectly with it. Try the spicy pork tacos!!!"}
{"text":"This is the taco place that got me to fall in love with Mexican food! Well, the original location that was on the Strip was the one, but this location didn't falter to please. 
My sister and I had gotten a craving to come here since we hadn't been for awhile, and we were jealous that the little brother got to go without us... Sister Date! Anyway...
The ordering is pretty much the same, you pick a line with the meat you want, then tell them how you want it. My sister got to try Lengua (beef tongue) tacos, and we also ordered Adobada (pork) fries. The all the toppings still taste as fresh as can be. Both orders were fully loaded. Hahaha... Eating here can get messy, so ask for extra napkins. My sister was also surprised that she enjoyed the lengua: \"Taste more like regular beef than anything different, and texture isn't bad.\" Took awhile for the fries, but it came out fresh so there aren't any gripes there, plus they still loaded it with the pork. 
Oh man... We over-ordered though 'cause we forgot how big of the fries was, which was 1 entire to-go container. I helped her with about 3/4 of that thing, and we were supposed to half it! Shouldn't have ordered the tacos as well, but man... It was worth it! Our cravings are more than satisfied! 
Customer service is still good. Nice guys when you order up at the counter, and the ladies are always friendly when you pay. This location was pretty clean and not as busy as the closed Strip location, but we did go around 2PM. The seating area was good too, taking up more room than the original location. I don't recall any outdoor seating though. Only thing I wish they had was Jarritos soda."}
{"text":"If you care about tacos, or food in general, do yourself a favor and visit this place.

It's a little different because you have to order tacos first and then wait in line to pay, but you get to see exactly what they are making for you.

Try the following: lengua, pastor/adobada, buche, and Cabeza tacos."}
{"text":"i'll admit, my expectations were rather low.  everyone kept raving, and i was like \"whatevers, it's just tacos\".  and \"my gawd wtf is up with this line!\" \"do we REALLY need to wait here and eat this... we can get mexican food anywhere\".  
and then.... the adobada happened, and my mouth was way too full of deliciousness to whine any more.

there are 4 lines you can order from.  each line is designated for specific items, so if you want the adobada and you're standing in the carne asada line, you're shit out of luck.  better go to the back of the line, pronto!

we ordered 4 adobada tacos, 4 carne asada tacos, 1 carne asada sope, and a bowl full of chilis and all that jazz.  for all 9 items and a horchata (self serve) our bill was 23 bucks.  upon receiving all our food i really thought we were in over our heads and had ordered way too much... but we finished every single bite... and was left wanting more.

the carne asada was nothing special.  in fact, i've had better.  king taco's asada trumps el gordo any day.  but man, oh man, the adobada... the green sauce.  mind blown.  was so delicious.  

they have another tacos el gordo in chula vista, but none close enough to OC.  definitely will be going out of my way to get more hopefully soon.."}
{"text":"Really Las Vegas?!??!! These are the tacos your city offers at an average of 4 1/2 stars???
What a shame! The carne asada was dry as your desert, and my first bite was chewy and hard tendon/fat! Disgusting! And, we had to fight off the flies while dining indoors."}
{"text":"Great food... Essentially for meat eaters though because it's Tijuana style food... Huge lines very often but is worth it because the service is still fast and courteous..... Telephone ordering for pickup could use a little more work though... 2 out 5 times ordering over the phone my food was not prepared and I was having to wait even though ample time was giving to prepare. Suggested solution is a phone operator that is truly bilingual and can multitask."}
{"text":"This place is buzzing! You know is good when most of the customers are Hispanic. Seeing that big piece of adobada (spicy pork) on the rack when you walk in makes your mouth water. We got a sample of each, spicy beef, pork and beef on soft taco. All made to order with fresh ingredient, including the soft taco where they stamp them as needed. Don't forget to try the different meat such as the beef tongue, they looked good. They probably got some of the best tacos this side of Tijuana."}
{"text":"This place is OK, having lived in san diego for 4 years this is not as amazing as some other people make it seem to be, i mean the food is good but it really is a hit or miss depending on what you get. the fries here are not good at all! I would definitely steer clear of the fries but tacos are good! lines can get insanely long so make sure you are in the right line (each line is for a different type of meat) I recommend abodobe (or however you spell it)"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I like to stop by right after I get to veags when I'm not in the mood yet to start partying or going to a nice restaurant.

very cheap and quick food, that tastes pretty damn good as well! lines can get a bit long but they move fast, outdoor and indoor seating, parking lot faces encore/wynn"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best tacos I've had in a long time. I want their sauce recipe. I just want to buy them out so that I can enjoy being the patron saint of Tacos El Gordo. I want to be a millionaire just so I can eat these tacos all day. 

Yas."}
{"text":"This place is located all the way East of Charleston cross street is Bruce. Tacos El Gordo Only serves one dish and that's TACOS. This place is like the Inn & Out of Tacos. The place is  packed so expect a lot of noise. I would recommend the ADOBADA to anyone new to this place, and then expand from  there. There are exotic cuts that I've tried for the adobada is still the best. Cheap and Delicious is always a good combo in my book."}
{"text":"Just as good as the tacos I remember as a kid in Tijuana, Baja Mexico. Yum!! It was definitely worth the uber ride to the far end of the strip for a tasty taco lunch. It was pretty busy for the lunch rush when we arrived, but the service was pretty quick. They divide up the lines based on what kind of protein you want for your taco, mula, quesadilla, etc. The al pastor line is always the longest, because it's THE BEST. Don't let the line deter you, it's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Friggen fantastic.... always. I have had many tacos from this place and always...always this place delivers. Of course, my favorite is adobada/ al pastor but the rest is also good. The experience isn't romantic or even much more than an attempt to provide people with delicious tacos as fast as they can make them. Seating can be sparse and napkins are thin (a detail most people could'nt care less about) but with salsa dripping down your fingers you will notice. Or you can be an animal and lick the salsa off your fingers.... like me! Okay stop reading this.... stop... park.... walk in... and order adobada tacos already!"}
{"text":"At least keep to your posted hours. And it'd be nice if you didn't try to kick us out as soon as we got there (while other people are still eating)."}
{"text":"Nothing to say that hasn't already been said.  The Al Pastor Sopes are amazing.  Wash it down with a nice cold Horchata."}
{"text":"I came here for a late night snack. We cruised around and found this. We got adobada fries. The fries were cooked fresh. The meats were good. You see the guys literally cooking up fresh food. I managed to only eat half since I was hungry and needed to fill my belly. Fries were crunchy. Loaded with tons of guacamole and cheese. Really delicious!! 

To drink, I got an orange bang which was sweet and addicting. I got another refill since I was so thirsty. They sell Coke products which is a plus in my book. I normally get Diet Coke but was drinking a lot of it today.

There's plenty of seating inside and restrooms in the back. There's also outside seating but it was cold. 

A great place to eat at. If your in this side out town, check it out. Great food with great people and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Okay, it's 4am and you want something, greasy, fried, with meat and cheese, you want to stuff yourself silly just because you can and you don't want to spend more than...$8.  Where do you go?

This place.

It is packed, always.  But, the line moves quick, you can literally see all the food made by in right in front of you, including tortillas from scratch.

They have lengua fries!?  I love lengua, and I love carne asada fries, but the only way I could think to make asada fries better would be to swap out lengua, and this place does it!  And!?  They are amazing.

The tacos are super cheap and really really fresh, they have loads of drink choices as well as a huge variety of grilled Mexican goodies on request (jalapenos, onions, that sort of thing).

Serious, for delicious, grubby, 24 hour mexican food, it doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in years .. one has  to go through a \"maze\" to get them but worth it. Very authentic"}
{"text":"best tacos al pastor, i tried all the meats  and they are  all good but el pastor was amazing."}
{"text":"Great Food! Very Generous on the meats. Never fails, tacos are really good and filling. Mulitas look delicious didn't actually have one but one of my friends did and he absolutely loved it. Sopes taste really good the \"maza\" used to make the sope is very flavorful. Had the Campechana fries and honestly i would stay away from the asada,  i would say their specialty is adobada/ pastor, asada had a very overpowering smoky taste. Adobada is the way to go.  Location is off the strip, which is not a good thing but worth the drive! You wont regret it. Inexpensive."}
{"text":"Ordered the lengua, asada and suadero tacos. I think I ordered more than that but I couldn't really tell after the huge mess I made eating my tacos at a rapid pace. 

I was really unsatisfied by the food I was eating at the hotels and on the Strip and this place is just down the street from where I was staying.  

I've been to the Tacos El Gordo in SD and wanted to see what the LV branch tasted like. 

I came at around 11am in the morning and there was no line and ample indoor seating. Ordered my tacos and bit into the asada taco to find cold meat. I was really surprised. I know that the meat is cooked in a batch and used to make tacos and then another batch is cooked, but still - no reheating the asada on the grill? To top that off, the meat was a little tough so I was a bit displeased. 

The savior of the bunch was the lengua tacos. I could just gobble down lengua tacos all day because the meat is so soft and juicy. Juice literally sputters out at every bite!  I immediately regret getting the asada taco. 

Ordering is fast and efficient when there isn't a line. This establishment is spotlessly clean (well at least it was in the morning). Stainless steel tables and walls - and even the bathroom was spotless. Whaaaaaat. 

So even if my asada was cold, I was a happy camper. Later on while driving home I could still smell the tacos on my fingers and my mouth would water. A sign of REAL food. 

Skip the over-priced Strip and come here!"}
{"text":"Lo mas mejor!!!

I haven't had TJ style tacos since probably 2001 and that's a long freaking time! Born and raised in LA with frequent trips to Mexico all throughout childhood and well into adulthood, borderline/street tacos was our breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack. So it's only natural that this place is what hits home!

Super cheap tacos and aguas frescas to wash it all down; I was in heaven. You can get full with $20 as tacos are $2 each! We ordered 6 tacos; 4 de carne asada, 1 de lengua, and 1 de sesos. Lime wedges as well as radish slices were available to complete your meal. No long lines, fast service, ample seating indoors and outdoors, and music playing while you eat! 

There's nothing else to say than it felt like home the moment I walked in. We'll be coming back before we leave. I need my Mexican fix before I leave Vegas. You will be missed!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best taco spots in Vegas! I love how everything is fresh and cooked to order. I always get the al pastor and the carne assada tacos. The food is always great and the service is always with a smile!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for about a year now. When I first started going I LOVED it. Best place ever and great food. But now when I go, it's terrible. The workers are rude to me, and they never have the right toppings. I get steak tacos with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce. Last time I went all the had was guacamole. I would've rather ate somewhere else, but I had already waited in the long line. I will not be giving this location my serve anymore."}
{"text":"Sooooo amazing!!! El pastor tacos with that green sauce mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Ok, seriously... the best lengua tacos ever!!!! Tender, flavorful, and a little kick from the green salsa. I also tried the tripe, but it was too crunchy and hard for my liking. Orange cream soda also topped it off, but the lengua taco?? A definite must. And cheap!"}
{"text":"Best tacos of my life! I don't even like cow tongue (lingua) and here it is absolutely delicious. 

Well-priced, large seating area both inside and outside, and extended hours of operation are all pluses."}
{"text":"A chaotic hole in the wall right on the Strip. The layout is odd - there are several stations, each serving a couple types of tacos. You get your tacos and then go to the counter to pay. The line to pay Russ right in front of the soda fountain, so it's very chaotic.
But Damon! these are good tacos!
Cheap as well. $2.25 to 2.40 a taco.
Awesome place to get something to eat after an evening on the Strip."}
{"text":"Definitely a great spot to go eat at Las Vegas! I went expecting a huge line because of the reviews I had read on yelp.. But the line was actually pretty short! I went around 6:30p on a Sunday. 
Pros - they make your food right in front of you so you get your food faster.

Cons - there's separate lanes for each different type of meat.

Oh! And the Adobada fries are MUCH better than the Carne Asada fries from Alberto's.. The meat doesn't have a bunch of fat like the meat in Alfredo's does.. 

Overall this is a spot to try! I am definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Was really expecting to eat some delicious tacos. We stood in line for a good fifteen minutes while I pondered my choices and schemed how I would force the others to get more things that I wanted to steal. But just when we had moved up a bit in line, some worker came around and informed us that our line (which was one out of like fucking five thousand or something) was ONLY for al pastor tacos. That's about the most retarded system I've ever heard of. If you want to try more than one thing, you either have to pick some special super-secret line OR spend a few hours eating tacos while waiting in various lines. I'm not even sure where you pay. We ended up leaving, along with a bunch of other angry drunk people who didn't want to eat only al pastor tacos."}
{"text":"Three things:
1. You must get the adobada tacos with pineapple. 
2. This one seems to operate lines differently compared to the other ones. I wouldn't know cause there was no line when I went at 10PM on a Thursday night.
3. Adobada fries were on point. But the guacamole in it... not so much. What happened there?

Location: Just a bit out from Wynn. But walking distance, really. 

Overall, if you're staying on the Strip, it's one of the best (and cheapest) options on the strip. If you need some munchies or are straight up craving, it's definitely worth it for the tacos alone. And much more convenient than driving out to the other Vegas location. All in all, can't go wrong with Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"OMG, best tacos in all of Vegas. Hands down! Everything is cooked up on demand right in front of you. Perfect post drinking stop at 2am!"}
{"text":"I have to go here after the club every time I'm in town,m. I recommend buche, al pastor, Cabeza, lengua. Oh and get the pineapple with your al pastor"}
{"text":"HOLY FUDGE!

Best TACO EVER. I am a native Texan and I haven't ever had a taco as good as El Gordo. Honestly I wasn't even drunk when I ate here. I came here around the dinner hour and it was busy but not slammed. I ordered the adobada based on the Yelp recommendations. SO SO SO SO GOOD! The meat is roasted on a spit and carved off with a huge knife. It is served on two small corn tortillas, topped with onions, cilantro and an avocado cream sauce. I also ordered the asada which was good too, but not amazing like the pork. 

So yeah, I came here twice in one day. Both times got tacos and the 2nd time got tacos and  tostada. NOT EVEN SORRY. At $2 a pop El Gordo won't break the bank and will fill you up and leave you wanting more. Just remember they are smallish so don't feel bad if you have 6. lol. 

Come here sober the 1st time and most definitely come back if you are drunk."}
{"text":"Amazing like always.  Not American tacos, REAL tacos!  Like everyone is mentioning, keep a close eye on which line you wait in.  Secondly, have patience while they prepare your food.  If you want something faster, go elsewhere.  One of the biggest things to note is you must ask for salsa while you order.  Otherwise there is no salsa bar.  So is it worth the trip to leave the strip to visit this place for food?  OF COURSE IT IS!!  Always remind yourself, there is both good and great food on and off the strip.  What is always for sure is that whatever you get on the strip will be more expensive.  Nevertheless, Tacos El Gordo keeps it real by giving you food without the Vegas hassle."}
{"text":"FOUND IT!!  Took me forever to find the name of this place.  Let me tell you, how often does one stumble upon something, while in one of the worst moods you can possibly imagine, only to have this hidden gem turn it around for you?  Doesn't happen too often.

BIGGEST TIP: Get there BEFORE the clubs close because you will be waiting in line FOREVER!!

Tacos may seem a little small but they are proportionate to the prices.  The flavors, you'll love them."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best late night places to go. Their food is authentic and delicious. They have different lines for different meats and everything is made to order so you know that your food is fresh. I got carne Asada fries (it comes in two different sizes: small $5 and $10 for large) carne Asada tacos, and lengua tacos. The tacos were topped with a generous amount of guacamole which is always a plus for me. 

After ordering and receiving your food you go to the cashier to pay. It does get very crowded however the wait is not too bad. The only con would be that it is located a little far down the strip, but the food is very well worth it."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! As close to authentic as I've had in a long time, an awesome awesome experience!! Nothing like a good sope and they really upped it by topping it with a crispy tortilla. Adobado/tacos al pastor as recommended were amazing as well. Tables were packed at 6pm on a Monday night so plan to get there early or carry out somewhere else."}
{"text":"There are no words. Just simple amazingness. I love everything I've tried. Ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"sadly, the Tacos El Gordo near the strip has closed down so we have to go here for the heavenly tacos. I rated it down one because we waited an hour and a half for our tacos. It was hell while my legs and back were killing me but when I tasted it, all my regrets went away. The seatings are super limited and very cramp cause there is a line in each section. 

I also have found a new favorite: Vampiro. So good. I think I'll be getting that next time I go there. A crunchy outside, with awesome adobada meat, topped w/ other ingredients that just went so well together. Also they gave us grilled pineapple which was amazing when you eat it w/ the adobado tacos. 

Still love the place, just it's a lot more cramp and the wait is horrendous."}
{"text":"El Gordo is as good as they come. I wrote a review for the one in SD and this one is just as good as might even be better because of their excellent service. The service was super friendly and always had a smile on. I was really REALLY impressed with the way they treated us. 

I personally recommend Adobado because it is simply the best. Watching the guy knife off from the pork that is spinning and then grilling it on the grill until there is some crisp to it with their own made tortilla(which is awesome) and their home made guacomole sauce is simply AMAZING. I'm not even exaggerating how amazing it is but if you're not too into pork then....

I really love their Cabeza(which I tried to go to other places) and other places really suck and I thought it was disgusting. Simply they make the best cabeza which I never thought I would like, but it is just so good and drolling here. OF course, the other thing I absolutely love is Lengua. I don't think I had any lengua from other tacos joints to be this good. I just feel like you have the 3 choices which you simply can't forget to get and it's just so amazing.

I'm simply drooling from thinking about it right now but I'm just so far away. Oh El Gordo how i miss you so.

Perfect Drunk Food NOT TO MENTION :D"}
{"text":"Tacos adobada (pineapple sliced on top) are to die for. LOVE this hidden gem! 

ALso, Get a side of grilled green onions and green peppers for an excellent kick of flavor"}
{"text":"tacos el gordo aka the holy grail of tacos. I mean it does not get better than this. One day..I am going to get something here other than tacos. but everytime I come, the adobada with pineapple keeps calling my name.  It's just good I mean theres no other way to put it. I also like the cabeza and suadero. Every now and then I mix it up but I always get, atleast one of each;  adobada and buche. buche is well cooked, the taste is different from others I had, for some reason I like this much better than anyone else's. Even though I rave about the adobada, I have to say it's 2nd to another taco place in town...but..hey  they're open late, fairly priced, you cannot go wrong here. this is one of the places you must try before you die. no other way to put it."}
{"text":"I found this random place through Yelp while staying in Old town Vegas.   Their $10 fries are sooooo friggin good and it'll feed a whole gang...  I tried their pork taco (carved from a huge skewer), and their langua taco... If you're not afraid to eat a cow's tongue, try it!!! cus meat is too boring nowadays.. lol I like watching them make my tacos in front of me... 5 stars for taste, cleanliness, and all you can drink orange BANG!"}
{"text":"I tried this place on my Vegas trip because my party was hungry late at night. My first impression of this place is that it's really bright and the line is LONG. After getting the tacos, I concluded that this place is overhyped. The price is too much for how much it costs. The taco truck near where I live is so much cheaper ($1 per taco) and tastes so much better than this. But overall it is not too bad, I understand why the line was so long. I would not come back here though."}
{"text":"Love the concept this place has and the tacos are pretty darn good! Lengua is my favorite here.  You basically get in line and there is someone behind the counter with a different meat and you go down the line asking for which ever meat taco you want to try...delish! The carne asada fries looked good too...maybe next time they looked huge. Everyone is very nice and helpful as well and explain the procedure to you if you are new."}
{"text":"After a night out at XS or Surrender there is absolutely nothing better then Tacos El Gordo at 2:00 AM. 

While the lines may be long the food comes out fast and piping hot! The tortillas are made fresh, the meat is juicy and flavorful, the green sauce most have some kind of drug in it because it's seriously ADDICTING. Because the San Diego location is so far from me I make sure to make a pit stop here whenever I'm in vegas which is more often than I'd like to admit lol. If your're looking for something quick, fast, cheap, and delicious come to tacos el gordo for the best late night munchies!

My Favorites: Adobado Tacos and Adobado Fries :)"}
{"text":"They have the best tacos al pastor, and the people working there are really nice. Can't wait 2 go back 2 Vegas and visit them again"}
{"text":"Literally walked 3 miles each way for Tacos El Gordo. I've only been to the Chula Visa location & was SO stoked to find out that Tacos El Gordo is now in Vegas. If TEG were around during my Vegas heyday, I would have gone after EVERY XS/Encore night.

We ordered Adobada, lengua & carne asada tacos as well as a half order of campechana fries (topped with adobada, carne asada, guac and cheese). 

The adobada is the way to go here! It's like an al pastor spit where the cook freshly slices it when you order & the corn tortillas are toasted in the adobada fat. 

The carne asada and lengua are good but not as good as the adobada. 

For 8 tacos, a half order of fries (which is already a huge portion btw), and a fountain drink, it was ~$30. I feel like this is just a smidge pricier than the Chula Vista location, but still worth it! 

77/365"}
{"text":"I waited until my last day in Vegas to try this spot because I knew I would pig out. I was so excited to eat here. I was hoping it wouldn't be too long of a wait because I was starving! 

The place is right next to Encore. Towards the end of the strip. There is a red rent outside for outside seating. When you walk in there are several lines. There's a line for asada and adobada fries. A line for carne asada tacos and Mulitas and a line for adobada and al pastor Mulitas and tacos. Then a seperate line for anything with buche, suadero, and tripa, lengua. This was the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. I would rather just order my food and have them call out my number when it's ready. But in a way if works for Vegas craziness. 

The prices for the tacos are a bit higher than usual. Tacos are about $2. Mulitas $4, fries $10. 

I tried the adobada fries and these were delicious with a decent amount of meat topped with sour cream and guacamole and cheese.

2 al pastor tacos. Topped with onion, cilantro and guacamole. So delicious. Perfect size too. 

I also had a Mulita with tripas. So delicious. The Mulitas are small but since I had tacos tok I was satisfied. 

This is a place you need to come to while in Vegas. The food is great and it's also affordable compared to other places on the strip. The food is also very authentic. 

Besides the different lines just one other thing to complain about... The soda machine ran out of ice and it took a really long time to get ice."}
{"text":"I decided to go to this place because the reviews made it seem like I was really missing out on a great thing... To be honest, I thought it was very expensive in comparison to other mex \"fast food\" type places and I dont think I like the tostada presentation very much. The flavor and salsas were very good but again the presentation just made it messy and not very filling at all (eventhough i dont expect or eat a whole lot anyway, but it certainly didnt fill me up.) I am not used to this TJ food I guess... Id go elsewhere."}
{"text":"On the video I posted, I wrote:

\"If it ain't broke, why fix it.\" 

My motto when it comes to food, if you follow my reviews you'll know that when I find what what I like that's what we're eating every time. 

I'm sure everything is good here but the pastor tacos with extra green sauce and extra green salsa and lots of lime 







The horchata is horrible, but it comes from a soda machine so hello, has powder mix written all over it. Don't ruin your by eating that, just avoid it and his will be a 5 star experience. 

Can't wait for this place to open in Reno though!!!! When that day comes it's good bye Roberto's, hello tacos el Gordo!!!! 

Bahahahahah"}
{"text":"LOVED this place in SD. Pretty disappointed in this after a night of singing my heart out at the BSB concert though. Anyone from CA is automatically hypercritical of any Mexican food, and with the high percentage of visitors from CA, you'd think that I'd be a little more satisfied with my taco. 

Two stars, bc all the tacos my friends and I got were already premade and looked dry. If I was more determined, I would've requested a fresh taco, but I was hungry. My hunger was clearly not satisfied, and I ended up getting ice cream instead of taking my chances on another taco. To be clear, it's definitely not BAD, but I've experienced MUCH better, many times."}
{"text":"The main reason for only 3 stars is because of how small our there restaurants . There isn't many tables for the amount of people they get everyday . Honestly if you know your making good money with your tacos then don't be stingy invest in you  business . You have many people walking out because there's never any tables and the lines are way to long . Now let's talk about the tacos . Tacos are delicious! I can't say anything bad about them very good tacos !"}
{"text":"The menu is top notch, especially with the spicy pork. But because of the inefficient ordering and payment methods, you find yourself spending your entire lunch break just getting your food."}
{"text":"The tacos here are cheap but the lines are ungodly long. It took 20 minutes to finally place my order and you're only allowed to order certain things off of every window, so good luck if you're alone and want something that isn't being served at that window. The guy heard me wrong and gave me two Al Pastor's instead of 1 Al Pastor & 1 Adobada but whatever, no regrets since I love me a good Al Pastor. Their drink machine was also out of Horchata, so I was sad that I had a drink cup for no reason since I always carry water with me. The place is also very packed, so again, if alone, good luck finding a spot to sit. They do have outdoor seating but those are usually occupied as well. Had to eat outside by one of the trash cans since I couldn't get a seat. Hopefully, this place is at least better when it isn't a busy week like not during EDC week"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos. Open late. People I ate there with last night are still raving about how good their food was. Have a variety of different meat to choose from"}
{"text":"Tacos de adobada, my FAVORITE!!! Yumm! The sopes de adobada are too bomb!! You have to try them! I never mind waiting in line, the food is worth it! Always leave a good tip! :D"}
{"text":"Simple tacos! You know my favorite thing is the avocado man, you will always get plenty of avocado.

These guys are legends in Mexico they will soon be legends in Las Vegas, Kudos!"}
{"text":"After walking the strip for hours.. we were heading to Stratosphere!  We saw this place and read the reviews and gave it a whirl.  

This place was very, very good.  Luckily,  I read a lot of reviews as I had no clue what we were ordering.  We had quesadilla and 3 beef tacos.  Delicious for sure.

My only complaint is I wish I knew how to really order.  The menu is not in English..so we had to ask quite a few questions!

Very happy we stopped here."}
{"text":"Finally! This location took forever to built, but boy was it worth the wait. This location has more seating than the other locations. Different lines for different meats. The Al Pastor is Always the most popular meat. The tacos here are the closest to Mexico that I've ever had. Highly recommended. Although the tacos aren't expensive at $2 a pop, they do get pricey when ordering more due to its addictive nature. The Al pastor is by far the best! Don't forget to ask for pineapple, grilled onions and peppers. 

Also because this location is new - it's much cleaner than the other locations. Love that this is so close to my home!!!! Best location in town!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place one star is for their customer service.  And it doesn't go for everyone there either just one particular taquero that's goes by the nickname \"guero.\" The lines as you know are always super long well thia guy suppose girlfriend showed up with looks 20 people instead of waiting in line like everyone else she would just go up to the front of the line and order whatever she liked. She went up to order like 10 times and every time cut in front of anyone who was next.  When not only us but other people in line complaint to this guy by \"Guero\" he just ignore everyone and would stop serving the person he was serving to do her order her. Myself as a business owner finds that very unprofessional. And doubt if I would return to this exact location. I prefer take the drive to Chulavista where every customer is treated equally and faster service."}
{"text":"You'll get your tacos faster than you can say horchata and bursting with flavor. My favorite is the al pastor...anything...fries, tacos, etc. If it has the al pastor, I'm down. Their horchata is hit or miss. Sometimes it's too sweet"}
{"text":"Carne asada and quesadillas al pastor are the best, real guacamole and really good salsas, definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this place is my #1 favorite spot to get tacos. But tonight ago my bf and I encountered one of the rudest employees. The man taking our order, Javier, wouldn't even wait til we were done ordering. He yelled out our first order to the kitchen.. but we still had two more orders to place. He did it again and he seemed so surprised that we still had one last order, then he rolled his eyes and scoffed right at our face, basically saying \"are you kidding me?\" My boyfriend even apologized and he just yelled \"NEXT\", basically just pushing us away as if we were a burden to him. 

Normally, we would let something like this slide since I understand this place can get super busy and I assume stressful for the employees. He might've had a bad day or something, but the way he sneered at us was extremely rude and left us feeling kinda awkward.. like wtf? We were so confused. The experience we had today was just one of the worst ever I just had to write a review. (My very first review after having this account for a while) ((Thats how you know it was bad))

No offense Tacos el Gordo, I love you. But Javier, what's good?"}
{"text":"Al pastor is really good. I've had the tostada and I wasn't impressed. Carne Asada is very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Hm, not sure why this place got such high reviews...maybe because most people were tipsy when coming here?  Well, we came here sober cuz we wanted really good tacos and read all the rave reviews.  I told myself and my bf (who was the one who wanted to come here) that driving in Vegas traffic and waiting in this extremely long line better be worth it.  Well sorry my friends, it was sadly not!  It took us about a half hour in the line outside to get to the line inside, lol.  We ordered the spicy pork tacos and a quesadilla and both were just ok - I've had a lot better elsewhere.  Apparently the spicy pork tacos are supposed to be kickass here but for me, they were only meh.  Have you guys ever had really good tacos??!  My theory is that there's not many good taco places on the strip and that's why all the rave reviews?  Who knows, but I'm definitely not coming back here again..."}
{"text":"If a mixture of boiled meats in one pot is your thing, this is the place for you. I did not like the lack of options, would have liked some grilled meat options"}
{"text":"I live in Canada and unfortunately we don't have many places that serve authentic Mexican street style tacos. There are places that will say they're authentic but after trying the steak tacos from here.... seriously cant get more authentic than these tacos. So simple and so fresh. Corn tortillas made in front of you and that gauc! Worth the wait in the line up. Must try if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I believe this is a great place to eat at if one is hungry around Vegas and is feeling some Mexican food. This restaurant is also located in San Diego and they both deliver great cheap Mexican food.
Keep in mind when you order food, you first get the food up on the counter then take it to the back to process your payment. I feel like customers could just skip the payment lol, but I guess they believe the honor code here in Vegas.

Now the foood! I got the cabeza and al pastor taco which were both great and flavorful. The cabeza was awesome and just melted in your mouth. I also got the lengua fries, which was only tasty on the top. The reason is because there's no
Flavoring on the bottom. The sauce and meat only exist on the top of the fries. 

Overall, this place was solid but not the greatest.
But if I'm around I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Food was good not great. Very authentic. Two lines one for spicy pork the other for beef and innards yes correct. Local Hispanic population mainly so I know authentic. 
It's very chaotic and know what you want when you get to front of line!!!!! Server will not help you order so be prepared for that. 
Limited seating for size of crowd. I attempted to eat in outside seating and helper looked at me like 'don't you see there is no available seating?\"
This place is popular I believe because it's the ONLY place in town so they know if want this you don't have any other choice."}
{"text":"The tacos are good.. the vampiro is the best one but this place is a mad house! There are different lines for different meats and when its busy this place is smoked up, cramped, and hot. I don't think it's worth the insanity at all"}
{"text":"I visited this place near 2-3am on a Friday night and it was packed!!!! Cheap delicious food on the north side of the strip available to you at all hours! Yum!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. SOOOO good. There is nothing like an authentic mexican street taco to wrap up a long day/night in Vegas. 

I just wish that ordering was easier/made more sense. There are separate lines depending on what you want (Beef, Chicken, etc.), meaning you had to wait more than a few times to get all your food together.

Could do with an upgrade to how they take orders/serve food, but still 5 star taste."}
{"text":"The line was an hour long to get our tacos, probably because of EDC. The tacos were decent, but not great, and certainly not worth a 30 minute wait, let alone an hour! Each kind of taco has its own line, so if you want different meats and are by yourself, you're screwed, or even if you have 1 other person with you and want several different meats, you're still screwed.

Also, they put guacamole on the tacos, which drowns out the taste of the tacos. I've been to Mexico many times and they don't do that there. California also has a large Mexican population and they don't do that at most places. Some places put chunks of avocados, but not guacamole.

Maybe these are 4 or 5 star tacos for Nevada, but these are jus average for me. In the SF Bay area tacos are much better, as we are highly populated with Mexican immigrants who make good tacos."}
{"text":"Early in the morning or late at night - it's always a good time for Tacos El Gordo! I eat a lot of tacos, probably too many tacos, and this place is my gold standard for taco measuring. Great authentic tacos, plus they have free guac (take note, Chipotle) and delicious quesadillas. People literally sit outside of this place waiting for it to open in the morning - it's that good. But don't be fooled, they may open the door but you still have to wait another 40 min or so to get that taco goodness in you because they still have to finish cooking it all so all you can really get when they first open the doors is a drink. It's a tease. Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Customer service is TRASH.. who the hell makes you wait  in three different lines to get different tacos? Then get in line to pay?  By the time I found a seat and bit into the spicy salt less taco it was cold and I was pissed off.. this place is overrated, people that claim these tacos are bomb obviously haven't had good food.. another thing is you always have a long  line why not hire more people, the three cooks  looked like they were about to pass out from working so hard.. hire a new cashier both those girls up there were rude af!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican food places in town..it is clean, the service is great. I would highly recommend tacos el gordo..i have rated at 3 different places and have not been disappointed yet...my husband loves their asada tacos and I love the asada fries. Go check it out the food is awesome"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place! Love their carne asada fries although their prices went up which sucks"}
{"text":"The absolute best tacos in Las Vegas! Get the pork with some pineapple. Mulas are my favorite. It's an open faced quesadilla piles high with meat and salsa. Go ahead and throw some money in the tip jar and enjoy the VIP treatment. This place does it right on every level!"}
{"text":"WHAT WAS ORDERED: 2 tacos tripa, 1 carne asada mula 1 al pastor mula and carne asada fries

SERVICE: I speak spanish so service was good but I can see it might be an issue to none spanish speakers

CLEANLINESS: I truly think due to it being so busy they don't have the chance to clean as fast as they would like. Our table was dirty but we were waiting for someone to leave, someone came in to clean the table shortly after.

TASTE: BOMB!! tacos are my weakness and this place didn't disappoint.

WORTH THE PRICE?: yes! keep in mind, you are on the strip and considering how much food is in Vegas this is a great price.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Mulas all the way, it has cheese, guacamole, salsa with your meat of choice. everything you need in one bite. Out of all the meats my favorite was al pastor.

WILL I COME BACK?: Heck yes! this place is amazing!

TIPS AND NOTES: Be ready to wait, long lines! it is worth the wait but you might have to eat outside. There are no tables outside and the dining area inside is very small, so eating standing up is definitely going to happen."}
{"text":"I really love this place, it's clean, the staff are friendly, the tacos are hands down the tastiest. The al pastor is to die for, the asada is tender and flame broiled. The Lengue is made to perfection tender and falls apart with no indication that it was once a beef tongue. Order anything here you won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Best Tacos Ever!!!! It never fails for us to stop and eat here whenever were in Vegas. I LOVE LOVE THE ADOBADA FRIES & AL PASTOR TACOS. Best customer service the staff are always friendly with everyone keep up the good work Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever had were in Mexico- Playa del Carmen. Since then I thought nothing could compare to the real deal.

I was so wrong.
Some friends took me here, and I was so surprised by the flavor and tenderness of the tacos al pastor. I've heard the tongue tacos are good, but I'm not gutsy enough to try it. 

Just stop by and grab a couple- they're my favorite tacos in Vegas."}
{"text":"If hype were a flavor they'd be delicious! They are just okay tacos but nothing to write home about. I grew up in SD near TJ and spent lots of time over the boarder eating the real deal, and let me tell you kid this isn't it! Is it worth the wait? No! Is the food good? Yes but not the best in LV, that's for sure! Unseasoned, unmemorable and bland is the best description that I can come up with."}
{"text":"I live in  l.a where we have tacos every where but this place  out beats all l.a ...great tacos of adobado you don't need to spend alot to eat really good food .. there's oways big lines but worth the wait if i lived in las vegas i would definitely be a regular"}
{"text":"OMG!!! the best place ever! cheap eats and bomb a** food. especially late night."}
{"text":"I just got back from walking on the strip and all i can say is WOW not because it was amazing but because i didn't get to try the tacos or anything! The lines were so LONG and the restaurant was so crowded. There was no moving space! I don't know if the tacos were good but the wait sure wasn't pleasant we left after waiting almost an hour."}
{"text":"Oh Tacos El Gordo. Really sucks that you're located on Las Vegas Blvd where every tourist and their mom wants to try your delicious tacos. And it also sucks that you have bad air circulation, barely any AC, and barely any place to park. However, your tacos are the boooommbbb diggity and this is why you deserve all the stars. Nothing about the food needs to be changed... the adobada, lengua, and tripa tacos are all seasoned perfectly and melt-in-you-mouth and I would recommend them to anyone. What you do need to change is the ordering process. Long lines with bad air circulation and sweaty people do not make for happy customers such as myself. Thus, because of this I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"5 stars nuff said! 4 de buche por favor. If your in town make the drive it's worth your while... Big plus they're open late for those late night munchies!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that people haven't already said?! As you can see by my frequent visits, I'm hooked on their tacos! I have tried their carne asada tacos and carne asada fries but nothing comes close to the tacos de adobada (spicy pork tacos). My bf says they taste just like the ones from TJ!
The staff here is really friendly, they even have my order memorized (7 spicy pork tacos) and no they're not all for me! hehe
Make sure you get a side of green onions and chilies and sprinkle them with salt....
Think I might go there now! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place. I expected much more. The place was crowded and not organized. The food quality was not great and the line was too long. The tacos were filled with raw onions, made my breathe stinky all day! No one in our group was amazed by any of our orders. Not worth the wait. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"10/22/16: Visiting from Hawaii and my friend suggested this place to grab tacos I told her sure why not I heard tacos on the Mainland are better than Hawaii lol! Anyways we get there like around 1 am and the place is packed! I was kind of confused on how to order because there were signs in Spanish. But the signs are pretty much telling you where to stand if you want a certain type of tacos/quesadilla etc. So my friend, my boyfriend, and I stood in 3 different lines because we wanted Tacos de Carne Asada, Tacos de Lenguas, and Quesadilla Adobada. The wait time was like about maybe 20 min? But it was worth it!!! When I saw how small the tacos I thought I would still be hungry, but no we I ended up being stuffed!!! This were the BEST TACOS I ever had in my life and I wish Hawaii had this! Oh I forgot to mention my Horchata drink. That was really delicious too!!!"}
{"text":"4:00 am tacos? check

Tacos el Gordo definitely has the right idea about tacos. Unfortunately, having had some great tacos in LA and south of the border, I can say they aren't quite top tier. That being said, they are one of the best taquerias in Las Vegas. I would come back, but if a King Taco ever opens in the city, there would be no contest. 

Pros:
-Good price, open late
-Lengua and cabeza held their own; both were cooked well, moist, and flavorful, if a bit under-spiced
-Their red sauce/salsa was great
-\"insert meat choice\" fries

Cons
-The adobada, which they are apparently known for, was chewy, dry, and pretty lacking in any flavor whatsoever (resembling styrofoam perhaps)
-The ordering situation is, well, a situation. Be prepared to wait three times as long if you happen to want meets from three different stations."}
{"text":"The food is the BEST. Tried every type of meat they had & all of them were above what i expected. The meat it chopped in front of you, hand made tortillas, price is cheap!

The lines suck but they go by rather fast. 

I'd recommend 10/10

{"text":"BEST TACOS ON THE TRIP SO FAR!
We're on our Only Hell Yes two month trip and have had tacos a few times. We love tacos...
This place came up on a Yelp search as super yummy and inexpensive food. And for sure it's both. 
We had the adobada (pork) and the asada (steak). 
They're street taco size and full of flavor. 
The tortillas are excellent. 
And it's a very clean environment. 
For sure will come back!"}
{"text":"This place has decent Mexican food but it's not always worth the wait. They get crazy busy and packed that I've walked in and right out. But a big plus about them is the tortillas!"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best tacos in town! I like the carne asada tacos and mulas. You get in the line for what meat you want and drool while waiting for your turn. The lines can be long since everyone else wants some of this goodness too. Seating inside right now is limited but it looks like they are making more room for seating so that's good. What I'm hoping is that they get more stations going to help with the lines. Tacos are $2 and come with onions, cilantro, and sauce unless you specify otherwise. I ask that mine be made on flour tortillas and they do it and don't even charge extra. You can get a side of free grilled veggies upon asking too. Really good food at good prices."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos I've eaten, aside from the other Tacos El Gordo in San Diego.  I was so happy to discover that this place was walking distance from where I was staying.  There was a long line, but we knew it was going to be so. worth. it. 

Upon reaching the entrance, you'll find that there are three lines inside for different tacos.  
     1. Carne Asada and Chorizo 
     2. Adobada
     3. All the other stuff
This can get kind of problematic if you want a few tacos from each of the lines, but I'm guessing that this was the most efficient way to move things along.  Try to get your friends in the other lines to order the tacos for you!

I tried the Lengua ($2.25), Tripa ($2.00), and Adobada ($2.00) tacos.  The lengua taco (aka tongue for you gringos) was SO tender and juicy.  Tripa (tripe) was kind of a  weird texture for me.  I don't think that crunchy goes well in tacos, but some might say otherwise! Adobada was my personal favorite.  That green sauce they put on it is delicious.  

If you want the best cheap eats on the strip, I don't think you have to look much further than Tacos El Gordo.  

Food: 5, Service: 4, Ambiance: 3, Price: 5"}
{"text":"They have limited options on meat but I guess that's the kind of place it's supposed to be. I had steak fries, which used to be covered in cheese and decently portioned steak. I got a charcoaled up thin steak sliced up topping my undercheesed fries. Overall, it served its purpose at 2:30AM. Would only go back at that time."}
{"text":"Too much hype for badly prepped Mexican food. We ordered 6 tacos with ask toppings and 4 of them were missing tomatoes and guacomole. We ordered the $13 carne asada fries and got a glib of guac that was obviously not made in-house.

Paid at the register, and the busty fat lady who rang us up gave us only 3 salsas for 6 tacos and a large carne asada fries. When I asked for more, she gave me 1. When I asked for 4 more, she gave me 3. When I asked for 1 more, she turned to her coworker, complained about me thinking I couldn't understand and started giving me attitude.

There are better Mexican food available in LV (such as the food truck right off the Strip) with better customer service. This place is not worth going back to."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best mexican food I have had in a long time, for extremely low prices and open all night!"}
{"text":"Good Tacos, but get ready to wait in all three lines if you want different meats. Thumbs Down!!!!!! Thumbs down to the order set up. By the time you want to enjoy all your tacos they will be all cold. Also, the lines are long and slow."}
{"text":"Finally!!! I made it!!! I went in with Spicy Pastor Tacos on my mind. But when I saw an order of Carne Asada Fries pass by me, I changed course. I got the small order and glad I did because the large would have been way too much.

Let me tell you, TEG is some straight up Mexican food goodness! I love this place. The lines were crazy, it was hot in there, families squished in together at the small tables, people hollering across each other - I loved it! And I will be back now that I know where it is. For the past three trips to Vegas, I would make the effort to get to TEG, but could never \"see\" it.  It is in a sort of strip mall with a small parking lot.  This time, I rode around twice before I spotted it.  And I was rewarded with some really good eats.  (This review was from my July 2013 trip)"}
{"text":"Omgoodness best tacos to get, when it comes to adobado meat. It's street taco size with greasy goodness  The service is prompt, the boys back there get you out of there quickly, so make sure you just lay it on them when it's your turn. They have grilled yellow peppers and green onions to accompany your tacos with, so good! Sauces are not overly spicy  , the green ones are"}
{"text":"Best tacos on the Las Vegas Strip. Tacos El Gordo is like a pyramid scheme. My friend took me here once, I got addicted to it then I started to bring my friends. After my friends tried it, they bring their own friends to try it. The foods are good and they open late. If you have a mid-night hunger, picks Tacos El Gordo over Taco Bell!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Long lines! They are worth the wait! I had chicken tacos and carne asada fries and Wow I loved them.  I don't so much like the wait but if you are looking for great Mexican food, a must try."}
{"text":"I have a home in Kingman AZ, and I used to go to tacos el gordo often when in the area. As of today I am boycotting this place. After being called a taco bowl by the DNC I will never spend my hard earned money in a place that has allowed the DNC to use Hispanics."}
{"text":"5 spicy pork adobada tacos to start! At $2.25 each you can't beat that price for the explosion of taste at just one bite of this pork-filled yummy goodness on your tongue! Great for after party, late night, club food! The sauce is all the wonder; spicy, creamy, and tastey! 

Who needs to go south of the border when it can come to VEGAS! Even better, there are two locations of your choosing! I have visited both and can firmly account for both! Same fine taste, same bountiful servings, and same great experience! 

Take everything adobada style, it is their trademark and you just can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos at a great price. The tacos are so fresh, one of my favorites is the lengua because it is so tender and juicy. The only downside is it gets so packed it is hard to get a seat at times."}
{"text":"When we first walked in, it was a little chaotic.  We didn't know what was going on....but, the staff is extremely friendly & helpful.  Basically, there are 3 lines: 1 for carne asada, one for adobada (spicy pork, but it wasn't spicy at all) and another line for the other meats (tongue & I forgot what else).  No chicken!

YOU ORDER FIRST & THEN PAY.

The carne asada line was the longest (out the door practically), so we went for the adobada line.  I was able to order my tongue (lengua) tacos here too and 1/2 order of campechana fries (half carne asada & half adobada).  The adobada meat was the best--not spicy at all.  Sometimes this meat, also known as \"al pastor\" is spicy or flavorless.  The fries were really good, but we got full from the tacos---reheated this the next day & it was still good (just took off the guacamole & sour cream before taking it w/me).

It was a little over $20 for 6 tacos, 1/2 order of fries/ & a drink.  My husbad said that I know how to pick the best places to eat!!!  This place gives King Taco a run for their money.  I love the green salsa from King Taco & give the salsa 5 stars, but the meat from El Gordo has more flavor & the portions are larger.  Lots of Mexican people eating here, so you know it's good when a food place is packed with it's own people. The customer serivce here is superb---really friendly & helpful. Lots of locals eating here....

*Will probably visit this place every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Come early or be prepared to wait in line. A little unorganized and parking is crazy in the mini mall lot but overall this place is recommended when you're in Las Vegas and are craving authentic tacos."}
{"text":"Crowded, loud, pricey, but absolutely authentic. I've been to their other locations and have always been satisfied. Their adobada tacos are the best around."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand what all the hype is about... the mulitas (quesadillas on corn tortillas) are pretty good. But other than that, they're just small greasy tacos. The wait is too long, the ordering system is weird (one line for asada, one line for adobada) Not worth the hassle... I'll stick to Roberto's. Say all you want, but they make a nice simple taco. No gimmick required."}
{"text":"This place has some really delicious tacos/quesadillas/meats. It's really simple to order - but unorganized. They're very simple to get and the asada is delicious- get it on anything you order! Limited seating but, hey, it just shows how tasty everything is."}
{"text":"A little hard to get in out...northbound from Cheyenne on Losee only.  Very chaotic ordering system. The spicy pork street tacos were very good albeit pricey ($2.49 ea.)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! You know it's legit when it's packed all hours of the day and they are making the tortillas from scratch. Had the asada tacos which were really good. Love that they have guacamole included for no additional charge. But what really sold me was the asada fries. Such a good flavor with all the toppings. My new favorite Mexican place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Must stop here everytime in Vegas. Made Dad is from TJ and this place Took him back with their authentic style and taste. They take care of the customers. Best time to come is after the lunch rush...about 2pm. Any other time expect a long line but truly worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Their tacos are small, but tasty. I fell in love with the adobada (spicy pork) tacos! Don't forget to add radish and lime, it's perfect when you're a bit peckish."}
{"text":"Slightly above average taco.  Not worth going out of your way for, but it will do if you're nearby.   Al Pastor was pretty average."}
{"text":"I have dreams about these tacos. Like I'm already salivating just thinking of what to write in this review. 

While all their meat options are delicious, the al pastor is to die for. I ate here two days in a row when I was in vegas, once for dinner and then a day later after leaving Surrender nightclub (walking distance, and open late)! 

The ordering system is kind of confusing at first since each line is for different meat options, but its easy after your first time. Just split up with your group of friends and have everyone order from a different line for the group. 

This is my new must-go restaurant whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"It has become a weekly routine to come down to Tacos El Gordo for dessert on the weekend. Yepperz you heard that right.... dessert. I like the Asada tacos and they are $2 each. I don't like any of that guacamole sauce they put on it. They have signs to let you know what each line is for so make sure and pay attention because these lines can be mad crazy. If you like grilled peppers and veggies then ask for a plate of them free of charge. You can also ask them to put foil on your plate if you want it to go or you can sit at tables they have set up under a tent style area outside. If you like good ass tacos them come here."}
{"text":"I have a rule when I go to a different city; find a new place to eat that I can't find back home. A couple of years ago I stumbled upon Tacos El Gordo one drunken night, the lines were confusing so I ended up getting tacos de adobada. That day I tasted heaven. Since that night I have been to Tacos El Gordo every time I've been in Vegas and also the location in San Diego. My girlfriend and I were in Vegas this past weekend and we just had to have these tacos, twice. While my reviews are strictly for the tacos de adobada, which are more addictive than crack, my girlfriend seems to like the asada tacos as well. Why won't they come to LA already"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONED. I ordered the asada and chorizo tacos and spent the whole night vomiting everything I ate. No I was not even drunk. AVOID THE HYPE."}
{"text":"Staying in Las Vegas for the week, and had a hankering for some authentic tacos. I jumped on Yelp, and found the location right off the strip. Unfortunately, after a little bit of running around, it was discovered that the place had just closed down. Much to my surprise, this location is not too far from the strip. 

The food was pretty dang good, the tortillas homemade, the green salsa had a perfect amount of kick. If you are looking for an authentic Mexican tacos, comparable to something from East LA, this is your place."}
{"text":"The BEST Tacos in the country! Try ANYTHING on the menu and your expectations will be exceeded! Try to go during the week and during the evening to beat the long line. Everyone craves this place so trust me if you go during vampire hours you're in for a long line, but the lines move pretty quick."}
{"text":"I wish those Al Pastor tacos came in a bucket like KFC Style. And even then I'd still be double fisting buckets."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos at all. Line up was not that bad when I went but worth the wait. Too bad you have to line up to different station for different taco. Still some of the best food I had in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food. Love the guacamole. 

However... 
The seating here SUCKS hairy monkey balls. 
There is no where to sit and I went during slow hours. I can't imagine how shitty it must be during peak hours. The worse thing is, there are drunk bros taking over seats with piles of trash on their table and they won't move. 

They need rows of just elevated tables. So you can just hang out and eat. That's it. No sitting around and taking space. Get in, eat, get out. More room and less clutter. The very few tables there sucked too. Everything is too tight and people fight over the chairs."}
{"text":"Good tacos, but they're on the pricey side as far as taco prices go. The ordering system can be a little confusing if you've never been here before but watch everyone in front of you and you'll get the swing of it in no time. I really like to watch the guys that chop the meat and make the tacos do their thing, they know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"$2 meaty-tacos?! What's not to like? They have a bunch of different types of meat, I just stuck to the carne asada and spicy pork tacos. The carne asada was just ok but the spicy pork tacos were amazing. Make sure you get a slice of pineapple on top! The only weird thing about this place is that they didn't serve chicken."}
{"text":"Crazy how they won't give you carne asada fry's plate with out the fry's. I had talk to the manager and said to her I would pay extra so they won't give me fry's. She then said to me no because i can use that meat to make tacos and give them to my family which was very retarded when it was just me and my friend."}
{"text":"Taco meat is juicy and the al pastor flavor makes me want more! The horchata is my favorite of all time!
We always make a stop here when we visit Vegas and the one in TJ as well. It is usually crowded so be prepared but the wait isnt that long."}
{"text":"This is the real deal taco, no tex mex, not Americanized, it is seriously Mexican tacos. Don't come here expecting Taco Bell..please don't..those tacos are nasty, but Tacos El Gordo gives real tacos. How do I know this? I frequent Tijuana Mexico and I've eaten at their location in Tijuana near the border and they taste EXACTLY the same at this location as they do in Tijuana!! They only have locations in San Diego, Las Vegas, and Tijuana. There are others that try to take the name but it isn't the same. 

You start by standing in line for the meat you want. Different lines serve different meat so it's best to come with a few people so each of you can stand in a different line and order each other's food. Then you take your tacos to the cashier where you order your drink and pay. 

This place has always been crowded each time I've been here. Even with short lines, I had a hard time finding seating. Be in your competitive mode when hunting down seats or take it to go. 

I love their horchata and get that each time I come. It's nothing fancy but it isn't the standard one either. It's just good, cinnamon-y, and just a little thicker than water. It has a nice consistently that is perfectly sweet. 

Soooo...the al pastor meat...mmmmmm...ok, I'm back from day dreaming about it. It is my ultimate favorite. I just love the light sweetness of it. There are two usual al Pastor flavors that alive tastes from top tacos spots and this one is the sweeter flavor and my fav by far. The meat is a beautiful bright red from the seasoning and juicy. I love the crusty burnt pieces that adds a crunch because it was cooked on the turny thing (lol, I don't know what it's called, I'll google it after this review). 

The steak tacos are really good but I've had better in Tijuana Mexico. Maybe because I like for my meat to have flavor and this carne asada taste like straight up meat. It's good quality and not fatty (I don't like when I bit into more fat than meat). 

This is a must when you visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh my. I just love tacos, especially when they're made right. This place makes them right. My favorites would be the adobada and asada, squirt some lemon on them and it's just too good. It's no wonder they're so busy, they're a poorly-kept local's secret! Oh my gosh these tacos are good."}
{"text":"It's a little piece of Cali-Mex in Vegas! We accidentally came to this location (and not the strip) because that's what our Google Maps told us. But I'm actually really glad we did come to this off-strip location, because the one on the strip is super duper busy and hectic. At this location, about 12 girls were able to ponder over the menu and take our time. We ordered a variety of tacos and fries. I've definitely been missing my Cali-Mex tacos, and I was able to get my cravings fulfilled here."}
{"text":"The best tacos this side of the border, maybe the world. The first time I tried these legendary culinary delights was in Chula, Vista, CA and I was hooked! After longing for another mouth watering bite, I was ecstatic to find this Mecca in Vegas!

They use fresh meat, which is actually grilled the way it should be-over charcoal, and the salsas are tasty.

You can't go wrong with the carne asada tacos. I highly suggest the tacos al pastor and a mula with carne asada."}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to try these tacos at the South Las Vegas location..I love the handmade tortillas..we ordered the carne asada..n the al pastor...I hv to say I liked the al pastor better..I'm not crazy about their salsas..or the different lines to get the tacos u want to try...if u are by yourself n want to try the different tacos then u hv to go to different lines to get them..then when u get your food, there is another line for the cashier which could get hectic also..hence, by the time we were able to sit and eat our food, the carne asada was already cooled off n so was the al pastor..which made them mediocre to me..sitting is also limited here..suggestion would be to tell them it's to go so that they wrap it in foil so your food will be hot when you finally get a seat...all in all I'm glad we experienced it..not sure if we'll go back..I've had better but still glad to be able to try it.."}
{"text":"Great street tacos and loaded fries.  Crazy busy, and that's because it's sooo good.  I went with the classic steak tacos, but they have crazy tacos like beef guts, tongue, brains, etc.
Line was out the door and around the building."}
{"text":"Because this is where you go after you go clubbing in Las Vegas. It's confusing that there are several lines, but just pick one, order, get your food and pay for it at the cashier."}
{"text":"Need to hire systems engineer as your ordering system is inefficient and causes unnecessary delays."}
{"text":"If you want a life changing experience, the tacos from Tacos El Gordo will do that for you. Sinking your teeth in one of their succulent, flavorful, tacos will blow your mind. 

Tacos El Gordo is straight up authentic Mexican food at its finest. When it wasn't very dangerous to venture to Tijuana, MX, I would easily drive 10 minutes south and go to Tacos El Gordo to get my taco fix (also because it was cheaper than getting it 10 minutes north from where I lived in SD, in Chula Vista, CA :P).  As a SOUTH San Diego, CA native, and having experienced the many taco shops that saturate the SD area I've had to settle for OK Mexican tacos in Las Vegas, NV or even avoid considering tacos as an eating out option. I guarantee Tacos El Gordo is THE best tacos you'll find in town because it's seriously the best in SD and I find it an awesome relief that they brought the best to Las Vegas.  

Since I'm a carne asada fan, I've only had their carne asada tacos and tostadas. The flavor and spice of their carne asada is so delicious and they grill it to perfection! The employees here are just pros at grilling and flavoring the meats to perfection. My fiance is all about the pork adobada! He scafs down his order in a ridiculous amount of time; he'll finish 4 of those tacos faster than I can finish two.

Pros: the hours of operation--it's better than in San Diego! :P and it's authenticity is further accentuated because it is situated in a similar, run down area to that in South San Diego. Unlike other places where they tend to put less meat and more of the other items, Tacos El Gordo loads it up with lots of meat and a great balance of the toppings (onions/cillantro/guac etc.). Lastly, their red and green salsas are the s**t!!!! (tasty with the right amount of spice!)

Cons: far from where I live in Las Vegas and the prices are a little bit expensive than in San Diego but comparable to other taco/mexican food places in Las Vegas and they don't offer seafood options for those who crave shrimp or fish tacos as an alternative to the land animals.

Hope you anticipate spending most of your money toward this awesome goodness and turning into a TJ taco fiend. :)"}
{"text":"Overrated......ive had better tacos from my own litchen. Total waste of cab fare and calories . skip this place."}
{"text":"I hear about Tacos El Gordo quite often. I decided to give it a shot while in Vegas. I went to the one outside of the strip in hopes that there wouldn't be much of a line...boy was I wrong...

Food: 
Love the homemade tortilla and all but the tacos were not all that special. I've had way better in LA. 

Service: 
Long long long lines....You have to line up to get inside to line up again to order your food....THEN you LINE UP AGAIN to pay! W...T....F....whoever thought of this set up is an idiot. 

Environment: 
The place was so crowded and the lines pretty much crowded the entire interior. Had to sit outside in the cold windy Vegas weather. Parking is plentiful. 

Price: 
Ehh...pricey for tacos. 

Food: 3
Service: 1
Environment: 2
Price: 2"}
{"text":"What can I say that 1000 other people haven't said?!

They are really good, simple tacos.  Small corn tortillas, meat, onions, green sauce, creamy sauce, cilantro....  Did I mention really good?

Ok, the lines.......
If you go at peak time (pretty much any time they are open) you will see a huge line.  Facing the restaurant, the left side is pork, the middle is beef, the right side is fries with meat and other \"not taco\" stuff.  The register is in the middle of the chaos and you get your drinks there.

Good luck.

Bottom line - its worth the wait every once in a while to eat here.  Time to break out the granola bar you keep stashed in your glove box for food emergencies and get in line.  at least you won't get hangry waiting for almost 30-40 minutes to order your tacos.

You need to replace that granola bar every month or so anyway to keep it from getting stale."}
{"text":"Yes! See Kevin's review!
Best tacos in the universe.
Crowded like all get out even at 10pm!
Make friends in line-- you'll be standing there awhile.
And go for some of the meats like tongue or tripe or head cheese that you wouldn't normally eat-- they are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Interesting twist on the taco here...  Kinda like a Mexican Gyro where they slice off meat from a rotating spit.  

Flavor wise it was just ok.  It seems pretty popular though so I'm probably in the minority here but it just missed the mark.  

The best thing for me was the Orange Bang they had at the soda dispensers.  Haven't seen that in since Pioneer Chicken was around.  

Give The Gordo a shot though and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Can't believe they opened one of these in Vegas!  Now I love Vegas even more!  The original one is in tijuana, then opened some in the Chula Vista area of San Diegio, and now Vegas.  Bar none, the best pastor meat you will ever taste, not to mention the avocado cream sauce they put on top.  And their asada tacos get a fresh guacamole on top.  The best!  $2/taco but well worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite tacos here .. especially de pastor tacos and the fries love the food here . Only reason why  I give it 4 stars because it's always so packed but it's a good sign .. always stop here when I come to vegas wish they open one in California"}
{"text":"Had this place on my first day in Vegas for lunch. It was pretty good, I like the fact that the tortillas are homemade and that they don't have beans because I'm not a big fan of beans. 

I thought the carne Asada was alright. I think the best meat I tried was the pastor. The mulas are good and very different because it's like two tacos on too of one another but it was good. 

I wish there salsa was a littler better but it was a good place for Mexican food in Vegas that's different from everything else you can get. The price is also good."}
{"text":"The long wait is over! 
Visitng to LV and trying their Tacos is a must! We planned ahead of time timeto taste their Tacos here. Because the last time we saw there was a long line outside. (Maybe their tacos are so good?) Yeah! We're right! All their tacos are juicy, fresh, tender, flavorful and affordable! You must try my favorite as of now, the Taco Cabeza (beef head) and Taco Tripa (intestine). They are both Muy Esquisito! BTW, I really loved their Adobada Fries so huge (we ordered small), unique taste especially the cheese on top, it is a bomb! You better not forget to taste their food when you visit LV. A must try!"}
{"text":"OMG the best tacos ever.  I'm just waiting for them to open up a location in Norcal.  They will bankrupt Super Taqueria if they opened up shop in Norcal.   The first time I ate here was when I was visiting San Diego and then we accidentally came across this location in Vegas during a limo ride.  Sometimes this place gets really crowded, but its totally worth the wait b/c the tacos are soooo good.  Every time I'm in Vegas or San Diego I make sure to include Tacos El Gordo in my itinerary.   There's just no other place like it.  BTW don't expect 5 star service here.  Its elbow to elbow at times to get to the front of the taco line.  Don't be afraid to call out the fat Mexican dude who's trying to cut in front of you!  If you don't say something and let him get in front of you.....you will regret it because he will be the the one that orders like 30 tacos and holds up the line."}
{"text":"This place is great!!

Best tacos in Vegas!!

If you are ever in Vegas you have to come check it out!!!

Real Mexican Tacos"}
{"text":"Authentic and super tasty street tacos. The line is a little daunting but the staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. Our group tried quesadillas, 3 types of tacos, and Mulas and everything was delicious.


The place was super clean. The lines looked long but moved super fast. Great place to grab a quick bite heading to or from the strip."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go eat. I love the tacos!!"}
{"text":"These tacos are off the hook.  Especially when u see a lady making hand made tortillas.  Everybody is friendly. A lot of different types of meat.  My favorite Al pastor (pork) lengua (beef tongue)."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I don't get what the hype is all about.  I was very excited to try this place out because my sister said the one in San Diego was really good, they are open late, and I assumed service would be fast.  1 out of those 3 things wasnt true.. that the food was really good!  Service is fast.  You pick a line, order what you want, and you are quickly given what you ordered. You step out of line and head to the cashier to pay cash.  They have a tortilla lady making tortillas on the spot.  The meat in our $2 tacos was such a disappointment!  It was so bland. The best part about the tacos was the tortilla, the onions, cilantro and salsa.  The pork belly was chewy and I was hoping it would be a little crispier/fried but it obviously was not.  We also had the Adobada Fries ($10) which could have used more meat; the meat was lost amongst the fries and condiments they later onto the fries.  I don't have the desire to come here again and will now drive by it without giving it a second thought."}
{"text":"Waited about 20 minutes before I was able to order my tacos. Got up to the front of the line and told the guy what I wanted. These guys are hustlers for real. They seem to enjoy doing what they do. Singing laughing cooking, etc. It was great seeing that. I was still buzzin from the night before so i couldnt wait to stuff my face with these tacos. Made right in front of you exactly how you want them. 

www.bomb.com!!!!!! Oh my lordy lordy lordy!!! Semi Greasy tortillas, lots of meat, the salsa is delicious. I ordered 5 tacos and in 5 seconds they where gone!!! Just great tacos over all. 

I just wanna use explamation points in this review because it makes me want to go back and eat more !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

woooooohhooo!!! Tacos el Godrizzy is for shiizzy."}
{"text":"Delicious!  They have separate lines for the type of tacos you want.  We are fans of the offal so standing in the line for tripas, brains, stomach, tongue etc. will be the shortest line anyway!  LOL.  Delicious!  Fresh tortilla, grilled scallions and jalepeno.  yummy"}
{"text":"Disappointed with this place I was in Vegas and heard about Tacos El Gordo . When we pulled in this location was jammed packed .Once you walk in your directed to form a line to order your tacos . They have separate lines for different kind of meats then once you order your tacos you have to get into another line to pay . Finally 25 min later I got to sit to eat my tacos and oh boy I was disappointed with the taste absolutely no flavor from the meat to the salsa .It taste like water and the guacamole not sure what it was but it sure wasn't that . The only good thing was the tortilla are hand made ."}
{"text":"Great tacos been coming here for years 
Long lines but its worth it their pretty fast to"}
{"text":"If you want authentic, delicious Mexican food then you should check this place out!!! The carne asada is amaaaaazing!!! The food is all homemade and tastes so yummy!! The cheese quesadillas are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"The best tacos in Las Vegas hands down.

There was two of us, we ordered 3 asada and spicy pork taco. It was so good, we ordered 3 more each again right away. When I was ordering the second round, I realized the corn tortilla was fresh made right there. That's why the taco was so good.

Anybody appreciates authentic Mexican food, you have to go there and give it a try.

I gave 4 stars for the high price and not so good service(bad attitudes). The taco is quite small for $2 each, I had to eat 7 to get full."}
{"text":"Intoxication may alter reviews but I think if I was sober I'd enjoy this even more.

My dumbass took a 50 dollar cab ride (to and from) this location. I think the other location closed earlier than this one. 

The Al Pastor tacos with their green sauce is all you need to get! I default to always getting Carne Asada tacos everywhere I go but the Al Pastor tacos definitely blew my mind... lol."}
{"text":"Find the line that has ADOBADO in it. Order like 20. Ask for extra avocado sauce on the side. Then cry because life is great with these tacos. God bless these tacos. Can I get a hell yeah amen hahaha 

Literally the best al pastor tacos I've had!"}
{"text":"What more can you say about a late night taco shop located on the Las Vegas strip that has over 500 yelp reviews?

Well, let's start with: This place rocks. 

Let's get into it. You need some greasy food after an epic night, and sometimes Tacos are the cure-all. Do not miss the opportunity to eat here. It's located on the northern end of the strip just passed Encore & Wynn. 

There is usually a line, but it moves quick. 

You have plenty of meat options for your tacos (hey now). I prefer the more adventerous stuff like lengua, cabeza & tripa. Totally worth it because everything is seasoned to perfection and greasy enough to be amazing.

If you are on vacation and have no regard for your arteries (aka if you are like me), then try the carne asada fries. It's massive and something that can easily be shared amongst 3-4 people. Or just split it with someone if you are both cool with a challenge.

Read some of the other reviews now. Then grab some tacos. 

This spot is bomb!"}
{"text":"Muy rico el lugar. Comimos tacos de carne asada, pastor y carne asada fríes. El precio es accesible pero los tacos son demasiado pequeños y con muy muy poca carne (Me imagino que cada taquera es diferente). De cualquier manera el saber si es muy rico."}
{"text":"Ughhh why are the lines soo long???

Because they are that good. Yes. 

Really close to the Wynn, with a shared parking lot if you're driving, on the strip, open late, super cheap, and absolutely delicious after a day of drinking or not drinking whatever floats your boat.

My favorite is the adobada (spicy pork) and who could say no to a cup of horchata for $1.40. Nobody that's who! Don't forget to ask for the pineapple! Yum.

If you're going with a group of people, better split up and wait in different lines (there are 3) so you could order faster. Can't wait to visit the one in San Diego soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place they always treat me like an Mexico the tacos may not be the best in the world but all the concept and combinations of meats make this place great"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas, hands down. Order the lengua tacos, that shit is the bomb. Take it from a local ;)"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm on the strip and have the time I will stop at tacos el gordos because it is ALWAYS worth it. During the weekends it's packed and super chaotic. They have the best tasting carne asada tacos, they are small but 5 is good and filing. Wish they had more locations in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best tacos al pastor I think you can get in the US. Beats anything I've tried so far that wasn't actually in Mexico, and that says something. Hell, it's better than some of the Mexican spots I've frequented when I lived there. Their carne asada is great, their carnitas cuts are excellent, their sauces are flavorful, the service is fast and loose (it is kind of like a fast food joint), their aguas frescas are varied and sweet, and they have a huge selection of paletas to help you stave off the Vegas heat.

One of my favorite stops in Las Vegas every year."}
{"text":"I am so, so ecstatic that this location by the Westgate Hotel is open again. Walked in after the first day of the League Championship Series Spring Finals with my friend Akinola and got into one of the empty lines -- which was the al pastor line. Why aren't people in this line? Y'all tripping. We got a bunch of tacos, a pair of aguas frescas and some paletas.

The tacos did not disappoint. They never do. I was insanely sad when this location closed down and I couldn't make it last year. Maybe I overrate this place because it's the closest thing to eating tacos like I used to have back home. There's nothing like this in Miami, unfortunately. This is a pilgrimage I will always make every year, every time I am in Vegas.

This location being open again was one of the happiest things I'd heard in a while. I am always effusive in my praise about this place.

I am biased. Stick me on a trompo spit and roast me al pastor, for all I care. These are the best tacos I can think of that you can get in Las Vegas, bar none. These are some of the best tacos I can think of that you can find anywhere in the US, for that matter.

We sat down. We ate like kings. Eight tacos al pastor, some carne asada, some chorizo, some cebollitas and some peppers. Waited like five minutes for our entire order, sat down in another five and we were out of there in less than thirty. We considered coming back later in the weekend. I sent legions of friends, both old ones and recently-made ones over the weekend, to eat at this place. They loved it.

We'll return.

We always return."}
{"text":"Having a late lunch in vegas sure helps you beat the long lines come lunch or dinner time.  We got there and the place was half empty. Thank goodness! Ordered 7 adobadas and 1 carne asada...all with pineapple.  The sweet juicy goodness on top of that perfectly seasoned tender pork left me wanting more.  I thought, \"ohhh i'll just have 2 tacos\" but ended up eating 3, stealing one of my bf's. Squeeze some lime on each of those puppies and we were in heaven!  Ordered 2 more tacos after finishing the initial 8.  Don't bother with the carne asada tacos.  Pretty bland with a strange taste that follows. Make sure you try the Orange Bang from the fountain machine.  Its like a orange creamsicle.  I hear it also serves as an awesome chaser to vodka.  (We refilled and took some back to the hotel).  They have an array of your mexican fountain drink, jaritos, horchata, tamarine bang, just to name a few. 

The folks that work here are super friendly and just downright outgoing.  I was not only in a good happy mood when leaving just from the food but also because we were treated right."}
{"text":"I came here expected amazing tacos and was highly disappointed. I'm from southern California and have tasted authentic tacos these are not them.  Yes the tortilla is made from hand that was the best part.  The al pastor was fatty lacked flavor and were died pink to show more color. Everything was bland and lacked taste.  The long weight, the chaos inside, finding somewhere to sit etc not worth disgusting tacos.  Eat at a food truck not this garbage."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have EVER had --- I am a super finicky eater and I never eat veggies, but these were so tasty, I ate them with the veggies. I had no idea that a gem like this existed in Vegas, and it is totally worth the drive. Super cheap and just delicious. It's as authentic as you're going to get."}
{"text":"This is probably the most overrated taco stand I have ever been to.  Seriously, don't waste your time if you are on vacation in Las Vegas.  Over priced, dirty, crowded, staff is rude.  Skip it."}
{"text":"I'm from a city where I have many many options for Mexican food and the tacos weren't as great. I really enjoyed the carne asada fries but that's it:/"}
{"text":"I tried one of each taco. & I have to say the middle line was my favorite. you get a choice between all the things you don't really want to eat, but the tripa was by far the best taco I have ever had. After that I would say the beef head. everything there was very good and the drinks are uncommon, so if you're looking for not the same ol' mexican food you have to try this place."}
{"text":"These tijuana style taco are very delicious. My favorite is al pastor (yummy). I also love the fries with meat, cheese, guacamole and salsa."}
{"text":"This was mine & my boyfriends first time here. Aaaaaand, it DID NOT disappoint. This place is amazing. The service was super fast & friendly. And the food was of amazing quality and taste. The prices are perfect..$2 for an authentic Mexican tasting taco?! That's unbeatable. Definitely coming back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos !!! Wow! So much flavor ... It's a must if u Come to Vegas !!! Forget the fancy buffets .... Tacos el gordo is the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Despite difficulty locating this place (don't use the monorail system, you won't get very close!), we drove to it because we had heard of its greatness. It has good parking and really isn't that hard to find once you know to drive, and it was well worth it. 

The tacos are not big, but they pack more authentic flavor than any Mexican restaurant I have been to so far. I got two taco adobadas, a taco tripa, and a taco asada. They had some good horchata in a fountain with some soda as well. 

Needless to say I am impressed. Two dollars a taco. Super quick, friendly people, clean but fun tidy environment, and incredible food. Only drawback was walking back outside into the 100 degree heat. 

If you visit Vegas, you must stop by Tacos el Gordo!"}
{"text":"This was so good!!!!!! It is a shame i live really far from it otherwise i would be there all the time. Al pastor tacos were super yummy! Carne asada tacos were amazing as well. I will try to go there again soon."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!   Always crowded,  expect the wait,  but it's all worth it.   I had a total of five and I don't  normally eat a lot.   Must try"}
{"text":"Ehhh tacos are overrated! Just hype! The whole ordering system is messed up! By the time you finish ordering your food is cold!  Flavorless waste of time! 
On top of that the taquero was rude af! He was giving me attitude because I couldn't make up my mind wtf??!! 
Then the lady cleaning the tables comes after me like I'm trying to steal the tacos! Complete bs! Never again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a trip to Las Vegas and I was amazed. The reviews are all 100% accurate! Best tacos ever! I used to say that you have to drive to TJ to actually get authentic meat, and fresh hands made tortillas, but this place proved me wrong. There tortillas are made to order, there meat is soft , tender and so good! There product is fresh- from the guacamole to the sauces and Chile's- and there prices are so reasonably cheap! Everyone needs to stop here when they go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Good Pastor tacos in a not so nice part of Vegas. They clearly do not show this area in the tour guide books. I felt comfortable the whole time there but the family from Utah seemed a little freaked out."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best, most authentic Mexican food I have ever eaten!!! It was amazing! I went here twice on my trip to Vegas last week. I had the spicy pork Tacos with everything. They are the bomb. Food highlight of my trip!!!"}
{"text":"The worse tacos a ever ate, salsa horrible and the meat I can't express my frustration."}
{"text":"Best Taco shop in North America period.  I tried things I normally wouldn't, simply because everything else I tried there was incredible.  Fast, fresh, incredibly tasty.  Anytime I am in Vegas you can count on me stopping in for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"OMG hands down best tacos I've ever eaten in my life. This is a well deserved 5 stars and I've been craving tacos from this place ever since I've come back to California.

A friend of mine decided to take me here before we all left Vegas for home. The line was super long during lunch. You line up, order and they prepare it in front of you, and you pick it up on the spot. My friends and I ordered carne asada fries, and the pork adobada and spicy beef carne asada tacos. It was SO delicious!! I even put some of the carne asada fries in my taco and ate it like that. Everyone agreed my combo tasted bomb! Lol I wish California had a Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"Every time I am out until late, this is what I crave before I go home.  They offer all kinds of meats from tripe to tongue, the tacos are small but very tasty and they give you grilled onions or peppers on the side if you ask.  They have this dish called MULAS which is basically a sandwich made of tortillas, with the meat of your choice, cheese, and beans and it is absolutely yummy.
Their tripe is pretty good, although I'd prefer it more crunchy!
Adobada tacos are AMAZING and the steak are good also.



After hearing how dirty this place operates and watching them pouring lard into a tortilla I don't like it that much anymore...... still tastes good but ew!"}
{"text":"Long lines and the tacos aren't that good. Big disappointment. I've had better tacos from a taco truck."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego, so I was happy to see that a Tacos El Gordo was across the street from the Encore.  It was windy and very cold when we went, but we didn't care.  They were so busy that there wasn't any inside seating and the lines were stupid long too.  We had to eat outside, but that was complicated with not high tables or chairs out there.  

The tortillas are made fresh and the guys behind the counter are fast.  Some dishes take a lot of time, so I hope the person in front of you doesn't order something like mulas because it requires the melting of cheese.  That could easily take up to a minute to make.  Other than that, I recommend any of the tacos.  I've tried a bunch of their meat, but I like the al pastor the best.  I've had the quesadilla and mulas and I'll always come back just for the tacos.  

For about $2.50 a taco with tax, this will be one of the best deals on the Strip."}
{"text":"Disappointing doesn't even begin to describe the experience here. While their tacos are pretty good, you literally have to go on a mission to get them. 

First off, they have a terrible system for ordering your tacos and getting customers out the door. Each customer has to wait in line based on which type of meat they want in their tacos. If you want fries, you have to wait in an additional line. On top of those lines, you then have to wait in another line to pay. It took at least 45 minutes to get tacos. 

They cook with charcoal which sounds great, until all you can breath is charcoal smoke. Your eyes start to burn and clothes stink like you've been at a campfire for weeks. It's a miracle no one has passed out with it being so hot in there, extremely smokey, and minimal ventilation. Honestly, it becomes hard to breath 

Do not give in to the hype, this is not worth it! Should have just paid for a $25 quesadilla at the hotel."}
{"text":"One of the best cheap eats on the strip.
This restaurant is behind Encore beachclub which is definitely a walkable distance.
Tacos at this restaurant average at about $2.50 each.

The line up is quite different.. There are various line ups at the counter and you have to pay attention to the signs to make sure you are at the right line based on what you want to order.

We ordered the beef tongue taco, steak taco and the spicy pork taco all of them taste pretty good.. The spicy pork is a little bit on the dry side though but overall it's a good late night snack.

They offer plates of veggies with cooked green onions/ peppers.. They also have limes and beets up for grabs.

They have horchata and tamarind juice too which is pretty hard to find out there..

This restaurant opens till 2am monday to thursday and on weekends.. They open till 5am..
Definitely stop by if you feel hungry after partying late night!"}
{"text":"What can I say... I came to VEGAS to gamble and boy did I lose by taking my chances here.  2 lines for certain meats. Then another line to pay for over priced tacos. 
The paper the tacos are wrapped in had more flavor than the meat itself. I've been to TJ and let me tell you there is no comparison. I can see why the locals gave this place five's . We drove around I did not see any other Mexican taco stands so I can see why the locals favor this place. What's with the guacamole it's so watery and the salsa had no flavor and the meat was cold and flavorless. Or maybe it's me being from LA we are spoiled with the variety of different Mexican taco stands. If you still decide to stop by and eat you've been warned good luck. 
No es bueno..."}
{"text":"Huge lines can only mean one thing. Amazing and authentic tacos Mexicanos. Just be prepared for long long lines and limited seating. But it's worth it, come and try it."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS!!! You will not be disappointed! The wait is worth it! Yes there will be long lines and yes I waited for 2hrs to get my food but it is worth the wait. The employees are nice, the restaurant is self is not the prettiest. But it's a hole in the wall spot and these are usually the best. Food is fresh and horchata is amazing!"}
{"text":"Slow service. I know it's a popular joint, and the lines are long, but that doesn't mean you provide bad service."}
{"text":"I put this spot on my bucket list of places to dine while in Vegas.  I have to say the food was good.  And fresh which is a huge plus.  The prices are very reasonable as well as having a wide variety meats to choose from.  I will definitely drop in the next time I'm in town for a late night bite.  

J.S."}
{"text":"Tacos are the BEST but the only thing that I hate is that you don't know where to go if you want a certain kind of tacos because there's practically no line. Everyone is all confused on where to go to order. And there's never tables available."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in North Town! Love the hand made tacos. Carne fries are a MUST! Great prices!"}
{"text":"We tried the carne asada, pastor, and lengua tacos and I was expecting much more flavor than what we got. Pretty disappointed for how much we spent too. Will not be back."}
{"text":"It was a bit further down the strip, but it was worth the walk and 20 minute wait!
We ordered 2 carne asada tacos for each of us & some fries & it did not disappoint. The tacos seemed authentic & were all very flavorful. There were also a lot of fries for the low price, but maybe next time i would try out the carne asada fries since the normal fries were pretty average. Definitely coming back next time for the famous pork tacos!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp.  Tried it.  $2 tacos and by far the best food we had the entire trip.  We ate there every day.  They open early (can't remember; maybe 10AM?) and the help is VERY friendly.  Very clean, lively place.  Nice find!"}
{"text":"A must every time we're in Vegas. My favorite is the adobada tacos. Be prepared to wait, the lines are a little confusing, but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"When i travelled to las vegas once i was in a rush so i ate on this place. I remember the tacos were delicious, but it didn't exceed my expectations. In my opinion the place wasn't cleaned enough to enjoy the food properly. I wouldn't recommend it to go with friends."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm crazy, but one of my most memorable meals in Vegas was the El Gordo tacos. Before and after the club, I'll literally eat this anytime of the day. Their marination is so good and the sauce gives it the perfect compliment. I know my group of friends are all with me when I say we LOVE El Gordo!!!! 

But I did hear that San Diego's El Gordo is WAY better. Must make a trip to SD before I can confirm that statement for myself!"}
{"text":"In Vegas last week on business. My friend who's a gordo was raving about this. I stopped by one night ordered the quesadilla, sope, and tacos. The meat was good but I think just a little to much in way it was prepared. Overall ok, but I've been to better places back home in Los Angeles. Try it out, all of customers"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas!!  Spicy Pork is my favorite!
Just a couple minutes away from the Strip. Little tacos with colorful vegetables and delicious pork. You can eat 4 and that's a meal."}
{"text":"pineapple and pork taco is the only reason I'd return here..

people rave about this place but the tacos don't really live up to the hype.. that is unless it is a pineapple and pork taco.."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Tacos el Gordo for the longest time ever since hearing so many good things about it. I finally got the chance to try it while I was in Vegas for the weekend not once, but twice - that's how good it was! I only ordered the carne asada tacos and the adobada tacos which I absolutely loved. The carne asada tacos has guac on it, and the adobada tacos has two different kinds of salsa on it. My friends also tried buche but said it wasn't as good as carne asada. These were hands down the best tacos I've ever had in the States! The only downside is the wait - both times we went had at least an hour wait. Also, be sure you're in the right line because they have different lines depending on what kind of meat you want!"}
{"text":"Heard the hype and finally was in town . Wow good tacos , I had lengua , pastor , cabeza, tripa very good salsa was hot but I had to suck it up will go back !!!"}
{"text":"Tacos just like from Tijuana,Mexico. The Al Pastor were amazing! We ate there 2 times already today!"}
{"text":"Best tacos on the strip.  Open 24/7.  No ambiance just a cafe with some limited seating.  Food cooked in the middle of the room--you see what you're getting.

Went down here a couple times this week.  Good tacos.  Fresh sliced and cooked meats, pastor tacos were well spiced and flavored.  Big plate of peppers came along with it.  

24/7 was a big help:  tacos at 3am.  Mmm.  Bought total of five tacos for myself and the cab driver with two drinks total $13 bucks and they take American Express.

Give it a try.  Real good value and great hours."}
{"text":"Soo as some many know, dear Yelpers, Tacos El Gordo is my favorite taco shop in San Diego. When I realized (thank you dear Yelpers) they were in Las Vegas when I was visiting, I had another OMGAHH ____YES!!!! moment. 

http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-3-national-city#hrid:vuhiAv6G8JayVY4oQ4TT1g

I dragged my 60 year old mother in our rental car from the Strip to eat here one afternoon. She kept saying things like, \"Adrienne, are you SURE it's THIS FAR??\" I just knew it was going to be THAT good. You can't imagine how delicious the adobada was when we ate tourist food for 3 days. 

See pics of amazingness.  Tip well, drink the Horchata obviously, and try the weirdly addicting Creamsicle drink ."}
{"text":"*An excerpt from my 1st Tacos El Gordo review, at the National City Location:* 

best. tacos. i've. ever. eaten. 

ever. 

holygod.

______________________ This is me speechless.

*An excerpt from my 2nd Tacos El Gordo review, at the Charleston Ave location:*

\"I dragged my 60 year old mother in our rental car from the Strip to eat here one afternoon. She kept saying things like, \"Adrienne, are you SURE it's THIS FAR??\" I just knew it was going to be THAT good. You can't imagine how delicious the adobada was when we ate tourist food for 3 days.\"

So at the 3rd location I tried, I was confident they would be amazing. And the were, no doubt. Most of the customers in line were spanish-speaking and locals, so I took this as a good sign Consistent products state to state keep customer's from coming back right? The adobada here was juicy, flavorful and filled with pineapple and tangy salsa. My friend had a veggie quesadilla and \"veggie tacos\" which were kind of an odd assortment of toppings wrap up in tortillas...but still good and decent enough to eat. 

I'm sure the chaotic nature of the ordering has been hashed out a million times over in the other reviews, but be warned- stand in line in front of what you want to eat. There are different areas of lines for each station- grill, carne, adobada spit tacos, etc. They will yell out where to stand, so listen to where they tell you to go!"}
{"text":"The food was flavorful and looked good. Really nice place for a quick bite. I will definitely come back here, I really liked it."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally tried this place. Thankfully we were prepared for the complicated ordering system.  We shared six skewered meat tacos and an order of carne asada fries. The food was great but this place is pretty expensive forc what you get. I think we paid close to $29 for the lunch.

Not sure we will come back as there are other places with killer tacos for way less $. I'm still giving it 4 stars because the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Me encantan Los tacos de aki todo bueno, Pero como k ya se pasaron no cren? 2 Dolores el takito :( una familia de cuatro se gasta UNOs 40 dolares incluyendo sodas. cAROS! Pero buenos y despues del baile el unico Lugar abierto es este!!  :) cierran a las 5am"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fast service. Nice help. Limited menu. No chicken. My wife & I happened upon this simple fast paced authentic mexican restaurant while on vay-kay in Vegas last week.  The chef was helpful, friendly and made us a quick variety of food. Very casual. Muy delicioso!"}
{"text":"Authentic tacos just like in Mexico, served on waxed paper and all! My favorite are the lengua tacos.  You know it's authentic when about 75% of the customers are Mexican lol"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and tastes super fresh! The carne asada fries are the best."}
{"text":"Dirty Mexican food definitely hits the spot after a whole day/night of drinking... And Tacos El Gordo is the place to be! Not only is it super cheap ($2/taco) but its super delicious. We got the al pastor, carne asada, and the abodaba (spicy pork) tacos. My favorite was the abodaba (spicy pork). The meat is so juicy and flavorful. I can easily polish off 4 tacos. The carne asada fries are also good. They really pack on the meat and cheese, but wished they put on more guacamole. The fries are good, but I think I'd much rather eat more abodaba tacos! I also got the Horchata, it was OK. It was too watered down, I've had better. Parking isnt bad, saying how busy it is. We parked in a lot thats facing the Wynn, and there was plenty of parking... Easy access to good late night Mexican food!"}
{"text":"these tacos are legit. The Al Pastor/ adobada straight from the spit is how these tacos should be done. You can choose flour or corn tortillas. Located 15min from the Las Vegas strip and definitely worth the drive. Make sure you ask for pineapple on your Al Pastor tacos."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and was stopping by the neighborhood the other day. The place is not crowded at all, but the food is not as good as many other places nearby. Decent tacos. Nothing special about it"}
{"text":"theeee best tacos  ever 
Just like rosarito !! Intense long ass confusing ass line but totally worth it !!! 
They would have got 5 stars but management should really review they're set up and concept . The lines are really long and confusing for no reason .. 3 different lines for different tacos and another line to pay ... it doesn't make sense ... but over all ... the tacos are BOMB.COM"}
{"text":"I'm not gunna lie but tacos are good. Only thing is that they are expensive and you have to wait a long time to order cause lines are huge and have to make line several times of you want different type of tacos also there is never tables. I personally would rather go to a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The people who claim this taco joint is the greatest ever are probably not from the southwest. It is a very typical Mexican taco joint - all types of beef-related meats (carne asada for most, tongue and brain for the the adventurous. This place has a straight-forward menu. Heads-up:  when they ask you if you want everything on your $2 tacos, you are ok'g onions, cilantro, guacamole and salsa. The service is good and quick. I went at 6:30 pm on Wednesday evening during CES and there was no line."}
{"text":"Horrible taste, the pastor, steak and asada it does not taste at all like a mexican tacos, this is another tex mex restaurant food, you will never find a real mexican tacos in United States, sorry but is the truth."}
{"text":"I worked here I missed working for taco el gordo take me back in the food is good I loved it"}
{"text":"First, make sure you stand in the correct line for what type of tacos/food you want. Each line has a sign stating which type of food they serve for that type of particular line. Second, hopefully I have caught you reading this review before you make your way here because I want you to download a movie to watch while you wait in line. Yes the lines are that long. I went here at 3:00 p.m. on a Tuesday and still had to wait an hour. Was the food worth the wait? It's hard to say, because I hadn't eaten all day and probably any food would have tasted good. But at the time I thought these are the best damm asada fries I have ever had in my life, and I know my asada fries. Will I be back? Yes. Do I like the lines? No. But when you want the best, this place is the best."}
{"text":"The price point is perfect! ~ $3 tacos depending on what kind of meat you order.

They offer all kinds of options (carne asada, brain, tongue, etc) - so you have to find the person serving the kind of meat you want and get in that particular line to place your order.  You'll have to ask which line has what because there are no signs.

.. and it's weird because even if you're first in line (and you're at the counter ready to place your order) - if someone next to you has a tray of food and is waiting to place an order, they actually get to order BEFORE YOU because Tacos El Gordo has to serve those with food on their tray first.. that's right, they get to order before you, even though you were in line first... Tsk, Tsk!

They don't have chicken (aka pollo) - so if you're not a red meat person this might not be the place for you."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. You can see them making the tortillas right in front of you. I ordered two tacos and a quesadilla. The tacos were on point. Did not disappoint. The quesadilla was ok, but not what I would call a quesadilla. Not a traditional one at least. It was a tortilla with sprinkled cheese, meat on top and a smaller crunchy tortilla on top. To me a quesadilla is a big tortilla with meat and cheese, folded in half. For that, I deducted a star. Customer service was great and so were the prices Only thing I disliked was the lack of available seats. It was so crowded, we had to eat old school style. We placed our trays on the trunk of the car and grubbed."}
{"text":"BRAINS! BRAINS! BRAINS!  BRAIN TACOS! I LOVE TO EAT BRAINS!

During a recent lengthy stay in Vegas, I finally found time to get myself from my Old Town/Downtown hotel over to Tacos El Gordo on East Charleston -- a shop which I had known about for a couple of years primarily because of the fact that if offers brain tacos, but had heretofore been unable to visit during earlier Vegas stays simply due to time constraints. Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that I had been dying for several years, during previous visits to Vegas, to visit this shop?

So, I ended up visiting the shop for my very fist time on Tuesday, June 28th at about 12:15 PM;  I would have preferred to have visited the shop at about 11 AM, well before the onslaught of the lunchtime crowds, but my schedule did not allow it, and once I arrived at the shop, the lunch crowd turned out to be quite manageable.

Since I was a total newcomer, once I had arrived at the shop it took me a couple of minutes to figure out in which line I would need to stand in order to order the brain tacos that I was CRAVING, and, still a bit disoriented (largely because I was craving BRAINS), I finally needed to ask one of the chefs at one of the shorter lines, and he quickly, with a smile, pointed me to the correct line, which luckily turned out to be one of the very short lines (unlike the very long line for ordering pork and beef-filled tacos...), with only two people standing in line in front of me. I reached the chef within three minutes of having joined the line.

Best of all, it turned out that this was also the line for ordering tripe (stomach) tacos, which happened to be the only other type of taco filling in which I was interested. Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?

The ordering process, once I had figured it out, was great, and easy, and the chef on my line was great; he was obviously very happy (but then again, who wouldn't be happy if they were standing in front of a large bowl of scrambled BRAINS?) and he had a funny sense of humor. In very short order, he made up my large batch of brain tacos to go, replete with the exact toppings that I wanted on them (I love onions and some of the other toppings that were available at his station, but hate chopped raw cilantro, and the chef was great about avoiding the cilantro on my behalf...). Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?

When I reached the check out counter, I discovered, to my great pleasure, that they had at least two kinds of homemade hot sauce, each in small plastic cups with lids, stored in the fridge that they could and would pack with my order upon request. (When I got back to the hotel with my food, I discovered that both the red and the green hot sauces were GREAT!) They also had great medium-sized cups of rice pudding (with cinnamon on top) available in the cooler behind the cashier as well, at a very cheap price. I ended up getting several cups of the hot sauces, and also ordering five cups of rice pudding to bring back to my hotel room with me, since I still had about 5 days of my stay in Vegas ahead of me. However, what excited me the most was the simple fact that I would shortly be leaving the shop with a bag in my hands that was filled with BRAIN tacos! Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?

I ate some of the very delicious brain tacos 20 minutes later for my lunch in my hotel room, and the leftover tacos served as my lunch meal again the next day. Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?

My only regret is that during my first and only visit to the shop, I had not ordered more of the brain tacos. I should have ordered about 20 of them, and then stuffed them all (well, except for the few that I would eat for my lunch that first day) in the fridge in my hotel room. In case I have not yet mentioned this fact, I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS. In fact, BRAIN TACOS ares even better than BRAINS in tomato sauce on pasta, and even better than fried BRAINS.

In closing, I want to say that I love to eat brains. And my favorite brain meal of all time is brain tacos. The brain tacos and the tripe tacos from this shop were beyond excellent. The service at the shop was also excellent. I only wish that I had ordered more of each to bring back to my hotel room, as I had a large fridge in the room that could have held lots of BRAIN tacos! 

I am seriously thinking of moving full-time to Vegas, to a small apartment located just a few feet from the front door of this shop, just so that I can eat BRAIN tacos for each of my three meals each day! Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS?

Will definitely visit this fine shop again on my next Vegas trip. BRAINS!"}
{"text":"Just like going to Tijuana but without the border wait....must go if you are craving some good o' tacos"}
{"text":"Very good carne asada and soft flavorful tortilla.  The green salsa was mild, but good. Al pastor tacos were great. The fries and free refills were nice.  Parking was easy right on the strip."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town !! Just like back home will recommend to everyone I know 
Try the pastor tacos and buche !"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love tacos? Ok even if you don't love tacos this place is still awesome. The adobada is insane.  This place gets extremely packed and it's a little chaotic inside but trust me, bear through the chaos and you will be rewarded with some of the best tacos ever. Oh and don't forget the Carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Worst Ordering experience. Once you figure out how, then you walk across restaurant to pay where you stand in front of the industrial fan so your food gets cold. But not as cold as the cashier on this day!  Food is delicious so a star for that!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here and more than worth it!  Best tacos ever!!!  Had al pastor, lengua and cabeza and all were equally delicious!  Even have machine for drinks with Jamaica, horchata and many more!   This will always be on our list as a return spot!"}
{"text":"Great budget tacos. Taste just amazing. Totally worth checking out. Away from the Las Vegas Blvd. But want to eat different and tasteful things got really drive there."}
{"text":"Falls short from the original tacos El Gordo in TJ. I would've rated them higher but did not like the fact that you need to make multiple lines for different meat types. SMH. We have TJ tacos in LA on Avalon and Slauson that blows Las Vegas out the water."}
{"text":"I was generous in rating this place four stars. Nevertheless I really do like the tacos and asada fries. 

Bought 1 asada taco, 2 adobada tacos, 1 chorizo taco, and carne asada fries. Yes I do eat a lot so please excuse my endless appetite.

The tacos were delicious! Very well cooked and they pound it with guacamole, which I'm not used to since they don't do that in LA at your standard taco stand. But it's nice for a change. The adobada is practically the same as pastor.. Marinated pork. The sauces on the other hand were good but not great. Nothing too special but nothing beats spicing up that Mexican quench in your mouth!

The one thing I dislike about this place is the price. $2 for a single taco... and they charge you tax too, so technically even more than that. Maybe I'm just too used to $1 tacos from my hometown but that is pretty greedy of the Gordo management.

This is located in a pretty dead and shady neighborhood so be warned. I also kept getting stared at in which, I guess is cause I was the only Asian there. Asian or Mexican, it doesn't matter. I can eat more Mexican food than your everyday Hispanic person."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I've ever had. My husband and I eat here almost once a week so they always know exactly what we're going to have before we even have to order. 
The al pastor or adobada tacos are my favorite. They really taste like Mexican street tacos. 
The employees are always the sweetest and they treat you like family. 
Price is a little above any other taco place and you might have to wait some time to eat depending on the line but I promise you it's worth it."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos ever! Even though it gets really crowded the service is pretty fast! All the tacos are delicious  the service is fast and it's good! Can't go to Vegas and not eat here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. I've tried hundreds of taco spots but this al pastor ranks among the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo has really good Mexican food!! We come here every time we're in Vegas!! They are always busy no matter what time you come! I love the Asada tacos! My favorite! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I dig a dive, or a hole in the wall. It's like finding buried treasure.  This is the pot o\" gold at the end of the rainbow...$2 fabulous authentic tacos. Cheaper than a trip to Mexico. The perfect food to fuel a day of exploring the strip or an evening of dancing. Fast, friendly, fabulous!  I've just shared a Yelp secret.  Just between you and me...this is the bomb."}
{"text":"I didn't think the line was going to be worth it, but after I took a bite of the adobada taco....that one hour wait was gone from my memory. You would think that the location off the strip wouldn't be as crowded, but nope. always crowded. There was line the whole time we were there. Be ready to wait for a table. Lots of people save tables while others in their group wait in the hour line.. so they are actually on the table for like 2 hours. 

Other than the crowd and small space, the food is delicious here. Definitely recommend getting something with the adobada. They have campechana fries which is half adobada and half carne asada which is always AMAZING.

- long lines
- very little tables
+ delicious food"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the world. I've had tacos from here to Belize and I have to say, the marinade pastor/adobado is awesome. I'll def be back. The restaurant is busy but clean and efficient. 
  The price is great for what you get and the menu is quite extensive. They offer traditional and a few modern selections of Mexican food. If you can't make it to the location on the strip, there are a few other locations! Check them out!"}
{"text":"I had the pork taco. Actually I had four of them. I'm sensitive to hot pepper spices and this was perfect for me. Really reminded me of the street tacos in Tijuana. Plus the flan.....God the flan!!!!!..... it's going to be my new favorite taco spot...loved it!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place and order their compenchana fries. But I stopped going after I discovered Rita's Grill which was closer to me (Sloan and sahara) and they served a heftier amount of meat. But since I moved to bonanza and 95N I thought I'd give it another try since I'm in the area.

They must've hired new cooks or Rita's Grill is just that much better because I was extremely dissatisfied with my food. The fries were extremely poor in quality. They tasted as though they pulled them from the freezer. And the overall amount of food in my full sized box was extremely meager. Not worth the 30$ I paid for two boxes and two drinks for my girlfriend and I. Im never coming here again."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and a popular joint. Not a lot of English spoken but we managed okay."}
{"text":"This place is my Fav!!!! Reminds me of our fav taco spot in TJ- The hard tostadas are crispy and I always get chicken- Have no complaints about it what so ever. Also leave Fat & Happy!!"}
{"text":"Oh my! What have I been missing?! These tacos are the best. The meats are juicy and flavorable. Al pastor is my favorite and most popular! Tortillas are hand made right in front of you, they are fresh and hot and so delicious with any meat! At any time of the day, this place is crazy busy! Lines are out the door. While visiting Las Vegas, I came here two nights in a row for dinner and both times we've waited in line for these tacos. People order in large amounts, 15-20 tacos at a time, pretty smart I say. These tacos are so delicious, you won't settle with just 3 like you would a regular taco truck. These tacos make you come back for more -kind-of-tacos."}
{"text":"I can't get enough! Adobada! Ask for pine apple. Oh and they have tang that is creamy!!!!"}
{"text":"I have yet to see a taco joint where they serve excellent tacos AND fries. Here, you are delighted to tacos of all kinds of meat from asada to lengua. So you won't be limited to only one particular kind of meat.

The tacos are seriously STUFFED with meat, onions, cilantro, and sometimes mild sauce or guacamole depending on what kind of taco you order. Just a tip for preferential purposes, you can even order corn tortillas which are somewhat bigger than the standard size tacos. Remember, you have to ask for all the sauces when you pay for your food.

On the other hand, they serve fries! Be mightily warned that the full size rack of fries is HUGE. So unless you have a somewhat normal appetite and stomach, feel free to order the full size, otherwise, I highly recommend the half rack so you can get some tacos. They have carne asada fries, but my favorite is the campechana fries. The campechana fries consist of asada and adobada(similar/identical to pastor). And included is your standard set of sour cream, onion, cilantros, guacamole, and etc. 

This is conveniently located northbound on Las Vegas Blvd ahead of Wynn/ Encore. Which makes it the perfect place to fulfill your drunchies after a night at Surrender or XS. 

So many good things to say about Tacos El Gordo but why the one subtracted star? Prices. Coming from LA, I don't think I ever paid $2 tacos. But unfortunately, I have no other choice but to pay the full admission for a single taco in order to fulfill my meticulous craving for Mexican food."}

It is a \"family\" establishment to bring your children and let them run rampant and screaming without supervision in a dingy, low-ceilinged, un-ventilated horror of plastic clowns that haven't been cleaned since they were installed.  If there was a space capacity, there must be some sort of fire ordinance because you are unable to walk through the lobbies without dodging families who have too many children to keep track of, underage girls who are trying to grow up too quickly, and vendors who are trying to sell you belts and accessories made in Vietnam.  2nd hand smoke and dirty money was my perfume of the day.

So maybe you can understand my frustration about my predicament.  So when I yelped a nearby place to escape to, I settled on Tacos El Gordo.  This placed changed my entire perspective on the trip.


ADOBADA  ALL DAY ERR' DAY

Holy-- I got Adobada Tacos, Adobada Quesadilla, and ordered some Carne Asada fries for the table. 

The staff runs a jovial assembly line, where you order your items and they each take an assignment.  It comes with grilled veggies (especially the green onions) which were so bomb I was eating them long after my stomach was maxxed out.

The tacos had it RIGHT.  Perfect blend of all textures-- meat was savory, vegetables crisp, and tortilla fresh.  Quesadilla followed suit, and then topped off with my fries.  Best carne fries I have ever had.  Price was way too fair!  I tipped them 5 dollars in the jar because I was so impressed with everything.

The workers were experiencing a mid-day lull in traffic, and each of them began cleaning everything-- I saw one of the ladies even get on a ladder and clean the ceiling. They were jamming out on their radio music, and singing loudly.  I loved the warmth!

I walked out feeling like this trip could be good!  Staying at awful Circus Circus brought me within walking distance to this place, and I was instilled with hope.  If you are in town, you HAVE to go here."}
{"text":"The food was really bad. The asada had way to much fat they didn't even cut it off also way over priced your better of getting asada fries at pepes or rigos a couple of miles away."}
{"text":"Had the spicy pork tacos and steak tacos and WOW were they good! Freshly made tortillas, everything was so fresh! So good. Will definitely be back. Awesome place :)"}
{"text":"Thank you yelp for introducing me to this delicious taco place!!

I tried three different tacos, but the pork (adobado) was by far the most flavorful.

I also had the horchata that came out of a fountain. It was really sweet so I highly suggest diluting it with water and ice to make it a lighter refreshing summer drink.

Order at the open kitchen and pay at the cashier on the right. Line was super quick and food delicious and cheap. Double win.

Outdoor seating is available."}
{"text":"All I can tell you is that I wish that we ordered two of everything. $2 tacos... We had Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos and they were the best tacos I have ever eaten. 
After our visit I looked this place up and was thankful we didn't have to wait in line. It's totally worth a visit while your in town."}
{"text":"It's been six months since my last trip to Tacos El Gordo (in San Diego) so of course my first stop for food in Vegas had to be here! There was basically no wait for any of the lines when I went around noon which was surprising but I'm definitely not complaining.

I had the adobada and cabeza tacos - my usual - which tasted just as good as when I had them in California. My friend and I also split a half order of campechana fries, which had a nice balance of meat, cheese, and toppings. After eating 4 tacos I honestly don't know how I ate half the box of fries but it was so good and I've been deprived for so long so why not ¯\_(?)_/¯

Seriously I have nothing but praise for this place. I don't know if Vegas has any other good Mexican food places but why bother looking when you can have Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"Taco-flavored kisses for Tacos El Gordo!

Despite the number of time I've been to Vegas, I wouldn't consider myself a \"Vegas person.\" I dunno, everything on the strip seems to run together after a while, and you can't really tell the difference between this place and that. Enter Tacos El Gordo! You have to walk a bit away from the action to get to it - just north of the Wynn and Encore, Tacos El Gordo is located in a weird little strip mall next to a souvenir shop. They have seating indoor and out.

When I walked in, I was faced with a food station directly in front of me and a cashier to my right, horchata/bang/soda machine on the left. I was totally confused as to where to order and how to pay. It must have showed on my face because one of the guys behind the counter where the cooks were smiled and called to me. He took my order, barked it at the cooks and told me to wait there, then pay when I got my food. I was totally surprised at how cheerful all the employees where. Great customer service is definitely not something I seek out when I'm eating at hole in the walls, but every employee greeted me with a smile and was happy to serve me. When the cook handed over my food, he asked to make sure the order was right, gave me a big smile and told me to enjoy. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.

I had the carne asada fries, an asada taco, chicken quesadilla, and an a pork taco (I was sharing with a friend OKAY?). Everything was perfectly delicious. The carne asada fries were huge, enough to feed 2 to 3, possibly 4 people. The tacos come overflowing with meat, and the horchatas and bang juices are refillable. Woohoo! I felt like I struck gold with this place. And our whole bill was only $20. I think it was the least amount of money I had spent on a meal that satisfying in Vegas. If you're looking for some good, cheap Mexican food on the strip, drive or walk a little further, Tacos El Gordo is worth it."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas!

Other than being in actual Mexico and eating tacos, this is the next best thing! The meats are flavorful and tender! Salsas are great.

Carne Asada fries are bomb!

My favorite is adobada, cabeza and lengua tacos! 

Ordering is easy. You line up by what kind of meat you want. Once in any line you can ask for any other meats you want as well and they will shoutout your order to the guy working that particular meat! 

Also, They have quesadillas too! And free grilled onion and or peppers ! 

Overall great place to have tacos !"}
{"text":"Spicy pork/adobada is so good!! Moist and so flavorful. The avocado sauce (I think it's avo sauce) is so amazing too! 

At 1:30AM it wasn't too bad of a line. Waited maybe 20 minutes. But it's worth it! There's separate lines for each type of meat you want so read that before standing in line. Wish they had chicken, but only beef and pork )= They ask you what you want and if you want all the toppings (cilantro, onions, avo sauce). You order, they give you the food, you walk to the back and pay. It's efficient. They'll put foil over it when u pay if you're doing to-go. There's a tented area in the front to sit and eat but it's crowded. 

Since we went at night the heat inside wasn't too bad, but there is NO air conditioner. Just fans, so it's stuffy. Probably so bad during the day time in the summer. No water out or anything either, and drunk people and heat don't mix well.  Saw a drunk guy totally pass out and hit the floor waiting in line. Heard a big thump when his head hit :/ he got up with a huge bump on his head and they called an ambulance. Hope you're okay whoever you are! Too bad you didn't get to try the amazing tacos."}
{"text":"This place is amazing after a long night of drinking!! Don't be afraid of how hectic it looks inside and how long the line is. The line move pretty quick. We got the Asada and Spicy Pork. They have different lines for each tacos. The two middle one is Asada and Spicy Pork. I like the Spicy Pork more than the Asada. Sucks I forgot to ask for the pineapple. But the sauce and the tortilla was so good!! We got totally of 9 tacos and one drink for 28. I will come back to this place for sure next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos , if you want to eat real tacos this is the right place to go , it took me back almost 30 years ago when I was stationed in Camp Pendleton and used to go to Tijuana and get tacos"}
{"text":"This place is the best tacos in Las Vegas. They are the King Taco of Las Vegas, open late, delicious, and perfect after a night of drinking. The al pastor is incredible and the Asada I ended up eating the next day, cold, and they were still out of this world good. This beats anything else on the strip when it comes to late night quality fast food, authentic, a little expensive in comparison to your average taqueria but ultimately worth it."}
{"text":"Real authentic Mexican food. This establishment only serves tacos of different meat. Food is tasty and delicious. They do have different cooks for different meat, depending on your order. Each cook takes pride in serving your tacos. There are plenty of salsas to choose depending the taco. I thought the salsa of avocado was the best. Other salsas are also good.  This place is not expensive. I had five tacos with a fountain drink for 13.00. This restaurant surpasses all the other fake Mexican restaurants in the hotels food courts."}
{"text":"Now you know a taco place is good when you don't have to always settle for carne asada. Gordos has the best spicy pork tacos! And they're proud of it :) this has been the best taco I've had for a whole-in-the-wall place. The vibe is great too, from workers to customers. The place is crackin up until 4am. Oh and best of all.. Non stop refills on horchata"}
{"text":"I heard about this place because a friend of a friend grew up with the owner in Tijuana! He told us this place is legitimate, and I can confirm!

This is the real deal, you guys! After a long day of inundating glitz, there's nothing like going to an authentic, down-home taco shop for a pit stop. It is busy in here (read: pandemonium), but there is definitely a method to this madness: it's not too hard to figure out how to order and the food comes out fast. Tacos come with creamy guac and delicious meats (carne asada has to be my favorite, but the al pastor was also on point.) If you're looking to get full on $15 and in less than 30 minutes, this is the place to go!

There is no pollo aqui, be warned. It is also not vegetarian-friendly. Otherwise, encantado, El Gordo! See you again!"}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious Adobada Tacos. I get them with the real guacamole, which is so much better. They will do anything on fries and smother it in salsa and guac for you. Not as crowded as the Strip location. 

Cons: Crowded. It is set up cafeteria-style, so if lines are long and you want items from more than one of the three stations ( your food will get cold. I recommend having one person for each line."}
{"text":"Really good taco's, just a little on the expensive side.  $3 a taco! $8 asada fries (small)"}
{"text":"PLEASE OPEN ONE IN PHOENIX. This place is so good. I go every time I visit Vegas sometimes more than once. I always get the al pastor tacos or mulas."}
{"text":"We come all the way from LA to try these tacos. They're that good! My favorite are chorizo and asada. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Just went back here this week. Perfect late night spot with a great selection of carne asada, tongue, brain, etc. tacos, and there great fries with cheese, meat, Guacamole, etc. on top. Will gladly go here every time we're in town."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Mexican fare. I recommend the spicy pork-worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Had the lengua, cabeza, and tripas tacos.  They were all okay and the service was quick and capable  but I will go back to Taco y Taco and Pepe's.  Pepe has some additional options I like, and Taco y Taco had better tripas.  Everything was a bit underseasoned, a problem I've not encountered elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, some of the best in town. The menu is nicely priced, and the food delicious. I can't think of any real complaint here. They're salsa is lackluster though."}
{"text":"My first time here. Was looking forward to trying the tacos but they were just ok... Like the kind you would make at a Mexican backyard barbeque. Had the lengua, suadero, and pastor.

This is definitely a place where you can find and dash...I didn't! You first stand in a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong line for the different types of meat you want (so if you want asada, adobada, and lengua this means three long ass lines) which makes no sense at all. Then you stand in another line to pay. Oh so tempted to not stand in line to pay but alas I am not a scammer."}
{"text":"I'm giving the tacos de adobada or el pastor (spicy pork-not really spicy)  5 stars! This particular meat is difficult to master and they've done the job! Last time I had the best adobada tacos was out in Mexico."}
{"text":"Amazing! Location on Las Vegas Blvd. near The Wynn has closed though. Haven't tried the others yet."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  My wife is Mexican, from Guadalajara and I am...not but we both loved this place.  Hands down, the best tacos I have ever had. I had the Adobada  (pork, I think?) and she loved the buche (no idea what part of what animal that is?).  The tacos are only $2 each!  Last night we spent $100 on a dinner that wasn't half this good."}
{"text":"Always a staple whenever we're in Vegas. Its perfect for a cheap meal, late night meals, and hangover cures.

I've pretty much only had the tacos and carne asada fries here. I usually never order horchata but here, it's not even an option for me. Yes please!

Walking in, newcomers usually have a problem learning how everything works. You have to stand in different lines for different types of meat. Pork (adobada) line, carne asada line, lengua line etc. After you order and take your food from the lines, then you walk to the cashier to pay. If you're smart, you stand in one line and your friend stands in another line. 

The tacos are a great size and they're about 2 bucks each. I don't care what your preference is here, if it's your first time, you HAVE to try the spicy port Adobada tacos with everything on it!"}
{"text":"I don't see what the fad is here...maybe I'm not drunk or it's cause I'm from SoCal so I grew up eating deliciously cheap tacos (for like 75 cents). I thought this place was ridiculous expensive for tacos. Sure, they put on a show, and it's a popular place for locals. I tried the asada, lengua and adobada. I thought the adobada was the most flavorful out of the three. The others, didn't really stand out. The food tastes decent (I'd give it 3-3.5 stars at most) but I just can't get over the price! (hence the 2 stars)"}
{"text":"Oh man this place was packed on Monday night at 10 pm.  Tried the buche al pastor spicy pork lengua and qusadilla and were all good.  Tacos were $2 and quesadilla were  $4.  All in all the bill was $80 for 25 tacos n 3 quesadillas with drinks n dessert.  Avoid this place during rush hr unless u have plenty of time to wait for a table and lines.  Call ahead for togo?"}
{"text":"Authentic Al Pastor. FINALLY a place in the US - and i have searched far and wide across the land. And on the original gyro-spit machine. Thank you, Al Pastor gods. AND plenty of seating to boot!"}
{"text":"These tacos are Tasty.  Don't expect the same old Taco Bell cHOp meat.   They are like home made Mexican tacos. Very fresh and very reasonable.   The order menu isn't written in English and could be a little hard to understand.  But other then tn"}
{"text":"Most amazing street tacos - adobado, get the peppers...make sure you get the roasted pineapple on top."}
{"text":"Best Freaking tacos ever!!!!!!! spend so much money on expensive spots on the strip when i discover this place a day before leaving. Yikes. Glad i got to try them though my mouth still waters from remembering how good they taste. The tacos al pastor where the best!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a craving to get filled in the desert and it has to do with tacos? this is place to go to then. plus opened late!

Tacos El Gordo gets 5 stars from me. cleanliness, location, price, quality, flavor and free drink refills and I'm taking horchata on tap!

first, walking in you would be skeptic. they have most of the meat on a turning spit like gyros or shawarma meat holders. but rest assured it's all delicious.

I've had almost all of the meat offered there. some of it I'm not touching because I could be insecure when it comes to questionable titles on food names, so I'll stock with the usual meats.

the spicy pork meat is amazing. the beef is right behind it as far as flavor goes. carne asada is yummy. I like to get a assortment of tacos when I go...like a mix of donuts mmmmm.

the quesadilla is not what you think. it's a small tortilla with the cheese cooked on the grill, then placed on the tortillas and topped with a crunchy shell. it is not big at all, but very delicious. I'm not sure why it's so expensive, but I pay it (maybe that's why)

the food always taste consistent, fresh. quality is perfect.

guacamole is made fresh and the spread is great. the toppings are just all around good.

I'm a fan and will be back for more"}
{"text":"I love greasy tongue tacos. I love them on occasion and sometimes on Sundays. 

I love tongue tacos and that is all I will ever order from here. It's not to say that I wouldn't have anything else- it's just that my diet doesn't allow for so much grease...so when I come to a taqueria I make sure I get as slippery as I can *ssSSLURRRP*!!! 
I get my tacos as fast as I would get them in the heart of mehee-co..

I love beef- gimme that beef tongue in between two tiny corn tortillas...con pico y mucho cilantrrrrro. OMG tongue tacos for DAYS! It will be a while until I have another slimy and onion crunchy tongue taco but that day can wait....
                                                                           I prefer to keep my girlish figure...anyways. GET your tacos COME and get your tongue tacos (or whatever it is you may want..) COME and get your sugar packed horchata...GET it here...GET it now!! AY YA YAY (I'm allowed to do this...I have proof)"}
{"text":"Best $2 carne asada street-style tacos in Las Vegas! Ask for the grilled jalapeños. This is coming from a San Franciscan where our mission district tacos are on point and authentic. Located in a plaza with lots of parking. To avoid the lines go during the day. If you go late night, everyone and their mama will be there!"}
{"text":"I got my dinner just before the evening rush just prior to people getting off work and on the way home. I must say I spent (first time here) very little time waiting to order, waiting for the food to cook, and picking it up! I cannot complain as there were a few people ahead of me and they ask your name and the staff are so professional and amazing! Made me feel as though I was whisked away back south of the border. I've been to Mexico many times mostly to Guadalajara, loved it! Anyway, the food was flavorful and hot and Asada Fries I ordered were so delish the best I've tasted. Although there was a bit more guac then I am used to but that doesn't merit losing a star in my opinion! I am chowing down on my two tacos that I ordered! If I didn't want the Fries I would've gotten like 5 tacos! I mean $2 each and they are so unique and yummy, how could you go wrong? This place is as authentic as it gets when it comes to Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas in March...this place is awesome.  The spicy pork taco is pure crack.  If I have kids, I would sell my first born to have another spicy pork taco."}
{"text":"Got the tripa, buche, lengua, cabeza and lengua fries. I was hungry.

I got food poisoning.

Service was fast for the above meats though so +1 star for that."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is truly a hidden gem in Las Vegas!

Doesnt get more authentic than this, well it probably does, in the deep forests of Mexico.  Are there even forests in Mexico? Anyways, I love how there's more than just 2 meats.  Any place that has Suadero is a favorite of mine, and Tacos El Gordo has Suadero!  If you've never heard of it, try it! Trust me! It's meat so tender it'll make you wanna slap ya daddy AND ya mama!  

I had the massive carne asada fries, but I didn't know til after that you can get any type of meat you want on top of the fries.  I would have got their suadero. It's that good!  I usually just get the taco's now and maybe a sopes here and there but mainly the tacos.  It comes with grilled onions on request.  It always seems like they're constantly cooking, maybe because it's always so busy."}
{"text":"I seriously don't understand the hype about this place. I've been there twice and was not really impressed. First of all the tacos are tiny. The meat is decent but they are really small. The first time I was there I ordered 2, and the guy said \"Thats it?!\". They we're decent, not fantastic.

Next time I tried the Fries with adobado. It's basically a pile of fries, topped with your choice of meat, guacomole, sour cream, some kind of mayo based sauce and unmelted shredded cheese. It's great if you're trying to consume 2000 calories in 1 meal.... I didn't really like them to be honest. They should melt the cheese. 

Nothing about this place stands out, I seriously think the Mexican food in LV is lacking... and this place is no different."}

Will be the spot the next time we come to Vegas. Good size for the price (2.25) a lot of meat. You walk in and there is three different spots where you can order your tacos Depending which one you want. We got there and it wasn't so packed but once we started to order it got super busy. Recommend this place oh and they are making the tortillas by hand :)"}

{"text":"I was really excited about eating at this place based on all the reviews in yelp and was slightly underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong. The tacos were delicious, but they weren't amazing. I got the tongue, beef head, pork, and steak and I only felt the steak was really good. The other meats were well seasoned and cooked well, but I'm just not a big fan of the tortilla. It was a little too thick for me. Overall, this place is a good place to step away from all the expensive places on the strip, but just don't set your expectations too high."}
{"text":"A Vegas trip is incomplete without a visit (or two or three) here! You know it's bomb dot com when it tastes like heaven whether you're drunk after the day club/nightclub OR sober!!!

No joke, come grab a few tacos (my fav are carne asada with guac on the side & pastor) and some grilled green onions and you'll thank me later. 

There are multiple lines to order certain meats.  Takes about 10 min to get food during non peak hours but just expect for there to always be a line no matter when you go. It's THAT good!"}
{"text":"Delicious fucking tacos. Tried the Al Pastor and they were flavorful, juicy, and cooked perfectly. The tacos were just properly prepared. Only con is that they're a little small for $2 each."}

Btw most people that work in this establishment mainly speak Spanish but don't be afraid to ask them questions or another nearby customers, someone helped me with some questions I had and she didn't even work there!"}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I have ever eaten. The lengua is so soft, and the al pastor has so much flavor. I love the guacamole sauce they put on the tacos.

Ask for grilled jalapeños and onions! Absolutely bomb.

The lines here are absolutely ridiculous, I wouldn't come back because of the wait, I would go to one off strip.

They lose a star because the ordering process is weird. There's multiple lines for different meats. After you get your food, you have to get in another line to pay. It's crowded and cramped inside, making it hard to eat there as well."}

{"text":"i came here for lunch today after checking out from Aria and it was my first time, but it was so good. I wasn't even hungry but still managed to scarf down two tacos. The guy slicing our meat was super friendly and nice... that made me love the place even more. 

I asked my bf to get me foil so i could save my last taco for the car ride home. While I was attempting to wrap it, one of the lady's that worked there came by and helped me, but because I'm dumb I thought the shiny side of the foil was suppose to be covered... apparently I'm wrong! She took my tacos and had the guy wrap it for me. 

that's what i call customer service, and it left me with a smile. i hope they read my review and know that I really appreciate great customer service. I never asked for help but she passed by and just helped me... like so motherly!!

come here, you won't regret it!! the workers all looked so happy and really nice. in LA a lot of taco establishments are kind of nerve wrecking to walk in especially some of the king taco's I've been to."}

This place did not disappoint at all Yes I agree the set up is a bit confusing but everybody was super nice, there is hardly any seating and it's always packed so take it to go.  I got the usual carne asada and I also had the al pastor.  I cant wait to go back to Vegas"}
{"text":"I've come back every day of my stay to eat these tacos. The food here is outstanding. They make the corn tortillas fresh before your eyes, with delectable salsas and fillings (around six or eight types to choose from---the spicy pork is the one I keep coming back to). They have mounds of radish and lime on the side, and they also serve really good grilled peppers. Plus, the people who work here are nice; they have to work like demons to keep up with demand, but they still manage to treat their customers with a lot of kindness. I love this place! Stop reading Yelp reviews and go here!"}
{"text":"Came here right when it opened at 10 a.m. so there was no line up. Score. There are a couple different stations and you go up to the meat that you want your in your taco and order from that station. I tried the adobada which I found out was another name for al pastor.
It is the favorite there, and for good reason! I had to ask for my slice of pineapple and make sure to get the grilled green onion and jalapeno on the side. The grilled onion is really amazing. I was a little bit skeptical, I mean I'm from LA. I like to eat tacos, and I wasn't sure how Las Vegas would deliver. It was really delicious. The sope was not as good as I thought it would be and the vampiro is just a sope with a tostada \"lid\" on top.
See also got adobada fries but save yourself the stomach space and just fill up on tacos."}
{"text":"Long wait so please be patient hot hot hot it's Vegas. But worth cheap and good tacos"}
{"text":"For anyone that follows my reviews or knows me I am a taco lover. If there is a good taco I'm there for it. I've been to Tacos El Gordo once before and didn't get the Al Pastor. Shame on me, I know. Every time I bring up that Los Tacos (across the street) is underrated and might be better all my friends say, \"NO WAY! TACOS EL GORDO IS WAY BETTER!\" So today I took my wife on a taco tasting to eat at both places. Below are my thoughts on Tacos El Gordo, check my Los Tacos review too!

I came here for one thing only. Al Pastor tacos. But I would also suggest getting Mullas if you haven't had them before. Delicious. 

But the Al Pastor is perfect. Spicy pork with crispy bits and very juicy. The avocado cream and salsa all compliment the meat perfectly. They're delicious no doubt about it. Little bites of pineapple to just add that pop of tart citrus. Just a really excellent taco.

But nothing else here stands out as MUST HAVE. It's a one trick pony. And they have that stupid ordering system where you gotta wait in line get your food, wait in line pay, and by the time you sit down the Taco is soggy. So inefficient it kills me.

Based on the Al Pastor alone place is a winner. But rest of the menu and the ordering set up brings it down a peg for me."}
{"text":"\"Mexican street tacos meet the Vegas Strip\".

This places rivals some of the best taco joints in Mexico. Believe me, I've been to a lot of them.

I would call this a hidden gem (only because you don't know about it), but with the amount of reviews and the amount of people at any given time it's pretty well known. Don't be discouraged by the pictures of long lines, they turn out everything quick. 

They have separate lines for different cuts of meat, so you might want to have someone else in your group stand in another line to get it all at the same time. 

I would highly suggest Pastor (pork) and Asada (beef). You can chose from Flour or Corn tortillas. Don't forget to ask for everything on it! Also the Asada fries are amazing. You can even get a half order and any type of meat you want on top of the fries."}
{"text":"The experience here was absolutely amazing. My friends and I came to this place around 11 AM on a Friday, and luckily the lines were not that long. Right after we finished ordering though, the lines were going out the door... I don't think you can ever avoid lines at this place!

Food: I had ordered the abodaba tacos and asada tacos. They were $2.50 each, which is a bit pricey for tacos, but we know this place is known for great quality so that was fine. I wish I got some more abodaba tacos because they were amazing and my friends were raving about chorizo tacos! Honestly, the asada tacos were really good but I think I can get that kind of taste at any taco stands. Nonetheless, they were all yummy! I only ordered 3 tacos and I was still hungry lol. My friends and I decided to split the carne asada fries, which was the best decision I made during my Vegas trip. It was SO good, and nothing back home will beat the taste. 
P.S. Get the horchata, you won't regret it. 

Seating: The place has lots of places to sit, except there are so many people there. We had to often tell people that seats were taken while my friends went to go use the restroom or wait in line for some more food.

Service: it was okay. The people who work there are not nice, but they're not rude either. They do look like they don't want to be there. Also, the workers take your trays and trash for you, which is really nice, but they do it in a way so that you'll leave and make room for other people. We understood we couldn't stay for long, but we ate pretty rushed. Other than that, it wasn't a too bad of an experience!

If you're ever in Vegas or SD, you should definitely check out this place!"}
{"text":"We waited for over an hour just to order, but the food never fails to make me happy. I was super happy that the guy that always makes my tacos the adobada was there to help me. I secretly have a mini crush on him. He always has a great attitude and it makes everything better. 
I will continue to go and wait the hour to get my tacos.


*The wait was on Sunday*

We had also gone on Thursday and we only waited 15mn to get the tacos, same day I got to meet Adriel Favela (Mexican Singer) who was also getting tacos there before a performance."}
{"text":"I loveeeeee this place so much!! The people who make the tacos (tripas and adobada) are super cool and fast!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm...I was a fan after witnessing the spicy pork hang/marinate from a fresh pineapple.  Whatever sauce they place on top of the tacos is equally fantastic.  This was my first time trying cabesa (hesitantly, might I add) and was pleasantly surprised!   Best tacos I've had in a very long time, maybe ever.  They're also open late, which was convenient after going downtown."}
{"text":"Crowded like this every day!?!? What?!??? But 30 minutes on November Friday 27, 2015 was well worth my wait! They have the most affordable tacos for its quality. Everything was just so amazing to me!!!! I tried each and every single one. My next visit here I will have three of everything."}
{"text":"While now living in the Bay Area, I grew up in San Diego where I got spoiled with good Mexican food.  In a way, I took it for granted.  The Bay Area has some of the best food spots around, but in terms of Mexican food, I'm sorry, it just doesn't cut it.  Every time I go back to San Diego, I always make 1 or 2 (or 3) stops at Tacos El Gordo.  While I don't go to Vegas too often, it's good to know that I can do the same there, as well.

When it comes to Tacos El Gordo, the 1 thing you have to get is the Adobada taco.  It's spicy pork (although, not very spicy at all) it comes with a green sauce that complements it perfectly.  When you see the pork being shaved off the spit rod, your mouth will start to water.  Also good is the SD-staple, carne asada.  The meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked and is served with the freshest guacamole.  Not the watered down stuff you will find at the taquerias here in Northern California.  If I go with a group of friends, we will almost always share an order of the Campechana fries.  It is similar to carne asada fries you will find throughout San Diego, but is made with Adobada meat, as well, and is served with that same green sauce that is served on the tacos.

If you like some of the other cuts of meat that usually go with tacos, then they probably have those here, too.  I'm talking about Lengua (Tongue), Buche (Pork Stomach), Cabeza (Beef head), or Tripa (Beef Guts).  They also have different vehicles for all their meats, like Mulas, Tostadas, Suadero, or Sopes.  They also have quesadillas, in which you can add meat, if you want.  They are pretty small though, so if you're hungry, get a few.

One last thing to mention is expect to wait in line.  Don't think you can go at 10am, when they open, and beat the crowd.  Or, go at midnight thinking everyone's in the club or asleep.  Nope.  There will be a line.  Guaranteed.  But, they do have several lines when you actually get in.  One or two lines will have adobada, and other ones will have the other meats.  I want to say they go fast, but they don't.  They are fast making the food, but I think people order so much that it takes time.  The Adobada line does go fast though, for whatever reason.

P.S.  Don't forget the Horchata!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot after a night of clubbing when I'm craving tacos. They are open until 5am on Saturday,  which really is EARLY Sunday morning. They are usually very busy but are efficient in getting your food out asap. There are separate lines designated for which tacos you want. I love how they also accept credit cards including AMEX.
Their tacos are good! I get the Taco de Adobado which is their pastor. They shave the pork off the spindle and even cut a piece of pineapple. It's absolutely delish and you must try it!"}
{"text":"I love the tacos here!  My favorite is the Al Pastor.  So delicious!  I am still craving them now.  I also had a quesadilla Al Pastor, that was good too.  They put a crunchy taco on a soft taco and grilled it with cheese.  I can't recall the other tacos I got, but definitely go for the Al Pastor and include the sauce they put on it!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome! If you want quality and authentic Mexican tacos then search no more---this is it. I ordered beef tacos and carne asada fries and I honestly enjoyed every bite. 

The atmosphere is very laid back and casual and it's a great place to go for low price but still delicious food. The cook spoke with me briefly as he cooked and had a very nice personality. In addition the lady at the register was also very sweet.  

If you haven't tried these tacos please do and ENJOY! You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! I was one of three white guys in the place and I was wondering what some of stuff on the menu was. If you squirm when out of your comfort zone, this may not be for you...as the Beef Tongue and Beef Head tacos spanked the pork taco!  PS. It is only the Asada line that is to the left...I finally figured that one out.  Everything else is available in the right-side line. I could have gone here everyday I was in Las Vegas. I hope to get back."}
{"text":"BOMB Tacos and on the end of the strip. we used to drive to one that was a bit further off the strip but It isn't as crowded as this one. 

You must get the Tacos al Pastor. The best. They put Guacamole on them and they aren't stingy with it. Hand made tortillas. They have all kinds of meat or cuts of beef. So good. I easily devour 8 tacos. At 2 dollars a taco it aint cheap but its one of the cheaper eats in the strip and its real tacos. hmm."}
{"text":"Es una travesía poder comer con tantas filas que tienes que hacer, deberían de hacer una sólo fila los tacos están bien pero las filas no les ayuda mucho"}
{"text":"Great beef tacos but just be wary of what you order!  Buche (Stomach) and Tripe (Intestines) are not for me but some may enjoy them."}
{"text":"The set-up makes better sense after it's explained to you.  The lines are different because of the types of meat they serve.  Everything pork to the left, beef in the middle, and everything else on the right.  I can see how things would get chaotic if you want different items though.  

Luckily, we came in during off-peak time, 3 in the afternoon, and were able to try the spicy pork, and a few others.  I liked the sopes the best because of the gooey layer of cheese.  Yum!

Some of the meats weren't as flavourful as I had hoped so we slathered on some spicy salsa which still wasn't all that spicy.  Go figure.  All in all, it was a pretty good snack and for the price, worth the trek.  

That pineapple-coconut drink was so good!  Piña Colada.  Double yum!

3.5 stars, but rounding up to 4.  The service was so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Visited this location because of all the hype and how great it is.   

My review-

Food was good  4 stars 

Service at the register--. Was horrible the lady at the register needs to be sent to customer service training.... She has no clue, no customers there is no need for her.....this kind of service will eventually get them a bad rating  if they don't change that attitude  and end the hype....

Management great time to monitor your team and make the adjustments needed."}
{"text":"Tacos el Gordo will never disappoint. Don't be surprised if there's a crowd, because this place has always and will always be bomb.com hahaha. Also don't worry if there's a crowd either because the guys behind the counter are SO FAST! The way they prepare your food is so amazingly quick! The flavors are also always so full, I never find myself having to add any extra sauces because it's that good! Love it. If you're by the area, come here for sure"}
{"text":"Located at the north end of the strip, this place gets crowded. You get into different lines depending on the type of taco you want to get. It seems the longest line is for their carne asada tacos. Since we there for their el pastor and tongue tacos, the wait was short. I only ate the el pastor taco since I'm not eating beef at the moment. The el pastor was tender but lacked flavor. It looked like Chinese BBQ pork and tasted bland, no flavor at all. Being from LA, I've been spoiled by some of the best tacos anywhere and this didn't come on par with the ones I've had in LA."}
{"text":"This place is always packed with long lines and the crowd & food will tell you why. Just a few blocks away from the strip this place has the best tacos. Authentic Mexican! Worth the wait TRUST"}
{"text":"Super bomb.. some of the best tacos you might ever have .. and there guacamole is on point , there tortillas are real good , home made style and if you're brave enough to try the chile's there real hot but really good .."}
{"text":"Its been too long since I've had Carne Asada and I'm so glad that this place filled that dying need! Flashbacks of roadtrips to TJ/Baja Cali!! Came here during lunch time and place was filled (not one table available and they had plenty). Hey, must be a good sign!

*Ordering Food was Different Here - There were different lines for like different vendors.. Facing the counter - For example: Left side for the chili peppers, Right of that for Carne Asada and  on the Far Right for the Adobada (spicy pork). They have little pails/tip jars on top of the counter that had labels on them that displayed what each station served. Interesting concept..

Carne Asada (steak) tacos: I have been down south numerous times in the past and have had the chance to try some street vendor tacos and this had similarity.. Probably better.. They did serve them on homemade corn tortillas (you can ask for flour if you please) and the typical cilantro, tomato and onions plus guacamole. The steak had its own unique flavor (much different from Robertos), tender and the tortilla just sealed the deal! 

Adobada (spicy pork) tacos: This was a first for me, and won't be the last.. This staton had the longest line for a tasty reason! They shave off the meat from a vertical Rotisserie (like Shawarma), same toppings as the asada except instead of the guac they add this light green sauce. The pork was dark in red in color, super soft, had an unfamiliar yet delicious flavor and the creamy green sauce was the Star of the taco! Another spoonful of the Salsa Verde, Por Favor!  

Yellow & Green Chili peppers and Green Onion Strands: I had a bite of each with just about every bite of the tacos.. Delish!

And Now for the Highlight of the Meal and the Rest of my day - 2 Words: ORANGE BANG!!!!!

I've been searching for this Drink for the last 5 years here in Vegas and the search has finally come to an end! Yeeessss! I grew up drinking this and can't live without it! If you like \"Orange Julius\" orange blend fruit drink then you Should Fall In Love with this whipped, creamy, dreamy orange beverage.. I must of Drank a couple liters of this stuff!!

Dining in, Felt like I was in a clean restaurant in Mexico, Staff were all Extra Friendly, Quick and seemed happy to work there, Food was Excellent (some of the Best tacos I've had here in Vegas), but the tacos do come small so you may want to load up a bit.... Or A Lot!"}
{"text":"These tacos are nasty. I have no idea why people love this place. At 2 dollars a taco, I have a sneaking suspicion that this isn't real steak or guacamole. I must say that it is authentic Mexican down to the owners and workers."}
{"text":"GREAT TACOS !!!!! if  you've never been here, you need to give them a try.  Best freaken tacos around. mmm the mula de adobada is the bomb. i work down the street from this place and wow do they get busy for lunch,  Just wish their drive thru would be in service for a faster in n out... : ) oh yeah and their hours are great, open late pa todos los q andan de party and want to get a bite to eat, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Seriously, all tacos!? Don't come looking for a burrito now... Unless, you speak the lingo and ask for Mulas (which is not burrito, but you get the double wrap)! ^___*

But the service was so so painfully slow! And the fact that you have to line up to different lines to get different meats, it really didn't help my dinner time to be any faster. It was so ridiculous that I timed my waiting in lines... it took 1.5 hrs to get all the orders in and by the time I sat down to eat? The first order of carne asada tacos was stone cold. 

I've had comparable if not better meats in NorCal. I am not risking losing 2 hours of my vacay time in line. So, the next time I am in town, if I am inclined for cheap meats, I will look at the rate of line getting shorter before I jump."}
{"text":"Love the tacos al pastor! The salsas were great, the little tent area out side is very nice on a warm evening. The employees were helpful.  You must get the little grilled onions and the chilis. Classic! Great price for a taco as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing food -must have in Vegas. Get the beef tongue fries for the table and dont forget the complimentary jalapenos and grilled green onions.  Tacos are around 2 bucks. Favorite was the spicy pork. Lines can get long but they are pretty efficient.

Get a minimum of 4 tacos btw if you are not sharing the fries."}
{"text":"Fantastico!
If you are eating outside watch out for security. With I would have ordered more. Mexicano Mexicano :-)"}
{"text":"BOMB ASS TACOS!!!!!!!! i can eat 6 tacos al pastors! just thinking about it makes me drool! (yes, i'm a fatty) buttttttt i always have to come here when i'm in vegas! the meat is perfectly cooked so tender and juicy!! this place also gets packedddd but they have multiple lines! order your tacos first then pay!"}
{"text":"On point!... I always start off with the \"Al Pastor\" (marinated pork) tacos. Then get chorizo and finish off with asada tacos. Don't forget to ask for their grilled onions n peppers. Also ask for a couple tostadas to scrape off d the meat that falls off the tacos. And to wash it all down a large  ice cold Jamaica.
Everything is good from taste, location and price."}
{"text":"Best deal ever.  We stayed at the Wynn...but didn't want to pay Wynn prices for the late night munchies.  This place was crazy busy at 2am.  I ordered 2 carne asada tacos w/ everything.  Came with guacamole, too...for $2 each. They had a bar with radishes.  Only complaint is that I'd love to see a salsa bar.  At $2 a pop, I can't complain. They had plenty of seating outdoors. Super yummy and will be on my must do list from here on out."}
{"text":"Omg.  It was definitely worth the looooong wait..
The tacos are fresh taste great and filling.. I would  highly recommend this spot..ohhh and the fries...are Amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best taco places in LAS VEGAS! I absolutely loved this taco place, it's a must visit. I had tried Tacos El Gordo in San Diego once and thought it was delicious. So when I saw that they had one in Vegas I was so excited. I came here two days in a row and each time I was greeted by friendly food preparers who cut the meat right in front of you.

The first day I came here at around 2am and there was a line that took about 15 minutes. The second day, I came around 5pm and of course the line was much longer and it took about 30 minutes to get my food and there wasn't any seating. 

These tacos are amazing and a must try are the Al Pastor/Adobada tacos. They're at a great price and a whole meal can cost you under $10. It's a perfect place to visit for a late night meal and they're open until 3am. I wish they had one in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Nummmmmmy  a little piece of Mexico in Vegas  go on an empty stomach! The Mulitas al Pastor are the best! Not only are they affordable the cooks are fast!!"}
{"text":"Moving away from California had me longing for good authentic tacos. 9 months had passed and I couldn't find a decent taco spot in Vegas that made killer tacos that were similar to my grandmas. Then one drunken night, my boyfriend decided to take me here after we went clubbing. 
Let's get one thing clear, this place isn't fancy by any means. Nor does it offer great decor BUT what you get here are authentic hand made tortillas, delicious flavorful salsas and quality meats.
I had the Tacos al pastor with everything and added pineapple and practically swallowed them. I've been here a few times ever since and each time I've gone there's been a wait time of at least 15-20 mins to order food. The 3 separate lines make it pretty difficult to maneuver around when you have a tray full of food but it's nothing that's too bad or out of the ordinary.  Definitely my favorite spot for tacos and horchata!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. But also very crowded especially late at night after the clubs start to clear. I ordered the adobada tacos which was their version of all pastor. It was very tasty and filled with meat. A pretty good deal for two bucks per taco. I didn't have a chance to try any of their other meats because of the way their lines are set up but I don't know if I need to get anything other than the adobada. Not the best tacos ever but they are very very good."}
{"text":"I've never had street tacos in Mexico but I'm pretty sure they are as good as this. It's quick and fast. You get amazing quality at a great price. Perfect for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I come to Vegas twice a year and have never been disappointed by this taco place. Be ready for a line but it moves quickly. Try one of everything because there is nothing bad on the menu. The food is always fresh and hot. And they are reasonable priced."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!  I HAVE FOUND MY PLACE!!!!  I've been living in Vegas for a little over 2 years and have been highly disappointed in the taco joints. This Chicago girl needs her fix and I was literally just waiting until I went back to Chicago....until this week. 

A co-worker suggested this place to me and even brought me back a steak taco earlier in the week. Well, today my daughter and I went for lunch and even she gave her seal of approval. 

Now, it's a bit of a drive from Summerlin (can we get one out here, please and thank you), but I'm willing to make the drive!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just so damn good. Just as good as the San Diego location. I can't even begin to describe how good this place is. By the way the Tacos de Tripa are way delicious."}
{"text":"Overrated by far. If people say these are the best tacos in Vegas then they are sadly eating at the wrong place. They say they are as good as Mexico but I lived just about 30 mins away from Mexico and ate there all the time an I must say they are nothing close to it."}
{"text":"YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK GOIN ON BRUH.. Da Boi back in this hoe like I'm smashin my ex. These tacos go crazy blood. I wish a bitch would tell me these tacos are nasty so I can knock the teeth out their mouth cause they some hatin ass hoes."}
{"text":"Ok, so here's the straight dirt- I'm from San Diego and I've tried my fair share of tacos. We have more Mexican food restaurants/food trucks/dives/kitchens than you can shake a stick at. Having said that, Tacos El Gordo is fantastic. 18 items on the menu- and they are all delicious. I personally had the lengua (tongue) and it is soooo tender. The cabeza (head) is outstanding, adobada is off the charts ( this must be one of your choices) and the El Pastor, also very good. I cant forget the quelsedillas. In a word, heavenly.
It's chaotic and loud and you may have to wait, but in my experience, those are ALWAYS the best places. If tacos are what you are looking for (shoot, even if tacos aren't what you're looking for) make your way down here."}
{"text":"Amazing carne asada fries! These are definitely the best carne asada fries I have ever had. There is a large selection of different tacos to pick from here and the service is super fast. My boyfriend and I found this little treasure when we were visiting Vegas with his family and everyone enjoyed it. 

I remember that it was scorching hot that day so I got a popsicle from the little mini freezer and it was so perfect! Definitely come visit this place on your next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"The place is the happening place for try best tacos in town!  The al pastor tacos are the best!  They have beef heads, beef to tongues if you are into that.  
This place is very busy so expect to wait for a good 10 minutes due to the long line.  Be aware not all lines are for three food you want, so q up based on the tacos you want.  There are three lines."}
{"text":"It's hard to find the best tacos de tripa in Las Vegas, I can never find good tacos but ever since I discovered this place I don't have to wait to go to Mexico to eat tacos. I have the tacos right here in town they are freshly cooked, served, and the variety is just breathtaking. This is the best in Las Vegas, on a scale of 1 to 10 a 9. If you want tacos or delicious carne asada fries this is the only place in town where you won't be disappointed, you must try it!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever gone to a place for Dinner, went to do other stuff and then come back to the same place for Second Dinner. That's how good these tacos are.  

We had abodaba, tongue, and shoulder (over the course of our two visits) all with everything.  The adodaba comes with pineapple and somehow that makes it even better!  

The line was longer at 9pm, but it still moved rather quickly.  Do note there are several  lines each making a couple kinds of tacos, not just one line and you can get fries at any of those. 

Super delicious.  Totally affordable. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhh. Everyone always say how this place is the best for tacos but I'd argue that. 
1 - their expensive!  2.00 per taco and their tiny tacos with rarely any meat on them. 
2 - you don't get to choose your salsa. 
3 - tacos de asada are awful.  Meat is dry, super thin, it's like their using palomia meat instead of the appropriate ranchera meat

The other tacos are good but in my opinion over priced."}
{"text":"Wait a sec.....didn't they MOVE?! My daughter INSIST we go here EVERYTIME she comes into town, matter of fact as SOON as her plane lands! Sooo...We go there, XMAS eve, 11 am, and it was totally closed down!! An employee next door at the gift shop happened outside and told us that they'd move because the rent went up!! I was like REALLY a, as many freaking tacos etc, that they were selling all day and every night?!?! Unbelievable!
She and I both were totally dissappointed!! They'd moved according to the lady on Charleston and Bruce. So of course...OFF WE WENT!!! 
That's another review tho....
I'm still confused becus Im looking at recent reviews for THIS location...somebody tell me...WTH  is UP?!?

OKOKOK...nevermind!! Once I posted THIS Yelp revealed the new location on Losee Rd!! YIPPEEE...that's way closer to home!!
Lemme go back and add 5 stars!! 
Just ONE complaint.....WHY! Won't somebody give its customers a better flow to buy these yummy tacos?!? First of all, I can't read Spanish...and mainly, WHY SO MANY DANG LINES?!?!? That's just crazy, going to different lines for different items is freakin ludicris!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the busiest taco restaurant I've been too.  When you walk in you will probably get overwhelmed and walk right out. If you never been here before I recommend coming here with at least a few people. They have 3 lines. All lines serve different kind of tacos. Lines move fairly quickly but you can wait up to 30 minutes. But I promise you its definitely  worth it. I'm not a huge fan of the carne asada. It has too much of a smokey flavor in my opition. My favorite is the tongue and Al Pastor!"}
{"text":"Der Hype bleibt m.M. unverständlich und das Warten ist die Zeit nicht wert. Die Tacos waren pappig, fad, geschmacklos und labbrig. Der Maisfladen war immer vollgesogen mit Fett und Sud, den man wie einen Schwamm ausdrücken konnte.
Beim Bestellen sollte man wissen, in welche Schlange man sich stellt. Links gibt's Gegrilltes wie Steak, Chorizo etc. Mitte Gekochtes. Rechts Würziges Schweinefleisch vom Spieß. Abhängig davon was man bestellt, gibt es als Soße entweder Guacamole, Salsa oder grüne Salsa. Als Beilage gibt es immer Zwiebeln, Tomaten und Koriander.
Beim ersten Besuch sollte die Wartezeit 2 Stunden betragen. Da die Schlange quer durch den Laden führte, entschied ich mich am nächsten Tag wiederzukommen. Musste ja genial sein, dass die Leute bereit sind so lange zu warten. Obwohl der Laden um 9 öffnete, musste ich über 30 Minuten warten bis ich das Taco mit Steak bekam. Die Chorizos waren nach 10 Uhr nicht mal fertig. Es war rein gar nichts fertig!!! Also ging es erst an die mittlere Bestelltheke. Die dort servierten Tacos schmeckten nach nichts. Alles zerkocht und ungewürzt. Auf den Spieß rechts hatte ich am Ende keine Lust mehr, weil ich meinen Vormittag nicht damit verbringen wollte auf Tacos zu warten, die nicht mal wirklich nach was schmeckten. 
Das Bestellsystem ist mehr als optimierungsbedürftig, da das, was ich sehen durfte sowas von ineffektiv war, ja fast idiotisch. Jeder Koch nimmt gleichzeitig die Bestellung auf und serviert. Wie soll man bei drei Bestelltheken mit unterschiedlicher Nachfrage gleichzeitig essen? Die einzige Möglichkeit gemeinsam und alles zu essen ist wenn Laden leer ist. Alles andere ist utopisch. Und dann mit dem vollen Tablett zur Kasse, die sich dann auch beim Eingang befindet. So stolpert der bezahlende den reinkommenden über die Füße und tritt den wartenden auf die Zehen. Was ein Chaos! 
Nein Danke! Ein Mal und nie wieder!!"}
{"text":"Spicy pork tacos were out of this world. Very authentic! Super packed but so worth it. Grabbing a few more of these before I head home"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, their drink machine is unlike anything else you'll find in vegas too"}
{"text":"Beef brain, Beef tongue, and so many other delicious options.  Your best bet is going with a few buddies.  If you go alone and want multiple types of meat you will have to wait on different lines.  Bring a buddy and split up ;).  Try new things at Tacos El Gordo!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos this side of the Rio Grande (and the Sea of Cortez too). So freaking good. Get as many Adobado de Trompo tacos as you think you can eat, then add a few of the other flavors for good measure. And get the grilled onions. BYOB but security will give you a bag to be compliant even if you forget one. Great patio now too"}
{"text":"This is the standard for which Tacos are judged.

I ate 9. I'd eat 9 more if I physically could."}
{"text":"The place is a little dirty the employees are very rude but the food is decent the Pastore tacos are really good"}
{"text":"Honestly, BEST TACO PLACE EVER! You have to get the El Pastor! It is so delicious! 

I ordered two tacos, the el pastor and the asada. The asada was just okay, not bad, but the el pastor was so great that I ended up getting 5 more el pastors to go because they were so delicious! Highly highly recommend the el pastor at Tacos El Gordo. 

They have lots of tables and chairs inside and outside but it does get super crowded. There is parking in front of the restaurant as well. At Tacos El Gordo, you order your food at the counters, there are counters for each kind of meat that you want. Then you go to the cash register and pay. Sit wherever you want. Great place to come! Just come you know you want to!"}
{"text":"I love tacos else gordo so much I had to go twice in one weekend lol. This was the second location we went to (the first one we went to is near Wynn). This place was definitely less crowded which was a plus! The downside is that there are two separate lines for al pastor & carne asada. We only waited in the carne asada line but we ordered a al pastor quesadilla which they helped us get instead of making us wait again in the other line (how nice of them!)

The al pastor quesadilla was AMAZING. It was an open face quesadilla and the cheese was grilled onto the tortilla, leaving a crispy crunchy cheese layer and they then put the juicy al pastor on top. I was in heaven. Next time I'm definitely getting this !!! I already think the tacos are awesome but this was on a whole other level! 

We also got the carne asada tacos, always delicious! 

Definitely must come by and it's close to freemont too! :)"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest taco fan in the world, but this place blew me away! 

We came on a Friday around midnight and the line was a little long but it moved relatively quickly. We waited maybe 30 minutes.
I love this place because everything is so fresh! They make the tortillas in front of you and grill the meat and chop it as you order. Doesn't get more authentic than this! The tacos were seriously the best tacos I've ever had. We got al pastor & the beef tacos, both were amazing!!!!!! They are not stingy on the meat portions at all, and they also top it off with some amazing guac & other sauces. Each taco was well worth the $2 dollars. They were so flavorful and fresh. They also give you refills on your drinks so we got some horchata which paired perfect with the tacos. Was super refreshing.

I plan on coming every time I'm in Vegas!!!! 
They also have a location in Chula Vista, SD (the original one!) but this one is definitely just as good and authentic."}
{"text":"Okay so this place is on the run down north end of the strip between the Rivier and the Encore but oh is the food wonderful.  I am a big fan of authentic mexican tacos made from the cuts of meat you do not get everywhere.  The sudero and cabeza tacos were fantastic.  The meat was good even with the little bits of fat.  The campenchana fries were also well worth the money.  You can find fancier americanized mexican food in Las Vegas but this is the real deal.   Tacos run about the $2 a piece and the meat covered fries run about $10 for a large order.   It gets busy in this place but there is a reason for that.  I cannot wait to go back on my next trip."}
{"text":"For all my Mexican homies, one word: BOMB! Only bad thing, no booze sold here! But, you can bring your own! Lovely thing about Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 30 tacos tacos for take out... when I asked for sauce the lady at the register gave me 3 red and 3 green sauce. I asked for more and she said no. Are you kidding?!?!? There apparently is a limit of only 3 sauce per person regardless of how much you order. What a joke."}
{"text":"I love this place! In this touristy (read fake) town this is as local as you want for great tacos and good prices! I ordered many tacos ($2 ea/ avg) and was full, but not broke! Carne Asasda, puerco adobada, you name it's authentic! Excellent food!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego. Tacos El Gordo is from San Diego... In 2012, I lived near Texas, and surprisingly, Mexican food is not as good there. It's so ironic that American Mexican food is called Tex-Mex, yet it wasn't great. Moved here in 2013, and my friend brought me to Don Tortaco. I was drunk but that is the most horrible Tex-Mex food I've had. Heard about Tacos el Gordo has one here in Vegas. Went here one drunken night, and I was so happy. This is the kind of Mexican food that I like. 

The small tacos are good, but what sold me is the carne asada fries. So yummy!
I hate to admit that it's now on the same level as carne asada fries in Sarita's in San Diego. They're a bit different than carne asada fries in SD, but it's nonetheless delicious! I would go back here again just for the CARNE ASADA FRIES.

My boyfriend decided to try the TACO DE CABEZA (beef head). It was good. Better than Taco de Asada. Get that one!"}
{"text":"Got the chance to visit Vegas twice this year and have probably ate here for 5 of our meals. The line is always out the door each time but service moves fast. Tacos and mulas are so good, our last visit we tried the Asada fries and those were great too! Prices are very reasonable, esp for Vegas. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican street taco experience - I like the carne asada, chicken, adobada, and cabeza"}
{"text":"Came here the last day of my stay in Vegas.   It was good. Food gets 4 stars but the service wasn't that great. Really bad attitude from the carne asada line. The guy gave us a hard time with our food. This was Wednesday april 4 2018 around 10ish a.m.. But yes I would come again"}
{"text":"We loved the authentic food. Fast. Clean. Hospitable."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos you will ever encounter. Definitely get the Adobada -- slow roasted pork on a spit, seasoned with chili and pineapple. It's amazing on tacos, even better on fries. Have tried all of their more accessible meats (carnitas, chorizo, etc) and they are all top notch. Be sure to get the tacos with everything, as the aguacate salsa they use is amazing."}
{"text":"Went by here twice.  Both times I tried the steak and pork tacos.  These were very fresh, and tasted pretty good.  For $2 a piece, it's hard to go wrong with these.  Definitely worth a try.  There's always a line."}
{"text":"Best place on the strip to eat quality food when you're down on your luck. I've been to the ones in TJ and California (Temecula), and I would go as far as saying this is probably the cleanest one I've ate at. 

Unlike the other Las Vegas locations, this one was not as crowded by locals. Maybe the tourists don't know or prejudge Tijuana style al pastor tacos. Oh well, fuck 'em. Take my advice or keep driving, it doesn't matter to me."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I've had. Figuring out the system took me a few minutes. If you're hungry go!"}
{"text":"Still looking for better tacos in Las Vegas.  There's some that come a close second but this is the 1.  Always a long line but if you walk to the right and want to try some different type of meats other than al pastor or steak you can get served right away (major key!) the Mulitas are great think quesadilla but made with a doughy hand made tortilla. Just writing this is making me hungry"}
{"text":"I found myself walking by this place late at night on the way back to my hotel and decided to give it a shot.

Simply delicious.  Great place for a casual meal while in Vegas.

Only very minor drawback is that the seating area is a bit on the warm side (it's July), but the tacos were so good I scarfed them in just a few minutes anyway."}
{"text":"Got a taco craving? Get yourself to Tacos El Gordo. Apparently there's a location on Charleston if you don't' want to go on the Sttrip, but this is the one I went to. You walk in and see the meat behind the counter, place your order and watch as it is made, then take your tray up to the cashier to pay. It doesn't get fresher than this.

The lengua is amazing. I don't care how you feel about eating another animal's tongue, it's delicious- especially here, and particularly in the fries. Lengua quesadilla is also tasty, but the bottom tortilla is flour and the top is a tostada... so it's a little odd. Eat it anyway.

Best tacos were the spicy pork and the beef shoulder, honorable mention to the super-crispy tripas. Ordered all as-is with the salsas and sauces. These people know what they're doing.

Now for the lengua fries- a half order will run you $6, pricey for fries. But worth it. It's a giant portion of salty, crispy fries, topped with a healthy (NOT!) portion of lengua meat, sour cream, guac, and cheese. It sounds revolting but it's amazing, and it doesn't taste as heavy as it sounds, either- which is a bad thing because I could put away a lot of this dish.

Side note: apparently if you order the \"half order\" and tip the guy, you end up with a wink and a full order. Oops."}
{"text":"Couldn't even get in the door @ 2pm on a Sunday! Air conditioning was non-existent for those waiting in line in 113 degree heat."}
{"text":"OmG! Long lines! But wait theres more! Probably the best tacos ever. About $2.50 a taco. It is really good. Prepare for a line. Worth the wait. Long lines for a reason. Try the cactus and dont forget the lines"}
{"text":"Everything you've heard is true. Go, and go now. This one is also way less crowded than the Strip location, so it's worth the Uber/cab fare."}
{"text":"Second time here food is delicious, there's a wait but it's worth it. Everything if fresh. This place is really clean, even the AC vents!!! Great job team!!! Keep up the AMAZING WORK"}
{"text":"This is the best Taqueria ever!  The food is excellent!  I will always make sure I get to this place every trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"this is probably the best mexican in Vegas. It was amazing and really authentic... seriously good late night grub"}
{"text":"Fabulous food for those going from the sublime (Encore by Wynn across the street) to the local and not ridiculous. Very serious taco lovers only.  No new age veggie or chicken; the quesadilla de lengua (tongue) is specialty.  We loved sopa de chorizo b/c the mamasita is making fresh corn sopas as you watch. Fresh. Delicious. Satisfaction guaranteed."}
{"text":"Been here many many times every body I have ever brought has loved it here and they have came back best tacos and I'm Mexican so I should Lol"}
{"text":"I saw this place off the road a few times and had to try it. Great food.  Little confusing to order.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not too crowded on a Wednesday night, but wasn't too impressed with the carne asada here. It looks like it has potential as the guy was chopping and dicing right in front of you before he assembles your small tacos for $2. Did not expect guac on the tacos, but it was there in a dominating fashion over the meat. The meat itself was good in two of the three tacos, but number three took a dive and was unedible. The meat was undercooked, fatty and chewy all at the same time. All the other meats at this place belong on Bizzarre foods and the carne asada looks like it is very hit and miss."}
{"text":"Bomb ass tacos, love the al pastor tacos omg. The only thing I don't liked are the long lines and how you have to make line for every different meet you want on your tacos. Everything else was good"}
{"text":"The Tacos El Gordo in San Diego do not have vampiros so love this place for that. Don't forget to order your nopales asados with all the fixings."}
{"text":"Honestly, it was my first time coming to Tacos El Gordo and when I walked inside I got overwhelmed quick. The lines were so long until I realized that the way the ordering system was set up is brilliant. They separate the lines by the type of meat you want on your tacos. Perfect! I didn't want asada tacos which was the longest line. I wanted to have the lengua (cow tongue) tacos I just had to have them. I was saved from one of the employees who was super friendly to go to the other line were they also have lengua tacos. 

The wait was worth it! The meat was fresh and served when you order it just how you want it. It's a simple place that gets it and I like that. When you are done ordering you head over to the cashier and you pay there for your food and drink (if you get one). I loved that they had the lime and radish for you to get as much as you wanted. The tacos are priced at $2 a taco and I found it to be a good deal. 

Will I go back? Most definitely its a must!"}
{"text":"Al Pastor was freakin' amazing. Crazy good food and decent prices."}
{"text":"I thought my friends hyped this place up too much for me.
I've been there once, line was huge, price was ehh. I'd go again if i was in that general area.

My taco was good though."}
{"text":"Had the best tacos and fries at this place. 
Their al pastor is delicious. The meat were stacked on a stick and cooked slowly on fire. 
The langua tacos and fries were amazing. The langua were so soft and juicy. 
And the price was decent for the quality of food. 
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The best tacos in town!!! If I'm in Las Vegas and craving for Tacos. This place is a must..."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better tacos in the valley. Staff was friendly and helpful, always busy, and helped direct to what you would actually like to eat. Will definitely be returning there. Has great prices!

I've had some good mexican food, this is a top 5 taco place for me."}
{"text":"WOW...These are the best tacos I have ever eaten! I ordered only 4 of the Carne Asada  tacos thinking I'd leave room for desserts on the Strip. But the hell with that! They were sooooo good and PICA, I had to go back for more! 

If you are anywhere near Vegas ...you just have to stop here."}
{"text":"This is as close to real mexican food as ive ever had and its awesome. Got to be good with a line out the door even at 2am.  I take everyone that comes to visit.

Take someone that speaks spanish with you the first time,  no one working the line understands english so youll need help or feel dumb.   

Ive only had one bad experience there,  the AC broke and they closed down early so I had to drive over to the one on Charleston,  was worth it."}
{"text":"Living in L.A all my life, they up their prices cause there authentic.* NEWS FLASH, ..Plenty of authentic places with way more reasonable prices.  $14 for asada fries really, and lines are unorganized and always that one person that just cuts to the front, expect a 40 min. Line for your tacos (Sun.). All in all .. good food but nothing we don't already have."}
{"text":"Why have I waited so long to try this place. K.O. convinced me to come in to this place for a small snack in between meals.  I am glad she did.

The parking lot sucks to get to and is jam packed.

There are separate lines here depending on which meat you want to eat.  Look for the signs at the front of the line.  When we came in the whole inside of this place was packed.  It was very confusing for me in the beginning, but K.O. helped me navigate through the madness.

We stood in the Adobado line and got us 2 tacos and 1 mula to share.  Remember to ask for hot sauce when you get your food.

Adobado Taco - the meat was cooked well and on a spit. When you see meat on a spit you know its going to be cooked well, charred slightly on the outside and moist in the inside.  All the trimmings were delicious and that green sauce was really creamy and helped elevate the flavors.

Adobado Mula - First time trying it and its basically 2 tortillas with meat, cheese, and other things inside.  This was delicious and wish I had found out about this sooner.

After you get your food, you have to find the cashier line and pay. When we were here the horchata tasted really watered down and not good. The orange bang on the other hand was delicious.

Seating may be hard to find, but we found one outside fairly easily.

The place could be a little cleaner and less hectic.  The inside is crammed with ppl and hard to get refills on drinks.

I would definitely come here again but maybe one of their other locations."}
{"text":"Best Al Pastor tacos in Vegas! The carne asada are good too, but AP are my absolute favorite, especially with some lime squeezed on top! Mmmmmhm! Just the thought of them makes me hungry even if I'm full!"}
{"text":"This food is phenomenal. The lines are insane, so make sure you give yourself enough time when you plan to go here. Seating inside is limited, but the food is well worth the wait. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is a late-night-drunk-eats kind of venue, located very conveniently in a strip mall near the Strip. Sorry Vegas people, but this place doesn't stand a chance against LA Mexican food.
The carne asada fries were mediocre at best -- really bland. Had to go and ask for more sauce but it didn't help much. The adobado taco was actually pretty good.
I must hand it to the guys that run the place though. The restaurant is seriously a well-oiled machine. Runs super efficiently and the place is actually clean."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best street style tacos around. Family friendly place with indoor seating. No alcohol served though..."}
{"text":"El Gordo is the famous taqueria from San Diego and I am so glad they opened in Vegas. By far the best taqueria chain ever! 

Everything about the tacos is fresh! Even down to the corn tortilla. 

First you stand in line for different types of tacos. One line is for Adobada El Pastor (marinated pork on a trompo), Asada (Steak), Lengua, etc. I love that they only cut the meat where you order which makes the meat that much juicier and tender. 

I got the adobada al pastor and asada and they were just too good. I could describe it but you just have to eat them for yourself. My friends only ordered two because it was late night, but after eating them, they went for two more. LOL.
When you order adobada al pastor, make sure you ask for pineapples because it doesn't come by default. And pineapples make a big difference. And get the grilled jalapenos and green onions. 

They usually have long lines but totally worth it. 

I wish these guys would come up to Seattle. They would kill it here."}
{"text":"Although the tacos I had were good enough, and on par with other taco shops in the area, I was a bit underwhelmed relative to all the hype I've heard surrounding this taco shop. Having carne asada without the char that comes from brazing is like having elote that hasn't been roasted in its husk on a charcoal grill. It's just not authentic that way. The tripas were not fresh out of the frier, (room temp) and imho they should be served fresh out of the kettle; piping hot and still juicy. On the plus side;
From the griddle they have roasted green onions and chile peppers; if ordering peppers, specify green or yellow and how many of each; from the self-serve table they have fresh radish and limes. Buen apetito!"}
{"text":"No sirben aparte que son 3 lineas pa ordenar diferentes cosas tardan mucho y al momento que te formas en otra linea pa pagar los tacos terminan frios yo bengo de california y me llevo la peor experiencia de todas las taquerias en las que e comido"}
{"text":"Holy Sh%#....these guys literally bring the taste of the Mexican border and for the price you just can't go wrong..don't get scared the lines look insane but just like in Mexico...they move really fast... wow WOW WOW"}
{"text":"Most popular location just north of the Encore casino. Weekends nights will have lines out the door so prepare to wait 30min or longer. 

One thing I've noticed is that Adobada and Al Pastor is the same thing. Everything here leans towards the saltier side and Asada didn't have flavor either. 

Maybe we came here on a off night, but for the value and location you can't beat El Gordo. But if you have a car go off strip and try other taco shops. 

They do hand roll their tortillas."}
{"text":"4 stars because it gets packed as fuck and the tortillas are AIGGGGGGHT. I think it's ridiculous that it's 4 different lines for different meats but whateva"}
{"text":"While working in Vegas on the strip, I asked some locals where I should go to get some good \"real\" tacos. 3 different guys said Tacos El Gordo. So, I had to try it. I as on the opposite side of the strip, so I called for a ride share. My driver also recommended it, after seeing that I was headed there. So, this place had a lot to look up to. I am happy to say that it did! I was a little taken back when I walked into the building, but quickly figured out how to order food. You figure out what taco meat you want, then goto the area that happens to prepare that meat. After collecting all the tacos you want, you then go to the register and pay. It wasn't that crowded when I went in there at 8pm, but I could see how this structure could move people through the lines at a faster pace than a standard 1 counter set up.
What I really like bout the place, is the selection of meats. I got a cabeza (beef head), lengua (beef tongue), and Tripa (beef guts) Tacos. They were very, very tasty! At $2.25+ a taco, the price is a little high, but being on the strip, it's still a lot lower than most restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"From the reviews, I was expecting better. I tried the asada and pastor tacos and the meat was good, not the best in Vegas by any means, but standing in the different lines for different meats and then standing in yet another line to pay is a real pain. I would think they could simplify the system and probably save some money on all of the duplicated labor.

I ordered multiple tacos with everything, but they were inconsistent: All three asada tacos had meat, but only one had guac, two had cilantro and onions and only one tasted like it had any salsa. I went to look for some salsa, but only found limes and radishes. A tad disappointing."}
{"text":"My friends and I found this place by accident while we were walking by to go to Walgreens from Encore hotel. Looked kinda sketchy from the outside but after we saw the 4 star rating on yelp we were convinced. And boy was I glad that yelp convinced me to walk in. Tacos are always a great idea. 

I almost cried the 2nd time I tried to go around 3 a.m. and it was closed. It said it was still open on the door but they weren't letting anyone in anymore. 

YOU HAVE TO GET THE ADOBADA!! There's a reason why I wrote it in all caps. It's that good. Seriously you won't regret it. I swear on my life. It's flavorful and super tender and juicy. That's why all the people are lined up to get the Adobada. 

Tip, the long line is just for the adobada. If you are ordering something else you don't have to wait in that line."}
{"text":"I have been wanting authentic Mexican tacos since my trip to Mexico and this place was well worth the 45 min wait to get them. I had steak tacos fully dressed. It's a little confusing when you go in because there are lines for what you want written in Spanish. I was in the right line by chance  because I don't eat pork and google translate was no help. The line moves but not fast. When I arrived the line was out the door but don't let this stop you from going or waiting these were delicious and I am contemplating going back again before I leave Vegas."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why people rave about this place. First time I came here I had high hopes it was going to be as good as people have said, I was wrong, I've gotten better tasting tacos from food trucks, the meat had too much fat and the guacamole was disgusting, tacos had no flavor whatsoever, I tried really hard to eat them but I just couldn't, I wanted to gag, ended up throwing them away and eating at McDonalds, total waste of money and food, very disappointing! Their competitors next door \"Los Tacos\" are better in my opinion but to each their own!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I have even eaten! It is off the strip but not to far of a walk from our hotel which was Treasure Island, staff was friendly and the food came out super quick.  The only downfall is that there is not a lot of seating available so if you go at a super busy time you will be eating standing up."}
{"text":"Usually after a night of clubbing in Vegas, I get major drunchies and go looking for food. I've always gotten steak n eggs or pho but when I heard about this place, I was super excited to try! 

The first time I tried their tacos was actually 2 months ago. I, unfortunately, wasn't sober enough to eat the tacos at the restaurant (I was basically passed out at the table lol) but my friend was nice enough to buy me 3 al pastor tacos and take it togo so I could eat it in the morning. I was super surprised but these tacos were still so good the morning after even after reheating them!! I remember thinking to myself, if these tacos taste this good even after a couple hours, how good must they taste when eaten fresh?!? 

So when I came back to Vegas this past weekend, I was determined to be sober enough to try these tacos FRESH. AND YES I WAS SUCCESSFUL! My friend and I went around 4am and the line didn't take too long, maybe around 15 minutes total (to get the tacos and then pay for them at the cashier). Although we knew these tacos were a little bigger than the usual street tacos, we still got 4 al pastor tacos each and devoured them. (Never underestimate the power of drunchies!!) The meat was so flavorful and the sauces were sooo good. Just thinking about them is making my mouth water lol I'll definitely be back to try the other meats!"}
{"text":"In the town of overpriced bland food, this place breaks both molds.  All the reviews for ABODABO are for good reason.  Watch the guy shave it off with a machete as juices drip off the pole-o-meat.  I also got a lengua taco and an asada taco... Both solid a d tasty. The salsas remind me of homemade salsas I've had from old Mexican women... Fresh and full of flavor.  And the tortillas are made right in front of you.  Just go already!"}
{"text":"Good good good! Pork tacos on point! carne asada fries bomb! Could be just a tad cheaper but really worth it because you can taste the quality yum."}
{"text":"The Asada Taco has a line all by itself - that's how popular and delicious it is.

Be patient as it can get crowded - but it is well worth the wait.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There's a rumor that you can ONLY get legit Mexican food closer to San Diego or ONLY in Mexico. Tacos El Gordo puts this rumor six feet under with it's authentic Mexican flavor and great customer appreciation! Advertised as coming straight from Tijuana, it's no wonder that Tacos El Gordo or \"The Fat Taco\" in English, is a taco above the rest!

Upon walking in, the amorous fragrance of the spices grab your nose and the various meats cooking make your mouth water like an infant drooling! Yes, it's just like that! My favorite spectacle of the restaurant is the BBQ spit that holds the fresh al pastor meat (marinated spicy pork)! I suggest the al pastor mula with everything (cilantro, onions, salsa, and avocado salsa) and suadero (marinated beef) tacos with everything! Make sure you don't forget the FREE grilled peppers and green onions at the end of the ordering line :)

Grab your limes, pay, and ask the cashier if you'd like some salsa. If you choose to get a fountain drink, I suggest getting a cup full of some refreshing orange bang (whipped orange drink that tastes like an orange creamsicle) and brace yourself for some filling, satisfying, flavor packed, and the most authentic Mexican grub this side of the border! Writing this review triggered my craving so I'm actually on my way to fulfill myself!

You're welcome :)"}
{"text":"Their taco's are great. Ate here by chance going to Zion National Park. Pretty much tried most of their taco's. Made it a point to stop by again on our way back to LA. I had some to go as well."}
{"text":"tacos al pastor are the best!!!! make sure you ask for pineapple and the tiny tostadas"}
{"text":"Ok, here's the deal. Back in Hawaii we have no great Mexican Food at all despite the fact that they say authentic. I'm no Mexican Food Expert but as the saying goes if you know that a Japanese Restaurant is good, you'll see Japanese people eating there. and if go to a Chinese Restaurant and you see Chinese people eating there, I can be rest assured that the food should be good as well.

 Well after walking into Tacos El Gordo, which is only walking distance from The Encore where I was staying, let's just say that when I looked at all the Mexican Workers preparing the food for you, I knew I was I. For a treat. And what cemented that fact was that there were 90 percent Mexicans eating there too.

 As for the food, after reading some reviews, I heard the Adobado Tacos were the one to get so I got two. I had them put everything on it and let's just say these were one of the best Tacos I have ever eaten. Make sure you ask for the Chiles that they cook behind the counter as well.

 I also had a half order of the Carne Asada Fries. Warning even a half order of these fries are enough for four people. Once again, they were delicious but I could barely put a dent in it.

 I also had the Carne Asada Taco, but the Adobado was way better if you ask me. If you are looking for Salsa, just ask the cashier who has it behind the cash register.

 If you are looking for Chicken and Beef Tongue as well, they have it here as well.

 I just love the atmosphere at these type of places. It was 1:00 in the morning and this place was hopping. 

 If you are ever in Vegas, this is one place you have to try if you have a hankering for delicious Mexican Fare..."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever eaten...OMG they hand make everything the meat is fresh and flavorful. It's not like any other Mexican restaurant I've been too.. Hands down the best sadly they don't have one in my area only in Vegas. So sad.. Must come again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! You can never go wrong here!!! Order the Mulas with flower tortillas and Al Pastor."}
{"text":"A must when in Vegas.

Bomb.  Tacos.

Al pastor and chorizo are my favorites.  

It's ridiculous that they have different lines for different kind of meats so be prepared to go with a group that can line up in the different lines and some that can scope out tables."}
{"text":"After a late night of dancing at XS we came here to sober up.

Had 3 al pastor tacos and they were bomb!!  

They have different lines for the different meats, which is annoying, since I originally wanted 1 chorizo and 3 al pastor, but other than that, the food is delish and cheap!

5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"The tacos de asada were bomb! The guy preparing them was super fast and funny and got the line moving fast. Would definitely recommend. Love to come back and try the tacos de lengua as well. Great snack on the strip while shopping!"}
{"text":"Ultimate Addiction! 

If you want street tacos, this is the best place to find them! The spicy pork tacos, are heaven. I normally order the mula version, which cost $4. It's the best bang for your buck. This is a great place open 247 on the strip if you are starting or finishing partying for the night."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordon is one of the small dive taco restaurants sprinkled throughout Las Vegas. If you want something that is both authentic and delicious, this is the place for you. Carne asada fries, carne asada tacos, adobada tacos, & al pastor tacos, are all outstanding. All of the ingredients are really fresh and simple. The separate lines to pickup the food move fast so bring friends with you to order the different items."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely pretty good.  I don't know if it's the best tacos, but pretty good.  Everything is a little on the expensive side though.  C'mon, $2.25 for little tacos??  These little things should be a buck each!!!  Or less!  And $13 for asada fries???

The biggest complaint I have about this place (and I would give them zero stars for this if I could) is the ridiculous way they run it!!  As stated, there are 3 lines depending on what kind of meat you want.  And they each line has only ONE person working it!!!  You read that right.  ONE freakin' person to work a line that sometimes has as many 50 people in it!!!  Well, no wonder the damn lines are so long!!  ONE person to take your order, cook your food, and prepare your food!!  I'm surprised he doesn't take your money too!!  Absolutely ridiculous!!  I don't know which genius came up with this stupid idea.  You would think with all the money they're making, they could afford to hire a few more people to help them out.  I'm not kidding......we were in line for almost 2 hours!!!  If you drive by and see a long line, do yourself a favor and and don't waste your time and go somewhere else!!!  Unless you want to wait in line for at least an hour!  There's a Taco Mexican right down the street, which is also pretty damn good!!  

I'm never coming back here again, unless there's a short or no line at all.  What a waste of time!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  

Simply the best Taco adventure you can have in LV.  

Open your mind and tastebuds, you MUST try the lengua, seasons, suadero and buche tacos - nevermind what part the meat is from, just think of how tender, tasty and truly wonderful it is!  

The traditional and popular al pastor, asada etc. are awesome too - however living on the wild side is best here!"}
{"text":"After a 5 hour drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas my boyfriend and I stopped at Tacos El Gordo for take out dinner back to our hotel. We ordered 14 ADOBADA tacos for both (we were really hungry). The tacos were great. We had them with the green sauce (guacamole?) and pineapple. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Al Pastor in town. Don't be cheap! Tip your tacotender. Make sure to visit on a weekday before 10pm or you'll be waiting outside to get in."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!  You can't ever go wrong with this place!!!  Whether it's a late night snack or a lunch, you always leave satisfied with a happy tummy.  The lines are a bit confusing as there are three separate ones depending on what you're ordering.  The spicy pork and the asada are the obvious staples although they offer tongue and other stranger meats I don't have the balls to try.  So staples it is!  The tacos are the perfect size and usually 2-3 at 2 bucks a pop will do the trick.  I recommend getting into the shorter line of the two since you can still place one order. To receive both.  They have a nice selection or horchata and plenty of seating inside and out.  The locals obviously love the place as well and I constantly see construction workers pick up huge orders for their crews.  If you're staying at the Wynn or the encore, there is NO excuse not to try this place!"}
{"text":"We walked by this place a couple times.  Always smelled delicious and was obviously popular based on there always being costumers at all times of day and night.  So we decided to give it a try for a cheap dinner.  Glad we did!

To order, you walk up to the counter.  Read the signs because each section is for certain types of meat.  First time thru we ordered tacos de asada...the guy who prepared them was friendly and fast!   They were so yummy that we went back for more and decided to try the al pastor and the chorizo.  Delicious! 

With sodas and 3 tacos each, we paid about $15.  Really good deal for really good street tacos!  We'll eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"Its expensive and the tacos are greasy! If you are looking for authentic tacos, this is it! It tastes exactly like the tacos they make in Tijuana Mexico. The meat is juicy and the al pastor had a sweet and savory flavor profile that makes me want more!!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS packed but absolutely worth it. Every tacos there is delicious. You can't go wrong with anything. It will take a long time to get food so do not try to stop in quick to eat be prepared to wait. But I promise you will love it or you are a zombie."}
{"text":"My favorite taco joint in SD transplanted in Vegas. The food was good but not as good as the ones I've found in San Diego."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to eat here. We waited in line for 40 minutes and the line barely moved. We didn't come to Vegas to stand all day, so we finally bailed and went somewhere else. Which is unfortunate, because we were really looking forward to the food. 

In our 40 minutes standing in line we also noticed how many people save seats for long periods of time, leaving everyone else with food no place to sit and eat.

This entire place is a disorganized disaster. Not sure the food is worth the wait. I guess I will never know!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever had. I'm all about the carne asada, but don't bother with that stuff at Tacos El Gordo. Go with the adobada, hands down. The meat is tender and juicy, the avocado sauce is creamy and full of flavor, and the salsa has a decent kick.

I've been here twice and I'm only giving it 4 stars because the food didn't seem as fresh the second time around for whatever reason. The meat was a little cold and the fries were a bit undercooked. Also, they were a bit stingy with the meat on the adobada fries and they went overboard on the cheese and sour cream. Regardless, if you visit Las Vegas, try to make time to hit this place up. It can get busy during peak hours, so keep that in mind if you're running a tight schedule. The first time I went, we probably spent a good 30-40 minutes standing in line just waiting to order."}
{"text":"PARKING
Didn't look like it was a hassle for parking but what do I know, since we took an Uber here.

INTERIOR/ EXTERIOR
Not too big of a restaurant but man, was it packed! Mm, the lines were long for every section. They have a system where you line up for the for meat you want to order. Unfortunately, because it is set up that way, it can either take longer for you for faster, depending on what combination of food you want. After you get what you want to eat, you go by to the cashier and pay up.

Outdoor tables have heater above for when it gets cold at night. Indoor is packed and the line is unrelenting.

MENU
The last time I have been here, there was no pineapple! Luckily for me, this time, pineapple was available! I went for the Adobada and Al Pastor tacos along with the Mula, which was recommended by a fellow individual in line. Along with the Horchata, this order was way too much for me. As I finished three tacos, I was already full. However, everything was delicious and the pineapple leaves a refreshing sweetness on your palette.

Compared to the street tacos, these tacos are a little bigger and a little more expensive but it is worth swinging by when you are in Las Vegas or San Diego!

SERVICE
Workers are nice and they are trying to work as fast as they can, but the lines and people keep coming."}
{"text":"PARKING
Small parking lot, gets filled quickly!

INTERIOR/ EXTERIOR
Moderate size Mexican restaurant on the Vegas Strip! Many tables inside and outside to accommodate customers but there will always be people fighting for tables because it's just that crazy here! The line trails out the door so expect some waiting. You're in Vegas anyways so what's the surprise after waiting to get in the night/day clubs.

MENU
My absolute favorite is the Adobada Taco topped with a small slice of pineapple! This is comparable to Leo's Tacos in Los Angeles which I also love so much. They have a fountain station dedicated for their different horchata but they are a little too sweet for me.

SERVICE
Mediocre service at best because it's so busy! We had to ask for the extra pineapple on the tacos, otherwise they would forget or skip it. 

I did meet a Mexican couple who was visiting from Florida and they shared their tradition of always stopping by for these tacos when they are in town because they were comparable to the ones in Mexico. That's just wow!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. The lines are confusing and the service is slow but the tacos and the rest of the food is amazing. Great break from the rest of the Vegas scene. I highly recommend going. Be it for dinner or after a long night after clubbing."}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars because we've really enjoyed the tacos in the past. We just went to El Gordon and the restaurant is closed and gutted. Not sure what happened. Hopefully just closed for a temporary remodel."}
{"text":"I'm Mexican and I've been to many taco spot but let me tell you this is by far the best tacos I've had. 
Al pastor is my favorite.! Be prepared to stand in long lines, but I soon as you take the first bite it'll all be worth it I promise."}
{"text":"I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. Today was my family's first time visiting and we were thoroughly satisfied. We ordered the adobada tacos, lengua tacos, and carne asada tacos. Each were unique and delicious, but our favorite was definitely the adobada tacos! Not too spicy, the meat was juicy and savory ooh I'm making my mouth water. The lengua tacos were a little hot for me but the horchata is the perfect compliment to washing it all down. We also got the adobada fries which were topped with all the trimmings: guac, shredded cheese, sour cream, some really good green sauce, and of course adobada meat (spicy pork). I have a family of 6 and we were all fully satisfied.
COME ON AN EMPTY STOMACH!!!

Also: the ordering process can be confusing for newcomers. Get in the line for the meat you want, order your tacos (or sopes, quesadillas, etc.), put your food on a tray, then walk over to the cashier to pay, and of course find a seat and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Why did I not hear about this place until now?  I'm not a huge fan of tacos but when my friends took me here, I became addicted.  Expect to wait at least 40 minutes to an hour (if you're lucky) in line to get your tacos.  Once you get in, you will see three lines.  Depending on what type of tacos you want, stay in that line.  It's a lot easier if you have more than one person in your party so you both can order.  They have lime and radishes to take as well.  After you get your tacos, you go and pay for your food.  We ordered it to go and sat in the car to eat it since it was so crowded inside.  I was very pleased by the quality and taste.  I tried going again Saturday 7/23 but found it it was closed due to maintenance.  However, security told me they had another location ten minutes away!"}
{"text":"Great Reviews and a shady area- all the marks of a great Taco place!!

Overview: I had hopes for this place based on personal reviews from friends- maybe a communication break down. 2.5 Stars at best.

Total shady area pretty sure the parking lot was full of off duty hookers- not a 100% sure. I mean come on who isn't up for hookers and a potential stabbing all in the name of great tacos!! 

The food was OK not worth the ghetto location. Maybe I'm just spoiled from the Centinela place in  Venice. Not worth your time"}
{"text":"5/21: I've been here a few times; every time has been awesome! I haven't been to many Mexican restaurants, although I can't imagine better tacos out there. 

These tacos are so good, fresh, and cheap...max value for $2 each! You can definitely leave here full and satisfied for under $10. 

I've had the Spicy Pork and Steak Tacos. The fries are awesome as well. 

TIP: Make sure you ask for the freshly cut pineapple if you get Spicy Pork! 

The chefs are pretty friendly as well. I love that you can watch them cut the meat from the rack and prepare your order. 

I even overheard some guy at the Bellagio say \"Tacos El Gordo.\" The word is out. Just about everyone will love this place! 

Whenever the weather is nice, sitting outside can be very relaxing while eating these delicious tacos. 

Amazing food! I want some right now!"}
{"text":"This place has some seriously great tacos! The service is friendly especially the ladies where you pay. Most importantly the food is served fast, hot and SUPER tasty. We got 12 al pastors and 2 cheese quesadillas which hit the spot after a long day of drinking and walking. Great place will defo be back next time vist"}
{"text":"best Mexican tacos I ever ate!  authentic and without exception.. I can't go back to the gringo taco shops anymore!"}
{"text":"Tasty and great food value! 
It's a spectacle on it's own to see how this place is so structured when there's lines and lines of people. We ordered the Adobada fries, which were really good. The taco's looked really delicious too. 
Crew is friendly even at very busy times, which it was when we got there.

I would recommend going to El Gordo's!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! The adobada taco is a must!! It's so delicious I regretted only getting one! 

Be careful when you wait in line at this place. The lines can get really long and you have to know exactly what you want beforehand. You wait in line for the type of meat you want. For example, if you want asada fries you have to wait in the asada line. If you want asada tacos too you need to tell them when you order the fries otherwise you'll have to go to the back of the line! There are pretty much two different lines. One line is for asada, mules, sopes, and chorizo whereas the other one is for adobada and al pastor. Plan ahead! 

The carne asada fries are not that great here. It's not hot enough and the sauces added on top are cold which makes for a weird combination. Maybe the adobada fries are better."}
{"text":"Abodabo? Best in town, by far!!! Been eating these taco's for a while now, and it never disappoints. I cant tell you about the other meats because I am so hooked on the abodabo. All they need to be the perfect taco shop is elote!!"}
{"text":"Los tacos mmmm. Más o menos  lo que no  estoy de acuerdo  es que hay que hacer línea para cada diferente taco hasi que si quieres tacos de diferentes carnes  te tienes que formar para cada uno"}
{"text":"This place is in my TOP 5 of all time restaurants!!!

I had the Spicy Pork sopas and that was on of the best foods I had ever eaten. I had 2 sopas, the beef tongue tacos and carne asada taco. If you are on the strip and want an explosion of flavorful food, this is definately the place to come. The spicy pork name comes from the spices that it is marinated in rather than a hot spicy marinate. I will be back whenever I come to town."}
{"text":"You know the tacos are good when you only see Mexicans eating there.  I ordered the beef brain, beef head, and cow tongue tacos.  The cow tongue tacos here were hands-down the BEST tacos lenguas I've ever had in my life.  It was too spicy for me (you can ask them not to put the sauce on), and I still thought they were super delicious. I love cow tongue tacos, and these were really the best ever.  Tacos cost around $2 each, with the exception of the tacos lenguas, which were $2.25 each.  Worth it!  My brothers got the spicy pork tacos, and they said those were the best they ever ate.  They also have a bunch of other things like cow tongue fries, sopas, and other traditional Mexican foods, but I'll save that for next time.  Yep, go to this place.  Cheap good food, and it's enough to satisfy your stomach."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Definitely nothing to look at and in a Strip Mall in the middle of nowhere but the food is so good. 

The tacos al pastor come with fresh Housemade tortillas and pastor cut straight from the roasting spit like it's supposed to be! They are amazing!!

We also tried the Carne Asada Fries. This is the ultimate hangover food. Crisp fries, Carne Asada, cheese,  some kind of cilantro lime sauce, guac and sour cream. Very tasty!

For those who are more adventurous, My hubby had the Cabesa tacos and said they were Delicious with a capital D!

Only four stars for ambiance. Five stars for the food!!

Next time we are in Vegas we will be back!"}
{"text":"Was in town over 4th of July weekend, had heard about this place here on Yelp, so figured to give it a try. Figured to skip the strip and head to TEG instead for lunch. It's a short 10 minute drive up I-15, and pretty much right off the FWY (after a couple turns). As has been mentioned on here, this new TEG is a converted gas station (You know how when you go to like an AM/PM or QT/BP/Race Trac to get gas they always have the one-stop-shop building behind the pumps where you pay for your gas and grab snacks/drinks? Yeah, well that's what this TEG is). I don't mind it at all, but they need to invest some money to get rid of the area in the parking lot where the gas pumps used to be, and make that into parking spaces.

Anywho, back to the review of TEG lol... So yeah, we went there for lunch on July4th. We were expecting the place to be packed based on Yelp reviews. To the contrary, the place was semi-desolate (I counted only 7 different patrons in there eating while we were there). So that was pretty cool. Judging by those who were there, it seemed like many locals frequent the place, at least during the afternoon hours. 

There was only 1 person in line in front of us, and so ordering was easy. It was our first time there, and I had read that you had to get into different lines and what not. We didn't. We just went to the guy standing behind the counter to the far right, and placed our order, and simply kept walking over to grab our order accordingly (sort of like the lunch line when you were in grade school). 

I skipped breakfast that day, because I wanted to make sure that I had a big appetite so as to taste as much as I possibly could, this being our first time. I ordered myself 3 tacos Al pastor, 3 tacos of asada, and 1 regular order of steak fries. Moms ordered herself 1 taco Al pastor/ 1 taco of asada and 1 sope of asada and she ordered pops 2 tacos Al pastor/ 2 tacos of asada.

Coming from LA, the land of all things authentic Mexican, we came in wondering how authentic/good TEG would be compared to the LA fare, and let me tell you, the Al pastor tacos were DELICIOUS! My parents commented on just how juicy they were and how tasty the meat was. We noticed the Al pastor tacos are put in different (smaller) double-tortillas, whereas the asada tacos were put in larger (single-tortillas). I'm going to assume this is both to make their bread/butter tacos (Al pastor) taste better, but also to possibly save on meat (granted, they do load the tacos with meat). While the asada tacos were good, I much preferred the Al pastor tacos (Not sure if it was the tortillas or the meat, or a combination of both), but they just had a better flavoring/taste than did the asada tacos. 

I am very glad I ordered a regular sized portion of the steak fries, because I was unable to finish it. To be honest, the steak fries were just meh to me. Nothing special about them. I mostly ate the meat/toppings and a few fries. It would have been nice had the fries been crispier and less soggy, and at least with some taste to them. (I grabbed a couple of fries from the bottom without any meat/toppings to make sure it wasn't my taste buds messing with me, but nope, the fries lacked any type of seasoning to them.) I'm going to assume they don't really season their fries, expecting you to use the meat/toppings as seasoning-- But other places, they really season their steak fries and you merely add flavor to it with the meats/toppings, not here.

The asada sope moms had, she thoroughly enjoyed and raved about. She said it was very well done, and the sope was tasty and not overdone. It helps that they have the masa (corn flour mix for the sopes) right there in front of you, which means they're making the sopes to order, rather than having them sit under a heat lamp-- This really makes a huge difference in the taste of any food (fresh vs stale). My parents are suckers for fresh made roasted tortillas (aka tostadas), and moms noticed they had them right next to the sope mix, so she asked for a few tostadas, which the kind lady was generous enough to give her 5. We're not used to eating sopes with tostadas, and so what my parents did was, they used the tostadas instead to add the excess meat that had fallen off their tacos unto the tostadas and drizzled them with the great tasting in-house salsas they had available. 

Overall, we had a pleasant (and cheap) lunch experience at Tacos El Gordo, and certainly will give them our business next time we're in town. Myself, I'm definitely loading up on just tacos Al pastor and having my fill with those."}
{"text":"Came out to TEG on Sunday before 4th of July. Man was this place BUSYYYY the evening I went. I was in Vegas solo this time around, so I took a buddy out to taste this place, as he as a local had never been. I ordered 11 Adobada tacos and that alone LOL. 6 for me, 5 for my buddy. The line took forever and a half to get to the front, but was well worth it. TIP: If you speak Spanish, the folks that make your tacos at the front of the line, can be nicely asked if they don't mind getting you some tacos from another line, so you don't have to make line for a different meat. Had to get some to-go tacos for another friend who wasn't able to meet up with us to dine, and they wanted tacos de lengua, but that was a different line. So I kindly asked the gentleman at the Adobada line if he could get me a few lengua tacos. He said they can, but has to be aa couple max, so I asked for 4 lengua tacos and he obliged nicely. Tipped him for it on the jar in front, and on our way we went.

The thing I love about this place is that regardless of when you come, the quality of the food, the texture, and the sauces... it all remains constant. That is why I believe so many people flock to TEG on their Vegas trips. Needless to say, I shall be back next month when I'm in town for the Mayweather/McGregor fight!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Isn't the greatest food but hits the spot like no other at 3am while in vegas"}
{"text":"I want everyone to experience REAL ass mexican food once in their lives. In vegas, this is it. The flavors that go into it, mmmm tastes like my mommas tacos or more like my childhood! They make every single taco FRESH and right in front of you. It's usually SO packed in this place, like seriously, so try to order as many tacos as you can at once to not have to wait in line over and over again. Ask for everything on it. I mean I dont lie, this is an amazing spot! TRY IT!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Seems like everyone knows about this gem of a taco place! So glad we ubered down the strip to stop for lunch. Even at 11:10 in the morning the line was long but moves quickly. Our uber driver said it's a busy place even at night. 
Lots of choices for different beef and pork tacos- went with the carne asada and they were beyond delicious and authentic! 
If you're in Vegas- this is a must."}
{"text":"I heard the hype, I read the hype, I saw the hype, I felt the hype, too bad I didn't taste the hype. The set up says authentic, the kitchen looks authentic, the tacos themselves look authentic, the employees look authentic (This must be Donald Trump's worst nightmare). The tacos themselves are a huge letdown. If the tacos had as much flavor as the atmosphere inside the restaurant, they'd be rocking. They don't. The mulitas adobadas were the only half decent item I tasted on my 3 visits here. So my search for a good taco in Vegas continues."}
{"text":"This place is pack 24/7 and smells great outside. They also have a unique system for ordering similar to food court.

Asada - taste burnt but it isn't

Chorizo - alright

Adobada - good

Soderos- ok

Cabaeza- wasn't chewy as I expected

$2 per tacos so pretty pricey. It's not bad but definitely a nice place to try."}
{"text":"If Taco Bell or Acapulco is your idea of authentic Mexican food, than this place is not for you. However, if you have actually eaten off the numerous and delicious carts that line the cities of Baja, then this is your place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for cheap. 

Tacos are $2 each and a full order of fries is $10. But you can get half for $5 which is still a good amount. 

I like coming to this place because the lines are not long at all. I've been to the one on the strip twice and waited over an hour both times. 

I usually get the al pastor tacos and fries. The green sauce they put on them are insanely good."}
{"text":"This is the second time I come to Tacos el gordo (last time I ate there was about 4.5 years ago) and the food was just as amazing as I had remembered. Went in on a Monday morning at about 11:30am and surprisingly there were no big lines! I ordered the asada, chorizo and al pastor and hands down the Al pastor were the best. 
Staff was very nice and the food was great! Will definitely come back again on my next visit."}
{"text":"Omg,  seriously worth the visit! It's been a month since I've been there because I'm from Chicago.  I obviously Can't stop thinking of these tacos since its been a month and wish i could have some more now.  Since i can't hopefully you will have one for me!  I can't wait to go back to Vegas for these tacos! I'm more excited for these tacos than the gambling or the strip!"}
{"text":"Love love this spot. The wait is long but it's worth it. The adobado is sooooo yummy. Highly recommend getting adobado sopes and tacos. Also tried their super fries and it was delish. Be prepared to be in a food coma afterwards though ;)"}
{"text":"Best tacos by far. Just off the Vegas strip by the Wynn. Lines are long but well worth it. I can't wait to go back and try the carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Adobado tacos. No need to order anything else. 

Bit of a walk from the strip but definitely need it to burn the calories from all the tacos you will eat!! 

You must get a side order of the grilled onions and ask for pineapple chunks! Also,  make sure to tip the man slicing the meat! My guy worked very hard and fast to get my 20 orders of the Adobado tacos. 

I didn't taste any difference between this location and the one in Chula Vista."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with TACOS EL GORDO, Tijuana BC. All across San Diego. 

They are their own name and yet have the exact stuff. Drove by and was shocked to find them and asked the lady at the register who informed they are not the same. 

I still gave them a shot. Tried the tripa, Asada, and Adobada. Tripa is not cooked well. Asada and Adobada was flavorful."}
{"text":"I feel like I eat this every other week =____=;; LOL 

Adobado fries all day! Was not a fan of anything else :("}
{"text":"Small casual taqueria. Cool condiment station like zona fresca. Husband had steak tacos, he wolfed them down so quick it was so tasty, habanero sauce awesome. I had the grilled fish, excellent, done up the way my family does at home, seasoned just right. Great taco joint!"}
{"text":"Cheap, Delicious authentic tacos. I actually used to eat at the original one in Tijuana every time we went through TJ, I was so excited when they brought their giant indoor taco stands to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Real deal!!!! This is the real deal serving tacos so authentic I had to check my GPS to confirm that I hadn't walked through a worm hole in Vegas and come out the other side in Tijuana...TJ, baby! If you want real deal tacos, you must go to Tacos El Gordo!!!"}
{"text":"Yo. I can order one adobada taco or eight and I would still be a happy girl. Something about the green sauce that makes it sooooo addicting. The pork is not too spicy. The onions and salsa and green sauce compliment the adobada so well. 

Try coming here after a night of drinking and it may be packed. But it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The tacos are good, but like ever other review on here it is a little expense. I paid $11 for 4 tacos! Its a good place to eat but the prices still kinda kill it for me. I'm still coming here to eat just not as much."}
{"text":"5 stars ..not because this is a 5 star dining establishment , but because for the product they sell-it's 5 stars hands down!!!! I've been wanting to try this place for over a year and finally came..sooooooo tasty! I feel like I'm in Mexico! 
I had a Lengua taco, asada mulas, and a asada vampiro. All 3 were yummazing! Service was very fast & very friendly. The place was also clean inside and smelled goooood. 
I'm sold!!! Officially in love and will return anytime my taco craving hits :)))"}
{"text":"Despite my buddy who insisted we go to this location instead of the one four steps from our hotel, it was a lovely respite from the overpriced garbage you'll find in most touristy areas of vegas. Legitimately great tacos worthy of the long wait you'll certainly experience even when Omid wastes half of your day getting there.

They have separate lines depending on which meats you're planning to eat. If you're carne asada and al pastor, you'll be queuing hard. But if you're into more adventurist meats like tongue and head, you can jump
straight to the front."}
{"text":"Good, it's not perfect. I wish the dining area was not as shabby. Considering it's location on the strip, I expect more. I hate having to stand in separate lines based on what I want to order The food is pretty good and I like sitting outside while dining here. Al pastor was spicy and I will be making regular visits for that alone. Maybe some fries as well. Really good, cheap prices."}
{"text":"Decent spot for Mexican food in the area.

After trying the asada and adobada tacos, as well as the carne asada fries, I would say don't even mess with the asada. Just get adobada everything...tacos, fries, etc. The adobada is spicy pork that is cut from the huge chunk spinning by the kitchen.

The tacos are pretty pricey in comparison to what I am used to back in LA at $2+ a pop.
The fries are $10 but plentiful and very much meant to be shared. 

Green and red salsa can be obtained at the cashier counter. 

The best thing about this place is the $1.40 drink for soda or mexican drinks. You can get orange bang, horchata, pina colada, jamaica, tamarind, etc from the machines and it is all unlimited."}
{"text":"I love this place and used to frequent the locations in San Diego for years. I am so glad that they are following me everywhere I go! Authentic tacos just like I'm sitting at the border ordering 10 tacos (okay maybe 4).  I love the adobada the most, then carne asada, then lengua.  Try this place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Again, Tacos El Gordo are a must when visiting Las Vegas and San Diego.  Las Vegas has three locations.  This is the location I prefer the most because it is less busy and has the nicest building.  

Tacos El Gordo offer authentic Mexican street tacos.  I ordered Tripa and Al Pastor. I also ordered a carne asada quesadilla which was delicious.  

Overall I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic street tacos can't go wrong with any meat choice you do personal favorites were spicy pork and  Asada"}
{"text":"Serious amazing, authentic tacos. My fiancé's family is from Mexico and he says the tacos here remind him of the ones there! Just be prepared to wait. It is super full of people and, when you're hungry, it feels like forever. It's ok though because it's worth the wait. You can watch the people in the kitchen make the tacos fresh while you're waiting. I had the carne asada tacos, but didn't get to try the fries cuz they ran out. Also, good luck finding a seat in the restaurant. There's definitely not enough seats."}
{"text":"Soooo good.... It's worth every dime and every minute I waited in line. 
Would have been better if we don't have to wait on separate lines for different meat. 
The only set back is really the small space. There's no space to stand, let alone walk fr one line to another."}
{"text":"The tacos here are amazing. Fresh, made to order, tacos were delicious. People there knew they were worth the wait. Lines are long because people order a lot before they head to another line."}
{"text":"Garbage tbh took for ever to make the food we were staying in Vegas and decided to try out this tacos el Gordo because the one in Chula Vista San Diego is amazing and we were disappointed first of all the tacos had so much fat in them every part of the meat had fat in it making it just a flour tortilla second of all the guy making the tacos was so slow but maybe that's because it's Vegas on a Saturday won't be back"}
{"text":"If you like pubic hair in your Sauce go ahead And eat here. All these reviews are not accurate these tacos are not the best. The place looked really dirty and the cashier lady was rude when helping costumers! BAD SERVICE. If I could give 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"I LOVE Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista so when I came here for a late night snack after coming out of XS. I felt so disappointed... 

Drunk/tipsy + Mexican food should heaven but it unfortunately just didn't hit the spot. I mean sure, it was fine and I was pleasantly surprised they had adobada fries but the adobada tacos, which I adore normally, just didn't do it for me. 

We got there around 3:30 (they close at 4am) and the lines were HUGE. Clearly everyone has the same desire for some tacos after leaving the clubs. Fortunately, they moved pretty fast and we got 2 tacos each ($2.25 per taco) plus fries coming out to ~$28. I believe the tacos are priced 30-40 cents higher, but it's the Strip. The adobada just didn't seem as flavorful but the fries tasted fantastic. They were like carne asada fries and had a good amount of sauce. Not sure what it was but my other two friends agreed that it just did not hold up to their SD locations."}
{"text":"We went last Saturday afternoon around 2pm. The lines were CRAZY long. We waited close to 20 minutes in the Al Pastor line and then another 10 minutes because we asked for a steak taco from another station. 

That being said, they're the most delicious, authentic Mexican street tacos in the valley in my opinion. You will absolutely not be disappointed by the product. 

I'm a Vegas local but there appeared to be a lot of tourists in there. Not really sure how TEG got the word out (because I haven't seen them on a Food Network show or anything) but they definitely got it out! 

I would encourage you give this place a try because the food is second to none but perhaps go during an off-peak hour so that you don't have to wait 30 minutes in line then another 5-8 minutes at the register just to get $9 in tacos. 

But give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Ricos los tacos .tienen un sabor único. Pero la filas son interminables deben buscar una manera de agilizar!
Pero de definitivamente los recomiendo"}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had. Steak and spicy pork are my recommendation. All tacos here are a win"}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos in town (maybe the entire USA). The ordering system is a little weird but I was here for the tacos.  The menu is small but everything on it is delicious.  Don't be afraid of the different meats.  They serve cesos (brains), lengua (tongue) and tripas  (tripe), and you should really try them.  The more common meats are great, but the other meats are typical street taco fillings. They are amazing!"}
{"text":"Chorizo tacos were amazing!  I would definite hit this place up when I'm back in town. I like how you can see them prepare everything right in front of you."}
{"text":"This is one of the best street taco I had in a long time.
You can tell that this place is a popular place with the locals with the long lines but well worth the wait. Make sure you wait in the right line as they are for specific meats. A must stopping place for Mexican food when you are Vegas."}
{"text":"Best taco place in all of Las Vegas. Hands down. The food is quality and the service is top notch. You may need to wait a bit as they are always busy when I go, but it it totally worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Pretty average tacos the lost a lot of the authenticity since now they are a franchise also the line is too long for average tacos they need to fix the process it is severely broken"}
{"text":"The staff was very rude. They did not explain how their cafeteriaesqe operation worked. The food was not good. The pork was dry and the chicken was flavorless."}
{"text":"I cannot find words to describe how soulful this Hispanic restaurant is. I would have thought Roberto's was decent, but as soon as my mouth experienced Tacos El Gordo's taco I was beyond my blown from how much colors tasted after one bite. Because of this restaurant I now dislike Roberto's. Thank you"}
{"text":"This place is gross! The carne asada meat is horrible... You're basically eating tortillas with nothing but nerves, skin, and fat. I guess you get what you pay for... Never will I come back again."}
{"text":"YUM!!!!! I wish there was a place like this in Orange County?!?!?! I ordered the Lengua tacos with the side of grilled onions and peppers. I want more!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just go now!   And hopefully there's not a bad line.  Picked up my brother in law and went straight at 11 p.m. on Monday night.   No line and not even crowded, just how we like it.   Had 10 pastor tacos and 2 pastor quesadillas.  Amazing, simple filling and typically taco stand, taco truck, taqueria like atmosphere.  Love tacos, but would not wait more than 15 mins for this, too many other options.  But if the timing works out, there is a no brainer.   I wish they had one back home that was open late."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time in San Diego, but wasn't impressed. Gave another chance while visiting Vegas. I ordered a mula and sope topped off with carne asada. This time i was impressed! I enjoyed the mula, i could have done without the sope. Next time I'm going to order mula again....tasty!"}
{"text":"Beef tacos are good. The cooks are absolutely fantastic at making the tacos. Toppings taste fresh. The drawback about this place is it is HIGHLY unorganized. There are 3 separate lines to stand in based on whether u wAnt a carne asada, pork, or beef taco and none of the lines are labeled. So if u want one of each, u have to stand in each of the three separate lines and pay three separate times. This is very annoying and really inefficient."}
{"text":"This location of Tacos El Gordo is much cleaner than Charleston store. I've been here twice after a long night on the Strip and still want to come back for more. Check their hours of operation before you come, because they do open late on Fridays and Saturdays. There aren't too many good cheap eats on the strip like this.

We always get the same things, but I'm sure that the other menu items are good too. I'd recommend the carne asada fries and al pastor tacos. You order in different lines depending on which type of meat you want, and then pay at the front cashier. Don't forget to ask them for extra red or green salsa behind the cash register. Its definitely not the best that I've had, but its pretty good to satisfy your taco cravings."}
{"text":"Just as tasty as the San Diego location. 

Not sure why but there was a very long line for Carne Asada... cmon guyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyys, I noticed there was no line at all for one of the Al Pastor lines, so Security asked us which one of us wanted Al pastor and we all got to cut into that line, sweeeet!

Ordered 6 Al Pastor tacos and had no regrets. My friends waited probably another 30 minutes for Carne Asada. Ideally, you'd want to just split your group into the lines and order for the entire group, but thankfully I didn't waste any time desiring any Carne Asada. Surprisingly, 6 tacos was not enough for me... Now I'm kind of craving some more at this moment."}
{"text":"\"Always get an Al Pastor taco.\" That should be the motto at Tacos El Gordo. Al Pastor is the reason we come here. It would be what I would describe if someone asked me \"what's the most perfect taco in the world?\" I love them that much. 
 
The secondary motto should be \"Always get a plate of Carne Asada fries.\" They're smokey and delicious and HUGE."}
{"text":"My current favorite taco place on planet earth.

There's something about a finely crafted taco. All of their meat is hot and delicious. It comes straight from the grill onto your plate, so you know that it's good. The carne asada has this smoky flavor that is so unlike anything else I've ever had. Tacos Al Pastor are my hands down favorite and you need to get them with everything on top, including the pineapple which sits at the top of the spit. You'll want to make sure that you get some grilled onions and peppers to complete the experience. If there's a line, get in it as soon as you can because this place is worth the wait, and the drive."}
{"text":"The food was so good!!! The adobado was probably the best taco I've ever had in my life. And I eat a lot of tacos...I live in San Diego. The funny thing is, this place started just south in Chula Vista and I've never heard of it. I will definitely seek it out to get more!!! 

PS, the carne asada fries were also delicious."}
{"text":"After reading on Yelp that this place has great reviews. I decided to give it a try. After waiting in a long line to order and hustling to find a place to eat my food. I must say I was extremely disappointed. The Carne Asada: meat was chewy and the tortillas were cold. Fries were straight from the freezer to the fryer and given to me cold and soggy with oil.

It is possible that this place was good at one point but it's mediocre at the best now. The popularity of this place has cause it's quality to suffer."}
{"text":"Definitely a must go place when in Vegas. The tacos are really good, tender meat and generous amounts of guacamole. Expect to wait in line as it gets busy but of course a long line means great food!"}
{"text":"What  a big surprise find the best tacos in vegas high Recomended excellent service great job tacos el Gordo!! 

Que gran sorpresa encontrar los mejores tacos en vegas 
Excelente servicio desde el principio hasta el final buen trabajo Tacos el gordo!!"}
{"text":"This place gets packed! Try to either get here real early or really late to avoid the crowds and long lines. You'll find an array of meats and condiments to choose from all within a peasants budget! I highly recommend the adobada on anything! The refillable Aguas Frescas is a plus! Most taco shops I go to normally charge an arm and a leg for additional refills haha. Give this place a try for sure if you're in the area."}
{"text":"So not the best but really good. Very close to taco stands in TJ. I came in once before and they must have ran out of masa for handmade tortillas because this time when I went in the tortillas were outstanding. It was very busy and the vibe was much better. It is hard to find authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. I am sure we have all experiences that were sub par. I believe in second chances and Tacos El Gordo has defiantly impressed. I had two El Pastor tacos with all the toppings and two with just onions, cilantro, and salsa(which is how I like them). Fruit is not for tacos or beer, just my opinion. Very quick service even though lines are long and everyone was very nice. It has been hot in Vegas and I was offered a water glass when I paid for my tacos. Thanks Tacos El Gordo, you have made many peoples recommendations, which I was doubting, to be true and good."}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California so I know good tacos! This was a decent taco lol. Waited about 45 min in line which I really don't care for but I wish it was an excellent taco for that wait time. 

Also, myself and my date both felt sick for a full day after"}
{"text":"Bomb from start to finish, super crowded lively atmosphere, super friendly staff, affordable tacos, make sure you know your Spanish cow/pork translated parts before u order. Horchatas are free refills, tacos are made on the spot and the meat is chopped stove hot and fresh. Definitely come here again and recommend to anyone in town."}
{"text":"This will always be my favorite taco spot of all time!! Been to multiple location in both Vegas and San Diego CA, all have been so amazing and I crave this place almost daily! Get the pastor!! Get pastor fries!! The flavor here is unbeatable and fresh, and of all the locations I feel this one is the best. I would only BEG them to build more locations in CA closer to LA please....I need your tacos, nothing like it over here!! This place is a MUST if you're in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is just as delicious as everyone says it is. My first time attempting to go here was 3am on a Friday night. It was full and we just went home.

Second venture was much more fruitful - Thursday evening at 7:30.  Only one person ahead of us and the process was easy: you go to the line of the meat of your choice and place an order.  That's about it.  You pay at the counter to the right of the ordering area, where you can order beverages or desserts.

Now, the taste: I chose the carne asada fries because, well, carne asada fries.  Since the meat is fresh off a grill, it definitely has a lot more flavor.  And I can definitely see why - the carne asada was so tender.

I look forward to my next venture here. :)"}
{"text":"Damn... came again and still service can't get any worse...

Wanted to give them another try but every time we ask for the meat well done they give us attitude. 

Ummmm... the place was empty today too! It's not like they had a huge rush to get so upset about. 

And we said well done not burnt lol!! 

Geez! Don't get it. Lol! Oh, well."}
{"text":"Long lines but definitely worth the wait. Food was incredible and super inexpensive. Two filled up on $13."}
{"text":"La madre santa de Dios que es un taco bueno! Have you ever had a taco so good that you spontaneously start speaking spanish? Yeah. Who knew a $2 taco could turn you into a cunning linguist? I don't know what it is about Tijuana street food but boy are we glad they set up shop here in Las Vegas! Tacos El Gordo... Go! Go there now! Holy mother of God that's a good taco!

As we Mexican food aficionados, we were more than thrilled to finally find some good grub here in Vegas. For a mere two dollars you can get carne asada tacos, tacos de cabeza, tacos de lengua, and our personal favorite, tacos adobada (spicy pork). When you walk through the door you will immediately be greeted by the beautiful adobada roasting on a spit. Now really. Who doesn't like beautiful pork spinning about on a spit?

Warning! Don't be distracted by the $10 fries! This is a distraction for gringos! Your mission is tacos, tortas, sopes, and more tacos! All much cheaper than the gringo fries and much more delicious! So get in your car and get your ass to Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE PERIOD! This is coming from a girl that is married to a Mexican straight from Mexico. None of my in laws speak english except for one sister. My mom in law makes the best mexican food ever but tacos el gordo has her beat when it comes to tacos. I'm sorry mom! This is a must visit when coming to Vegas! Totally worth the $60 cab ride over here! You need to bring at least 4 people with you so that you can get food from all 3 lines. The 4th person needs to help get a table because finding a seat in here is like finding gold in a gold mine. I can't wait to come back later this year with my husband! I love living in Hawaii, but not having legit Mexican food SUCKS!"}
{"text":"This place has authentic Mexican street tacos. The tacos al pastor were fantastic. They shave the meat of the spit right in front of you. The carne Asada was very good as well but my favorite had to be the quesadilla with everything on it.  Six of us ate there for less than one of us ate for dinner the night before. It's nice to have a spot right on the strip that doesn't cost an arm and a leg but still taste great. Great food and an incredible value. Customer service was excellent too.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love this tacos in Vegas , that I have to came to Tijuana and eat them one more time!!!!"}
{"text":"Another late night craving before finals week.. I know I will stay awake after eating here

I have been to the other Tacos El Gordo and we decided to try this one out since it is fairly closer to home.  The place is busy since it is on the strip.  

I actually took some time to look at the menu this time and noticed some interesting tacos such as beef tongue and beef brain.  I didn't think they would be appealing to me so I stuck with my usual; carne asada fries.  Full Size please..  Order first, pay after.  Seat yourself.  Also do remember to ask for hot sauce and mild sauce.  The other place I went to offered, but she could have just forgotten.  My carne asada fries looked wonderful as it usually does, layered with cheeses and two scoops of guacamole.  Obviously delicious since I ate it all.  Tender meat and skinny fries.  Not salted.. Fries a little crisp.. 

Now, I did reach over and picked a piece of brain from my friend's taco.. That was very interesting.. mushy and no flavor.. I was definitely better off with fries.  I guess you have to acquire a taste or demand for it.  But the tacos looked excellent from my view of the booth.  

Great late night place, little condiment bar with lemons, slice beets, etc.  Self serve drinks.  Little tables.  Fresh Mexican food smell. 

Would I come back, Yes! But next round will be at the other location.. I want to compare and contrast."}
{"text":"Got recommended from this place by someone who works at New York New York Hotel and immediately checked it out the next day. 

Came around noonish and the line was sooo long about an hour wait under the sun. Started to wonder if waiting was actually worth it and it most definitely is. 

The order line was separated into different types of meat and/or other stuff on the menu to keep the line moving. 

Kept it simple and got carne asada tacos. Great tacos with handmade tortillas! 

Every employee was putting up a sweat and thank you for the hard work and delicious food! 

Would totally stop by every time I'm in Vegas from now on!! Hopefully next time, I could get there as soon as they open just to try other stuff on the menu as well"}
{"text":"Different lines for different meats! Took me a minuet to figure it out but once I got my order in, 3 tacos and spicy pork fries... amazing local place just off the strip! Would highly recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to their location in San Diego, but this place is LEGIT. SOOOOOOO BOMB. Worth the wait in line for sure. Forget about the buffets, the PHO joints off the strip, forget all of it! Tacos El Gordo FTW!!!! 

I ordered carne asada and spicy pork my first time and after having the spicy pork, I completely forgot about my carne asada taco. The carne asada fries are also delicious. 

I just stated salivating thinking about these tacos and fries."}
{"text":"Love their food! Just the lines can be a little long but worth the wait to me! :D 
Even though they never think I speak Spanish :)"}
{"text":"The tacos are good.  Not great.  Definitely not worth waiting in an insane line for.  Luckily we went off peak hours.  But they were still so busy that my large order for the group couldn't be filled completely.  They were in such a rush that they handed me over to another cook and the order wasn't transferred fully.  

The meat was tender but the tortilla was bland and didn't hold the tacos together at all.  The sauce wasn't special.  Really disappointed about that.  Have eaten at many great taco places in and around Los Angeles.  This place doesn't stand out.  Would eat it again if someone had brought take out but will not stand in line for it."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe the greatness that is Tacos el Gordo. So I will leave it as is but let you know we ate here 2 out of the 3 days we were in Vegas."}
{"text":"When I woke up today, I was hungry and craving tacos from Tacos El Gordo. It makes me seem like a super fatty, but I don't care. Damn, these are good tacos. Admittedly, I had them for the first time, exactly 13 hours ago. I fell in love with these tacos. Hard and quick. I'm pretty sure I fell in love with it even before I ate. Probably fell in love when I got our of my car, and could already smell the food. 

The adobada tacos were amazing. We also ordered the carne asada fries, bu half carne asada & half adobada. The carne asada had good flavor, but was burnt. I don't know if I would order the carne asada again. 

The line on the right is to order pork, the line on the left is to order everything else. 

I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas, but Tacos El Gordo has changed my mind about it. Definitely get the pineapple on your tacos. I'm not a big fan of fruit on my food, but i just adds another great element to these tacos. It also has this green sauce on it, of which I am not sure what it is, but it's good. Each taco has plenty of meat, so be prepared to get full. 

Just a tip - grab plenty of napkins. As good as the tacos are, it gets very messy when you eat them. Plenty of oil and sauce will be dripping down your hand, and probably down your arm as well - so be sure to roll up your sleeves."}
{"text":"Tried the adobada & asada tacos , they were really good & cooked just right ! I always have loved Tacos el Gordo because im from San Diego & we have some there as well & its never disappointing when I go . Only thing about this location is it was freezing everyone who was with me were so cold as well ! We even felt the AC on . But great food & customer service ! Loved the grilled onions as well !"}
{"text":"So I was in Vegas with my wife. We didn't want to spend $50+ on overpriced, average food (if you haven't noticed the prices on food in restaurants in Vegas has gotten outrageous).   So I checked out yelp for some good cheap eats. Tacos El Gordo pops up as the #1 or #2 spot. We decide what the hell, let's go check it out. 

Verdict: not only is their Adobada pork taco the best taco I've ever had, their Adobada pork sope was even more ridiculous. Look, i eat Mexican a lot. My wife is Mexican and I know authentic Mexican food. This place shits on every taco you've ever had. It's that good. The carne asada was above average but in hindsight I wish I would have skipped it and gotten more Adobada tacos or sopes. If you don't know what a sope is, try one. It's basically a soft, fat corn tortilla. It's like a gordita (and no, not like a taco bell gordita; those don't remotely resemble a real gordita). 

If you want to eat for under $25 for two, eat the best taco or sope you'll ever have, and impress your friends with some real local knowledge... Eat at Tacos El Gordo. And after you eat and hit the casinos/clubs and you're sloppy drunk, go back and eat more. That's what I did. If there were one of these where I live I'd eat there 365 days a year and that's no bullshit. It's that good people. I think the meat is roasted by a crack pipe. It's seriously addicting.  I would consider giving up sex and becoming a priest to eat it daily.  If I were on death row I'd ask for Tacos El Gordo for my last meal.  If aliens landed tomorrow I'd take them to Tacos El Gordo to show them human cuisine and I'm pretty sure I would save the planet from total annihilation because they'd know the human race is rad because we can cook the shit out of some pork. 

Don't be a dummy, just do as I say and eat there. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"So expensive, it's just all hype. The lines are ridiculous for $2 small tacos. I'd 100% prefer going to a taco stand on the corner of the street"}
{"text":"I'm actually REALLY shocked that I haven't reviewed this particular Tacos El Gordo location, mainly because I've been here AT LEAST twice before. Bottom line, the rookies go to the Las Vegas Blvd. location, the pros come here.

Why come here? Because the lines are WAAAAAY shorter! In all the times I've been here, it's been busy, but never out-the-freaking-door busy. As you can imagine, the Las Vegas Blvd. location is full of tourists and local strip traffic. I've never not once ever had a problem with lines here, and it's why I'd rather come here than go to the closer, yet way busier, Strip location.

So if you wanna feast on your helpings of adobada and carne asada and everything in between, go for it! Make sure to make room for the carne asada or adobada (or both like I do it!) fries, they are amaaaaazing! The food here is on par with the other Tacos El Gordo locations I've been to in Vegas and Chula Vista, so you're not missing anything by coming here.

As I've already mentioned, everything goes really quickly here. Staff doesn't mess around, they make sure you're in and out of the taco lines as soon as possible. And the great thing about this location is that there's plentiful seating everywhere.

Without question, this is definitely the El Gordo location I prefer when I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"My one regret from living in San Diego is that I didn't go to the original Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista more than once in the three and a half years that I lived there.  Seriously, what I did was practically a crime against humanity.  Because as I mentioned in that review, you're not going to get better tacos anywhere other than Mexico itself.  So when I realized the Gordo opened in Vegas...of course I didn't bother going here either until now LOL.  Yeah, I should just quit on life.

Same deal as the original.  Different meats at different stations, line up and go get some.  If you come here and don't get the adobada, you might as well just get back in your car and drive away.  This adobada is easily some of the best in the world and is the #1 reason to even come here.  Carne asada was just ok in my book, but at least it was prepared with the proper ingredients (aka HELLA GUACAMOLE), so it gets a passing grade in my book.

And since I figured I needed to make up for not coming here who knows how many times, I came for the tacos before going to XS and came for the super fries after going to XS.  Because quite frankly, nothing beats drunk food like drunk Mexican food.  And nothing beats drunk Mexican food like super fries topped with carne asada, adobada, cheese, and guacamole!

I think I have an excuse to go to XS a lot more now.  When the joint is across the street from Encore Las Vegas, there's really not much choice.  Secret Pizza, you have met your post-clubbing food match!"}
{"text":"The young man in the pork line was very very helpful! He broke down all the different meats for me. I'm glad I ordered extra food my son ate before we came. He tried my food and he ate half of it. I ordered 3 pork tacos and 2 beef tacos. BOMB very well seasoned loved it. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing, just amazing. The lines here are crazy but even more insane at night time so I'd recommend coming for lunch. 

The specialty is the pastor, the creamy green sauce, and the pineapple. Together they make a beautiful combo of succulent meat with the sweetness of the pineapple. There are so many flavor combinations with all the salsa! 

You have to ask for the pineapple separately or else they won't give it.

The pastor fries were ok. The meat was good but the fries were soggy and overall bland. Don't recommend. Come for just the tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is highly rated, but I can't figure out why. They are very slow, the meat is dry, and the tacos overpriced."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the buche tacos ,tripas tacos were hard and not crunchy..but al pastor tacos are great be sure to be early I got there at 10am there was a line outside already."}
{"text":"this place is hilarious... it was my first late night stop upon arriving to vegas... I was not here to celebrate anything so this is a divey tacos place for a quick bite and escape the heat.

lets just say, the ordering process needs a makeover... you have to get in one line for their famous bbq pork tacos THEN get in ANOTHER line for other items .... SO CONFUSING.

and then ANOTHER line to pay...!!

We ended up eating the pork tacos in line... no napkins, no table, then they determine our order by counting the plates, and wax paper (that we didnt just toss in the trash lol)....

this place could easily use the fast food business process... (hint hint) 

tip: order a side of sauteed onions..!"}
{"text":"OMG these are the best Tacos ever!! We need one of these in Orange County or LA County!! Next time were in Vegas we will be deff be going back."}
{"text":"Tacos in Mexico is way better..  And the quesadilla that I got was actually a taco with some cheese on it.. and for double the price..  Rip off times 2."}
{"text":"Did not have a mind blowing experience this time around.

I was really excited to introduce this place to the husband so we came for lunch. We ordered 6 tacos adobadas con pinas. Apparently some guy ordered a mula  (the workers call it \"mulita\" though)  but ended up not wanting it, so we got coaxed into ordering this mula because they offered us extra meat (ugh, I'm so easy sometimes). 

We bit into the tacos and the meat was flat. There was no tantalizing of the tastebuds. I was embarassed about my ravings. It was definitely their \"off\" day. Then we bit into the mulita and it was so salty! The saltiness was exacerbated by the cheese and the red sauce. It was simply messy dish and I would not order it again (even if they gave me extra meat, haha!) I noticed that a lot of other patrons had ordered mulitas and they were enjoying it. I think ours turned out to be bad because it was probably sitting out for more than 10 minutes. Ugh, why am I so easy sometimes!

Anyway, I'm going to give El Gordo one more shot and hopefully this time around it'd be as excellent as my first experience.




FYI: \"Mulita\" is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico, while they are known as Gringa in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas. (Wikipedia)"}
{"text":"I live in Southern California and surprisingly I have never been to a Tacos El Gordo. This is the first one I've been to. I was on my way to the Nellis Air Force Base from Downton and decided to stop by to this taco shop to get something to eat. I must say the food quality is amazing and it tastes just like the kind of tacos you'd find in Tijuana. The ambience is casual and the staff is nice. The cooks are experienced and quick to get your order ready. The pricing however is a little exaggerated. I have never paid $27 for 4 tacos with 4 small quesadillas before it's just too much money. Maybe they should tone it down on the pricing and it would be even better. Overall it's a great taco shop, actually it's the best one I've tried so far here in the states. So stop by and check it out if you're in town."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos.  Need to try the pepper and onions which everyone else seemed to have on their plates.  Also, saw that they have Adobada tacos which I will have to try as well.  Not on the menu but you have to ask."}
{"text":"The King Taco of Vegas !

I love this place. Get the Adobada Pork! The sauces arent as spicy as the King Taco sauces but their sauces are on point. I usually get the tacos. The Carne Asada fries and the Adobada fries were both fails. Stick to the tacos. Its a little off the strip but its worth it. This is the perfect place to come when you're hungover and broke from losing all your money on the strip."}
{"text":"I've been told about this place from my Yelp friends and I knew I had to try it. We decided to go to the location on Las Vegas Blvd. by the Encore hotel. Tons of locals and tourists for 10 pm on a Sunday night. The tacos are Street tacos but something so simple tastes so good. We ordered 2 Al Pastor tacos each. The meat is marinated with pineapple and other flavors. They put an avocado cream sauce on it and that's what puts the tacos over the top. 

It does get crowded and I can only imagine how crazy this place can be late/early morning. But food is excellent and service is great. Food is inexpensive and it can be a hard place to find seating because it's so popular."}
{"text":"Always good tacos. The wait is always ridiculous. I've never had anything I didn't like from them so far. I just hate the fact that you have to line up in different lines for different meats/items. On this trip we ordered asada and al pastor. Both delicious in my book, but the al pastor is a big hit in many eyes."}
{"text":"Affordable, with quick lines appropriate for the meat you want, workers who know English and Spanish, as well as super good service! The food tastes great and there is plenty of seating! Convenient location too, plus a nice focus on only tacos. The most authentic Mexican food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The best taco shop I've been to. The service was great and very fast. The store was clean taken care of. I ordered the steak tacos and also the pork tacos. The flavor and freshness, out of this world. I will definitely return and recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"FUCK! the line is hella long... imagine standing in line for 20 mins or more IN VEGAS in the heat at a place that doesn't have AC and jacked up fans... 

Hey, the line is SO WORTH IT!! Oh. My. Gawd....!!! I am a fan. It's so good I'd wait inline again.

I felt like I was in Mexico... VERY authentic.

I got the chicken and beef tacos. I ordered 10- 5 for me and 5 for my sister. We were starved! My nephew had AAU Basketball tournaments all day.

Once you get in:KNOW what you want. There are line for each option. 

Next time I am going to try their Carne Asada fries. mmm! 

minus a star for the long ass lines and hot ass spot!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Had tacos, adabodo fries etc... meats were very tender and juicy. This is a must try restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"Best food my wife and I had  in Vegas. The tacos are amazing! And the price is very fair, not expensive at all."}
{"text":"Worse carne asada tacos I have had in my life!!! So gross. The taste of charcoal was overpowering. I threw them away and was so mad that I stood in a line for over an hour for those nasty things!!! And don't get me started on how horrible the ordering and paying system is! If you want beef or chorizo you stand in 1 long ass line, if you want a all pastor or adobado you have to stand in another, oh and you want fries? Yup that's another line! Then when u get ur food, go stand in another hour long line to get a table! Nightmare! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!! I highly recommend this place.  Definitely beats Los Tacos in the same complex on prices and quality!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't all ready been said. I went to this because of yelp, usually I make a list of the top places in Vegas to go eat at, but I usually get side tracked you never know what's going to happen over there so one day at midnight me and my wife went after a show I was thinking I need to budget after hitting up the fine dining spots so we went here all I have to say is that we showed up at midnight and the next day we where back at 9 am for round two the tacos are Bomb. The tacos al pastor are authentic, I don't care how much you think you know by going to places around the world and having the best tacos this place is good and original. This place started in Tijuana and moved to San Diego and is booming in Vegas. I live in the high desert and think about taking of to Vegas just grab some tacos all the time. If your going to Vegas on a budget don't go but if you end up going hit this place up. Don't forget to ask for some grilled onions and chiles and burnt tostada all that is complimentary."}
{"text":"Tacos tacos  this is the place to go ! No other experience quite like the El Gordo experience!! I love to go late nights lol .... the fries"}
{"text":"Best tacos in LV. If you haven't been here you must put this your to do list. Things to try:Al pastor, suadero, buche and Carne Asada are my favorite."}
{"text":"I used to live for 21 years literally 5 minutes walking distance from Tacos El Gordo and never once tried it. Oh how I wish I could take back those wasted years without their tacos. Tacos El Gordo has literally the BEST tacos and Mexican food in Las Vegas. And I've tried just about every taco truck and authentic Mexican food place I've come across since I was born and raised here. My personal favorite is the adobada and carne asada tacos. Meat is seasoned well, and so juicy. All the tacos are loaded with toppings like guacamole and pico de gallo too. Now I live on the opposite side of town and am regretting I took advantage of Tacos El Gordo in the past."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended. Maybe it's impressive to non-Mexicans that are tired of paying exuberant prices at the casinos, but if you come here and it's busy, walk away! 

I have to hand it to the management, they really want to give the locals and visitors the authentic and chaotic atmosphere that you might experience in Tijuana. You also will need your tourist Spanish to understand the instructions given over the loud speaker. The process to order your food is ridiculous. Hopefully you know what you want and you are sticking to one type of meat, otherwise you'll be standing in multiple lines to complete your order. It took my husband an hour to order some tacos because we wanted adobada and carne asada. 

The situation was bad enough to require them to tag team, so one can start eating while the other one kept their place in line. \"Stay alive, no matter what occurs!\"

So was it worth the hype? No! Carne asada and lengua were chewy and stringy. The adobada had the best flavor, but not good enough to return and endure this chaos once again. Tacos el Gordo should be named Tacos el Tonto! Tontos for standing in line for mediocore tacos. Adios!!"}
{"text":"We must have eaten here 5 times or more in the week we stayed in Vegas. Coming from north Orange county, we have TONS of great Mexican taco joints, but I just loved this place! If you like lengua, or even if you've never had it, you have got to try it here! BF was never really a lengua fan, but he tried it again here and he's been converted! The most tender lengua I have ever had.

Cabeza is also super tender. Adobada of course is a must have. They even have sesos. I've been wanting to try it for ages, but no one sells in the CA anymore. Well I can finally say I tried cow brains, but I can't say I liked it. It had the texture of custard (what I kinda expected) but it left a faint irony taste in my mouth that I didn't care for. But don't get me wrong, I finished that bugger! I just didn't go for seconds. ;)

I also love how they automatically put the salsas on it for you. So there isn't another line at the salsa bar. They only have limes and radishes at the self serve bar.

Don't be shy if you don't speak Spanish! These people are super nice and everyone speaks perfect English. If you have any question about what is what, just ask. When I ordered the sesos, they guy was like \"Are you sure? It's brains!\" 

FYI the longest line will also be the Adobada line. That's the first one to the right. Get in line, grab a tray when you get to the front, order your adobada, and then go down the line for the rest of the stuff. Don't forget to ask for your free grilled green onions and chiles too!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of eight a little past normal dinner hours and was amazed to find that the lines were still out the door. 

When I eventually ordered I was already about to pass out lol.

Their food is good and their sides are bountiful. 

My favorite is their adobado. Yo u can also order fries if you want. I suggest getting at least four or five so you don't have to get back in line. 

Even if you're not sure what you like order a ton as you can share or trade with others in your group. 

Their drink options are standard with soda fountains as well as the other Mexican Frescas.

When you're finished eating, be sure to try the fresh made pastries should outside with the dude in a truck. 

If you're in Vegas and don't want a burger or a buffet, this is a good option."}
{"text":"We had a variety of tacos. Pork, beef and steak. The beef was very tough and hard to chew even though they had cut it into small pieces. Not good at all. The pork was the same way. We were so very disappointed. Quesadilla very expensive (4.50) for the size, street taco size and again, and not good. We spent over $20 for a variety of food and threw it all away after just a couple of bites of each item. The place was packed and we were not sure why that was. Apparently some people dont mind tough meat to chew on."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! I used to be a fan of Roberto's until I found this place. I've been numerous times and have always had a great experience. The adobada tacos are seasoned rotisserie pork they are my favorite. Try them \"con todo\" that means with everything. I usually eat 4-5 in a sitting. They are only $2.00 a piece, and well worth every cent. If you get the adobada fries only get a half order unless you want to share. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Memorial day weekend and this place was awesome!! Best bang for your buck after a hard day & night of partying... We got there about 3:30-4am on a Friday night/Saturday morning and it was SLAMMED with lines out the door!! Be ready to wait cause people are ordering 5-10 items at a time because drunk hunger and affordability. Just be ready to know what to order and \"STAND IN THE CORRECT LINE\"!! Enjoy...."}
{"text":"BEST Mexican taco shop I've ever been to!!! 

The staff is extremely friendly and generous! They pretty much remember you after the first time you visit. We went there almost every day when we visited for a week. Perfect for lunch on your way to the strip.... or on your way home at 3am (hangover prevention). :) 

The carne asada tacos are out-of-this-world! Flavorful beef, guacamole, onions and cilantro on their homemade corn tortillas. The quesadilla is also amazing!! Tried both in a corn torilla and flour tortilla - both equally delish! 

They also serve roasted peppers and green onions as a side with your taco or quesadilla. Not sure what to do with those but just ate it separately... they are soaked in butter and good! :)

Dont bother with fancy restaurants on the strip... try this place!!! :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Didn't expect it to be attached to a gas station or have to wait 20 mins but the Steak Fries are worth it!

There was a long wait of about 15 mins on the night I went with lines wrapping around the building.

The signs and lines and the division of the restaurant is a bit confusing for non-Spanish speaking individual but Spanish 101 helped a little. 

The cashier is in an awkward spot, similar to a buffet, and you have to worry about moving through crowds and lines with your trays full of food."}
{"text":"Came to this place after hearing all the hype but tacos were horrible line was bad, different lines for different meats. Meat has no flavor whatsoever, get plenty of limes your gonna need it"}
{"text":"Truth is, these tacos have no flavor! You wait in line of a mad house and your all excited and you taste them and a big disappointment.. no flavor..... get yourself some lemon and bring a bottle of Tapatio cause your gonna need it..."}
{"text":"$2 for tacos (except lengua which is $2.25) pretty standard pricing for better-quality tacos throughout the west, and these are good ones. Considering strip inflation right in this area the pricing is really pretty good espc. considering how good the food is. 

Ordering is a bit grabastic at first until you see how the system works. There's like 5 or 6 different grill stations that each specialize in certain meats, with a sign up over each indicating which are which. You go to the ones you want and order the items you want. You can combine orders at one station too if they're neighbors with the other meat you want. Then once you get the food you take it to one of the registers and they ring you up."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a few days so we had to stop at Tacos El Gordo. It was a 20 minute wait tonight but totally worth it. We ordered 12 Tacos to share between the four of us. As usual, the tacos were fantastic and my kids finally transitioned from their usual order of a cheese quesadilla to the Pastor and they loved them!!"}
{"text":"Heard and read so much about this place!  Had to try it!  Very disappointed! 
Pros:  
* Super fast service
* Employees are attentive and friendly
* Plenty or free parking 
* Ordering & Paying stations are separate 

Cons: 
* NO SALSA BAR!!!  
* Only bar available has lime/rábanos in it  
* Tacos are very small & overpriced
* $7.50 for 3 little tacos... no worth it IMO
* Meat didn't really have much flavor, if it wasn't for the salsa they add on topic it would've been bland. 

I had 3 tacos, I was still VERY hungry!  Didn't feel like spending $15 for 6 tacos that weren't going to fill me up!  

I won't be back, I'll keep trying different taco places when I visit Vegas again.  

If any of you ever travel down southbound the 15 towards L.A., stop at \"Carnitas Uruapan\" in the city of Victorville, CA.   Now THAT is a real taco.  

Double big tortillas, LOADED with meat, big salsa bar, and only $2.70 each!   You can thank me later.  I'm satisfied with just 1 taco... I get full with 2."}
{"text":"I can see why this place is so popular. The price for the quality of food is unbeatable around the strip. We went here during dinner time and the line was out of the door, but luckily the servers worked REALLY fast. There were different lines for different orders, so I suggest figuring out which line you are standing in before blindly standing behind someone. Overall the food was good, but I wished they had some grilled onions to enrich the flavor."}
{"text":"Best taco place in Las Vegas hands down!! I always get the carne asada tacos and a quesadilla..but I saw someone get the carne asada fries and they looked better than the ones from Roberto's... definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"ERRRRMAHHHGERRRDDD!!!!

Came here with a drunk friend. Yeah, I had to babysit and he was craving tacos. Mini tacos. I don't even know how to explain the deliciousness of these tacos!!! I had the lengua, adobada, and carne asada. Yum, yum, yummy!

Best part is that you can bring in alcohol. They give you a brown bag to put it in (I know, how classy is that). Beer + tacos = YUM!!!

DO: bring someone who speaks spanish to order for you so they won't mess up your food.
DON'T: be belligerent and drunk and be all over the place."}
{"text":"Riquísimo.  Los. Tacos.  Y. El. Taco. Azteca. Mi. Ijos. Les. Encanta. Los. Tacos. D. Suadero muy. Ricos y. Papas con. Asada.  Ami. Bebe. Los. Sopes mm"}
{"text":"My coworker has been raving about this place ever since I asked her for a good recommendation on Mexican food since we just moved here from Southern California. My husband and I stopped in about 2 weeks ago. Having never been there we didn't understand how it worked. The cashier didn't explain to us that we had to order from the cooks then bring it to her to pay. So we ordered from her first and then stood their until one of the cooks called us over and rudely pointed to the sign saying \"what you want?\" I said \"Carne Asada tacos please\" and said \"look...look\" and tapped on the sign above him. I get that maybe he doesn't speak English but it didn't seem like he was even trying to be friendly. Once we finally figured out what we needed to do we got our tacos and carne Asada fries. The tacos were amazing. But the fries were meh. We wouldn't order them again but definitely the tacos."}
{"text":"In terms of value this is my favourite restaurant in Vegas. The best tacos Ive ever had for $2 a pop. I would definitely recommend the Adobada tacos with everything on them, but its hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.

Some downsides are that El Gordos always seems busy and it is probably not the most efficient ordering experience if you want multiple kinds of tacos given that there are separate lines depending on what you are ordering. If you are going as a couple or as a group I would suggest coordinating your order and splitting up amongst the lines. 

Even with the downsides the tacos are always worth it though. Just a fantastic, genuine, taco shop with no frills. Tacos El Gordo is a must eat for me whenever I'm in Vegas. Perfect for lunch or post Vegas shenanigans late night eats."}
{"text":"OK I have heard of this place from all of my friends from other parts of Las Vegas so I figured I have to go check this out and since it was close to the Westgate resort !! We did! we pulled into the parking lot!There was a long line out the door so obviously this place must be good!!We found out that depending on with me you wanted that's the line that you got into So the line that we were looking for was a lot shorter!! This place was very busy but the food was excellent and we will be back again when we are in this area I will have a few pictures so you can see this place! If you are in this area find this place! I hear now there are like three in Las Vegas so find one you will love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos delivered in a cafeteria style location. The taco de adobada is fantastic. Now a much needed trip whenever I'm out west look for great food and at a low price. Not a big spicy fan but this stuff is too delicious and glad I went with friends that convinced me to try it. Other menu items sound delicious and plan to try more."}
{"text":"The Adobada fries are terrific with plenty of sauces and toppings. The tacos are decent too. The place is packed and there is a reason why that is so, as there are few quality eateries in Vegas that are reasonably affordable. The adobada fries are $14 for a large, but three people can make a meal out of this, so that said is not a bad value for money."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas, I have to, like HAVE TO, come to Tacos El Gordo at least once. Maybe twice. These are super authentic and just the best. No wonder there are always long lines, but definitely worth the wait. 

They have different lines for different things so make sure you read the sign and get in the right line! If you want multiple things, I recommend coming here with friends and have each person go into different lines . 

The service is so fast and efficient here. I love that they make their own tortillas, it just doesn't get more better and authentic than that. Definitely get some al pastor and carne asada tacos. So tender and perfectly seasoned. The tacos come with some guac and you can ask for some grilled pineapples on top too. 

There is a station where you can get your jalapenos and carrots. Once you've gotten everything, just head to the cashier to pay. They provide the red and green verde sauces. 

There is a sit in and dine area but keep in mind, this place gets super crowded so good luck finding a table. 

Parking is pretty limited in their lot. 

Miss these tacos already. If these tacos are amazing sober, best believe they're even more amazing after a night of downing shots. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"When you walk in, it looks kind of rough...don't let it fool ya! This place is one of the best mexican restaurants in las vegas! I love being abke to watch them make your food right in front of you. The al pastor tacos are the best around!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are so good.  The al pastor tacos are popular, but for me, i cant pick a favorite.  I like the non spicy green sauce the add to the al pastor.  The other meats are served with an awesome guacamole that has sort of a whipped texture.  Never had the nachos, but i think you cant go wrong with anything on the menu. I dislike the ordering process.  If you are lucky, the al pastor line will be short.  Otherwise, there is a wait.  Yes, there are lines for different meats or mulitas and so on.  This is always on my list to eat when I hit Vegas.  Ive been there many times, but this is the first time ive thought to review.  You should go too!"}
{"text":"Adobado.

Easily one of the most amazing words in the world to say when drunk, it turns out it may also be the single most delicious thing one can eat while drunk, though there is competition*

Additionally, while my bubby would be heartbroken to hear this, I have to say that this place serves what is hands-down the best tongue I've ever had in my life. Ever. Though you'd better not be shy about what you're ordering, because saying \"lengua\" to the counterman means he's about to pull out the entire grass-licker of a cow and chop it apart in front of you.

If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be Hannibal Lecter's sous chef, now you'll know.


*They also serve Carne Asada fries, which is a 1 pound orgy of french fries, carne asada, cheese, sour cream and guacamole. I had to stop eating it because I contracted Gout mid-meal."}
{"text":"First time trying on January 3, 2018. And it was a no for me! It was extremely full of people. The lines for different meats was a little ridiculous to me. Especially when i have my son with me and he eats carne asada and i like alpastor. Literally waited an hour and a half just for one line. Good thing my husband was with me and he stood in the other line. Which was the same wait time. & good luck getting a table inside. Ladies were being greedy with the tables and were allowing other people sit down even after they were done with their food. Best thing i ate were the mulas de carne asada. Tacos de al pastor were dry and paying so much for a taco i would expect more.. i would rather go to my local taco truck and eat way better tacos and cheaper!"}
{"text":"Authentic TJ tacos. Carne asada fries are yummy! Place is a little loud and not so clean. Customer service not bad but not good, more like non existant except for the lady making the tortillas, she went out of her way to get al pastor tacos to avoid us from standing in long line...she gets 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Walking into this joint you might be a little overwhelmed at first (especially if you go when they're busy), but don't fret your pretty little head, you got this. The meats are ordered in different lines, so if you want to sample more than what's offered in one line it helps to have a friend to wait in another line for you. The advantage to this is that by streamlining the ordering and preparation process the lines do tend to filter through reasonably quickly so even if you go alone it shouldn't take terribly long. 

The adobada is without a doubt my personal favorite, it's hard to go wrong with grilled pineapple and smokey & sweet seasoned meat but most of their tacos are delicious, well seasoned/sauced, and interesting. The tongue tacos are also quite good. Definitely get yourself some grilled green onions and peppers, which are yet another line but usually quite short.

Sit underneath the stuffed cow head for good luck or to contemplate cows and stuff while stuffing your face with cow...or pork...

Also had a guy mention this place while out at another restaurant with my boyfriend. The man claimed to be originally from Mexico and said that these tacos were the most authentic in town. I don't know the veracity of his claim, but sounds good."}
{"text":"Busy but worth it. Homemade tortillas made in front of you. Asada and Adobada are really good. 
Get in the line you want to order from (separated by animal, beef, pork...), order, pick up and go to a separate counter to pay. Not rocket science but a bit chaotic if you aren't used to this.
I wouldn't drive across town again for it, but if I'm ever down here again I'll come back"}
{"text":"Fun fact. If you go go a busy restaurant youre going to wait for food, and if you go eat on Las Vegas Boulevaed, dont expect food truck prices. in case you couldnt tell by everyone else complaning.

Lets judge this place by its food. The food was incredible, GET THE AL PASTOR. My only regret was i didnt order more tacos."}
{"text":"My second visit here was much better than my first. Late night (3-4am ish) is the way to go here. Lines aren't long compared to during the day- so you will be able to eat your food hot and fresh with shorter lines. I love getting my adobada tacos and LENGUA FRIES here... such a good meal after dancing the night away at the club. 

Parking is still kinda scarce here, luckily we took a taxi from the club and back to the hotel so it was no problemo for us.

If you aren't familiar with this spot - just know this place is legit. Tacos El Gordo is based out of South San Diego, super close to the border. Yumm."}
{"text":"Most definitely one of the best if not the best tacos I have ever had. I got their lengua, cabeza, and carne asada tacos and I have to tell you... it is amazing. I really have nothing else to say. There are so many words that describe the greatness of this place but... I just can't. Speechless. 

PRO TIP: The wait is pretty long so definitely expect a long line... Come with 3 or more people so that you guys can wait in the 3 separate lines. There are three different lines (stations) with different meats so if you come with more people, you guys can wait in separate lines and get more variety. That's pretty much all you have to know. NOW GO!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Great price point and the tacos are great. 

However there is a real problem of people without food sitting at tables, when there are people with food, looking for a place to sit, ends up standing for 10 minutes not being able to eat their food.

Workers need to do a better job of informing guests waiting on their food, to give up their seats so people with food can actually eat. 

The last 3 times I've been here I've witnessed people sit down while someone is waiting in a very long line for them to get food, with a family holding food, standing behind them. It's getting too out of hand and these employees need to start doing something out it."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaaaaazing! I've never had better tacos in my life. There was a bit of a line to come in and it's busy inside but with reason. The taco options are many and the meat is all very flavorful. Definitely coming back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Best tacos and absolutely delicious carne asada fries.  Loved watching our tacos made fresh in front of our eyes.  We went at around 4 p.m. and there was barely a line up."}
{"text":"This place get super pack. And I can understand why. They have delicious tacos and the restaurant is clean. 

A bit pricey for a street taco sized taco, but it was worth it. Delicious tacos. Prices range from $2.15 - $2.45. 

They have all kinds of red meat... Asada, pastor, the spicy pork ones, beef head, lengua, and even sesos! Wow! They have more meat, but I don't remember their names at the moment. 

They do not have chicken. Keep that in mind. 

Their ordering process is a bit unusual though. There's three different lines to order from. Depending on the type of meat you want, you go to that particular line that is serving that meat. Ex: you want asada, line #1. Pastor, line #2, Sesos, line #3, etc. Then you go to the cashier on the other side of the restaurant with your food tray to pay. I'm just use to paying for
 my food when I order it or when I get my food, in the same spot.

Oh, and clean establishment. There are always staff walking around cleaning up the tables and wiping down the tables for the next party to sit down."}
{"text":"I used to go south of the border to have tacos... Now I go to Tacos El Gordo! So so GOOD! We hit up this taco place every time we are in Vegas at least twice."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick bite to eat while running some errands. Most of the time this is a busy taco hot spot. I'm sure people passing by can see without having to go inside since the line does go out the door. 


I ordered the Sope de Asada without onions...sorry but onions make me cry (literally). I would have ordered more items since they have such a value menu here, but I don't like soggy sope or tacos so therefore, like superman I inhale and go! Don't want to be bursting at the seams when I still have a long checklist of things to do that requires taking the little one in and out the car at every stop. 

Check this taco joint out if you haven't already, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The variety of tacos is awesome they have carne asada, tripas, lengua, cabeza, chorizo,nopales. The tortillas are homemade and the salsas are yummy! They also have carne asada fries. I give it five stars as far as food goes.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars was seating is extremely limited only a few tables and it is always super packed when we have gone"}
{"text":"I will have to admit, If you want real Mexican food in Las Vegas, El Gordo is the place. And yes it is way far from the strip. We literally walked down here from where we were staying at, but it was fun. Enchiladas, tiny mini tacos are the best. Taste real good as if you were in TJ or East L.A. My only annoyance is the huge crowd and some of the element of ghetto people it attracts. The place is big with a few tables and outside tables, but it can get really noisy when trying to order food. Chilli fries are really good, and i like the fact that i can watch the employees cook and prepare the food. Great place, i hope to come back on a less crowded night."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good, 5 stars but I am only giving it two stars because of the way you have to order your tacos. Three separate lines for every meat.. I don't see how this makes things go smoother or faster.  We were in line for 45 mins and had to stick with one kind of meat because we were not going to be back in line again.  I'd like to go back next time I'm in Vegas but I'll have to go during the day with hopes that the lines are not as bad as wednesday night.  I wanted to try the Al pastor.. It looked real good..maybe next time."}
{"text":"3 Commandments to Tacos El Gordo

1) Learn Spanish or bring an amigo who does. They seriously do not speak English here. I am not very good at Spanish so I had to communicate through a series of grunts and broken Spanish phrases that had nothing to do with ordering food.

2) Stand in the different lines based on the different type of tacos you want. You order your tacos and then after you get them you bring them all up to the cash register. Grab the condiments, limes, beets, etc. on the side next to the soda fountain. Order a cup of horchata to help wash down the tacos. 

3) Get the loaded carne asada fries. These things are amazing and ginormous. Please do not get one to eat all by yourself. You need at least 3 other friends to eat with. You may pass out or hurt yourself while operating heavy machinery. 

Heed these rules and you will have partaken in one of the most legendary Mexican food experiences of your life."}
{"text":"I Yelped Best Mexican Food in Las Vegas, and ended up here. Lucky!!! I know remember this joint from Tijuana and I shall say that it is indeed a true and authentic Tijuana street taco. No way!! Not in the states, ok, cause I never, ever ran into a taco joint that makes \"those\" type of tacos. The tacos are all pretty much$ 2.00 a piece and there small and have that crazy guacamole like in Tijuana. They also will offer you grilled onions, grilled jalapenos and have a salsa bar off to the side at no charge. Cool. Plus they have free refills. But like I said, it's the same taco they sell in Tijuana so why change it right? The neighborhood it's in is kinda shady . FYI..... that's the star that's missing on my review. Go and eat some delicious tacos, it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"If I'm going to rate this place, it's for 2 sole things: their slow roasted, tender meat(especially the suadero and spicy pork) and their free unlimited refills of horchata. What!? diosmio. Really though, there are more pluses. Keep in mind, their fresca cheese. Their salsa is spicy enough to sucker punch me in the mouth but not as an anesthetic, and I can still taste the fireworks of sauce and meat and celantro all mixed in. They're cooking and prepping right in front so you know there's no silly hide & seek games, \"where are they taking my food?\" Believe me, these kids are authentic Mexican grub-lords. They're more than willing to sample you a piece of their carne. That's how confident they are- and they earned it.

It gets better, the ladies that work here don't joke about a clean environment. They're so fast, when a group heads out, they're already cleaning the table for the next..  All the workers are always smiling. 5 stars all day, and in my next 3 lifetimes."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SERVES THE BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD!! The AL Pastor meat is always tender and moist. They have a special sauce they can add that is very tangy with a hint of Chile (not spicy). When all of the flavors come together, you can't help but smile. They keep every bite just add special as the first. Great customer service and low prices. I can't believe I've gone so long in my life without Tacos El Gordo. Please expand to the southern vegas/anthem area!!!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't all that. Meh! I tried the asada, chorizo and pastor. Ive had better, way better. I think having to stand in the different lines is stupid. Why can't you just order what you want and they get it for you? The taquero in the pastor line was very rude and a bit of a bonehead. Dont think I'll ever come back here again. Not worth the drive from the strip. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Best place for fast, cheap tacos! They're a bit on the small side, so it takes about 3-4 to fill me up. Nevertheless, we always come here every time we're in Vegas. 

Tripa (Tripe) = DELICIOUS! Crunchy and a blast of flavor. I always get this. 

Carne Asada = pretty decent, but I've had better. The guac tastes a bit weird to me. 

Adoboda (Spicy pork) = so yummy and juicy. Get this if you want to be on the safe side.

Lengua (Tongue) = tasty, tender, soft. 

Sesos (Brain) = Didn't like. Has a consistency of oatmeal with a strange meat taste.
 
Cabeza (Head) = bland...

Suadero (Shoulder) = good, but doesn't compare to the ones above. 

Quesadilla = amazing!! Good option for your vegetarian friends. 

Make sure you get grilled green onions and chilis (warning, it's extremely hot) on the side!  And don't forget Horchata!"}
{"text":"If you've visited Taco y Taco prior to coming here, then expect to be disappointed. They are comparable in terms of atmosphere, friendly service, location, ordering process, etc., but when it comes to the food, specifically the al pastor, there just is no comparison. 

You get at least double the amount of al pastor at Taco y Taco than you do here. They also do not serve alcohol, which it's not like I have to have, but if I'm  splurging calories for a taco, I like a nice beer to go with it. 

Seating is super awkward, and the al pastor line was crazy long. I would give it a 3.5 if I could assign half point values. I would come back if I were doing a taco crawl, or to try the fries, but otherwise I'll stick with Taco y Taco."}
{"text":"Going to this restaurant I knew I would have to wait. But as we stood there for 30 mins a lady who works there came out and started speaking Spanish to the crowd. Because I'm Asian I had no clue as to what she was saying. I don't know what she said but everyone who understood her were escorted inside. When you get the pork don't forget to ask for pineapples, other wise you won't get it. I did not realize I had no pineapple until it was too late, by then I was over it. Their carne asada is NOT good! They skimp on their dry carne asada and when they serve it to you, they place it upside down so you're left with even less meat. I'll pass on this place, I've had better."}
{"text":"Let's be real... I love me some tacos and I'm gordo!  This place offers delicious tacos at really cheap prices.  The lines are never too long and there is plenty of parking outside.  When you are tired of hitting up the buffets at the casinos, drop by this spot..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet! How is that possible, this is one of my SPOTS! Its possibly the best place to get tacos in las vegas. Ask anyone! I've probably go 2-3 times a month to this place simply because its the best. No one ever says no to el gordo... it will thwart any good dieting intentions, melt away your convictions but leaving you with no regret. just sweet satisfaction

It doesn't matter if you're new to Mexican food you're going to love it here...I am from Canada and had no IDEA what real mexican food was like. Definitely not a lot of authentic places at that latitude. But I instantly loved this place, and you will too! I recommend you try the The tacos adobada  or adobada fries... with everything on it... but MAKE SURE you ask for them to put PINEAPPLE on it. seriously its a game changer and if you don't ask for it specifically you wont get it.  If you get the fries, you may want to share it with someone.. even the 1/2 size order at $5 is crazy huge and shareable. 

Also for something different to drink, try the orange whip fountain drink. Its a very rare drink to find in restaurants, so take advantage of it at El Gordo... it tastes like a creamsicle!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. We ate here at 1am on our way home from the Strip. The adobada fries are just as good as everyone else on yelp raves. Seriously don't miss it. We had asada, adobada, and chorizo tacos as well as the fries (6 total), plus a soda, all for under $20. Great deal, great food."}
{"text":"So I was in Vegas for the weekend (Electric Daisy Carnival 2011)  and was hungry for some real GOOD mexican food like they have in TJ. So I yelped and found this place. It seemed to be raving with good reviews so I went there.

I got one carne asada taco and one adobaba taco. Many of the reviews said the carne asada taco was flavorful and delicious when to my dismay....it wasn't THAT good as I thought it would be. The meat was bit different than it was over in TJ and it definitely was bland. The guacamole didn't help it at all so I was saddened.

However the ADOBABA taco....WAS to die for! I loved every bite of it so much that I went back for a second one. Trust me, if you got adobaba tacos, you will not be disappointed. It's spicy and just perfect for your tastebuds.

I was going to get the carne asada fries, but after trying the taco, I wasn't going to get it and besides it costs 10 dollars to get it. o_O

Just get the adobaba tacos, do not miss out on this-

I'll come back to this place when I'm in Vegas the next time!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible!!! I would let all my friends and family kno about this place!!! Works was also incredible n the food was 5 stars n on FIYAH!!!!!"}
{"text":"Both locations on Cheyenne and the other on Charleston are superb! Tacos de asada y al pastor... Perfectos! Lol"}
{"text":"While your in Vegas do yourself a favor and start going north on Las Vegas Blvd. Once you see a strip mall near crappy hotels like The Riviera and Circus Circus you're at Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is a Tijuana taco joint that is also now in the U.S. They have locations in San Diego, Vegas and Temecula. Having tried the real deal in TJ, I was skeptical that the Vegas one would not be as good. But it is just as good. When you first walk in its a little hectic and confusing. They have separate lines for different meats.  All the tacos are good but their best is the Al Pastor or Adobada. It's a  thinly sliced marinated pork on a rotating spit. Make sure to order plenty of tacos and ask for the green salsa and cebollitas (onions) and chiles.  I also highly recommend the Adobada quesadilla and Adobada fries which is French fries with a ton of Adobada meat. This place is heaven for any taco loving glutton. I've had tacos all over Mexico and can honestly say these are the best tacos you will find in the United States. I was trying to keep this place a secret but judging from the lines there and number of reviews the secret is out. The Vegas location is full of tourists so it's key to go there at the right time which is early for lunch or early evening for dinner. During the 2am drunken hour this place is a zoo."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town to grab some tacos! Not too expensive, either!

I had a Taco De Asada (steak), Taco De Buche (pork), Taco De Adobada (spicy pork), and half an order of Adobada Fries. The Asada was nothing too special; your normal asada from any mexican restaurant.  The Buche was labeled as pork, so I was surprised when I bit into nothing but pork INTESTINES! It was surprising, but I LOVE pork intestine. Extra plus for that pleasant surprise! =]  Finally, their Adobada is DELISH if you can handle a little bit of spicy. They cut it off a huge slow revolving chunk of pork, and serve it to you. YUM!

As for their service, as I walked in, the place was PACKED. The servers were helpful and made the food on the spot as we ordered. When we approached the cashier, you can get your fixing of sides (limes, etc). All the tables were taken when we paid, so my party and I looked around. A group left as they saw us waiting for a table, and a worker walked straight over to clean the table for us! That's faster service than any other restaurant I've seen (high class or fast food alike!).

I will definitely come back, but since I live on the southwest side of town, coming here was quite the journey. Of course, it was worth it! =]"}
{"text":"The line is definitely worth the wait! These tacos are as close as the ones you'll get to the tacos from Mexico. There are lines for the different types of meats that they serve, and the carne asada line is longest. Quesadillas were GREAT! Guac and chili were a perfect add to the tacos and quesadillas, and not too spicy. The staff was amazing!! The lady's came out and gave ALL the customers in line iced waters while we we're waiting. Another one was going around talking to people making sure everyone liked their food and cleaning up. You could really feel the family vibes in there. Sweet sweet staff and awesome tacos in Vegas!! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The best place for tacos! Smokey delicious flavor. Authentic!!! Great prices! Best salsa!!!!! Love it!!! A must try when in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG !!!! Could have eaten here everyday while In Vegas !! First day I had 8 spicy pork and I'm not ashamed!! Effin delicious!!"}
{"text":"Got there around 2am and it was too crowded. So I decided to go the day after. I cam around 10am and there are a few customers. There are many stations, each makes some special tacos. Then, I paid at the cashier. The tacos themselves are delicious. They make in front of my eyes. Will definitely come back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Love their tacos! Totally authentic and tasty! Must try their horchata drink too! Their spicy pork here is amazing! When you come here ask for a free side of scallions and peppers. The lines here can get quite long but they do have several lines for various orders so pay attention to the signs that should tell you which line to stand in depending on what you plan to order."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love the buche, lengua and the adobada taco. We went there twice during our 4 day weekend. I would highly suggest making a stop, won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is suppose to be a quesadilla.  It was a small taboo shell on the bottom and a hard sopa shell on top.  It was $4.75.  The whole experience was bad.  Smoky throughout the place and too pricy.  No chicken products here"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Vegas for vacation, and wanted something other than food off the Strip. We drove around and came across this gem! The tacos were soooo good! It's definitely a go to if you are in the area. Just watch which line you go to because there are different meat selections."}
{"text":"My bro had been talking about this taqueria so we decided to attack it as a family! We ordered Al Pastor, Cabeza (head) and Asada. Our favorite were Al Pastor and they actually put pineapple on them! Excellent Salsas and good Horchata. We want to go back to try other stuff. You do get the TJ feeling in there!"}
{"text":"Great food great service needs more of a selection I think but overall if your in Vegas defiantly try it"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place. Do not expect to come in and be wow-ed with charm or ambiance or anything other than what it is: delicious and authentic Mexican street tacos. 

I have had the tacos adobada and the carne asada tacos. Words cannot express how delicious the adobada tacos are. The description says \"spicy pork\" but I do not find the meat to be spicy at all. The pork comes off a huge piece of meat that is hung rotisserie style and then carved by hand onto a corn tortilla. This is topped with a green sauce and cilantro and pineapples (upon request). I don't know what is in this green sauce, but it is beyond delicious. I think the sauce and meat combination is out of this world. I really cannot up-talk it enough. 

The tacos are slightly small, so I suggest ordering at least three. 

You know a Mexican taco place is good when there are tons of Mexican people eating and working in the restaurant and Tacos El Gordo is no exception to that rule."}
{"text":"Well...the name says it all! If you want some authentic tacos, this is the place to go. It might seem a little hectic in there at first (probably because it is a little hectic in there) but it's definitely worth it. My humble gringo suggestion would be to get the al pastor tacos or quesadillas (notice I am using the plural sense for a reason)! The carne asada was good but the al pastor was fantastic! If you want to be gordo for a meal, this is the place to do it at."}
{"text":"It's pretty much a given that the food here is amazing. The line is almost always out the door. My favorites are the lengua and pork shoulder. The only real problem I have with it is their line system; they have three lines, for different types of meat. SOMETIMES you are able to request that they get you meat from the other 2 stations when you get to the front of your line, but if you're looking to get tacos de cabeza, lengua and asada all together you may have problems.

Other than that, there is no reason NOT to go here if you have a car or are staying at Wynn/Encore adjacent. Cheap meal with more satisfaction than most of the Vegas hotel spots."}
{"text":"WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE SOONER???

What's wrong with me! I'm usually on top of these things, and I've been missing out this entire time. During my trips to Vegas, I spend most of my time at Encore and for the longest time I did not know about Tacos El Gordo. The boyfriend heard from a friend about this place, because it was one of his favorite places in Vegas in terms of food. 

ARE WE AT THE ZOO?
The boyfriend and I came during lunch, and the place was a zoo!!! Where to order your food may be quite confusing at first, but if you look there are signs at each station that tell you what they're making. So, you just go to the correct station and tell them what you want, and they'll make it for you. 

While we were waiting for our tacos, I noticed an employee wiping the stainless steel walls by the grill stations down with a towel. Then my eyes started to wander around the entire kitchen, and I noticed that the ENTIRE KITCHEN WAS SPOTLESS! Holy crap!! This place was clean as hell, which means NO DIARRHEA. YES!!!

After we were given all the food we ordered, we walked over to one of the two cashier stations to pay for the food. Yes, so you get your food first and then bring your tray to a cashier where they will ring you up. This is where you can order your drinks. 

OUTDOOR SEATING
With the number of people inside, I was surprised that there was a good number of tables available. I was expecting the table and seats to be filled with leftover food from the people who previously sat there, BUT there was nothing. Again, spotless! The tables are sitting under a big tent, so don't worry about birds crapping on your head or trying to steal your food. 

LUNCH IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE DAY
Between the boyfriend and I, we had one spicy pork taco, 3 carne asada tacos and one half order of their carne asada fries. I've been to so many taco trucks and taquerias in San Francisco, and usually the dirtier the place the better it tastes. But Tacos El Gordo was clean, and it tasted even better than most of the taco trucks and taquerias I've been to in SF!! =X 

CONCLUSION
Like I said many times in this review, and I'll say it again, this place is very clean. Even their stainless steel garbage cans sitting outside are clean, not a spot to be found! With that being said, if you're afraid of getting mud butt, Hersey squirts, bubble guts, the runs or whatever else you want to call it, because you've eaten dirty tacos from a dirty taco truck or taqueria, you won't have to worry here! You can get the same delicious tacos without worrying about having the run to the bathroom later. Haha, that sounded like a commercial. 

Anyways, I'll definitely be coming back for more tacos in the future. I love tacos, and I love that there is a legit place on The Strip I can go to, to get it! :) I want a taco now."}
{"text":"Tacos el gordo so far is the ONLY Mexican food that I will eat in Las Vegas ( until I venture out to some future places)  

I always get the carne asada fries and the mulas. It's a win win everytime. But don't be surprised if there is a line. Like I said, I don't even eat robertos now because if this place !"}
{"text":"Make sure you're in the right line when ordering because the people behind you will be pissed! Lol! The tacos here are delish!!! OMG. I usually go to the Charleston location because there's more parking but this location is awesome !!!!"}
{"text":"BEST. TACOS. IN. VEGAS.

Yes, THEE best! Just when I was convinced that the taco game sucked in Vegas, I found Tacos El Gordo and all my taco dreams came true.

Some people might not know how the ordering here works, so here are some tips. First, you order and wait to pick up your food, then you pay at the cashier. Depending on the type of meat you want, you have to stand in that specific line. Once you have your food, you go to the cashier where you pay. The soda machine is on the opposite side of the cashier. Tables could be hard to find, so when you see an open table you better go grab it. This place is popular all times of the day, so don't wait for the crowds to die down or you will never get to eat. If you have multiple people in your group, have one person can stand in each line and then one person save a table. Now that's teamwork!

-Al pastor is the fav here. It's not my usual taco order, but when I am here I get the Al Pastor. Make sure you get it with everything on it. Ask for pineapple, mmm! I ordered 2 tacos on corn tortillas. Also I am not usually a corn tortilla kind of gal, but from here.. Yes! 

-Carne asada was amazing as anticipated. I ordered tacos and the fries-- best decision I've made all week. Ask for peppers on the side. The carne asada fries reminded me of all my favorite spots back in SoCal. This place hits the spot.

Protip-- ORANGE BANG. Unlimited refills of delicious orange bang. Reminds me of my childhood in LA! They also have horchata and tamarind. I can drink a kiddie pool full of orange bang. No shame in my orange bang game."}
{"text":"This place serves GREAT tacos for a cheap price! The spicy pork is really good and I recommend it. They should expand this restaurant even more since it seems to get very packed and crowded! My only complaint is the sitting area outside had many flies flying around in it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Whenever I go to Vegas, I'm prepped to drop a couple hundo at whatever, no expenses are spared when it comes to fun. But this shining jewel on the strip is where I can get a great meal at a fantastic price.

Tacos are $2 or $3 each! Tons of meat choices: carne asada, chicken, lengua, shoulder, etc. They make them right in front of you so it's nice and hot. 

There are canopies outside for you to sit which are a godsend considering you're in the middle of the desert and it gets toasty. 

This place is a bit far from the Cosmo, Caesar's, and the like. Closer to Circus Circus but if you're itching to save some bucks on your food, then there's no better place."}
{"text":"Best al pastor I've had. Amazing.

Service was quick and on point. Almost like an in-n-out of Mexican food. Few choices: tacos, mulas, sopes, tostadas, fríes. Then you get to pick their meat choices: TOO MANY TO NAME. But the al pastor was by far my favorite.

Lots of seating and right by the freeway. And on the other side of the strip (avoid crazy traffic and crowds).

Great spot."}
{"text":"Mucho ruido y pocas Nueces
 I stop today during my vacations in vegas so  you order there  basically  in the counter then pay  afther and by the time you fined space on a a table your tacos,sopes are cold......
 I order adovada taco,sope de chorizo and chorizo taco where cold and Messi because the taquero buil your taco onions,cilantro and guacamole salsa adobada taco was good but the rest was bland no flavor at all
from 1 to 10 I give them 3  lack flavor
cheap I pay $10 for it"}
{"text":"So we yelp this place and saw that it had great reviews. We were craving carne asada tacos so we trusted the comments. As soon as we got in the facility, it was like a smoke house. You could hardly breathe. So we waited in line for about 10 minutes to find out that we were in the wrong line. Still trying to be positive, we got in a line that you could only order carne.  

We orders 6 carne asada tacos and carne fries. Not only did we pay about 26 bucks, the food tasted terrible. The meat was so hard and the tortillas were soaked with grease, we just left the food on the table for everybody to see. I was really surprised due to the reviews. Maybe it was just a bad day for us, but I don't think we will give it another chance."}
{"text":"Line kind of takes forever but food is very tasty! They have 3 different lines for what you would like to get. They cook the food right in front of you and it is super fresh. They are some hard working employees and keep this place moving! Didn't bother my tummy and it was very yummy!"}
{"text":"This is my first review and unfortunately it's negative, but very true. Service here is really bad. Avoid going here at all cost to save yourself from inconveniences. Here's what happened to us. (8 people total)

After a fun night in Vegas, we decided  to get some tacos. When we entered the place, we noticed there were different lines for the different types of meats. Meaning, you can only buy tacos of adobada/pastor OR asada, not both unless you and your friends divide into the different lines. The waiting time was about an hour. It's a struggle to find a table.

The cashier is separate from the ordering area. They make you get into a different line to pay while you hold your food. This can cause your tacos to get cold. One of my friends decided to place the tacos on the table and then went to get in line to pay. He was told that he needed to show them the tacos and couldn't pay causing him to go back and getring in line all over again. 

Then, we were eating and one of the ladies that cleans the tables, came behind me, to tell me that my asada mulita and asada tacos were not paid by my friend. My other friend jumped in and said she paid for them and asked if they wanted to see the receipt. The rude lady took the receipt not believing us and consulted with cashier to make sure it was legit. This was offensive, later the lady came to return the receipt and didn't apologize for her mistake. We will never come back to this place.

This place is loosing business/ customers, I find it ridiculous that if you go by yourself you can be limited to one meat only."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Las Vegas.  Hands down.  I usually get the pork tacos and the carne asada is amazing.  I also recommend the sopes!  It's quick and convenient for lunch."}
{"text":"This is the best taco joint I have ever visited. First act like a local and stand in the line for the meat you want, second just get in the adobada line and thank me later. The adobada tacos with the green secret sauce will leave you a fan for life. Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Oh my freaking God I am in Mexican taco heaven you have to try this place when you're in Vegas tacos El Gordo off of Charleston I've never found a place that could replicate the Tijuana Street taco at its best. This place is off the hook good don't even think about coming to Vegas and not trying this place!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is your no frills, straight up authentic tacos. We got the abodaba, asada, and carnitas tacos and they were all super tasty. The Mexican onions and grilled jalapeños on the side were also good. This place gets really busy so prepare to line up and find seats. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"They could charge for the smells alone in this place! A lil chaotic line situation as it's a busy place but all in all it's an incredible place to eat!"}
{"text":"I am a taco fanatic and have tried all the highly rated tacos spots and plenty of other ones across the Las Vegas valley. Tacos el Gordo is the best one  and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I LOVE TACOS EL GORDO. the best tacos in the US, but i will say the one in San Diego is better, just based upon the location next to the border. But read my other review on that place for more in depth descriptions. This location will satisfy your craving, is walking distance from the strip, and open 24 hours. Need I say more? always order one more that you think you could eat and make sure that one of them is the adobada! Thats all, you got it, wait in line, split up the lines with your friends for more efficiency and get some pineapple on the side! you're golden!

HAPPY DRUNKENFOOD EATINGGGG"}
{"text":"My Mexican girlfriend told me this was the best tacos in Vegas.  It's right by my house.  Last time I ordered the pork and it was good.  Today I got the steak tacos this time if flour tortillas and guacamole and sour cream.  Very good and probably the cheapest meal I ever eat at any given time. They also have my favorite drink Orange Bang. Haven't had it anywhere else other than Zippys in Hawaii."}
{"text":"I was dead from drinking all night. Sure to have the worst hangover in the morning. My friends were hungry and found this place on Yelp. I went along because I was too drunk to say anything. This place brought me back from the grave. I have never experienced anything like the flavor of these tacos. Sure you have a small wait in the line, but I promise it's worth it. The service is quick and the food is most excellent. This is a must stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The food is AMAZING!!!! I could drink a bucket of that sauce they use on tge Adobada tacos! Also had the Carna Asada fries SO good. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is so good I ate there twice in one day. The first time I had a taco adobada which was fantastic. The spicy sauce was great. The second time I had tacos asada and tacos al pastor. Both were great. A great place to try."}
{"text":"I've been to the Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista, and would give it a solid five stars, but this location just isn't as good! I was in Vegas for a conference, and stayed at a hotel very close by and knew I needed some adobada tacos in my life. The people are friendly and I got my food quickly, but was not happy with the taste and quality of the meat -- far too salty! Thankfully, I got a horchata to wash it all down, which I love the creaminess of their mix (even if it is premade, it doesn't taste like it). 

I think that because this is a chain, there should be the same level of quality across the board...with that being said, I still love you Tacos El Gordo!!!"}
{"text":"Flavor 5/5.
Service 5/5.

My go to are always the Adobada tacos!!! Also, their carne asada fries are delicious too!

Just be aware that you line up at whichever meat you want to order. For example, if you want anything with Adobada you go in that line, and for Carne Asada you go line up again in another line - if you are with a group, then you guys should split up into the different meat line for faster service!"}
{"text":"I love the food that I go to all the time taco is what I get all the time  the line are long but it would wait all the time I get between 4 8 taco"}
{"text":"We love taco all the  time  cheap  eat so many the best place to when you on the  strip"}
{"text":"Go here if you're reading this. I've travelled throughout Mexico and these are super authentic street tacos. Better than anything I've had in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos I've ever had.  I'm glad we were there at like 2 AM, because based on the photos in all the other reviews, it looks like there is always a line at any other time of day/night.  I think we made it there just before closing. The El Pastor was shaved off a huge slab of meat rotating on a spit.  We each had two tacos and took them with us to eat outside.  Less than 10 bucks for all 4.  I don't care how far off the beaten path this place is, I'm making it a regular stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"Adobada tacos....holy cow. I mean pig. Holy delicious juicy spicy pig sliced fresh off of a spinning rotisserie like Greek gyros are done. Corn tortillas with pork,onions,cilantro and some kinda amazing green spicy avocado sauce. Also the asada Mulas were great. Lines are a tad confusing but on a crowded late night things moved along just fine. The free grilled jalapeno and onions are nice as well."}
{"text":"Long line but worth the wait!!! They have different lines based on type of meat, so bring friends if you want to try multiple things without waiting in line all night! We waited in line for asada and el pastor tacos. El pastor were my favorite, so flavorful. Asada fries we amazing too! Best tacos in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent stuff. I like the lengua best followed by spicy pork then the carne asada. But they were all great. Their aqua fresca was not very good though, too watery, and dispensed through a soda machine instead of the traditional big glass jar.  Probably best as a late night eat but we ate it for a late breakfast and it hit the spot! The grilled green onions were a real treat."}
{"text":"I happen to be a taco fanatic.  I heard and read great reviews about Tacos El Gordo.  I walked all the way from the Wynn hotel which happens to be waaaaayyy further than I thought.  When I arrived I was absolutely starving.  I was shocked and disappointed.  The meat tasted like leather and had no flavor, very unfortunate.  Maybe they had a bad day and I'll give them another chance someday.  Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!! I live in DC and have tons of taco options but I love their tacos. I talked about these tacos so much that when we came back for a friends birthday I insisted we all go for lunch. Everyone enjoyed the tacos!"}

Love this place..
Quick nice and clean food..
Never got any problems after eating her Mexican food..
No need to say to much just go and try.."}
{"text":"Visited this place on a Saturday midnight. The line reached the street. Debated whether it was smart to wait in the line- best decision ever!! 
By the time you pick what you want, you'd be approaching to order. There's so many crazy options of meat! 

Taco de Adobada aka Spicy Pork with everything was amazing! The meat is shaved off a sharwarma grill & assembled right in front of you. Was disappointed I ordered only 2 tacos (they were pretty small like the Mexican street tacos)
The Tamarind Horchata drink was sweet and tangy in just the right amount. The Cinnamon Horchata tasted like a iced apple cider with a twist. 

My definite go to place in Vegas! Can't wait to return and get a larger order of these amazing tacos!! 5 stars for the cheap price and the tastiness!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm an Angelo by culture. Hispanic by color, and after waiting in line for 1 hour for street tacos: omg this brought the Mexican out of me-ole!!! Lol. Seriously good and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location when it first opened. I would bring friends & clients to this location. As well as refer a lot of tourists to try the real deal of the Mexican street taco.

 Unfortunately, I had unpleasant racial experience on the evening of Thursday, January 28th 2016 around midnight. I had brought in a best friend of over 30 years & his wife to experience this place. Only to be pleasant to the whole staff including the security guard, Miguel with a badge & gun, which made my guests feel uncomfortable. My racial experience though was the big lady, Lela, who cooks the onions & peppers. She had the nerve to try to skip me to place an order & call me a white faggot in espanol after I tipped everyone after putting in my order. We didn't want make a scene but she did. She refused to offer me any of the cooked onions or peppers. The staff has changed for the worse. I used to be greeted on a  nice professional basis. Now I'm being called names with racial condensending remarks.

Other than that the food is GREAT.

Can't say as much for the staff. Especially when they are catering to various clients from around the world. Also they need to put some smiles on their faces.


My apologies to Miguel, the owner, & Natalie for having to report this but maybe this will help make changes for the better. For the time being I can not refer you business anymore. Also will let my other friends in the hospitality industry know of this incident & refer to other similar QSR concepts."}
{"text":"The line was nuts and slightly confusing (I want all the meats!), but it taste incredible and is worth the hassle. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really good tacos and prices are really reasonable. Can get packed at times but that is always a good sign that the food is good. I like the Orange Bang drink flavors too."}
{"text":"Mmmhmm one of the best and quick spots to pick up tacos after clubbing!! They tasted pretty good! We ordered around 30 tacos and their service was rather quick. Once you enter, there are three different lines that you can go to and order depending on what you want. I tried the carne asada and the spicy pork (these are a must try if you are here!!!) I definitely enjoyed and recommend the carne asada!! They were flavorful and delicious! On another note, the tacos are small and I would recommend ordering at least 4!"}
{"text":"Authentic and wonderful. $2 tacos. No chicken ones. Everything is made fresh even the tortillas!  Great street food!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco I've ever had. 
I got 3 taco de asado (steak), peppers and onions. Wow! Spectacular!! Next to Encore in a strip plaza. Next time I'm in town, I might just stay at encore so I don't need to walk so far. Soooo good"}
{"text":"Tired this place for the first time over the weekend, and i must say they are pretty good.

I wasnt a fan of the location though. Super busy and its too small in the restaurant where you need to order. There were 3 different lines when you enter. The first line to the left will be the line where you order asada or anything beef. The 2nd line next to that is where you would order the al pastor or adobada, and the 3rd line to the far right is where you can order asada fries. 

We ordered asada tacos and my cousin ordered the al pastor and lengua. The asada tacos were soo good and the toppings that they put really just top it off. The al pastor was a little too spicy for me but still good at the same time. Price is not bad either. Most the tacos are no more that $2.50. Cant beat that deal. Especially when you're looking for something cheap and easy."}
{"text":"Always loud, crowded and can be intimidating. Ordering food here is different. Great place to take someone who will try anything. Kindly wait in line. It sometimes goes out the door. People behind the counter are always sweet and patient. Speak loudly and smile. After each thing you order they ask, \"with everything,\" and you will say, \"YES!\"

For your first time you must get the  1/2 order of adobada fries (not displayed on menu).  Order it at the right most part of the counter. You will have to wait a hot minute for these so grab a tray and promptly move left/down the counter to order other stuff. I love tongue tacos (lengua) and head tacos (cabeza). I usually get one of those with a mula of different meat. I prefer mulas with flour tortillas and tacos with corn. After you order stand back and wait attentively for your items. After your tray is complete take it to the cash register. Ask for a small drink and fill it with orange bang. You will need many napkins and a fork.

If you get fries you should share them. Get one item then share the fries ~or~ get a taco and a mula."}
{"text":"Can't believe it's taken so long to visit El Gordo. Here's the rundown:

Yes it's greasy Mexican food. No, it cannot be good for you. Yes, the adobada fries are the best I've ever had. No, I am not sorry I ate them all (in my defense, half an order). 
It gets hectic inside so pay attention and move swiftly! 

I ordered the half order of adobada fries ($5) and they were more than enough. Good fry to meat ratio, and absolutely delicious!!

Yes, I will be returning. No, I will not bring you back a taco."}
{"text":"Lots of variety with different cuts of meat. I didn't like most of the food as it was a bit too authentic and not for my taste buds.

The prices were amazing tho with $2.5 per taco. They were generous portions of meat"}
{"text":"We wanted something quick and decided at the last second that tacos sounded good, so we pulled a race car move into the parking lot - boy were we right about tacos sounding good, no wait, great! Ordered steak and spicy pork and we're still dreaming about them today."}
{"text":"Just so freakin delicious!!!!  Had tongue, asada and spicy pork tacos.  I could eat here forever!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my hubby for a snack and totally fell in love with their food. It's a great cheap eat in the heart of Vegas (next to the Wynn). Make sure you taste their spicy pork tacos! They are just fantastic! (and cheap, 1 taco = $2)"}
{"text":"I got this recommendation from my Mexican uber driver during my first visit to Vegas. I wanted to eat the best tacos in the city. The place is hectic busy. There's a line outside to make it to the line inside. Of note, if you're only interested in the tacos al pastor, you literally may be able to cut the line outside since usually the inside line for these tacos is empty or short. For the rest of the items on their list you just have to wait on the long line. The sitting area is definitely way too small for the amount of people they serve. You have to scramble to get a seat anywhere, and you will be sitting next to strangers. You pay after you get your order but before you eat. They do take credit cards. The people at the register will give you free hot sauce if you ask for it. Now to the important stuff, the tacos. They're small, street taco size, so get 3-5 per person depending on your appetite. They're served on two thin corn tortillas which do not taste freshly made unfortunately. I only tasted the al pastor tacos (spicy pork). The meat was ok, a bit on the dry side perhaps, depending on where it was cut from. They're dressed with cilantro, onions, salsa and a light green sauce (not sure if it was avocado based). They'll add pineapple if you ask for it. Overall, it was an interesting experience but I wouldn't say they're the best tacos I've had."}
{"text":"Bomb! Sad they left the strip but still drove out to the new location. It's THAT GOOD :) Can't go wrong with the Asada. Both the tacos and fries are absolutely delicious! Tripa tacos and sesos tacos are great too! Yes, the long lines suck, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"very good meal great place if you and your friends wanna go somewhere but don't want to spend too much money. loved the al pastor quesadillas I would say it's better to get one of them rather than 2 tacos since they come out to be the same price. they give you a ton of meat you will always leave full. great place always come here every time I come to vegas"}
{"text":"The food is amazing as advertised.  I got the pastor tacos and they blew my mind.  The meat, the cheese, the sauce, the pineapple...all fantastic.  Also got a carne asada mulas, which was equally amazing.  I could've eaten two more of each they were so good.

The ordering system is indeed flawed, and I almost want to take a star away just because of that.  There is nothing that prevents someone from getting their food, eating it, and not paying.  If I were the owner or manager of the restaurant I would fix that immediately.  Furthermore, there are three separate lines that list various meats and types of food (mulas, quesadillas, sopes, tacos, etc.)  There really is no order whatsoever.  For instance, what if I want a carne asada mulas?  There are two signs in different lines.  Extremely confusing.

In the end though you get your food, and I bet you can order whatever you want in any of the lines.  The food is literally some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  Next time I am in Las Vegas (or San Diego), I am returning."}
{"text":"This place by far has the best tasting carne asada. The actual meat better than Pepe's, my mistress and Roberto's my love. 

That said, it's a little pricey (minus one star). $2.00 for a taco? Not too bad. $4.00 for a taco sized quesadilla with only one tortilla??? Ouch! It's good food though, minus the guacamole. It's disgusting and I am a guacamole lover. Try it on the side?

They do have a variety of different meats. I've tried the spicy pork, which I think they are famous for, and the carne asada but they have a bunch of other stuff. The spicy pork is SPICY, but different in a good way? I'd try it once, and go from there.

I like the vibe of the place and it feels super authentic. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Sigh! 

I remembering loving the other location, but rarely go because of distance. When the one of 215 and Cheyenne opened, I was really excited. I wanted to wait for the hype to settle down  and decided to stop by for dinner last night.

I ordered two adobada (sp) tacos with everything and a half order of carne asada fries. The adobada was crunchy.. maybe overcooked. It was so crispy that it took away from the taste of the taco. The carne asada  ratios are way off. The standard order comes with a ton of fries and sour cream with a sprinkling of meat, cheese and avocado. The carne has such great flavor, but every other bite was gristle, so half of the dish was inedible. The excessive amount of sour cream made the dish cold.

I spent over $12, which is a bit pricey for what I got. The half order of fries was $7.. that's the price of a full order at Roberto's.

I probably won't be back, at least not to this location."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about Tacos El Gordo and had been meaning to check it out. I was on the strip over the weekend and figured it was the perfect time. When I walked in I was completely overwhelmed with the various lines of people waiting for tacos. It took me a few minutes of looking around to figure out that there were separate lines for different cuts of meat and that there were 2 counters on either side of the restaurant with the same lines and menu. You're supposed to order your food at the counters and then pay for it at either of the 2 register areas at the front (1 by each door).

After looking at the menu for quite some time I decided to go with 2 al pastor tacos, because you can't go wrong with those, and 1 tripa or tripe taco. The al pastor was tasty, well seasoned and cooked, which made me glad that I got more than 1. The tripa was ok, not what I thought it was and it had an interesting taste to it that I wasn't used to. I also wanted to try the asada fries or adobada fries but will wait until next time because I'm sure it's a humongous portion judging by the price.

Not sure why they have separate lines because the guy that was serving the al pastor told me that I could order everything at 1 station when he saw me standing in another line after getting my tacos from him. How nice of him for worrying about my tacos getting cold while standing in line :)

Seating is difficult if you come during lunch, just don't forget about the outside seating like I did. It was hard to find a spot that wasn't dirty or taken so had to sit at the table by the bathroom. Needless to say, I ate my tacos and was out of there!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I have tasted. The pork tacos are the best. It is so yummy that I want to go back just for these tacos. The best part, cheapest mean I had the whole time I was in Las Vegas. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ok,ok, I know from my profile it probably looks like I'm throwing 5 stars out at will but I promise you this place is a 6 star gem! There are two things I could eat everyday and as non-foodie as it may sound they happen to be Mexican food and NY style pizza. This place was hands down one of the best Mexican spots I have been too!

The restaurant appears chain-ish at first glance and looks like nothing special. However, the charcoal smell looming over the parking lot is your first hint that you are in for the real deal.  The setup is order yourself, pay and eat; simple and perfect.  

I apparently signed up for my own eating contest because I ordered 2 pork, 1 lengua, and 1 cow brain taco (don't know the Spanish term..I can hardly ask for agua), annnd split the carne asada fries - unbelievable!  The pork tacos were hands down the best I have ever had!!  They are shaved right from a slab of meat as the orders roll in so it appears in strips as oppose to the chunks/cubes or \"flakes\" as you may be use to.  Its appearance oddly reminded me of pork in a Chinese restaurant. The lengua was fresh, tender, and just right. The cow brains, don't judge me,  I was trying for the first time. I thought them to be more tender and even better than the lengua!!  One aspect of the tacos that made them so good were the toppings they are loaded with the best ingredients and \"salsas\" which only my pics can properly describe.The carne asada fries (also have pork option) were amazing! They are very similar to McDonald cut and tasting fries, which I secretly love, and the fresh cooked steak was nearly infused with smoke from the fresh charcoal grill it was cooked on. 

This is not a hoity-toity Mexican restaurant so keep that in mind when considering.  Most of the places I frequent that have the best Mexican you can get a few tacos and a pair of cowboy boots if you wanted.  They are hole in the wall places that dish up awesome food.  This is one of those places (minus the boots) and it is a must have if you are an authentic Mexican lover like myself.

Enjoy!!

{"text":"This is one of the best places I ever had tacos. Closest thing to Mexican tacos made in Mexico. I got these tacos de adobado which were so amazing! As well as tacos de lengua which were so good too. I can't wait to go back. I highly recommend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Im giving this place two stars only becuz I really liked the tacos but the setup is horrible. You have to wait in a separate line for each kind of taco you want! I was so disappointed. I wanted two of Asada and two of al pastor and I had to get in two separate lines for each, then get into another line just to pay by the time I sat down my food was cold.
The salsas are good except for the creamy green one they put on al pastor tacos it taste like watered down sour cream.

I really wish they would work on there set up because the tacos are good but it's too much of a hassle if you like more then one kind of taco."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time. Glad I finally had a chance to try out their stuff. My boyfriend and I ordered the al pastor & carne asada tacos along with carne asada fries. There was more than enough food for both of us. We were really shocked at how busy they were though. I went to wait in line for a table while he went to line up and order. It took about 30 minutes to finally get our food and it was well worth the wait. I noticed that mostly everyone had tacos and they don't offer burritos. What I liked most about this place was that even though with their outdoor seating, they had heaters and a tent to cover around all the tables. It made our meal much more enjoyable.

Parking wasn't a problem since there was a parking lot nearby. Can't wait until the next time we're back in Vegas! We plan on coming back."}
{"text":"when i went to las vegas tacos el gordo, I had the tacos and the carne asada fries. When I got through that horrific line and received my food, there was this nasty looking green stuff on top, they had no salsa choices, and there were bones on top of my fries. The worst carne asada fries I have ever had. never coming there ever again!"}
{"text":"We went there because of the Yelp ratings. I was surprised to see a line of people waiting under the hard sun of LV. It was worth it, when you get inside the place, you decide which protein you will get and pick that line, we decided to go for the Spicy Al Pastor because there wasn't a lot of people. We bought a few tacos and the price was cheap. Don't expect something fancy, no fancy just great authentic street tacos and that's what I was craving. I'll be back for sure if I go back to Vegas !!"}
{"text":"I went their two times and could not place my order cuz the guys behind the counter were too busy flirting with the chicks.  lol  will not go back again"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. 

My gf mentioned this place so we decided to check it out on Sunday before we headed back to LA. Parking is pretty big and the line was even bigger. Menu is pretty simple. Interesting was that the line forms in 4- 5 different sections. If you want pork then there's a line section just for pork, And same for beef and so on. It can get a little hectic and kind of sucks because you have to keep getting in different lines just to get a  few things. The pork line was pretty fast, my gf waited in the beef line for at least 30 min or more. 

_Taco de Adobadas (spicy pork taco $2.00) the most popular and the BEST! They slice the pork real thin right in front of you. The pork isn't too spicy but just enough flavor. The green sauce gives it a nice little kick and sweetness. Add some lime on top and it's the perfect bite. I could have had 3 of these.. oops already happened!
_Taco de Asada. (steak taco $2.00) I'm never a huge fan of beef taco because normally the beef comes out dry, But I thought this place may be different. Turns out I was right. The beef was a bit dry and after eating the pork taco the beef just did not cut it for me. I wish they added more guacamole sauce.
_Taco de Suadero (beef shoulder $2.00) The beef shoulder was a bit juicier than the steak taco.  I would pick this over the Asada but still the Pork is the best!
_Carne Asada fries ($10) huge portion. We shared this with myself and 3 other girls. It can get quite heavy and rich but so hard to put the fork down. I would do the Adobadas fries instead. 
_Adobadas Tostada. ($2.00) This was pretty good. The crunch factor from the tortilla was nice and the pork was again amazing! 

I would come here again just for the spicy pork taco and would like to try their sopes. I'm more of a fish taco person so don't go all crazy on me on my rating :) BTW great place to eat after a hangover."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and reasonably priced. I rarely go to LV, but when I do return I will hit this place up again for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I recently visited Vegas and wanted to try this place out. I heard some good really things about this place. Let me 1st say that if you go there, be ready for a wait. the lines are super long. I got the asada & adobada tacos. The asada tacos were good, but not great. However, the adobada were on the verge of magical! The were just so tasty and bursting with flavor. You gotta try them! The tacos were a bit more expensive  than normal ($2.00 per taco) but they are worth it."}
{"text":"Went to tacos El Gordo today after hearing about how great it was  and it was really good,  the line was long and standing in the different lines for different meat was challenging while I was starving but the AL pastor was great,  the tacos were tasty and I would definitely go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Tacos are good but lines are way too long (I was in line for 1 hr just to place my order), I feel like they can improve their way of taking orders...way too many lines but yet not enough employees and/or tables as well. need some organization in that place."}
{"text":"Holy crap. Best. Al. Pastor. Tacos. Ever. 

That being said, only get the pastor here. The carne asada was dry and lacked flavor. 

They have different lines for the different meats so I couldn't try the lengua so I can't speak on that but the lines were equally as long. The lines each took about 30mins each and don't even think about ordering a different meat than the one that is listed. One customer almost fought the server because he couldn't (not joking). The AC doesn't work that well either so if you're here on an extra hot day, you'll want to rethink your decision."}
{"text":"Spicy adobado is the best. Fresh, juicy and authentic. The beef tongue is pretty good too but it's not for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic - reasonable prices, but above all, food is just wonderful.  Standards like the adobada and carne asada are solid, but special items like cabeza and lengua are the real treats."}
{"text":"Unless you are someone who likes to stand in line and smell food cooking?   Don't come during rush hour.  10-1am is their rush hour.  Fourth meal drunkards is another reason why this place is shoulder to shoulder and spilling out into the street at Midnight."}
{"text":"The tacos al pastor are good but they need to work on the carne asada ones"}
{"text":"So good! I highly recommend the carne asada with cactus. Beware that the lines are very long and you have to wait in a different line depending on which kind of meat you order. It's well worth the wait though. The meat is so fresh, the salsa adds a great spice, and the avocado complements it well. So glad I came here. Seating can also be tricky, but if you look around for a couple minutes you should be able to find something as people are cycling in and out"}
{"text":"WOW! This place was absolutely amazing the spicy pork tacos were great.  I highly recommend the sopes with the spicy pork or carne asada they were unbelievable with the cooked onions and the jalapeno peppers, definitely the best mexican taco joint i've ever been to."}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT! Our cab driver was actually the primary reason we even ended up here and I wish I could go back and give him an extra tip for recommending this!!!! Despite the long line, the tacos were fresh and full of flavor. The fact that you have to make a separate line to pay can be a bit aggravating. Especially when your starving and all you want to do when you get your food is eat it!!!! However, Best tacos in Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"I love Tacos El Gordo.  Its definitely my go to place for tacos when I am in Vegas. They serve authentic Mexican Tacos and the tortillas are from Mexico. 5 stars for the price and quality of food. Whenever I am in Vegas, I always go here to eat tacos. This particular location gets busy and sometimes the line is out the door. I ordered my two favorites beef tongue (lengua), and spicy pork (adobada).

Beef tongue tacos:

The beef tongue tacos are my favorite! The meat is very tender and it melts in your mouth. They cut the meat right in front you of you, and tacos are made to order. They add a green salsa sauce and veggies.   

Spicy pork:

The spicy pork is served off a spit, and the tacos are made to order. The tacos comes with a creamy green sauce that is very good."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I came in cause everyone gave this place good reviews. I mean I'm sure other tacos el gorda are good but this particular one was absolutely horrid. I kept asking for carne asada fries and they kept sending me down the line. When I finally got to the line that serves asada meat, the worker gives me carne asada tacos! I asked him for asada fries again and he gives me plain fries. At that point I just accepted it and went to pay with my parents. They ended up double charging my dad for our food. When my dad went to correct the issue, they lady said that it wasn't her fault. After about 5 minutes of argument, she caves and gives my dad the extra money he paid. The food is ok. I tried some tacos and they were pretty good. The service is what needs extra work."}
{"text":"The restaurant was jam packed but it was worth the wait! The Campechana fries are to die for! The tacos were very tasty and authentic. First time here and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! We always make sure to stop here when in Vegas. Best taco spot in town!"}
{"text":"This guy is authentic. Started from the bottom with 1 chuck wagon here in Phoenix. I give them 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"***4.5 stars***

I could honestly just say...try these damn tacos, but that's no fun.

Tacos El Gordo has only a select few locations, which are Vegas, San Diego and Tijuana (might have missed some but these are the main locations everyone talks about). It's nice that this place stays open pretty late so the late night munchies is a must here. 

We arrived around 4:30pm and the line was ridiculous. They have a weird ordering system here where you have to get in line for each individual taco meat that you want. For example, if you want Asada you'll to wait in the Asada line. After receiving those tacos you'll have to get in another line for any other meats you want. If you're with a group of people, it's easy to split up and have one person order a few tacos in each line to share with everyone. 

El Gordo's has a wide range of meats from Al Pastor, Asada, Abodaba (spicy pork), Lengua (beef tongue), and etc. We ordered 10 tacos between my bf and I. We decided on pastor and Asada. Sitting there watching them cut the pastor on the skewer was mesmerizing. 

Taste test time. We both agreed that the asada was one of the best we've ever had. Everything from the home made tortilla to the guacamole was amazing and fresh. 

I wish we had more time to explore the menu however first impressions last a life time. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Expect a long wait, especially during peak hours (.. in Vegas, I'm not sure what times that would be but we were in it).

The flavors were unique, the staff were authentic, and the juices were amazing.
The carne asada fries, or any fries, were gigantic and they do not skimp out on any ingredients.  The tacos, while definitely tasty, are small.  My brother, who doesn't eat too much, ordered 4 and even then I question his satiety.

They hand make the corn tortillas in front of you, carve the meat from huge skewers for each taco, and you can customize it however you like.  They offer unique ingredients like shoulder and others.  A side dish of grilled peppers and onions are provided for every order as well.  I only wish they offered salsas because I absolutely love salsas.

Definitely an excellent stop for a Vegas trip, especially if you're tired of buffets and McDonald's.  The quality for the price is unbeatable."}
{"text":"I've always been too messed up to go with my friends to Tacos El Gordo at 3 in the morning when it was closer to the strip, however I've had it brought back to our hotel room a few times. I have to say that even though it's delicious to-go, it was EXCEPTIONALLY BETTER when I had it at the actual place. 

Even at 10 in the morning, this place was packed like a can of worms. I was still drunk from the night before (heh) but I remember three lines that had different meat in each line. I was too lazy so I just stood in the line for the al pastor. You go up to the window and you say how many tacos you want, and you get to admire the meat being freshly cut right before your very eyes. Then you take your tacos and get into another line to pay. They accept credit card so yay!

I ordered 3 al pastor tacos and it was SO GOOD. I was drooling as I was eating my tacos. The meat was exceptional. It was moist, tender, and flavorful; as is whatever sauce they place on top of the meat. I may have regretted eating tacos for breakfast later in the day but it was all worth it from what I can recall.

Tacos El Gordo lives up to the hype and I feel bad that there's another taco place like right next to it that may go out of business..."}
{"text":"Happy to have fund this place just  out from fancy hotel. I had 3 different meat Taco with a surprising coffee. The lobby of fancy hotel ask for $ 10 a small cup of latte and a croissant. (Not nutrition balance). I decided to get out of hotel find something better. 
This place is so busy. Many choice and yummy. 
I had 3 taco that has meat and cactus. 
?????????????????????Taco ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????"}
{"text":"Can you say PORK ADOBADA?!! Baboy introduced me to this place. Hands down THE BEST tacos I have EVER had!! They have the right amount of spice, they have slab on a rotating THINGY and the freshly slice the meat off into your perfectly sized taco! Get the pineapple added on there... a side of their HOT PEPPERS --They will leave your mouth on FIYAAAAAAAH and I LOVE me some HEAT in my food! Those peppers kick my ass and I LOOOOVE it! Also, the Adobada Fries!! Get a half order and it's still HUGE! The dollop of fresh guacamole makes it MMMMM FREAKIN GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the juiciest tacos I have ever eaten!! My whole family got adobada tacos, adobada fries, quesadillas, and tostadas 

I only got to eat one taco.. But it was SO GOOD. I would recommend to get just tacos
The others are not the greatest. My jaws started to hurt after eating one tostada because it's just soo fried and crunchy 

The tacos, however, omg.. Mouth watering, juicy, salty, delicious, wow! Don't forget to ask for pineapples on your tacos! They don't add it Unless you ask for it. Ask for extra sauce too! The saucy-er, the better. ;) 

The line was really long, almost to the door. But it went by pretty fast because there were a lot of stations and workers. It's definitely worth the wait and the hype. It gets confusing and people cut you in line, so make sure to stand correctly and know what you're doing! 

All in all, five stars! This place is a must go. I'll definitely be craving this place often!"}
{"text":"The experience of trying something new to me was exciting. I had to ask what things were on the menu. I tried cactus on my carne Asada taco. It was good. I also had a half order of the carne Asada fries. The experience was good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican tacos in Vegas...best service despite the massive amount of hungry ppl!! Can't wait to b back"}
{"text":"After a drunken night, my boyfriend came here and brought back tacos. He ordered the spiced pork, which I thought tasted great! The flavors and the sauce was great. No complaints. I'm hoping my review isn't biased based on my drunken munches, but I would definitely come back sober if I got the chance to."}
{"text":"With so many great places to dine in Vegas, why do I stop here everytime I visit? Simple, best Tacos in town done the way I've always preferred my Tacos. If you go to Mexico city, you will see the identical tacos I promise you. It's always packed so be prepared to sit outside. During the early afternoon hours and summertime, it really is a committment to sit outside under their tent and eat tacos while sweating but to me its completely worth it. I love how the stuff is always fresh because its always at capacity. I also like how they just put all the onions, cilantro, and sauces depending on the taco you order so it makes it that much quicker to get your food and get to eating. Been in two times out of two times I've been in Vegas and wouldn't hesitate to come a 3rd time next time. Definately recommend."}
{"text":"Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. 

I think I ate that many. I cannot recall how we ended up here after an evening of (redacted)...nothing much.

Stood in a line with a bunch of loud drunks. Our group split up to get a variety of eats from the different stations. 4th meal fun."}
{"text":"Yum. So glad to have one here in Vegas... Almost as good as the one back home in San Diego:)"}
{"text":"I guess this location re-opened. If you're ordering the spicy pork, the line was pretty short. However, I had friends who waited for the asada and beef tongue and the lines were pretty insane. The food is good but I wouldn't wait in line for more than 5 to 10 minutes for the food. Make sure you're in the right line because they have different lines for different meats. 

Payment system is very interesting... it is based on honor system/cafateria style where you order in one spot and pay later in a different spot. They also got rid of their outside seating which was a terrible idea because the whole place was packed with nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"I did not eat because they have zero options for vegetarians.  The food looked very authentic and the place was buzzing.  If you're a carnivore I'm sure you'll be pleased.  If you are vegetarian don't bother."}
{"text":"This place is straight fire. Everything about it was awesome. The tacos were a little pricey but that is expected when your getting something so savory. The ambience reminded me of south central LA, old school taqueria... I got adobo and carne asada. They also give you some roasted chiles that are awesome. I wish they would give u some chips but it's whatever's. Oh ya the salsa on the tacos is so bomb. Overall straight 5 stars, wish I could've gave it
More."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Probably my new go to for tacos place. Although it's located at a terrible location for locals (Las Vegas Blvd and Sahara) and the parking is terrible, the food makes up for all of that. I walked in and was so confused as to the process of the place, but after asking around, I finally got my tacos and I wish I had gotten so many more. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"As soon as you step in, the smell of oil and taco smoke was overpowering. I took my order to go, there was just no way I can eat comfortably inside the restaurant without chocking on smoke. The cool thing is that they make the tacos right in front of you. Our taxi diver spoke very highly of this place so we decided to try it. We order tacos of pastor, buche, carne asada, and lengua. We ordered 16 tacos and 2 quesadillas for 2 people lol. However, customer services SUCKS! I wanted salsa and the taco people sent me to the cashier, then the cashier sent me to the taco people again. Waste of time. I ordered so much food and they were stingy on the salsa. Also, the cashiers are pretty rude and so are the guys making the tacos. They have so many people go there they treat you like cattle. As for the tacos, I expected more but they were just ok."}
{"text":"honestly, bomb tacos for roughly $2!! i was starving and bought 3 tacos and even though they look small, man they are truly filling.

even if the lines are packed it goes by relatively quickly, and it really hits the spot.  im sure there are other people here writing ridiculously long reviews so i'll let them do that...so JUST GO IF YOU LOVE TACOS!

i also got their flan just because and it was pretty dang good, i think it was around $2 as well for a nice slice."}
{"text":"I had to visit this place twice before I could write my review. My first visit didn't go so well a few months ago. However, I think it may have been my fault.

I ordered the adobada fries the first time around, and was not impressed. The fries were soggy, and didn't hold up well to the mountain of toppings that were piled on top. In my opinion, the fries need to be crispy so you can pick them up and eat them like nachos. I also ordered no sour cream on my fries, and somehow my order arrived with extra sour cream.  Since I had waited almost 20 minutes for the fries, I didn't feel like waiting even longer by sending them back. Instead, I tried to eat underneath the sour cream  and focus on what was good- THE ADOBADA.

The gentleman with the jungle knife cuts from the hanging pork with precision. I decided to try the tacos this time around. With a few quick strokes, the perfect amount of pork falls into two corn tortillas and the choice is yours on what comes next. You can add cilantro, onions, salsa, avocado, and pineapple. I chose to skip the avocado sauce-- as it is just too runny. I would prefer real slices of avocado rather than this watered down version of green goo. I am not a huge fan of pineapple, but somehow this could be the best thing that ever happened to a taco. The flavor combination will make your head spin. My only small complaint is that the salsa is too mild for my liking. I was in a hurry, so I forgot to get one of those roasted jalapenos off the grill. 

This place doesn't offer rice or beans, but with tacos this good -- I honestly didn't miss them. The tacos were $2.00 a piece, and I put down three with relative ease. On a good day, it would probably take 4 or 5 to fill me up, On the other hand, I probably shouldn't be eating that much anyway - TAKE IT EASY FAT BOY! 

5 stars for the tacos

Minus 1 star for no rice and beans and terrible fries."}
{"text":"Store closed early at 4 in Vegas disappointed. Yelp says later disssapoimted.......straightnup tacos are not that great for being only thing open jack and the box is probably just the same this late"}
{"text":"I don't know what the big fuzz about this place. The food is not even that good and very overpriced. People think just because they use the name Tijuana they are good and thats the reason they are overpriced. Don't be fooled there are way better places then this."}
{"text":"I've never really been a big fan of this Tacos El Gordo, preferred the one on Charleston if anything but still not a big fan of Tacos El Gordo.  I don't know why but somehow I seem to always find myself coming here once in awhile; people do flock over to this location because its on the Strip.  Go to the Charleston location if it's busy here it's not that far away.  Honestly I like their food only when I'm either drunk or recovering  but I could probably get the same effect from a Roberto's which is probably more convenient. Any other time I just can't enjoy them.

When it's slow, which is when they're usually still busy but manageable, you can find a parking spot easily, you walk into the building, open the door and shut the door, you wait in a decent line, and you can enjoy your meal maybe on a table inside or outside.  However when it's busy, mainly weekend, forget about coming here, unless you're willing to wait. The line usually spills out the door and it's hard to find a seat.  You'll likely find yourself joining others eating their food on the curb or at your car. 

Food-wise it's alright 3 star maybe 3.5 tops which isn't that bad.  You probably heard about their carne asada and adobada fries, and their various street tacos they are a must if you never had it but personally I don't think they have enough flavor to my liking and seemed a little pricey, especially for the fries. I think I only liked them the first time I've had street tacos.  It kind of has phased out of my system, I do prefer a few other businesses more. 

Overall they are probably a 2 star maybe 3  mainly because of the inconvenience and madness that goes on. Yea it's busy because a lot of people want them but they could do something better to manage the crowd besides making the food faster, I don't know maybe it's just me being picky but definitely not a fan of the atmosphere. You can say it lacks good customer service but they do make things fast.

Most recently I brought some out of state family here it lasted only a few mins. We ended up going to a pretty good regular Mexican restaurant where it was fast, excellent customer service, served good food, and accomedating for a large group wiith kids, Taco Bell joking."}
{"text":"late night taco hunt lead me to this amazing taco place . Try there Adobada fries , they are so good."}
{"text":"Always fresh and great food . Try the carne Asada fries the portion is enough for 4 but you can order a 1/2 order. Been here a few times this week."}
{"text":"If you want REAL, AUTHENTIC Mexican tacos...Then this place is where you need to go. Tacos El Gordo is the BOMB! We go to the one on Charleston mostly and the wait is usually out the door. Love this place. I'm getting hungry just thinking about one of their tacos."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! I got two of the pork tacos first time through the line and went back for two more. Ordering is a little confusing at first but the taste and spice of the food outweighs any downside from the confusion. I would definitely come back if I'm in this area again."}
{"text":"Ive been to Vegas twice and both visits Ive went to Tacos El Gordo. The first time was as mind blowing as the next. I enjoyed every single part of the meal. Upon arrival you'll probably get hit by several lines and be confused af, ask one of the staff to explain each of the lines to you so you can line up according, sometimes they can get other things from other lines for you if it isn't too busy. When youre done picking and choosing all the tacos, (seriously get ALL OF THEM!) as well as a order of fries (half portion is enough for 2) get in the cashier line and pay the lady! it might be hard to find a seat sometimes especially if you're visiting on a busy weekend. 

The service is very fast-food but everyone is very friendly and will engage in conversation if you want. its as authentic as it gets. 

The price is cheap but it surely does not affect the quality of the food. I had tacos in New York at the Chelsea Market  and it was 3.99 EACH taco, for less than half of that Tacos EL Gordo has you beat ;)

The location was very easy to find there is also parking for those who chose to drive. Its also walking distance from the Wynn-Encore hotel! 

This has became a Vegas-Must for me personally every time I come, my visits were 3 years apart but the quality hasnt seemed to have changed whatsoever,"}
{"text":"Capechanga fries! oh my!! Love this place. Friend told me about this spot a while back and am so I glad I opted for this over steak n eggs! You can eve order half orders! Just imagine super fries but 10x better and thats capechanga fries for ya ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place in Las Vegas! The service is fast! The customer service is amazing!"}
{"text":"This spot seems like one of the best deals on the entire strip, and with all the great reviews, how can you pass this place up?

After a day spent strolling around aimlessly, it was time. Time to eat. It's been a bookmark for a while now and decided we'd make a stop this time through town. We were passing right by it - so why not?

The lines were kinda hectic, at first I wasn't sure what to make of it, but after a minute, I saw that there were about 8 lines for ordering your food; direct from the kitchen staff. Watch them cook up your order, then take it to the register to pay. Pretty simple once you realize how it works. Finding a place to sit and eat on the other hand, was a challenge. Five minutes of hovering around the tables, and a spot finally opened up - this place is packed with customers enjoying their meals.

The Carne Asada tacos were excellent, but the disappointer here were the Adobada (spicy pork) fries. Usually a fan of pulled or shredded pork dishes, the Carne Asada would have likely been the better choice to top that huge mound of (half sized) fries; I certainly am glad the lady and I didn't order the large. The pork was good, just not awesome or over the top delicious - I'll plan to stick to the Carne Asada if I stop in again.

With four tacos, a (half) order of fries, and a coke our bill came to about $15 - I dare you to try and find that anywhere else on the strip for less than $30. If you do, please let me know - I'm always down for some tasty tacos.

Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"This place was my go to place when I went to vegas! Probably the most legit Mexican tacos I've ever had! Their soft taco shells are made perfectly. I love the concept of having some sides to add on (they had turnips, lime, etc). I had beef, chicken, and I even tried the beef tongue and they were all delicious! This is the best taco place I've ever had and you know they are legit when the actual workers are Mexican! I love how the meat is in front of you when you order and they cut it in front of you. They make their own  taco shells and their meat are always freshly cooked.

Very impressed with the food. And the servers are great and fast. This is a self serve place so you go out to the patio and eat it outside. You also clean up after yourself. Perfect for quick snacks at late hours (definitely a go to place after night of drunkenness and clubbing)."}
{"text":"We are clearly visitors, and our friend from Vegas highly recommend this place. It's honestly one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. You can't miss out on the adobada one (spicy pork)."}
{"text":"This place is weird....there are 4 lines for different meats. If you want a lengua taco wait in the lengua line...if you want Assad go wait in the Assad line. The men who prepare the food talk to you like you're special needs. They're so rude and they don't understand how confusing their entire set up is. It was so loud in there with one man butchering crane Assad that was full of fat...I couldn't hear the man asking me questions all the while he was behind the counter rolling his eyes at me. I understand people come in there drunk however all your patrons aren't drunk and I clearly wasn't. I wanted to throw the below average and expensive taco in his face. The place is cramped, dirty and the tacos are $2.00....in LA the most we pay for an incredible taco is $1.50.....I don't even pay that when I go to tacos Leo or chato. Some yelpers have nasty taste buds or something. Don't believe the hype for this place or earl of sandwich.....gross!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to Encore or leaving... you MUST swing by this place to grab some bomb cheap tacos!! It's literally one block away. Nothing fancy, just some delicious authentic tacos. You walk in, and there's signs directly telling you which line to place your orders for specific taco's or other items you wish on the menu. It's an open view kitchen where you could see all the love that is going into it while seeing and smelling the meats being stewed or grilled which is pretty cool. After you place your order, you bring it over to a separate cashier counter to pay... And that's where you may ask for a cup for free refills on whatever beverage you please for the Vegas hot weathers. They have some pretty unique Mexican fountain drink options such as mango juice, horchata, creamy orange drink, some sort of chrysanthemum or jasmine lemon ice tea, etc. 

THE FOOD -- the two absolute must is the lengua (beef tongue) and the adobada (spicy pork).
Lengua - for some of you who gets intimidated of eating something like tongue... Well, don't be. I'm not one who ever likes to eat tongue or those sort of things besides two exception.. Now 3 (Blue Ribbon, Tacos El Bronco, now hello Tacos El Gordo). It literally just looks like ordinary chunks of beef... And it totally blows my usual NYC's fave taco spot's lengua taco. It's not as mushy but yet it's still tender.
Adobada - the spicy pork was flavorful along with the fresh topping and verde sauce. It wasn't too spicy too which is a plus for me since I'm a baby when it comes to spice.

The line wasn't long to order at all and I was able to grab a table right away. This place seriously is generous and stuffs the hell out of your tacos and the shell of the tortilla is so well made!"}
{"text":"Due to my other half's hatred towards Mexican food, I very rarely get to indulge in it's deliciousness. However, one night I paid a visit to Tacos El Gordo after my girlfriend's soccer game. I didn't know what to expect, but had heard rave reviews about the place from everyone and was terribly excited to finally try it for myself. The wait wasn't as bad as I had thought it'd be. My friend had ordered me two tacos--one carne asada and one al pastor. I'm the type of person who has the save the best for last, this also applies to the way I eat my food. I took one bite of the al pastor taco and it was delicious. I took one bite of the carne asada and it was even more delicious. Needless to say, I finished off with the carne asada, but gobbled both up quicker than you can take a breath. 

Based on my first visit alone, Tacos El Gordo trumps Roberto's and is my new favorite taco spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came here because of the positive Yelp ratings and it didn't disappoint, however, I attempted to visit on a Saturday night and the mad line inside turned me away. I returned Sunday for lunch and the lines to order were much more reasonable so I did order tripas and suadero tacos. The tacos were well above average, yet I expected the tacos to be the same quality as those from Taco Y Taco a few miles away. If you are in the area and crave authentic tacos, you can't go wrong as long as you don't mind long lines. I prefer Taco y Taco on Tropicana as my favorite taco spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"While driving a cab in Vegas I'm always on the lookout for something tasty.  Not only for myself but something I think other people would enjoy as well.  Tacos El Gordo is the newest in that category.

The tacos here are really good.  While not everyone may be up for a lingua (tongue) taco, the el pastor tacos are really really good and so are the carne asada tacos.

Just the other week, I actually brought someone here in the cab who was visiting from Minnesota. He was originally from Mexico City and hadn't had a good taco that he didn't have to make himself for quite some time.  I brought him here to Tacos El Gordo and he was absolutely amazed.  He said the tacos here were the best hes had since he was back visiting family in Mexico.  Personally, I've only had tacos like this on a shopping expedition of sorts in Tijuana but I'd have to agree that these tacos are pretty awesome.

While the price of the tacos is a bit high (even more so when compared to the price in Mexico ;-) ) they're really tasty and you'll definitely come back for more.  A Taco runs about $2.00.  Small price to pay for a piece of happiness.

Bring your appetite and leave happy.  They're open late and are very quick.  The service is friendly and while there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the way their counter is set up, walk right up and get yourself some tacos!"}
{"text":"These are the best Al Pastor Tacos I have had, every time we come to Vegas we eat here. The pork is really good and the asada has good flavor"}
{"text":"Outstanding! The place is a little unique... simple menu and a cafeteria-line style system... but the tacos are AMAZING! We also had the fries carne asada - and it couldn't have been any better! I can't recommend this place more highly. Great food. Unique. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"i would not have gone here if my friend had not yelped this place. we stayed at the encore and this place was right across the street, literally a 2 minute walk. since i lost all my money playing roulette, I didn't have that much to spend on food. Thankfully Tacos El Godo has all their tacos for 2 bucks, their quesadillas for 4 and horchata for 1.40. Usually shady taco places skimp on their meat, but no way jose, this place gives you enough carne asada in one taco to make two tacos. My friends got their famous pork adoabab tacos, which they couldn't stop raving about. From about 1-4 am on the weekend, this place has huge lines, but they move quickly. They have separate lines for the types of tacos you want, so make sure you get in the right one. I ate here 5 times during my 4 day stay in Vegas, and it never got old. The guac/tomoatoes/onion combo that they put on your tacos is superb. Also they have steamed vegetables/onions/peppers that are free, but you have to as for it with your meal. And you might as well get the horchata while you are here - because the food is spicy as it gets...you will need something to cool off."}
{"text":"Its a good, fast, crowded place. I love the Strawberry Bang.. I just can't find it anywhere but here.  The carne Assad has great flavor but isn't that tender.  Pastor was good."}
{"text":"I've been there twice since I've bookmarked it.

I really like it, even though I don't understand them and they don't understand me. Despite the communication issues (they speak Spanish, I English), the food I order is good and fresh!

I like the ordering process. You go and order your food from the front counter, where they have different people making carne, pork and other types of tacos, sopas and tostadas. You shimmie your way to the different sections to order the type of meat you want. I just point at what looks good and tell them I want everything on it. It usually turns out good for me, except for the fried  cow-guts taco I got. It looked like a tasty type of meat, but was a little fatty and too chewy for me!

I'll definetly go back for more. Perhaps once with a translator so I finally know what I'm ordering!"}
{"text":"Usually I expect taco prices to be like $4 or higher, but $2.25 sounds just right. I got like 7 tacos for me and my gf, carne asada and al pastor. I love the part how they added guacamole for the carne asada tacos. The horchata, especially from the soda machines was superb. It tastes like the type of authentic horchata I would taste like from Santa Ana taco food trucks. The only bad thing is that I wish the cashiers knows how to speak better English because I only wanted one drink, but she charged me for two drinks, oh well. When I was in Vegas for 6 days, the last three days, I have been just eating tacos mostly lol. Can't get rid of the taco taste. Can't wait to get them when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"These tacos are more authentic than tacos in most of San Diego. 

Need I say more? 

Una mas por favor!"}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty good but they are a bit pricey. The  Carne asada I thought wasn't that great, I think they use milanesa  which is the cheapest type of meat u can get.  The adobe were pretty amazing. The guy didn't skimp on the meat which I really appreciated.  No carrots available :/"}
{"text":"i love this place when i'm not sober. sooooooo gooooooood. Came here 3 times today. And I'm probably coming back for more."}
{"text":"great food! lines are always long. The service is ok, but sometimes the people who works there are rude."}
{"text":"This place is off the chain! Tacos for days! Super good and the taco selection is awesome!! Asada, tripa, lengua, and steak fries! If you want some tacos come here! Tends to get full so prepare for a line to get some food. Outside sitting and the toppings are great too! Enjoy this taco paradise !"}
{"text":"Good tacos here, I had the steak tacos with everything on them. It came out to about $2 a taco, but they are more authentic tasting then alot of shops out there. They are also opened 24 hours a day on the strip by the Wynn"}
{"text":"food is pretty good. always crowded. Just wish they put more meat in their taco."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo
The Lengua(tongue) Fries  1/2 order is the best bang for your buck. 6 bucks! 
Tacos are decently size, a little high on the 2 dollar side cause im a cheapskate, however 3 tacos will make you content. 

Most tacos 2.00 a taco, tongue 2.25, line is a huge mess, order first pay later. free guac.

GUAC IS FREE, ASK FOR THAT $%^. Cow Brain taste exactly like monkey brain, soft and fatty. I love tongue, but the way I cook it it tends to be more chewy like you're eating ligaments. I felt as if they kind of over cooked it but im sure thats just how they prefer tongue. Cow head just taste like any other meat. I should have tried the spicy shoulder pork, oh well next time!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal Authentic Mexican, on the Vegas strip! You don't need to know Spanish but you might end up learning some by the time you leave. Good stuff. The store surroundings is brightly lit and there's a security guard that looks like he means business. My favorite taco flavor was the one with the pineapple sliver. The way it works is you walk down the line, picking up the tacos from each one of the dedicated stands. Each stand has dedicated meats. Take all your food and pay at the cash register in the corner. It's all kind of honor-code that way. For some extra crunch, try a the whole fresh radish and take alternate-bites with your tacos."}
{"text":"Los tacos estan ricos, lo unico es la mala organicazion q tienen para las lineas, pido de adobada y quiero de asada, tengo q hacer otra linea para los de asada??? Por q no hacen una sola linea y cobran al entrar en lugar de al salir? En lo q estoy esperando los de asada ya bien me pude haber comido los de adobada... los tacos callejeros nadamas hay una linea y se piden todos los tacos al mismo tiempo...."}
{"text":"7 tacos later....OH. MY. GOD. I just tasted heaven. This place is absolutely amazing, hands down. My fiancé and I are hardcore taco/Mexican food lovers so we've been to quite a bit of places looking for the best. We actually thought we found it until now. Immediately after my first bite my mouth was doing the happy dance. We ordered 4 pastor/adobada tacos and 3 carne asada both with everything which was salsa, onions, cilantro and guacamole salsa and let me tell you both were PHENOMENAL. I was in my own world of ecstasy while the lady next to me couldn't stop telling her husband that it's been so long since her food had that much flavor. I stood in the al pastor line while my fiancé was in the asada line and I was done ordering in 1 minute and then he let us also get the carne asada tacos thru him so she didn't have to stay in line. I have 3 more days in Las Vegas and I will be here every night. Even contemplating breakfast :-0

GET.YOU.SOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! It is super confusing if it's your first time here ... we were standing in a  long line and noticed other people \"cutting\". Then we realized there are different lines for different meats. The al pastor line is the longest. I always get lengua (beef tongue!) and theirs was tender and flavorful. We also got the super fries -- sad to say that I finished it all and paid for it in bloat later. You can also ask for their steamed green onions and they have unlimited crunchy radishes in the back."}
{"text":"I've been to, and reviewed the Tacos El Gordo in SD so I was expecting the same kind of experience, I was wrong. Even though this location is a lot less crowed than SD the food and staff did not make up for it. Let me begin with the workers: Rude, rude, rude. I understand they have to serve a lot of people, but you don't have to give me glares. They were also very sloppy about putting the tacos together, especially the al pastor guy. Maybe he was having a bad day, but he looked like he wanted to kill someone as he put my tacos together. Also, the food is not very consistent. One of my tacos tasted like burnt meat, and the another was super dry. The rest of my tacos were good on the other hand. But overall, I'll just stick with going to SD."}
{"text":"If you have any Latino in you....you know that you don't wait for 30+ minutes for tacos. The lines were ridiculous. If they really wanted to make the experience more customer friendly then have the ppl place their order and pay, then wait for their number to be called. We just went to Pinches Tacos in Downtown."}
{"text":"Shame on me for not visiting the San Diego location first...Ugh. Better late than never.

Having had a sudden craving for Mexican, we decided to go here since it wasn't too far from the Downtown Grand.

The food is worth the long lines and lack of air conditioning. The al pastor and carne asada was juicy and flavorful. The campechana fries hit the spot...I need them again...like right now.

If you're in downtown Vegas, this spot is a must."}
{"text":"I was here right at 9 am and it was very very busy.  The asada tacos were ok but the el pastor was amazing.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Over hyped taco place in sizzling Vegas.
It was nice that they slice the meats for all to see, and I've never seen this in San Diego. However, I think I've tasted better tacos in SD. 

- Spicy pork tacos- it was just alright as it did not have enough flavor. Spiciness was mild.
- Lengua (beef tongue) fries- meat was very tender which was nice, but didn't find the combo to be that tasty."}
{"text":"This place ain't healthy eating, but the food is greasy-good.   I was suprised how much I liked the lengua (tongue) and the al pastor and adobada were both fantastic.  Good salsa, very fast service at the counter.  My kids and I were the only gringos in the place, which tells me the food is authentic.  I wish they'd open a location out in the northwest..."}
{"text":"This please is taco heaven!!! We went for the first time with someone from the area to this gem, seriously the best tacos I've ever had. We skipped the long line and had the trompo, where they carve the meat off the huge spoils and holy moly were they great! Tons of fresh limes and slaw for toppings. If I could give this place 100 stars I would"}
{"text":"This is the reason for the three stars The tacos were great but the person serving the tacos was a d... head if you don't like serving tacos then why you work there"}
{"text":"The food really is fantastic. The only knock on it is that they have a strange way of ordering if you want varying meats in your meal. You have to wait in different lines for each.

So, you want beef, you stand in the beef line and when you arrive at the counter you get your beef tacos, for instance. But if you want a pork taco, you have to take your beef taco to a new line and wait to get to the counter to order your pork tacos. 

It's a very inefficient and strange way of ordering, but honestly, the food is worth it. Go. Eat. You'll love it despite the strange ordering system."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The pastor was so good it made us come back wanting more for breakfast. If your in Vegas you have to stop.  
Ps: all of the reviews about this place being sort of a cluster are correct it is but over whelming but do worth it."}
{"text":"the tacos are good,but they are expensive and small for the price i think they raise to much the price."}
{"text":"I've known about this place for sometime and finally went.

Went to the Charleston location and made the mistake of coming here on a Sunday afternoon. The wait was over an hour, and we had to make friends with people that were already eating to secure a table for when we got our food. BUT it was well worth it! 

Here's what we got:
Carne Asada tacos-average. I think they only had it on the menu to offer something familiar to the people that usually go to robertos
Lengua (tongue) tacos-very tender and beefy flavor
Tripa (intestine) tacos-fried and crunchy, a little greasy, tasted like pork rinds. Good, but are probably better after a night of drinking
Adobada (marinated pork) tacos- delicious. The green sauce on it made it so much better
Adobada quesadillas- same as the tacos but with melted cheese. Good, but I could have done without
Suadero (beef) tacos- by far my favorite. Whatever they marinade/season/cook it in is amazing

There are 3 lines and each one only makes specific items. One strictly for adobada and the other 2 have a mixture. You order/pick up your food at the window cafeteria style and take it to the left to pay and get drinks. The employees hustle. They definitely have a rhythm about what they do. We spent quite a bit, but as you can tell,'we tried a lot. If you go in knowing what you want, it's pretty reasonable. 

While in line, we talked to a few people that were out of towners. Surprising to see how many there were since this place is nowhere near the strip. The new location is even further.

Overall, great experience and will definitely be back time and time again"}
{"text":"bomb.com every time i go, quick, fresh, and the authentic as AF"}
{"text":"Best street tacos in Vegas! Lingua, Cabesa and Adobada are my favorites. Super friendly staff. For the amount of traffic they get, they do an exceptional job keeping the place clean. I eat there every time that I am in town."}
{"text":"La verdad. Una decepción total.  Mucha publicidad y nada de lo que dicen es; la comida es muy mala la verdad está ubicada en un muy buen lugar y pues no sé si esté abierto 24 horas. Y pace como a las 2 am. Y pues mucha mucha gente pero a la hora de comer nada de sabor muy triste"}
{"text":"I'll start with the good- the tortillas and the nice ladies at the checkout. Now the bad- really fatty meat in the carne asada tacos; you might have a few decent bites, but eventually you're going to get a chunk of fat that you'll have try to discretely spit out in front of your friends and family. The al pastor has a bizarre too-red color that I've never seen in al pastor tacos in Mexico. I'm not sure if it's dye or something better, but I'm a little afraid of it. The line/ordering system- this is truly terrible. There are three lines for the different kinds of tacos. You can't get all three in one line and the lines are REALLY long. People shamelessly try to cut in front of you in line. Not really a pleasant experiences and the place isn't cheap."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some grub after clubbing (or just hang out with friends after too much alcohol in the bar), head to this place! I love their carne asada fries! They also have adobada fries, but if you want to try both, you can order half and half. They serve authentic mexican food, but too bad they don't serve burritos here."}
{"text":"When my friend Jay F picked me up from the McCarran International, our first order of business was food, and that food was tacos. As you can see from his glowing reviews, this is a Top 10 Vegas spot for him. And if you are a foodie who loves authentic street food, this will be INSTANTLY be a Top 10 Vegas spot for you too.

The small and unassuming taco stand is on the side of a small shopping center tucked away in a corner off the strip within sight of The Wynn. And for about 1/10th of the price of meals on The Strip, you'll probably get your best meal on or around The Strip. The Abodaba is spicy pork that is cooked on a rotisserie like gyro meat would be, and is then sliced to order. Amazing. And if you like the jiggly pieces, they've got Beef Head, Beef Brains, Beef Tongue, Pork Stomach, and Tripe. 

Not being much for the jiggly parts - except for beef tongue, that is - I ordered the lengua, adobada, and asada. At $2.00 each ($2.25 for tongue) these were amazing tacos, filled with meat, each with a unique garnish, and served with a huge plate of grilled veggies as additional garnish. It was an awesome amount of fresh, authentic Mexican street food for $6.25. 

As I told my friend, this is the type of place that Tony Bourdain would go nuts over on one of his shows ... great cheap street food with lots of the jiggly bits offered. And this is a must-stop for all future Vegas visits."}
{"text":"Omg this place was amazing, had the $10 fries with carne asada, cheese and guacamole so delicious best Mexican food ever, the service was also great and very clean  loved it hope they open one soon in L.A."}
{"text":"I get that it's Vegas but wow, around 11.30pm on Sunday night and the place is packed!!

Pay attention to the various lines, it is for a specific item only so make sure you're on the right line.  Divide and conquer if you come with someone else.  The line can be quite slow since everything is made to order.  As soon as you get your order, one pays one grabs a table.

We had 6 between the two of us and a side of the grilled vegetables.  Filled us up!

Spicy pork
Pigs head 
Lengua (my favorite!!)
Steak 
Get the grilled vegetables!

Taking one star off since their horchata machine was out of order but they didn't say anything when we ordered and paid.  The pina colada is pretty darn good too!

It's about a $8 uber ride from the main part of the strip.  Don't expect to go out partying after, you'll smell like grilled meat after."}
{"text":"A little whole in the wall where all the locals go and it is wonderful. The carne melts in your mouth. Service is so friendly."}
{"text":"I hope they make a chain in every single city in the states. That's all

We went here for lunch on a Sunday before driving home. It was packed and was confusing at first how to order. There are different lines for different meats you want, so make sure to look at the lines and plan accordingly. It really helps if you have a friend with you to have the friend wait in another line. After you get amazing tacos with variety of meat, you go to the counter to pay.

I highly recommend Adobada, Carne Asada, and Chorizo. They are amazing tacos for very cheap that every taco-lovers should try"}
{"text":"Best Tijuana tacos in Las Vegas, my favorites the Adobada, Carne Asada and the Cheese quesadillas. It is clean, fast and you can see how they prepare your tacos in front of you.
Don't forget to ask your tacos either with the corn tortillas or tostadas which will give you the same taco on a hard shell tortilla, same flavor but crunchy."}
{"text":"This business is a success. Period. There's a lot of things that need improvement but overall the tacos are authentic. The variety of meat is nice from Al Pastor, Cabeza, to Carne Asada. All of the Tortillas are hand made fresh daily. For the quality of the food you're getting, the price is reasonable. My only suggestion for this restaurant is to find a way to renovate the place a bit and make some more space because the customers aren't going away any time soon."}
{"text":"Man if you like tacos or Mexican food you should definetly hit this place up!!! The meat is super tender and well seasoned and the prices are very affordable, great for people on a budget in Vegas. The service was good and fast, there was a bit of a line when we showed up but they served us fairly quickly! The overall quality of the food was excellent! Only thing we didn't like was the fact that they charge the same for a flour mula as they do a corn mula ( the corn one is twice as small) and the lay out of the restaurant. Other than that it was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is closer than the original on the East Side. 
And just as good! Some might say the original spot is BETTER but I think both are delish! 
ADOBADA FTW!! NOTHING beats this!! We tried another spot, Taco Taco Mexican Eatery. We even did a side by side tasting! 
TACOS EL GORDO FTW!!! Yeaaaaaaaah! Cheap delicious eats! 

I wish they had ELOTE though!"}
{"text":"WOW the lines are long. But the meal was great, tacos at least. Fries were mediocre, I'd just get a couple more tacos if you wanted some fries.. 

Come with friends, get each others others and divide and conquer the lines!"}
{"text":"Fucking amazing.... adobado, lengua, everything I had.... I Live in California too, and this is a place visit every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Over rated!!!! We decided to eat here before checking into our hotel. Line to get in to order was about 10 minutes for the Al Pastor line. (They have 5 different lines for different types of meats).

After getting al pastor tacos I had to get in the asada lane while my husband was in the lengua, buche and tripa lane.!!! Crazy right!? After another 15 minutes in line while holding my al pastor tacos I was finally able to order. 

The line does not end there my friends! Then you have to get in a separate line to pay. (Order first then get in line with your luke warm tacos and then eat).

And to top it off you have ladies walking around asking if you have paid while eating!!!! What a mess!!! Eat here if you must. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Yanet no sirve se hace bolas y tiene un mal carácter siempre and peleando con los clientes. 
Miguel mucho cuidado con ella. Vas a perder clientes. Yo ya no regreso. Arriba los tacos el gordo de tijuas."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas. Meat is tender and fresh. The sauce is best I've had in a long time. Definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"The perennial question of these types of places is always ... is it worth the wait? I can't honestly judge this without a grain of salt having been to the original as well as many, many, multitudes of great taco places. However ...

That being said, if you're willing, interested, or just find the line not that intimidating, this is still the best place to get tacos in Las Vegas. The tacos come out piping hot and you will pretty much burn yourself trying to stuff that hot deliciousness in your mouth. Yeah I went there. 

I recommend going not a peak time, whatever that is, and just be ready for a wait almost always!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best taco place in Vegas. The Pastor tacos are the best I have ever had in all my travels.. including visits in Mexico. I definitely will return every time I come. Plus it is reasonable and you avoid playing high resort prices for great food."}
{"text":"Good and cheap. The place to be for overnight Mexican taco fix. Walking distance from the Wynn."}
{"text":"Wow possibly the best taco alpastor. They also add a creamy guacamole sauce that is sooo good. The prices are very reasonable but the wait might be long especially if you go on Tuesday"}
{"text":"Make sure you pick the right line when ordering. Adobada and al pastor on the far left."}
{"text":"This place didn't get 5 stars because of the salsas...they're not hot enough or tasty enough for me, the best one of is the green salsa, spicier and a little more flavorful than the red.  
          Some of the best tacos I've had in a long time.  I had the cabeza, carne asada tacos, and a half cabeza/half carne asada order of $10 fries! Yes, their fries as $10!! 
     I thought that the cabeza tacos were better, the meat very soft and a little slimy? typical of this type of meat, seasoned to perfection.  I don't konw if it was my particular batch of carne asada, but it was way too salty.  The tortillas are made of yellow corn, and are delicious.  They add avocado to their carne asada tacos, but not to the cabeza, apparently this is \"tijuana style\".  You also get a side of grilled onions and yellow peppers, they are delicious with the tacos.  Their order of fries are quite large and they are generous with the meat, however I didn't think they were worth the $10. They add avocado, cheese and cream to the fries, I uploaded a photo of these. 
    Their customer service is great, they are all very nice, the cooks and the cashiers.  They knew that it was my first time there, and they were very helpful in helping me decide what to order.  
     I was pleased to see that about 20 min into my delicious meal, the place started getting packed, which is a good indicator of freshness and quality.  You get your order pretty fast.  I would definately recommend this place.  
      The place looks very clean."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Tacos El Gordo ever since my husband took me to their location in Tijuana and then in Temecula, CA. Their food is very authentic and delicious. All meats have great flavor and even their gooey cheese just melts in your mouth. The tortillas are hand made and just add to the deliciousness known as Tacos El Gordo. Their carne Asada fries are packed with meat, cheese, and sour cream. You must try these!!! I like that they have multiple locations in the valley and their service is great pretty much at every location. Tacos el Gordo is a popular brand therefore expect some wait times during their peak times but the wait time is certainly worth it! 

The only negative comment I have is that they are a bit pricy and an order of a few tacos can add up. I wish they kept their prices as if they were in Tijuana, LoL."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite place to get Mexican food in LV... hell probably anywhere.  All the food is great quality and you really cant go wrong with anything on the menu (and yes I've tried everything at least once).  The most popular item is easily to adobada tacos which are heavenly and perfect when you're not trying to stuff yourself.  This place is also really cool because anything you see on the menu you can put on top of fries (like carne asada fries style!).  I always find myself coming back to this place and its always a go to when friends come to visit!

Favorite items: Adobada Tacos (w pineapple), Buche Tacos, Tripe Tacos"}
{"text":"Best Tacos I've ever had! The lines are sometime long but most definitely worth the wait. Try the Al Pastor tacos with the avocado salsa it's amazing. The employees are always great and give the place a great vibe."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. Tripe is amazing! Good place to hit up at 0400 too. Friendly staff, great food and cheap."}
{"text":"The best pork nachos(Adodaba) I've ever had in my life. So many toppings on fries! We're going back again today for more! We need a Tacos El gordos in Washington!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos by far.  I wish they had one in southwest Vegas"}
{"text":"The last time I was here I do not remember much lol. I think I fell asleep but I remember the last time it was a lot smaller. I came this time and business must be booming because its completely remodeled now! Its pretty nice now. and will accommodate more people. Went here on a Sunday night with my girlfriend so it wasn't very packed at all. Their ordering system is a little confusing but the food made up for it. I usually hate Tacos with guacamole but these absolutely changed my mind about that. I had the carne asada tacos and they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas. Bit over priced, but worth every penny. Had the carne asada pastor and they were very tasty...yummy"}
{"text":"Imagine real Mexican tacos south of the border, but in Las Vegas nearly walking distance from the strip. This is what you would call paradise"}
{"text":"Great food.  Terrible ordering system.  I have not visited the Losee location.  The Charleston location, ordering system, is plain stupid.  I love the food, but I bypass sometimes, because of the ordering system.  Insane....."}
{"text":"Ding ding ding! Winner winner taco dinner.

Do you like tacos? Of course you do, everyone does. This place is the bee's knees man. Went here on a Saturday night, and while it was busy, the service was quick, the food was fresh, and the taste was superb. Would I go back? Indeed I would, and I will. 

I highly recommend the Pork Quesadilla, a little pricier than the $2 tacos at $4, but twice the size and twice the meat, well worth it. Not traditional though, it comes with cheese, grilled green onions (yum!), salsa (fresh and spicy, so gooooood), and  some sort of sour cream-ish type sauce (also awesome), and topped with a tostada shell (small, but a little extra crunchiness never hurt anyone). Everything is made right in front of you, including the corn tortillas. I had both carne asada and the spicy pork, both of them spectacular. Saw someone else eating the carne asada fries, and while $10 is a bit pricey, it's probably worth it given the portion size. 

Looking forward to going back and getting more Gordo."}
{"text":"Amazing little place!! El pastor tacos and carne asada fries were delicious!! We got a half order of fries to share and it was huge! Go here! You will love it! Super fast, clean, friendly staff.will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"YUM!!YUMMM!!!!YUMMMMMMMM!!! 

The best tacos i've had to date! And i've had a lot of tacos. lol. I had the chorizo, pork, and lengua tacos. ALL SOOOO GOOD!! My favorite was the pork... Juicy, perfectly seasoned, the salsa was delicious, everyone was soooooo nice, it was just overall a great choice for a late breakfast/lunch. Very good price!

There are many places in vegas to eat and i went to alot of food places while there and i can honestly say this is one of the one's i would religiously return to every visit. 

That is all!"}
{"text":"Glad this location opened back up. Best Carne Asada fries!! Also, best Pork tacos I have ever had. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"When my friends wanted to eat mexican food on the strip I wondered the heck why. Since all of them were from San Diego and that's where some of the best mexican food comes from but they were raving about Tacos El Gordo. 

We got the adobada tacos, and abobada fries which I had no idea at first it was the marinate pork. It was absolutely delicious-nish. Probably the best taco I ever eaten before I love the sauce they use on the taco. It was good and very creamy. I like the number one fan of carne asada fries never having tried abobada fries but I gotta say they made a believer out of me. It was delicious and I love how much sauce it had. Yummy the definite mexican joint to hit in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tacos el gordo is okay not all that. The lines are insanely long for no reason. Their tacos the tiniest little things I've ever seen. Spent 28$ for 6 tacos and a tiny ass quesadilla that had barely any cheese. Go to pepes tacos on Fremont instead"}
{"text":"Literally amazing. Of course, their pork is perfection. As are their fries with meat... Incredibly generous portions.

Only two negatives: they don't serve alcohol and the lines for pork can, sometimes, get fairly long (especially with people doing takeout of 10 tacos a piece... Cuz they're so good).

But, if you order a quesadilla, don't expect a regular quesadilla. It's instead the bottom of a quesadilla with a large corn ship filled with guacamole on top. They have more traditional quesadillas, but the name is escaping me."}
{"text":"Yes, the tacos are pretty pricey. $2 a piece whereas I can find tacos for as little as $0.50 in Orange County.. Is worth it? Hell yeah it is!!!

Everything is prepared fresh in front of you (meat, tortilla). You get in line according to what meat you want on your order (there's carne asada, lengua, cabeza, adobada, buche, and tripa). Lines can get pretty long around lunch time; I recommend you go in the late afternoon or late non-weekend evenings. If you want different meats, best method is to divide and conquer. Have friends order in the other lines while you wait for yours! 

Carne asada and al pastor are the meats I always go for. Tortillas are thick to avoid ripping since the meat is so juicy (plus you'll probably be adding tons of salsa). You can choose to add everything to your order; everything meaning guac, onions, and salsa. Radish and lime are at the side bar.

Unique here is what they call \"Campechana Fries\" ($10), which is Carne Asada and Al Pastor added together! Super delicious. Fries were not soggy at all and meat was tender and juicy. Highly recommend this option if you're not into the whole finger food ordeal! *Campechana fries can come with or without chili cheese*"}
{"text":"Worth the 45 min wait the last time we were out there. Just wish they had better structure in servicing clients. It's a free for all, so I if you look intimidating, chances are you can cut in line and be out in 25 min"}
{"text":"Had suadero for the first time and loved it, the tacos are small but soooo fucking tasty!!! The spot for tacos nothing beats it."}
{"text":"After going here once, this place has easily become one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. My friends and I came here once for lunch after a night at EDC since it was a short walk from Circus Circus.

We arrived at about 2:30pm and the lines were out the door. There were multiple lines: one for carne asada (beef), one for adobada (spicy pork) and one for lengua (beef tongue) + everything else. My friends and I all split into different lines. The adobada and carne asada line took ~45 mintues to order, whereas the lengua line didn't even take 15.

I ended up asking my friends to get me something from each line.

Carne Asada Fries ($10): The beef itself was really good. Super tender and just absolutely melts in your mouth. The fries, on the other hand, were nothing special. The fries comes with cheese, sour cream and guacamole (although I don't think we got the guac.)

Adobada Taco ($2) and Quesadilla ($4): Easily my favorite. Definitely worth the wait for this. The spicy pork was probably the best I've ever tasted at any Mexican restaurant. It was the right amount of spicy and OMG was it juicy.

Lengua Taco ($2.25): The lengua here is a really close second to the adobada. The meat is super juicy (like all the others lol) and there is a lot of flavor.

Pork Shoulder Taco ($2): My least favorite out of all the meats, but still really good. It's basically like pulled pork, I would say. There isn't as much flavor in this compared to the other meats, but still, the meat melts in your mouth.

Even though waits can be long, I would absolutely come back here. It's SO cheap for the amount that they give you.

Notes:
- They give a lot of toppings on EVERYTHING.
- You order the food at the counter and then pay at the registers by the door. Kinda awkward when there's hella people in line and you're just trying to get through to pay.
- Open super late Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Great tacos. I took my mom here while we were in Vegas because I love Tacos El Gordo in San Diego. It's located North of most of the tourist hotels on the strip, but it was walkable. Also, you can take the Deuce and get off at a close stop. 

They only have one line at this location, which is nice because you can try the different tacos easier. I love the adobada (remember to add pineapple). The carne asada is good too. Their tacos are still extremely cheap even though they're on the strip. Also, the drinks are cheap. I had to get some horchata. But, they don't have any orange bang.

The also have fries at this location. 

Overall, this is very similar to the Tacos El Gordo locations in San Diego. However, they are a bit more sloppy with the taco construction and they only gave me one small slice of pineapple on my adobada tacos when they usually give me an entire plate of pineapple in San Diego. 

If you want some amazing food. Come here. Writing this review made my mouth water. Mmmmmm. Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"This place is simply AS GOOD as it can get when it comes to tacos.  The spicy pork is on another level.  I can't wait to go back here again!"}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall taco stand is AMAZING.  Believe the reviews!   It's about a 10 minute walk from the Convention Center in a sleezy-looking strip mall (filled with souvenir shops, AYCE Korean buffet,  AYCE Indian buffet and foot massage parlors) but it is quintessential tacos at their best.   At first glance, it looks like you would most likely get sick from eating here, but no, no, no..... so good.   I had the lengua and adobo (spicy pork) and I wish I got more.   They are cheap!  $2.25 a taco and a soda machine with Mexican sodas (I noticed that nobody was at that soda fountain.... instead they were all at the regular Coke/Sprite/Fanta machine so I just wound up getting a cup of water).  The seating is limited -- I wound up eating outside while standing next to the trash can..... but it was really an experience!   So rather than eating at the Denny's down the street or shopping the food section at Walgreens, just know that this is a tried-and-true taco shop.  So amazing! Worth the walk from the convention center, and frankly, any place on the strip if you are looking for great food and a real bargain!"}
{"text":"A must when we're in San Diego
Always busy
But worth it
Parking sucks
Seating sucks
But the tacos are worth it"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas! I have yet to find better. I would highly recommend their adobada (spicy pork) tacos."}
{"text":"Place is fabulous! Asada tacos is what we had, just amount of meat, cilantro, cheap and yummy and filling. Looks not so hot on the outside and very warm inside but staff is fun and lively. Place was clean for the amount of people shoved in there. Awesome, loved the grill views... 
Kids loved it. Yummy and filling and good for the money."}
{"text":"I really don't have a whole lot to say ... the tacos here are cheap and delicious, and the place is open late (2-4AM, depending on the night). It's conveniently within close walking distance of the Wynn/Encore, if you happen to be staying there. If you're looking for a quick, simple, tasty, and affordable meal, you can't go wrong with this place. It's not as fancy as many places on the Strip, but it's definitely satisfying all the same."}
{"text":"Great tacos!!! I've been to the location in Chula Vista but was not impressed. I don't know what it is about this place but the tacos de al pastor and tripas were the best. Salsas are great, everything is fresh. The downfall to it is that you have to wait in line to get in and than when inside the lines are split. Kinda confusing but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Good tacos. I tried cabeza, lengua, buche, and suadero. All very delicious !!! It was packed! That's the only bad part. Limited sitting."}
{"text":"Let me just preface this...you will wait in a line. A long one probably, it will be hot and sticky...be sure to come properly dressed and with water. I do not advise you coming here after a show where you dressed up real nice and in uncomfortable shoes. 

Located in a strip mall at the north end of the Strip, you'll be wondering why people would stand in line for a taco joint? Being from Texas, I've had my fair share of street tacos, so it could it be that good? After about a 30-45min wait we finally got to the ordering stand, there are a few lines however, and you have to choose a particular line for a particular food and hunt down a table.

We ordered the large carne asada fries. While the portion was huge, I thought it was just ok. Taste waste I felt it could've used a little bit more kick, maybe a spicy taste to it. It satisfied a light night hunger pain, but would I wait in that massive line again for it? Maybe not."}
{"text":"I was sooo excited when I found out they had Tacos El Gordo in Vegas and not just San Diego.  Needless to say I stuffed my face and left with a happy fat belly. Come here if you're craving TJ tacos minus the chorro."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!! THIS REVIEW IS ON A RUDE EMPLOYEE!!!!!! So we love coming here because the food is great.  Most of the staff is very friendly and they do try to keep the place clean.  But there is this a-hole that work the al pastor how is extremely rude. I think his name is Javier but in not sure.  He is a light skin,  bigger set man who is always there upwards the night time. He has been rude before but we thought it was just stress due to how buzzy this place gets so we let it slide.  But this last time was the final straw. We took out of town people to try this place.  We get there and they make us wait 25 minutes because the al pastor has to cook. Okay,  time to place our order.  We ask for 18 tacos and he starts prepping them. Once he is half way we all for 2 mulitas. He looks at us and says why didn't you say earlier.  Well we didn't want to get him confused because he has a tenancy of doing that and we told him.  He start going off staying that he won't get confused cause he has 30 years in tacos and he won't make mistakes (really a-hole cause your track record states otherwise). So we tell him we don't care and we need our 2 mulitas. Mind you he doesn't even cook them.  The order is place with him and someone else from the back comes and makes them.  So why he got all rude is ridiculous. Needless to say I'm not coming here anymore. I rather go to the Charleston location.  I never had rude service there."}
{"text":"This place is worth the praise and hype. These are by far the best al pastor (adobada) tacos I've ever had period. They slice the meat right in front of you per order and if you are lucky you will get a piece of meat that is a bit charred with a little fat, it's like pork crack. Definitely have to try this spot when in Vegas but go early as the lines at night are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very tasty tacos. Only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's pretty expensive for one taco. If they were even $1.50 a piece I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The tacos are good, but their line system is ridiculous! By the time we got out of the lines, my tacos were cold ."}
{"text":"Who says there's no culture in Vegas? Been coming here forever and if you think Benihana and all you can eat Brazilian steak is culture, you need to get your gordo   trasero ( fat butt) down to the TEG! You'll feel  like you died and went to Mexico, only they speak english and are not trying to rip you off, just feed you most authentic taco you will find in Nevada. All at the taco  $ 2  store- simple menu, all for one low price, how nice is that? The 5 stars are for bein' real, the food is more like  a 4.
This place is seriously off the hook, as far as a basic taco joint goes. What you see is what you get, BYOB as well. The menu consist of essentially 2 things, meat and meat. Pork in a few versions , the Abodaba is killer,nothing like it anywhere I've eaten- plus the usual body parts cabeza ( brain) lengua ( tongue)  Buche  ( pork stomach) and asada, you can top off your asada with some silky nopal (cactus) all wrapped in their handmade tortillas.Tacos are very simple  meat, onions, guac, hot sauce and a white sauce I can't place that smooths the whole thing over sprinkled with a little cilantro. No beans at all. Be sure to try the different windows, one for pork the other beef. It's a bit of a pain, especially if busy, tag team it with  pals if so.
The attire and clientele   is all over the map ...tattooed chicas in heels and sparkle, hombres with cowboy boots, families with kids, dates, teens on skateboards, toasted college and other kids in town, locals and outta town tourista latinos of every sort..it's all here, under the red tent out front, sitting down at the stainless steel booths. Self serve order at the window, get your grub and pay before leaving. Right on the strip, next to the entrance to the Encore. Step right up amigo."}
{"text":"Boggles the mind that such an authentic spot could be located so close to the heart of Las Vegas. We were staying at the Wynn Encore and it was a very short walk. There are multiple lines with signs saying what kind of taco you can pick up. It's confusing at first, however, people are very helpful & friendly.

DH's favorite was the spicy pork, which wasn't actually that spicy. You can get it with a little pineapple. They shave it off a pineapple impaled on the top of the vertical spit. All of our tacos were yummy. Spicy pork, though, was the best!

The tacos are small. DH is a light eater & he killed 4 without difficulty. So, not that cheap, but still a good deal by Vegas standards.

The place is crowded with locals, but turnover is quick so you can grab a table after you pay. Dinged them one star because their drink machines ran out of flavor syrup. We waited a long time, but they didn't refill it. First time around, the horchata & tamarind drinks were excellent."}
{"text":"This place is good but the line is stupid long instead of making everyone work together they rather have 1 guy trying to serve 30 people alpastor instead of having the other workers help. By the time you get your food your ether starve to death or your annoyed. They need to step it up with the alpastor"}
{"text":"WHERE: Charleston & a little passed Maryland (toward the East).

WHEN: I believe it's open until 3 or 4am. If you land there within that time frame, be sure to call them and ask beforehand! Please and thanks =).

WHY: Tacos, tacos, and more TACOS!

WHAT: While at work, my co-workers and I were talking about how hungry we were! One of my co's mentioned that she went with another co to a Mexican spot the other night, and also mentioned how delicious it was! I automatically hopped on that conversation and asked what this wonderful place could be!

Then and there, I felt like I was deprived of life because I haven't really tried a real Mexican spot besides Roberto's Tacos (don't get me wrong, I love late night cravings and journeys to Roberto's, but I have found another spot to satisfy these random cravings). So, after all this talking, we decided to take ACTION and eat there after our shifts!

This was a really different environment!! When I walked in with my co's, it was packed! There is an Order station where you order the types of taco's you would like. Tacos are 2 bucks each- totally worth it!

I tried:
Cabeza taco (beef head): First timer, but it was way good!
Adobada taco (marinated pork): I have never had adobada anything, and I have come to find that adobada should be in EVERYTHING! lol.
Asada taco (steak): I love carne asada, so this is a no-brainer! DELICIOUS!
Adobada fries: I ordered a box to take to-go for my family! I had to take a bite out of it too, and it made me fall in love with Mexican food!

I'd love to try other things! This taco shop is way FLAVORFUL, FUN, AND OPEN UNTIL 4AM! Ch ch check it out!"}

{"text":"Came here after my young cousins from Cali and Hawaii dragged my old ass out clubbing. It was 3:30 am and I was grumpy AF! I wanted to go home!! The lines were long and it was cold and windy out. But these young, energetic, \"turn down for what?\"-minded people wanted Tacos.

While the guys stood in line, me and my cousin's girlfriend waited in the car. We just kept complaining, even snapped our rants, expressing how annoyed we were haha. Literally, an hour later... by then I was probably half way asleep and still irate, the guys came out with our order.

Even though I was so disoriented, I managed to start eating my tacos. Probably after the 2nd bite, I was shook!! I come from Santa Maria, Ca where I've had what I thought could be closest to authentic Mexican food. (Why I couldn't enjoy many Mexican food in vegas). These tacos were bombbbbbbbbbb!! I was pretty mind blown. I had carne asada and carnitas. Wow!

Since then, I've declared they have the best, authentic tacos, ever!! I refer everyone visiting vegas to this place for some post-vegas debauchery food."}

as long as youve got a DD, cab, or can walk to this place, youre solid.  tacos taste pretty damn authentic and to the adventurous foodies bold enough to consume the awful parts, they have it here too.

good spot, not too far from the strip, decent food.  the spot may be a little suspect late at night, with all the characters out and about on the streets, but i have no problem with it"}

{"text":"Great tacos at fantastic prices. However, the lines are ridiculously long and you have no sense of what you're lining up for because it's that crowded. With the crazy heat, sweat, and peoples' body odor, this taco place isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos but as busy as it gets you'd think they'd have more than 2 locations to reduce traffic. I swear you're go for tacos but end up grinding all night...they should at least play music along with it."}
{"text":"If I knew I had one day left to live in Las Vegas, I would do a lots of things.  One of these things would be to walk up to the carnitas that's slowly cooking at Tacos El Gordo and take a big bite out of it.  I imagine the workers would tried to restrain me, and as this is happening, I would attempt a second bite out of the pineapple on top.  

This is a hidden gem on the strip (maybe not so hidden since there are so many reviews??)  I came here in the middle of the day on Wednesday and had 5 tacos.  2 Carnitas (of course), 2 Carne asada, and a chorizo (this is great, I feel like it goes unnoticed amongst other things).  I also ordered the nopales (cactus).  I think vegetarians would really appreciate this dish.  They serve the tacos with grilled green onions.  Parking was easy but it was a random hour.  I can't imagine what happens to this place on a weekend night.

Good job Tacos El Gordo.  You have a funny name (translates to Tacos The Fat).  But I will return regardless of your silly name.  Adios muchachos!!!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Finally a taco shop that I can eat at in Vegas. Off the hook and. It's no secret, home tortillas flour and corn. Meat all freshly cooked. Very packed but and I say worth the wait. I recommend get a table when you walk in and order your tacos"}
{"text":"yum yum yum mexican food just off the end of the strip (:

For carne/beef, line up on the left.  For pork, line up on the right!  My usual order is something like 2 adobados + 1 carne + 1 lengua taco (have a friend order all the carne, and another order all the adobados, otherwise you will have to line up twice!)

This is a must-go if you are in vegas - cheap, delicious, tasty tasty food! Convenient parking, available seating.  What more can you ask for?

Last time I came, however, half of their kitchen had been closed down for some reason and the wait time was ridiculous (close to an hour around lunch time).  On previous visits, my wait has always been around 20 minutes long around the same time (we have a habit of going right after hotel check-out, before driving back to socal!)  So that would be the only partly off-putting thing.  Fingers crossed for having the whole place back up and running again by the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Not giving 5 stars because I hate that you have to stand in different lines depending on what you order. But the tacos are amazing!!!! My favorite in Vegas, definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best, most authentic tacos we've had north of Rosarito. Even my young kids loved it! (The salsa to be on the spicier side though for kids)"}
{"text":"The bomb, number one taco around.  I was almost going to say Los Angeles, but I drove in a hurry to Vegas to help my sister, and there I was.  My new neighbor in Norwalk told me the week before that Tacos El Gordo was excellent.  It is true.  I loved the spicy pork, or al pastor.  It had a creamy cilantro salsa, yum yum.  I enjoyed the carne asada, and really liked the chorizo and nopales.  The guys working there give their heart and soul and love, into the food.  Bring me back to Vegas!!!  Oh, and the best part, I was with my nephew, Dakota."}
{"text":"Read this because I know you have a yelp for a reason...
Everyone that comes to Las Vegas and wants tacos(because they are hungover or whatnot) comes here expecting that there will be no line. Wrong. There is always a line...a giant line. Something you will have to wait a long time in to get tacos that aren't that special. Don't get me wrong they are delicious. I just think that the lines should be more organized. The amount one person can order should be limited. The service by the staff needs to improve so much. Getting anything that is not tacos(like fries) is a horrible experience. Parking is horrible. I would say if you really want Tacos El gordo go to another tacos el gordo location or better yet another taco spot. Its not worth it. Asada fries were good. For a very popular eatery, these guys need to improve so much."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I've had outside of Mexico. I highly recommend the pastor and cabeza."}
{"text":"I just wish I did had to pay after I get my tacos because they get cold but 
 Maybe add a cashier !! But tacos are awesome $2 each taco is worthy though !"}
{"text":"NO STARS IF I Could
Si pudiera dejar zero Estrella's lo aria.

This place is a knock off immitation of the FAMOUS tacos el Gordo in California, Nevada and Tijuana. They have to steal there name and logo to TRY and hit, PLEASE don't support copy cats. Come up with your own name, don't be using another famous taco place name to try and make it big!!!

No se dejen engañar gente de Phoenix, estos no son parte de la familia tacos el Gordo, que ya conocemos, son tacos piratas.. Ay mejor taquerias aki en Phoenix, no soporten immitadores.. Se cuelgan del nombre para tratar de pegar, ni a Los talones al #1 y ORIGINAL TACOS EL GORDO DE LAS VEGAS, CALIFORNIA Y TIJUANA"}
{"text":"The Asada is okay. I highly suggest getting the Mulas with adobada with a side of green onions. 

I most likely would not come back here if I came to Vegas because I like the tacos in LA better. 

Regardless, good food"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food I have ever eaten. We had tacos and carne asada fries and we were sad that this was our last day in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the SD location once prior to eating at this location. All the locals recommended this location it was in the hood but that's how you know it's going to be good. Some of the items we ordered:
Vampiro de asada- which is like the marriage of a taco and quesadilla with asada. 
Mulas de asada- two tortillas stuffed with meat, cheese, guac salsa. 
Tacos al pastor- pork tacos fucking to die for. If you aren't sure what to get, GET THESE! With everything on it. Comes with cilantro, onion and this creamy sauce. 
Make sure to ask for grilled jalapeño and green onion it compliments the dishes."}
{"text":"Taco Assad was good, I didn't enjoy it that much it's an okay experience and it's not a must to try in Vegas"}
{"text":"Best taco spot in Vegas. Came around lunch on Saturday and wasn't busy at all. Their tortillas are all made fresh. Carne asada, tripe, cabeza all on point. Great flavors and nice portions, priced at about $2.50 each."}
{"text":"Fast. Delicious. Cheap. Ordered one steak and one spicy pork. The pork was my favorite of the two. Wish I would have went sooner."}
{"text":"Cheap Mexican food on the strip with absolutely amazing adobada and lengua tacos. Can't rave on more about both meats - you just have to try it!"}
{"text":"Glad they have a North Las Vegas location now!

We used to go to the Charleston location, but this one is much more convenient.  I'll admit, it's a bit intimidating to order, but I find the service to be pretty good and the food is excellent.  I like the al pastor sopes the best, but the al pastor tacos and carne asada fries are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I found out about this hidden gem while listening to the podcast Five Hundy by Midnight.  I am so glad that I decided to check it out.  It is located in a small shopping plaza between the Riviera and Encore, so it is a little bit of a hike to get to, but it is worth it.  

I had three Adobada Tacos (spicy pork) and my wife had a Steak Taco and a Beef Tongue Taco.  The tacos also came with a plate of sautéed scallions and hot peppers.  All the food was wonderful, plus at no more than $2.50 a taco, the price is unbeatable.  

This is a great find and I highly recommend anyone looking for an inexpensive meal to give it a try."}
{"text":"Wow! Wasn't expecting that! Food was awesome. place is not fancy and is very busy but lines move fast. Gonna stop here again next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The wait is over. I had been driving by this place for months waiting for the grand opening... Now wait no more.. hop off the 15 and come step into the ring with Northtown's new Taco Champion! Tacos El Gordo is simply the best taco in the Valley.

El Gordo tacos are flavorful street tacos that will run you only $2 bucks a pop! You have your choice of meats which include asada, chorizo, adobada, suadero,buche, lengua, tripa, & sesos . You can get everything on it which includes onions, and a red & green sauce. The corn tortillas are made fresh right before your eyes. Flour is also an option.

This is a popular joint that always packs a crowd. One thing to be aware of is that you can only order certain meats in certain lines. Look for the sign before you commit to a line. This can be a little confusing on your first visit. Once in line it's kind of fun to see how they prepare the tacos with swift precision and relentless repetition. 

Parking is a little tight and the lines are long at El Gordo, but it's worth the wait. I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to be here at least once a week. Now, I think twice about going. 
- their tacos are always cold. 
- the staff used to be nicer. 
- always changing people. 
- the meat in the \"suadero\" tacos is just not good. 
-they never ask if you want pineapple in your pastor tacos. That is just not good service a good taco al pastor has to have pineapple and they do not have to assume you don't like pineapple, because that is basically what the guy told me. 
Salsas are not good . 

I could go on with the list but I'm tired... so that's why I stopped going. 

I do appreciate that they are always cleaning after lazy people leave their mess on the table after they leave."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! The Vegas location is just as good as the San Diego location, and the guy who took my order was terrific (so nice and happy that I knew about the SD location)! The adobada sopes are superbly delicious! The spices and sauces they use for their meat are different from every other Mexican restaurant that I've ever been to. It's pure deliciousness in each bite! Also, eating here won't hurt your wallet at all!

That all being said, there is one thing I can't stand about Tacos El Gordo...and that's that there isn't one in Phoenix!! I woud be the first to jump on that ship if it ever set sail! 

Go eat here, people!!!

To quote Tracy Jordan from 30 Rock...

I want to take Tacos El Gordo behind the middle school and get it pregnant."}
{"text":"TACOS EL GORDO. TACOS EL GORDO. 
T A C O S. E L. G O R D O. 
You can't go wrong with Tacos El Gordo, these tacos are as authentic as they get without going to TJ. 
From the spiced pork... carne asada, pollo asada... generous on their guac, delicious red and green fresh sauce... 
Everyone can agree that Tacos El Gordo have the best tacos you can get your hands on."}
{"text":"WHY WE GO HERE:
- because when with Mexicans, we go Mexican

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- you know it's real when the line be poppin' and stretching well through the front entrance
- gated outdoor seating

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- beyond the multiple lines there is indoor seating to the right

THE MENU:
- tacos
- vampiro
- quesadillas
- sopes
- tostadas
- mulas
- [insert meat choice here] fries
- drinks
- meat choices: cabeza (beef head), lengua (beef tongue), tripa (tripe; stomach/intestines), suadero (thin cut of beef from the intermediate part of the cow between the belly and the leg), sesos (beef), buche (pork cheek), carne asada (grilled beef), chorizo, adobada (spicy marinated pork), al pastor (pork); NOTE THERE IS NO POLLO (CHICKEN) OPTIONS SERVED HERE

WHAT WE ORDER:
- tacos (adobada, al pastor, asada, buche, cabeza, lengua, tripa)
- fries (lengua)
- horchata (cinnamon rice water; liquid Cinnamon Toast Crunch for those unfamiliar with this)

HOW IT WORKS:
- depending on the menu item/meat choice you're going for, you have to go into separate lines accordingly; if you're in a group and you're smart about it just have different people in your group go into the different lines and then Venmo amount owed to one another
- after ordering your food, your food is given to you on the spot, and then you go to ANOTHER line in the far right corner in between the indoor seating and the outdoor seating to the cash register to pay for your food
NOTE: yes of course the workers here speak English, but I personally feel if you're with a Spanish speaker, AND you're nice, then the workers will try their best to help you get the other meat choices you're trying to order without having to go in the separate lines

THE TASTE:
- LENGUA IS MY LIFE! especially when it's made WELL; when we go here we usually will get lengua fries (because carne asada fries are basic) and lengua tacos
- I'm a BIG fan of their tacos here, but I will have to say that generally speaking I'm just not a fan of cabeza or buche, but hey, at least I can say I've tried it

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- the servers have always been pretty efficient and super nice
- security guard(s) onsite are nice too, unlike bouncers at clubs sometimes
- the cashiers can be pretty curt, but that's OK"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. This is the first time I have ever reviewed a taco spot, but it's just THAT GOOD. As an Angelino (someone from LA), there are taco places everywhere- perhaps there are as many taco joints as there are gas stations lol. Having said that, I've tried the most reviewed, highest rating, and even mediocre taco joints. However, my mouth has never met such an amazing taco. When I say these are the best tacos I've had in my life, I seriously mean it. 

The lines are ridiculously long, and that's the only slight complaint I have....but being that it's a hit, it's expected. 

Make sure you order the al pastor with a slice of pineapple. Also order a side of nopales (grilled cactus) and don't forget the salsa and Coca Cola. 

To whoever wrote a bad review about this place- go back to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Authentic, great tacos and love their fizzy drinks.  Know your spanish before you order if you are not adventerous.  My husband almost ordered the beef brains."}
{"text":"Best best best el pastor tacos on the planet. 
The line gets hella long but the combination of pineapple pork with cilantro onions and guacamole salsa is to die for. I could eat this everyday of my life. Like if this was the last meal I ate before I died I would happy as hell.
This one is way less crowded than the other one. 
It is also a lot newer and cleaner and larger. Open seating and super clean and well lit.
At the other one I tried the campechana fries. Totally would not order unless u are eating it immediately. They get soggy hella quick and the meat just isn't as good as when it is in the taco.
Will be coming here forever and ever"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!!! First time here was a bit confusing, their line system is not what I'm used to, they have different lines for different types of tacos. My favorite was the el pastor!!! It's like nothing I've ever had before, their sauce goes perfect with the meat. Now every time I'm in Vegas, I know I'll be stopping here for sure."}
{"text":"Authentic ass Mexican food!! I'm Mexican, from Mexico and I'm telling you this is legit. We tried the The sopes, tacos and vampiro, tacos were great but the sopes and vampiro were amazing!!"}
{"text":"The BEST of authentic Mexican tacos! My first visit, hubby second time. So Wish there was a location near West Covina, Cali but thanks for savory tacos! God Bless."}
{"text":"It was good. But not the way I expected. I had carne Asada fries from Cali and they were AMAZING. Like out of the world amazing. The meat was good, it tasted like it was made by Ecuadorians. I say that because I've had that taste before (I'm half Ecuadorian and Puerto Rican.) it's NOT BAD. Just not what I wanted...it had a little sweet taste to it too...service was good, location is good. The horchata was delicious. Overall it was good. Like I said...not what I thought it would be. The again, it Cali so yeah...either way, still very good."}
{"text":"Back home in Hawai'i, we call it \"kanak attack\" and according to Urban Dictionary, kanak attack is- The feeling of intense laziness that one gets from eating too much. Yes, this is exactly how I felt after eating at Tacos El Gordo for the first time. These tacos hit the spot and definitely put me in a food coma not too long after!

I've lived in this crazy city for four years now and I'm JUST trying this place out! Tacos El Gordo did not disappoint. 

If it's your first time here, prepare to be overwhelmed. The organization/set up of this joint could use some improvement, but the staff here is efficient and keeps the lines moving. There are three separate lines for the different types of meats offered, so make your decisions quickly because the lines grow fast! 

The fan favorite (and my favorite) is definitely the Adobada Al Pastor, or spicy pork. Similar to shawarma, the marinated pork is placed on a vertical spit and freshly sliced into your tortillas as you order your tacos. The meat is moist and packed with flavor! The sauce they put in the tacos compliment it really well. Squeeze a little bit of fresh lime on top and call it a day!

My girlfriend and I also shared a half order of the Adobada Fries. The portion was huge considering it was a half order. We barely made a dent in it. They were just OK, nothing like the tacos. They were lathered in sour cream, shredded cheese, and topped with a heaping amount of guac.

Seating here is very limited, especially on the weekend. If there are a few extra bodies in your party, I suggest that one of you snag a table (or attempt to) while the others wait in the lines to order grub!

Tacos El Gordo is a must and definitely worth the wait! It's now on my list of places to bring my out of town guests!"}
{"text":"I sincerely love this place, the only downfall is that their phone lines have been cut off and I can't place orders over the phone anymore, which was an awesome service being that I live approximately 30 minutes from their location, their prices vary but nevertheless their worth it to me! If you're new to this amazing place on earth you Must try the mulas! Which are a hand made tortilla with the meat, sauce and condiments of your choosing and a glob of cheese on top with another tortilla to top it off! So it's like a Mexican taco burger to put it in short words! DELICIOUS!!! Best place to eat tacos in vegas."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town love the tostada and pastor try the moola they put cheese on it and beans"}
{"text":"top notch... great food and great price.  adobada, carne asada fries and horchata are worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"Let's face it, anyone can fry up some tortillas, throw on some lettuce, onions, diced tomatoes, a little meat, and some salsa or hot sauce.  That's not what this is.  This place should be called \"Taco el Perfection\" because that's what it is.  Taco y Taco has nothing on the delicious, perfect recipes that this place has put together.  Every taco we ate was divine.  Beware of the 15 minute wait at lunch... it's worth the wait so much that we waited in line a second time to get more tacos.    And it's cheap!  Damn, this place is good!"}
{"text":"Good but not oh my god unbelievable as you might think from these reviews. Solid set of tacos. 

Surprised that al pastor does beat carne asada though. Ordering is also super simple and makes a ton of sense once you go. I was there when there was no line and thought damn I've got no chance. The guys behind the counter made it super easy - what do you want, how many and what on it? Since they are doing the cooking and serving, the \"line per\" makes total sense. Pickup, go to next line and order there, take tray to get limes/radishes, pay, get drink and eat. Simple. 

Unlike most places though there doesn't seem to be a variety of different salsas that you can get and put on the tacos. I got \"everything\" on mine and would say the salsa provided was very mild. Not sure if there is a way to get spicy and there is no self service option for the salsas. No chips, cilantro, pickled carrots or other condiments which make me rate this four stars. Good stuff but with no spice I missed a kick. That said next time I'm at the Encore I'm making another stop. It's literally right there and worth the walk!"}
{"text":"You have to walk north of the strip pass the Wynn and Encore but trust me it is worth it. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did, but the carne asada tacos were amazing.  I had the tripe and spicy pork tacos as well, on a full stomach and it was still delicious and authentic.  For 2 dollars a piece, the size was perfect, and if you are walking down the strip you might as find this little mom and pops place.  The lines are long but they go pretty fast.  It is the right amount of spice and flavor."}
{"text":"THANK GOD THIS IS SO CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN. 

Amazing prices, great food, great hours, and easily accessible. Tacos El Gordo is great for the late night drunchies or any time meal. They do also offer free grilled onions and chiles if you request them. 

Don't forget to pick up some candy or ice cream for dessert! arroz con leche or cafe popsicle is my personal favorite"}
{"text":"This place sucks really not sure what the hype is about. Waited in line for dried out meat. Don't order a quesadilla. Cuz it's not really a \"quesadilla\" it's more like a tostada. I'm really in shock right now because I'm not sure why everyone loves this place. Trash. Never again."}
{"text":"Bomb. This place is now on the strip and everything I have tried is authentic. Oh and delicious I took a Latin friend and the said it was legit only to further confirm my taste buds decisions."}
{"text":"I love this place. I had lengua ( beef tongue ) here for the first time. It was delicious but I did puke a little. I kept picturing a cow waking around with no tongue. But yeah...good food.
My friends ate other strange crap. Looked delicious though."}
{"text":"I love the tacos here. So much in fact, that I sometimes convince my friends to stay at Encore just so we're walking distance from the joint. There is no questioning that the tacos here are some of the most delicious outside of Mexico and CA.

However, their ordering system and the the drunk, rude, and obnoxious patrons that they allow in here sometimes prevent El Gordo from a 5 star. If you are a big fan of different types of tacos you'll have to wait in multiple lines. The most efficient solution to that is to have one friend stand in each line and order up enough tacos for your whole group. But if you're a couple visiting Vegas and want to try everything from asada, al pastor, lengua, intestines, or brain, then good luck with that on a busy weekend night."}
{"text":"Worth the Line

Ordered:

3 Tacos de Adobada
1 Mula de Asada/Adoba 
1 Taco de Asada

A must go in Las Vegas!! Love, Love, Love the Food. There's always a line though, so be prepared for that. There are separate lines for the different types of meat you may order, so just be advised. 

Seating is limited especially during peak times, so if you're not smart and aggressive about securing a table you may be stuck eating your tacos standing up. Blah. 

The only suggestion is that they work on a more efficient way of ordering. (i.e. Maybe pre-order/pay, find at a table and then they call you up when your number gets called?)"}
{"text":"Where has Tacos El Gordo been my entire life??? Honestly this might sound crazy but I am not a huge taco person but I can honestly say after having tacos here I am hooked! Their abodabas tacos are freaking bomb dot com unbelievably delicious. Spicy pork prepared and sliced sharama style so tender and flavorful oh my god! I like mine on flour tortillas and topped with grilled pineapple  they make their tortillas fresh in front of you from dough to pressing it and then cooking it in front of you! Their lengua tacos (cow tongue) are absolutely delicious and full of beautiful flavor! Super tender and I now love cow tongue because of their tacos here! When you come here you have to order the tacos in different lines depending on the meat of your choice! The carne Asada line is the longest line because their carne asada is hands down heaven wrapped in the most beautiful taco! I will be back asap! I love you guys and the way your tacos have touched my heart forever! I'm a better person because of your tacos"}
{"text":"Cheap. Delicious. Tacos. Need I say more? Yes? Ok....you need to get the carne asada first. A delicious marinated steak taco covered with guacamole, salsa, and onions for 2 bucks filled with all the yummy grilled flavor you want from a steak. Or get the lingua taco. The most tender meat you'll get in a taco form. Don't tell your friends what it is (beef tongue) and they won't know the difference! Or get the tripe taco. They must char the meat before they put it on the tortilla because the tender meat had crispy bits of yummy on it. That's my favorite part. I got those three tacos and a water for less than 9 bucks...a huge deal considering I'm eating on the strip!"}
{"text":"The worst taco I ever had in life. This place is so dirty!! The service is horrendous : different lines for different items. You get your food first and then you pay. Some people just walk out without paying. Kind of hard to tell who pays and who doesn't because it's so packed with drunks and smelly musty people inside. The lines are out of order--- not worth the wait and $$$. I came back into the room with my friends asking why I reek like onions--- damn you el gordo nasty crap taco!!!!"}
{"text":"Great taco spot recommended by a Lyft driver. Not far of a walk, right past the Wynn. They have the setup great! Always lines but definitely worth the food. They have certain lines for certain meats in the tacos. We got the Al Pastor and Asada. They were both delicious. Make sure to at least get the hot sauce & guacamole crema. Soo good! It is a little smokey inside because of all the meat cooking. We will definitely be back next time in Vegas and will definitely recommend to anyone. Great spot!!"}
{"text":"OMG! tacos and quesadillas which a completely different than ur average one are AMAZING! oh and let me not forget the carneasada fries!!! U need to try those! A must have!! I introduced my friends to this place and they loved it!! Only negative is the line but it's understandable for the food"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had in Vegas. The flavors of the meats are unique. The service could be better but I'll  still go back here every time I'm in Vegas."}

{"text":"For our very first wedding anniversary, my husband took me to Las Vegas! I had never been before, therefore I do what I do when I'm somewhere new... Yelp places to eat! It was lunch time and we always agree on taqueria's...
Tacos El Gordo caught our attention immediately. The pictures and videos of the Abodaba, the grilled veggies and nopales (a personal fav. of mine...) beckoned us down the strip. We just couldn't pass it up and I'm so glad we didn't! 
I've never had Abodaba, or meat prepared like this for Tacos...the closest is Mediterranean shawarma....when it's vertically standing and spinning!
As they cut the meat down into the hand made tortillas I couldn't help but smile ear to ear! They probably thought I was insane! Maybe just crazy for these tacos!!!
My husband got Carne Asada tacos as did I, however I also ordered the Abodaba's tacos which there was NO WAY I was passing up! We also ordered the Nopales.
The tacos were amazing. The meat was in huge chunks, the tortillas were so flavorful... You can't beat watching a woman kneading dough and making tortillas right in front of you, only to be passed off and have a man slice huge chunks of pork off this thing, and make you the best damn tacos you've ever had!!! And that's saying a lot ... The flea market tacos here in Reno are seriously a close second!  
I'm already eager to drive the 7hours back just for these tacos...orrr... They could open one here in Reno!!! A girl can dream!!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype, y'all! Tacos El Gordo is as good as it gets!

Surprisingly, I found this location to be a lot less overwhelming than the Charleston location which is odd seeing as to how it's on the Strip. The layout here is definitely a bit more efficient and the lines moved at a decent pace. 

If it's your first time at Tacos El Gordo, do yourself a favor and plan ahead. No, seriously. There are three separate lines for the different types of meats offered. It's best to have an idea of what you're planning to order beforehand. I would suggest that your party split up and have each person stand in separate lines. Use the buddy system, folks! The most popular meat served is the Adobada Al Pastor (my favorite) and this line in particular tends to be longer than the others. It's completely worth the wait!

The Al Pastor is so good! The meat is flavorful and juicy. It's freshly sliced into two corn tortillas as you order your tacos. I love the crispiness around the edges of the tortillas after they're fried on the grill for a few seconds. The tacos are completed with the works- Cilantro, onions, and salsas! Try it with pineapple too!

Prices are fair, location is clean, and the staff is courteous. The employees behind the counter always impress me with the way they work under pressure!

Grab your tacos and get some Orange Bang to wash it all down!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is all about the experience and these tacos are as authentic as it gets.  Great spot for late nite munchies after a Corona or Dos Equis fueled night.  This place makes you feel as if you've been transported south of the border to Tijuana.  

I sampled the adovada, saderuo, and asada. I was offered a plate of green onions and roasted jalapeño on the side.  Every one of the tacos was flavorful. I recommend getting the with everything on them.  Each of the different meats was served slightly differently with the toppings to keep them authentic.  

I was not brave enough to try the lengua or cabaesa. Maybe next time and a few more Corona's."}
{"text":"Went last weekend and I wasn't disappointed! I had just ate at wicked spoon right before coming here and I wasn't going to order any since I was full but once I walked in and saw the rack of meat sizzling, I had to try the al pastor. Ended up getting just two which I regret they were so good I could of easily ate 6 with a full stomach. The lines are long, I say lines because you have to wait in one to just walk in the door after you get in there's 4 other lines where they have different type of tacos, sopes, carne asada fries...etc. Not much seating inside so we ended up sitting outside on some fake grass. Overall bomb tacos I'd definitely would come back and like my cousin said \"I don't wait in line to get in a club but I'll wait in line for some tacos el gordo\"

Taco Bell ain't got ish on this spot.....just saying"}
{"text":"We rolled into Las Vegas at 8 am and were basically starving by noon, so right when I was hoping a taco truck would materialize around the corner, Tacos El Gordo shows up at the cheap end of the Strip, right before you hit Circus Circus and the other sad old hotels. 

$2 tacos! I got an asada one and an adobada (spicy pork). The latter is juicy shreds of pork sliced off of one of the biggest vertical kebabs I've ever seen and then drenched in a day-glow green sauce. The aguas frescas are under $2 too, and even if it's from a soda machine, we had enough to fill our Nalgenes with a jamaica and horchata mix for a post-lunch Strip amble.

Ask for a free plate of carmelized green onions and roast white peppers!"}
{"text":"I walked in on a Saturday night and there had to be 40 people in 3 separate lines for Asada, Chorizo, Al Pastor, and a variety of other amazing meats and dishes. You choose a line based on meat, not size.

We stood in line for almost 25 minutes because it was Saturday at dinner time and the grill was cooking. The wait was 100% worth it.

There were 6 of us and we sent one person to save a table (it's hard to find a place to sit) and the rest savored the smells of what we were about to eat. 

I ordered the Carne Asada fries and they were incredible along with a carne asada taco and 2 chorizo tacos. I ended up splitting the fries because it was a ton of food. The others in my group also got fries and taco variations and everyone loved their tacos.

I've eaten at lots of other taco places that I love (Taco y Taco, etc.) but Tacos El Gordo is quickly a top 1 or 2 on my taco list now. Everything is incredibly fresh and food is authentic and incredible."}
{"text":"When I first came here, the parking is a little hectic. Sometimes the line to order food is outside the restaurant so be prepared. Once inside, you are faced with a small tight spaced restaurant with barely any tables to sit at. Ordering my food was a bit chaotic because there are certain lines you have to stand in for certain foods, so that whole process was a bit confusing. When I finally was able to order my food, the cook making my food was so nice. He made my tacos quick and precise, it was pretty cool watching him throw guacamole and salsa in the air and having them land perfectly on my taco. I usually get 2 lengua tacos and 2 carne asada tacos and it all comes down to under $10! 

I would definitely recommend my friends to this place. Cheap and delicious food that is open super late."}
{"text":"Eh. I've been to Tacos El Gordo in SD a number of times and sadly, I was just not impressed with the one here in Las Vegas. I ordered the al pastor, asada, and lengua - my usual favorites  - and they were all a bit...lacking to say the least. The al pastor and asada were both on the dry side and I got more of the burnt bits. The lengua was actually pretty good but overall I felt like all three tacos were lacking the certain depth of flavor that I was used to from the SD Tacos El Gordo. And the salsas of each taco are usually one of the parts that I enjoy the most, but each were pretty bland/underseasoned. As a huuuge taco fan, I was pretty disappointed :( Maybe it would've tasted better if I were drunk and leaving the club, but  I want my tacos to taste good sober, too!"}
{"text":"I visited their location on 4/12/18 and got food poisoning. Had adobada and lengua tacos, not sure which one was bad. Having fever and stomach issues. Had food from them before, so disappointed. I am sure it was from their food because I had it for dinner and woke up few hours later sick.  Maybe one of their workers was sick or food not fresh. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Anyone who wants excellent freshly cooked in front of your tacos, come here :) didn't have to wait long as busy as they were & was definitely pleased with my entire order. The tables were clean and floors which is surprising because of how busy they are !! Definitely worth the $$. Five stars for fresh tacos ! Yumnnn"}
{"text":"Me and my friends came to eat some tacos, they loved them. I didn't .My own opinion  they don't look appetizing. First you make line for about 20 min to order your food and get it, after you get your food you wait another 20 min to pay for your food. That's a different line. From where you get your food. By the time you start eating your food is cold. the set is annoying, chaotic, poor management skills ..I myself won't be going back.  If it was up to me. I wouldn't even give them one star."}
{"text":"A little pricey but I'd bet my last dollar that any true street taco lover would say there is no other!  Best tacos on earth!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place more.  Anyone who knows me, knows that I love Mexican food.  Not the fake crap drowning in cheese.  That's like calling egg Foo young Chinese food. I ordered tacos adobada and tripas.   The adobada was bland and at $2 taco, kinda of small.  I can go to Cardenas and get a better taco for less. The tripas were better.   There is no salsa bar,   menu is kinda small and huge lines at lunch."}
{"text":"simply delicious... long lines, crowded but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Over seasoned salty and low quality meats, plus I'm not ok with roaches running around. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tacos are awesome here I recommend it. I wished there were some tacos places like this back home. When we come to Vegas we have to come here to eat."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the wait, I'm not sure if anyone writing reviews has ever had a truly great taco before. There was nothing special about the meat, tortillas, or salsa. We tried the asada and pork, both were not even average. Go to any taco truck in LA and it will be faster and better than this joint! Highly disappointed and would never recommend."}
{"text":"Overall the tacos are pretty good. As someone who has never been I was definitely confused. There is a separate line for the different tacos offered. The suadero ( beef brisket) was a little dry and salty hut the asada was really good. The lines are very long (a hint of how good the tacos are) but overall I think the wait is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer at the Chula Vista location and the Al Pastor Tacos are the best I have ever had period.  But this location did not have the same flavor that I was used to, in fact they were staight up flavorless, just ruined the whole experience for me and my firends for thinking we were getting the \"same\" tacos back in CV.  maybe it was that day I dont know but not going there again.  Taco loco no more."}
{"text":"Actually I've been here 3 times already, and each time I've gone I've never been dissatisfied with the selection of the food items. Not much of a selection, but just all the favorites. Served fast and healthy portioned. Great eats for less."}
{"text":"They alright. Wont be my first choice to get tacos but they work. The meat is good and thr torillas are good. Chorizo and pastor are not that great. And alittle pricey"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever had!! Fast,clean and very affordable. The ordering process can be a little confusing for first timers. Loved the pastor (shaved marinated pork on the turning spit) is to die for and the loaded fries. All fresh ingredients. The real deal! A must when in old Vegas area."}
{"text":"I was misinformed about where this place was located and ended up walking 20 min more than I thought I would have to. However, the walk was worth it and I was quite pleased with the tacos here! 

I am always in the mood for some tacos and Tacos El Gordo has a good amount of options, except they don't have chicken, which is the lamest kind of taco you could get anyway.... 

You basically stand in line for the kind of meat you want and it could get a little hectic, so brace yourself. I got 2 carne asada tacos, which I thought were a little too dry, 1 head meat taco which was super tasty, and 1 spicy pork which was delicious!! 

This place is worth a visit if you're willing to make the trip here!! The food is good and cheap compared to most of the places on the strip."}
{"text":"Tacos were pretty bomb..!!! Tried going to the one close to the strip but it was soooooo packed... so decided to go to another and I hit the jackpot cause no line and fast services. It was better to drive out."}
{"text":"Uber drivers recommendation was on point! (Seconded by the hotel bellhop). These Are sloppy $3 tacos and they are AMAZING!! We tried the chorizo, asada, and al pastor which was hands down the best. We got here early so no wait, I hear there's a line later on. Got some grilled peppers to accompany. The gyro like al pastor meat and marinated asada meat, plus all the special sauces, are what make this a standout. I also loved the radishes and lime slices to put the finishing touches on. Overall outstanding!"}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic! One of those places you wish you didn't get full so fast cause you want to keep eating!

Get in the correct line for the type of meat that you want. So far I've tried: 

Al pastor (5): amazing! Right off the trombo, the meat is moist and flavorful. The dress up the tacos properly. Just get everything on them. 

Carne Asada (5): again, moist and flavorful with a slight char. Tostadas are crispy with their handmade tortillas and the fries are nice and cheesy. 

Chorizo (3): im normally a huge fan of chorizo but this is the only meat that I had that I thought was lacking a bit. Still decent flavor but I thought it was a little too moist. Almost just like ground pork. 

Cabeza (5): super tender, like melt in your mouth tender. 

They give you a plate of grilled green onions and chiles which were also amazing. If you're craving tacos, this is the place! Also much less crowded than the location in the strip."}
{"text":"Vegas has tacos ya'll. I repeat, Vegas.. has.. tacos.. y'all.

I'm not talkin' about your gourmet fish tay-co or the horrid generic ground beef. No, no, no..

Notice that big chunk of inverted curvy red meat rotating at a smooth, cool pace? She's with me. Her name is Adobada. She's pork cooking rotisserie style, beautifully marinated in a spicy 'red' chili sauce.. tossed on a corn tortilla, doused with hints sweet of cumin, a sprinkle of oregano, grilled onions and lathered with a creamy green salsa verde.  Ay dios mio! The perfect mixture of tender sweetness and spices that kick. Easily one of the best tacos I've had to date.

This isn't the only thing they serve, of course. What's neat is they have it set up almost like a cafeteria / buffet, in the sense that you can get in a line for an Adobada taco then walk over to another line and grab some carne asada fries. 

Thirsty? From horchata & agua frescas to my favorite.. Orange Bang, Bang.. Baby. Like a mother and her child, the drinks and food go hand in hand. Then into my stomach. Not the mother and the child, the food, you sicko.

The staff is pleasant, usually smiling and constantly moving.. This place is well kept and presented in a welcoming manner.  It truly reminded me of a few taco joints back home in LA, and that's a great thing! Amazing food, fair prices, up-to-par service and an alright location. Tacos El Gordo has the Nevada taco game on lockdown!"}
{"text":"As soon as we got here there was a line out the door! I was surprised. It took us almost 20-30 mins just to order our food. But it was worth it. This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Vegas. The staff is always working hard in the back and sweating there butts off because it's always so busy in there. 

The place smells so good while you wait and it teases your senses making you anxious while you get closer to the counter and then BAM!! There it is. The delicious adobada! It is absolutely delicious. It is right there in front of you spinning on a steak while the chef cuts it off fresh for every order. Try the adobada (marinated pork) on anything. It is the best pork I've ever had in my life! Like this is better than bacon and they carve it off of the roast right in front of you. The tacos are so good and fresh!

Anything on the menu you're going to like. They have a large menu and anything you can think of, they have it on their menu. Make sure you know what you want to order though, and quickly because you have to go stand in the meat line of your choice. If you stand in the wrong line, you have to get out of line and go stand in the right line. That is a huge bummer.

This place is wonderful! It's the Mexican food you've always dreamed of but have never obtained. If you're in Vegas, leave the strip and head down to this place for some good grub. It's a really good price and worth it for the wait, because they're will be one. No matter the time of day or day of the week there will be a line because it's a really popular place!"}
{"text":"We all know how freakin amazing these tacos are. My boyfriend and I always get 1 carne asada or adobada taco each and then we share the adobada fries with melted cheese, meat, avocado with all that yummy goodness the fries get drenched in. 

This location is much better than the one on Charleston Blvd. 
1. The place/seating area is much, much bigger. Plenty of tables and chairs to go around...even on a peak Saturday afternoon.
2. It's cleaner. No remains left over from the previous guest. I see workers cleaning and wiping down tables constantly.
3. Most importantly, it isn't as crowded as Charleston plus the line seems to move quicker here.

From now on, I much rather make a 2 minute longer drive to this location."}
{"text":"Multiple locations in town, very very good street type tacos, all the regular meats including lengua and cabeza and tripe but no brain.  Only down side, their prices are almost double what most good street taqueria's charge.
Good place to eat if you don't have an option to drive somewhere else. This is a go to place if you don't want to travel."}
{"text":"I would say this place would of been great if their tortillas weren't so rock hard, dry with razor sharp edges and if they offered hot sauces or fresh salsas. I'm way too much of a sauce snob and I admit it. I was very disappointed that there was no salsa bar or sauce for that matter. The tacos could of used a nice dollop of moist and flavorful salsa.

Granted the carne asada (beef) and the adobada (pork) were marinated well and very tender, I needed a spicy kick in my life! Even the grilled jalapeño pepper they offered us wasn't spicy. 

I favored the adobada over the carne asada, it seemed more tender. Also, the taco de cabeza (head) was really oily, we took a bite and couldn't eat the rest.

The vampiro, had a sopes masa cake bottom and a crispy fried tortilla tostada-like top. It was filled with carne asada (or any meat you choose), a dense piece of rubber-like cheese, and topped with lots of their guacamole sauce and cilantro and onions. It was tasty, hard to eat, and extremely filling! 

Their avocado sauce that they put on everything tasted good, but it was very thick and filling. It's not made of 100% avocados and they may of added some type of filler in it. 

Make sure to ask for a complimentary plate of grilled green onion and peppers, they don't offer it unless you ask for it.

6 small tacos, 2 vampiros, and a soda totals $23.02"}
{"text":"Totally worth the wait! Whether it's a late night of drinking or just a craving for fantastic street tacos, this place ALWAYS hits the spot. Don't get scared away when the line is out the door, it moves quickly and the amazing pork is the perfect end to your night!"}
{"text":"If you have never been here and are having trouble with the menu I suggest you start off by listening to pitbull song. Cabeza, lengua and other cow body parts can easily be explained through him. Some head and tongue tacos never sounded too bad! :p
If the thought of eating these things disgust you, do not be afraid and just try it! It is not as bad as you think! I was so happy to know that the \"guac is not extra\" here! The unfortunate part is that the food is actually pretty descent, but what is up with the guacamole! It looks and tastes like green paste! C'mon! :p"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Went here with family and they treated us horribly. We waited for our food, got our table ready and they told us we had to give up our seats for others. I have a sprained ankle and had the nerve to tell me to stand! Customer service is horrible, and won't be coming back. Letting everyone know not to come here!!!!!!!!

UPDATE: if you want great service go to the taco el Gordo off Charleston blvd. They didn't tell me go stand nor give up my seat. Very fast and efficient with lines as well. So glad I came here instead!"}
{"text":"freakin BOMBA!!!!!!!!!!!!! How can you go wrong with hand made corn tortillas, guacamole, salsa!!!' Tacos are bomb people!! Place to be at!!!!! WOW!!!!!!!!!!

A MUST, MUST, MUST COME PLACE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best drunk food ever. I always make a stop over here when I visit Vegas. Lines can get out of hand at times but it's worth the wait. Seating is a bitch though. I always get the vampiro, 4 al pastor tacos and the fries. You can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong wit Tacos El Gordo!!! It's right down the street from Encore, so not a far walk if you're there. The parking lot is definitely small, so be smart about how you get there. 

There's usually a line, but don't worry it's totally worth it. There's a security guard outside who will help with the line. Once you get in, you'll need to choose a line to get into. Each line has its own specialities. For example, one line was for the Al Pastor/Adobada meats, and the other was for carne asada and lengua. All meats are good, but the spicy pork (al pastor) is my favorite! You can get the meat in whatever you'd like- sope, Taco, etc. (tacos can come in corn or flour tortilla). 

Get your order and then pay in the back corner of the restaurant. Seating is limited so maybe have someone in your group go save some spots. They serve soda and horchata, and have salsa upon request. Lime and radish is on the side bar for you to get yourself. 

PS. If you order fries, you'll have to go to the side of the restaurant to pick it up (the side nearest the restrooms)."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos adobadas! Autentico de tijuana."}
{"text":"This gringo loved every taco. Authentic street style tacos that were beyond amazing and an awesome deal. Get the spicy pork! We went to a different location that was off the strip to avoid lines."}
{"text":"Fantastic taco place. The line was out the door which was annoying when you are hungry. But definitely worth the wait, and actually the line moved rather quickly."}
{"text":"Forget about all the traditional main stream cuts of pork and cow when you enter Tacos El Gordo.  It's time to man up, adjust your nut sack, hike up your trousers and get down with some more unfamiliarable less desirable \"of courses I mean by American standards\" fleshy fatty gems of the animal kingdom.  Cabasa and buche are king at Tacos El Gordo.  Melt in your mouth tender gelatiness nasty bits that will turn your wanna be foodie ass on it's side. I mean it's all good but these two cuts are out of this world.  Lets just put it this way, If Tacos El Gordo was Oceans 11 the cabasa would be George Clooney and the buche is Brad Pitt the other tacos, like the rest of the supporting cast, kick ass however there can only be one Clooney. OK, I know its not your typical analogy however, I'm sure you follow me. Well follow me or not all you need to know is that this place is crazy good.  If I had to point out anything negative it would be that it's a little pricey, however this is definitely one of those you get what you pay for situations."}
{"text":"So nice we had to visit twice! Have heard people talk about this place, but we normally don't stay on this side of the strip. What a treat to find out this was right down the street from where we were staying. 
If you're expecting fine dining, or even organization, this place is not for you. It's made for quick order, quick eats, in and out that simple. However, there is always a line out the door for good reason. Their tacos are amazing. Our first time there was after a bar crawl around 3am. Still a line out the door. It went pretty quickly, they have separate lines for their different meats (a pastor line, an asada line, etc.) they go pretty quick if the drunk guy in front of you doesn't forget what he wants to order. Tortillas are fresh, pastor right of the spit, and the traditional grilled onions and jalepenos on the side at your request. Also a salsa bar with all the fixings.
Price is what you'd normally pay at any taco stand, and the flavor is amazing. 
It was so good that the last day of our trip, we went back during the day as our last meal before hitting the road. This is a Vegas staple and now we know why."}
{"text":"Bless you little pink building full of taco goodness!  This former gas station & Jack in the Box location now houses taco nirvana. And at two dollars a pop you can graze through the vast offerings without breaking the bank. 

They have three stations with an array of selections of meat at each. Including real honest to goodness adobada al pastor on a shawarma. This being my first time I had tripas, carne asada and three trips back for adobada al pastor. Very satisfied. Clean, friendly and great tacos. And did I mention two bucks each!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Had to pull out my phone to translate some of the menu.  This is authentic and great.  We went around 12:30am on a Thursday and it was packed."}
{"text":"al pastor and lengue tacos really really good! hombres behind counter made  a good show of knife skills and a littlle showmanship on plating. clean tables and friendly staff. pretty authhentic for a chain."}
{"text":"Street style tacos, the best hand made tortillas cooked in front of you as you order fresh salsa and veggies . The whole fam had the steak tacos, they have the more authentic tacos also such as beef tongue but was a little to afraid to try."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a shout-out (did I just use that term?.... I must really like this place.) It's not 100% perfect, - the tortillas are a little gummy and the chorizo is surprisingly balnd - but everything else is spot on. 
First off, great people. I asked about the sudero (so sorry if I butcher the Spanish language here) and next thing I knew, I had a sample in hand! Not only that, but I was rewarded for my attempt at speaking Spanish with a plate of grilled veggies on the house!
Spicy pork is to die for. Sudero is amazing. Really worth the trip. 

*Note that it's pretty much just pork and beef so if you don't like mammals, you're out of luck. BUT if you like it authentic (cabeza, brains, etc.,) then you're in luck. 

You will not be sorry you tried it. Good eating!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Order Al Pastor tacos, sopes, vampiro, etc. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the prices are cheap. Come after the club and the food taste even better."}
{"text":"Has been my fav Mexican fast food for about 5 years when a co worker brought me here for the first time . I haven't yet to experience any bad things . The food is awesome , the workers are kind . Makes me wana learn more Spanish but they know what to do . I absolutely love the pork tacos"}
{"text":"Went there last night. These tacos are simply the best I've ever had.
The meat was so tasty and the hand-made tortillas were soooo good.
Lines were long, but the wait was worth it.
I guess the only downfall is that there's different lines for different kinds of meat, and also that there are no seats available because they are sooo busy. 
But the tacos are sooo good that all those little things dont matter. We are going back again today!"}
{"text":"Hands down best taco joint I have ever been to in the United States... EVER!  This place is near the Wynn, I just wondered in here after a night of partying and wow!  They have every amenity that they have at taco spots in Mexico... Without people getting kidnapped... I found my new after party spot in Vegas! I definitely recommend this to the discriminating taco aficionado."}
{"text":"Food her was the bomb! Had 7 carne asada tacos on my visit to Vegas on edc weekend. The lines were long but I still got my food relatively fast. Will be coming back again when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"best tacos al pastor, i tried all the meats  and they are  all good but el pastor was amazing. we come here for work every year with all my co workers and we all enjoy this placeif you are around the area you need to try this tacos"}
{"text":"11am opening time on a Sunday morning and it was already mayhem.  We were stuck in 1 line only to realize when we got to the counter that we could only order Al Pastor and Adobada in that line.  If you wanted anything else from their menu like Chorizo, lengua, quesadillas or carne asada fries, you had to line up at 1 of the 3 other lines!!!  Ridiculous!!!  It took me 20mins to get my order of 2 Al Pastor vampiros in my line and as much as I wanted to try the other stuff, I didn't wanna line up again, especially since I arrived the lines were even longer!  After you got your oders, you had to pay at the cashier, then squeeze to the beverage counters.  Dear Tacos El Gordo owners, obviously your stuff is good and people are willing to line up for it, but I really wish you would care more about customer service!  I wish you would implement an effective process where it's first come, first served, order what you want, get it then pay!  We are not herds of cows wanting to eat, we are PEOPLE folks!

Moral of the story, come at an odd hour or come prepared... in a group of 5 people - 1 to save a table, 4 to order at each line/counter so all of yous can get what you want.  Or you can check out their other outlet at E Charleston Rd which may be less crowded.  

All we had was the Al Pastor vampiros and the flan.  The flan was good, but I have a personal preference of the Philippine leche flan over the Mexican version.  This version is more dense, but still yummy and creamy.  For those who haven't tried Vampiros, try it!  It's a taco meets grilled cheese sandwich.  It's all your taco fillings sandwiched between tortillas and grilled so that the cheese melts and packs all the goodness inside.  The Al Pastor meat was exceptional, one of, if not the best I've tried in Vegas.  Very tender and tasty, the right amount of sweet and spices.  The cheese was melted and yummy but the tortilla they used was so thin that most of it was pretty burnt.  I preferred the tortilla they use in Taco y Taco vampiros.  We definitely have to go back for the other items on the menu! 

P.S. 4 stars for the food, 4 stars for service (helpful runners that ensure the seating area is clean), and 2 stars for the ordering process which is very annoying."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Vegas that we have found so far! 

Cons: crowded, confusing service lines, especially for groups/families. Don't understand the need for separate lines for different meats, kinda weird & senseless.

Pros: Fast, cheap, SCRUMPTIOUS actual Mexican street tacos!  (I've been to Mexico not just Baja CA)

Delicious, I especially recommend the pastor quesadilla, or any quesadilla for that matter, THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness....THIS...is freaking amazing!!!! 

Pretty much every review below mine has covered everything. From the price, the flavoring and taste of these tacos....I know I'll be addicted to these. I've already gone twice in the past week alone.

Street tacos to the max! Small in size but packed with flavoring.

This is located on the Las Vegas Strip, so all your drunk tourists can stop by here after a night of drunken nightclubbing and sober up with these tacos.

For you So Cali peeps: You know King Taco? Yeah...that infamous place with bombass carne asada tacos. Well....TACOS EL GORDO is giving King Taco a run for its money. Maybe this surpasses King Taco. Who knows? I'll let you decide. So if you had KT before, you got to try these tacos out!!!!!! These won't disappoint, I promise."}
{"text":"OMG. I can't believe I haven't tried tacos el gordo until recently. I love love love tacos and this place definitely lived up to the hype! I tried the al pastor (of course), the chorizo, the suadero, and the lengua tacos. My favorites were the al pastor and the lengua. SOOOOOO GOOD!! I wish there were more locations. Only downside was that we went on a 102 degree day so it was miserable to stand in line and the inside wasn't much better. But I would do it again to get my hands on those tacos!"}
{"text":"OKAY. So there's a big reason why I am giving Tacos El Gordo 1 out of 5 stars...
 a couple weeks ago my friends and I visited the establishment late at night. This was my first time coming and I was so excited because I have been hearing great things about this place. They didn't have everything on the menu since it was really late at night and I can understand why so that wasn't a big deal. We got what we could be able to get. I got 1 taco de lengua and 2 tacos de asada. They were absolutely delicious and they even give you the little onions on the sides. For my first time, it was amazing and I was absolutely looking forward on coming back again.

A couple days later, we came back and I decided to try 2 tacos de pastor, 1 taco de cabeza, and 1 taco de asada. The thing is.... I FOUND A TOOTH IN MY TACO. I was shocked. I'm not one to be grossed out about things... but a tooth in my taco??? They tried explaining to me that it's normal and they tried offering me free food but honestly after that experience I didn't want to ever come back to eat tacos there again. I've had many tacos in the past from authentic places and this was by far one of the most shocking experiences while eating at an establishment. YUCK. 

On top of that, the cashier and the employees on the floor had nasty attitudes after I asked about the tooth in my taco. I'm better off making my own tacos at home."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of places in Vegas and generally am less than impressed. We drove past this place one day and the line was out the door and around the corner. This peaked my interest so I had to see what this was about and boy, it did not disappoint. Affordable and delicious. My favorite were the adobada. I will crave these until I return!"}
{"text":"One of the best taco places in town with a great location! Though it is almost always crowded throughout the day (even at 3 am!), it is worth the wait! My favorites include al pastor tacos and chorizo tortas! The meat is freshly carved for each taco and is prepared right in front of you. There are a good amount of tables inside and outside. I always go here after a night at the nearby nightclubs, like XS at Encore. It's a great night time food place that isn't pricey at all!"}
{"text":"I had to update this down one star because I went the other day around 10-11pm on a Thursday night and wasn't expecting it to be busy, but of course it was. I didn't mind waiting in line at all because the line was just up to the door, but the biggest problem was... the line wasn't moving for at least 15-20 minutes. I was standing in the same spot for the longest time and it didn't look like anyone's order was coming up. Usually, they can get people their food pretty quickly but not this night. Some people were complaining because each line was for different kinds of meat and so groups had to split up into the different lines so they could get carne asada, adobada, etc. and waste time going on every line. There needs to be a better system for that because if someone is by themselves on busy nights and they want different kinds of tacos, are they supposed to wait in every single line and let their food get cold? 

 I still enjoy the food here and will most likely come back but this is what I experienced recently the other night."}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you don't have patience and don't speak Spanish. We had the WORST experience and our food was less than mediocre. The gentleman cooking was rude and he didn't get our order right. He spoke only Spanish to me and I did my best but he was visibly exasperated with me because we had a communication issue. I apologized for my lack of skill and felt very embarrassed . When I brought the food back to the hotel my family was pissed, it was terrible!"}
{"text":"There are three Taco El Gordo in Vegas now...the one on Charleston is just as busy as the one on the Strip.

I had the asada tacos and mules because the line was short...bad move...beef was chewy...should have the lengua....

Oh well, tomorrow....

Lines are very long on a Saturday night...oh well, other places have no business."}
{"text":"Great quick tacos...best quesadillas I have ever had. For a simple taco shop meal it is the best I've had here so far"}
{"text":"I recommend this place to all my friends visiting Vegas.  Often times the Strip will cripple tourists' funds, so a cheap, delicious place to eat on the strip is ideal.

Get the adobada tacos, they're probably the best I've had.  The guy on weekends can also throw the sauce in the air and catch it in a taco..."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! The carne asada tacos are very good! Homemade tortillas, meat is tasty, top with avocado sauce and fresh garnishes. Worth the $2.25 for street tacos. I recommend this taqueria/restaurant.

The minus star is for the setting on placing order and paying for food. They have seperate lines for placing orders on different meat items and a separate line across to pay the cashier! chaotic! Especially, when you have a crowd and the lines are out the door and you are trying to get across to the cashier with your food,is just a challenge! Good luck finding a place to sit down to eat. This place is busy!"}
{"text":"These tacos are legit, the best I've had in Las Vegas. I get the carne asada fries when I come here though. You have to wait a little longer for them, but they are amazing."}
{"text":"The logistics of this place are stupid and deserve a 1 star, but the food is 5 stars all the way! My San Diego family has got me hooked on Tacos El Gordo.. I can only get it when I visit them.  You can imagine my surprise and happiness to find they have a location in Vegas! I sure did walk 20 minutes from my hotel in the scorching hot to eat me some adobada and asada tacos. By the time we got there, we were so ready. Then to our dismay, we opened the door to find the line up to the door, almost out the door. Darn! So we got in the line that looked shortest and waited. And waited more. As we got closer, our hearts sank.  We noticed that there were separate lines depending on types of meat.  I wanted asada and adobada, which meant I had to stand in line twice! Then if you want a drink, it's a separate line. Fries? Separate line. LAME! I don't remember San Diego locations being so asinine! So we split up and got into the lines we needed and placed orders for each other. The lines were about 15 minutes each... so I can't imagine 1 person wanting to do the not so unusual act of ordering more than one thing..they'd be there all day! Oh and then there is a separate line to pay.  Basically, don't come here starving, because it'll be awhile before you eat. Not to mention the place is friggin packed, but that's only because it's so good. 

But let me tell you, when you finally do get to eat, it'll be the best tacos you ever had. You'll probably overeat and not regret it. You'll wonder why you ever thought Taco Bell tacos were actually tacos.  I was definitely on my gordita status that day and it was well worth it."}
{"text":"I have a Mexican coworker who swears these are the best tacos he's had in the west.  The only tacos better he said, are in Tijuana.  So while in Vegas I decided to give them a try.

Went with my lady who is a half Mexican and a Mexican food freak!  We both agree these tacos were good, but not...oh my sweat Lord delicious.  Everything is quite fresh including the tortillas, but my issue is with their meats.  They taste under seasoned and lack flavor.  I'd go back only if I was in the area and there was no line, otherwise nahhh not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hands down the best and
Most authentic tacos and quesadillas on the Las Vegas strip! No contest"}
{"text":"I love their carne asada tacos here always have to stop here whenever I'm in Vegas! They serve it fresh always. The first time I've tried thier tacos was when they were still open near the strip and I fell inloveeee so yeah give them a try!!"}
{"text":"It's cheap and delicious! The tocos are huge with tons of toppings. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has awesome asada tacos. They are filled with avacado and salsa. This restaurant stays open till 3am on weekdays and 5am on Friday and Saturday night making it the best after-party stop.

This has become my favorite taco place in vegas. The carne asada tacos are awesome. I stopped there for lunch and later after going to a club stop there for dinner. this place is a great place to stop after a long night . it's open till 5 o'clock in the morning on friday and saturday nights and 3 o'clock in the morning on other nights of the week. my only complaint is the meat later on at night is fatty."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco spot in town! The carne asada is actually grilled, not cooked on a flat top like at other places. There are other protein choices like adobada, lengua, chorizo, etc. They also have nopales for those wanting a vegetarian option. The tacos come served on small corn tortillas but you can ask for flour if you prefer. You also have the option of ordering sopes, tostadas, mulas, or vampiros (like a mini tostada but with melted cheese topped with another crispy tostada). 

If you go for lunch, be prepared for the long lines and do yourself a favor and bring a buddy to help you hunt for a table while you order."}
{"text":"Looooove thier food! But English communication isn't so good! Other than that the service and food is worth the travel from the strip. City transportation is easy from downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"$2 tacos and open for your late night munchies. I got the spicy pork- best tacos I've had. The carne asada fries had a burnt taste from the meat...wasn't too big of a fan of the fries."}
{"text":"Once again , I was pleasantly surprised. Long lines usually and it's worth the wait. Different lines for different meats. I always get pork tacos with grilled scallions on the side. There is a fixins' bar that has radishes and sliced limes not to be missed."}
{"text":"Good tacos and nice setup.  Should be cheaper though. 2 bucks a taco? If you are ok with the price - but I've had tacos just as good and much cheaper.  Breakfast for two was 30.00!"}
{"text":"I had to try this place. The food is pretty authentic and fresh. The guy recommended I go with the adobada tacos. Which is the spicy pork. It was awesome. The meat was so tender. The tacos had onion, cilantro and a guacamole based sour cream. They were really delicious. 

The only reason I'm going with 4 stars is that the menu and where to order was confusing. They had like 3 different lines (apparently to order different meats, but it wasn't too clear whether or not you stand in different lines. I'll be back though."}
{"text":"My must go to place whenever I'm in Vegas! It's fast, fresh, easy & affordable. Adobada tacos, fries, errthang! It's the meat I only and always get ... I've just recently discovered you can request pineapples on your tacos; tried it & it was delish :p  -don't forget the grilled jalapeno & iced horchataaaaa"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is a gas station converted into a taco joint. That said, this place couldn't be more awesome. The tacos are the perfect size if your looking to try a few different variations. The ingredients are as fresh as they can be and the combinations, sauces and over quality are exceptional. I had the adobe pork tacos and tacos vampiros. Both awesome combinations of meat, seasoning and heat. Everything was 'flavorfully spicy' but nothing was 'burn your face off' spicy. Next time I'm here I'll have to try their fries. I've heard and seen great things. I'll be sure to frequent this place next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I've ever had.  You must try the spicy pork tacos!  

The Asada fries are great too but if you order them the half portion is more than enough for two.  The full portion could probably feed a few Poeple.

The spicy pork fries are great as well.

The line can get long especially around 1am but it's a great late night meal after a night of gambling!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good, cheap eats outside of the strip, I highly recommending going to this joint. Its a bit out of the strip so I'll look a lot more ghetto, but it's well worth the trip. I was there for a Sunday dinner and boy was it packed. There is plenty of parking. There is a lot of booths and seats, but getting a open booth can be difficult when its busy. Another thing that I didn't like was how to order. There are three lines, but each line you can only order certain stuff. I hope they would change this up soon.

If you're looking for a burrito, tough luck. They don't have any here. I decided to try the carne asada fries to go with my tongue, beef and oyo tacos. The meats were fresh and very comparable to something I can get in LA and San Diego. The carne asada fries were really good. The portions were huge, and I liked how they cut the meat. Most places the meat is cut into really small pieces; however, they give prretty big pieces here.

The service here is pretty good. The people serving you are pretty friendly and the cashier was really helpful. I wish I could give this place 5 stars, but they really need to improve on how the food is ordered. Other than that, I really enjoyed my dinner here."}
{"text":"Best $#*&ing tacos!  Get the Al Pastor/Adobado. Get more than you think you'll want because you'll want more."}
{"text":"The Best I've Had, Home in SD, in TJ, and here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Despite having been to Vegas at least 100 times, I never made my way to Tacos El Gordo until just recently. It's located in a strip mall about a 5 minute walk past Encore on the strip. The tacos are $2.00 and the carne asada fries are $10.00. Portions are pretty good - don't expect anything too fancy. There's limited seating inside but plenty of tables outside. The way it works is you go to the corresponding booth for what you want to order, put it all on a tray, and then pay after. Food is pretty good but I had a terrible experience.

One downside to this place is that it may or may not have gotten me food poisoning. Considering there's close to 1000 reviews on this place, I may have just been an oddball but I was in a sweaty, chilly pain a few hours after eating here praying all night long to the porcelain god in the hotel and vomiting 16x. Since this was the first thing I had in Vegas, I subsequently didn't get to indulge myself in any other food or alcohol for the remainder of the trip. 

You've been warned."}
{"text":"The Tacos are Amazing and the Horchata is Refreshing! I only knocked off two stars because the ordering process is a complete cluster****! This place def needs to work on organization. Also a chicken or veggie option would be nice."}
{"text":"Delish mini tacos. Food is great and tasty. Tacos are small but worth it. They do need a/c inside the restaurant though. It's temperature hot inside."}
{"text":"The place is completely remodeled.  No more outdoor dining...The kitchen and order area has totally redone.  I guess the local government made them do this.  The place can serve less people now.  However, the happy news.  The foods are just as good as before.  There is a nwe name for spicy pork, adobada.  There are also more different inds of beefs.  Will try the sopes before I leave town.  

This place is the best!"}
{"text":"This place is insane! I've never been to the SD location but heard that it's delicious. I stumbled upon the Las Vegas branch and was like I HAVE TO TRY THIS! Upon entering this place, you better know what you want and where to get it because they will get you in and out ASAP. To the far left you got the adobado, middie is the carne asada and far right is the counter for brain, intestines, stomach, lengua (my favorite!!!). You can make about anything with the different types of meat. I tried the Carne Asada fries, carne asada taco, mula con adobado, tongue mula and adobado fries. I actually had a Tacos El Gordo Sandwich (what is this??)...which involves TWO visits to TACOS EL GORDO within a 9 hour time frame with my first and last meal of the day being at this establishment with some more foodie (Korean bbq) and Las Vegas show in between. Probably my most BIG GIRL night in a long time. 

They also speak Spanish to you like you know Spanish. So brush up on your Spanish or get lost in translation. Drinks are $1.40 and there's only one size...BUT you get unlimited Ole drinks (mmmmz Orange Bang....). Indoor seating is scarce because they get filled up so quickly. Everyone wants to eat here at all times of the day, I swear. Never worked so hard to enjoy my food, but it's well worth it. If this place is too hectic for ya, try their other location off the strip approximately 3 miles away.

Anyhoo, I CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK! The food is delicious and everything else street Mexican is unacceptable now (unless someone proves me otherwise). Thanks for setting the standard Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"I am a lover and a believer of all things Tacos El Gordo. And when I say all things I am talking about the Adobada (Spicy Pork)!! If there was a drooling emoji that I could add to my review I would insert 27 of them here. That pork is sent from Heaven! I love it sandwiched between melted cheese and flour tortillas in the mulas or wrapped in a warm corn tortilla in taco form. You can't go wrong with this place. It literally hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"VIP service at a hole in the wall, really Mexican taco joint? You bet.

I first tried going to their location on the strip near Wynn but after I parked my car and walked around in circles I was disappointed to find out they closed that location recently. Thank god they still have this one!

As I walked in, the place was not surprisingly packed. Each 'station' line was snaking. That will never deter me, even if it went out the door.

I stood in the offal line. You know the good stuff: tongue, cheek, tripe. After maybe 30 seconds, a smiley and guapa staff member came up to me in line and asked what I wanted. I told her what I wanted and she tells me \"no need to wait in line, let me go get your tacos\". Before she heads to the back she clears off a counter and makes a table for me (there were no tables available). Score.

Maybe it was because I was the only one somewhat dressed up (just a sport jacket), maybe she mistaken me for someone else. All I know is Te Amo Gordo Senorita."}
{"text":"When the guy you're ordering tacos from doesn't speak a lick of English, you know you're in the right place.

My boss who speaks fluent Spanish told me this place is legit so I walked here.

Just North of Wynn, El Gordo looks like Mexico. Walking in it's kind of confusing to figure out but basically you have to line up by station to order each kind of taco. Inefficient and confusing yes, but you learn quickly. 

My advice: head for the offal station on the right. Rarely a line as white people think it's gross. Cabeza, lengua, buche, tripa, now that's the sh*t I dream about after. 

This is also the 1st taco joint I've been to that makes the tortillas fresh in front of you with a press! 

For under $10 for 4 tacos I can guarantee you that you won't find a better deal in Vegas. 

Te amo Gordo. You is THE Senor."}
{"text":"It was way over priced being almost 3 dollars per taco, which were tiny... And when they got my order wrong, I had to get in an argument with the manager to get them to remake it.... The food ended up being good, but absolutely not worth  $22.00 for 6 tacos, 1 quesadilla and 1 canned Fanta.... I won't return."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I go to Vegas they have the best tacos. The al pastor is my favorite here I've tried them here in Vegas and in San Diego and every time I've gone great food. I definitely recommend them to everyone"}
{"text":"This is a favorite for my husband when we visit Vegas. I prefer veggie meals so I started ordering the quesadillas with avo, cilantro, onions n salsa. If you like tacos, you'll fall in love with this spot."}
{"text":"For those who enjoy places like King Taco or just a good taco spot, this is it.  I've had the pleasure of stopping here a few times and I would tell anyone that wants good, fast food to try it.  My favorite meal is to have tacos al pastor. You have self serve refills and the prices are great.  Thank you Las Vegas.....for having authentic food to please the craving of awesome tacos!!"}
{"text":"BOMB, FRESH OHHHH sooo good!!! You walk in and order tacos first then pay... the carne tacos are sooo amazing fresh tortillas hand made, slow marinated meat topped with onion cilantro and guac OMGGGGG!! We shared a small carne fry just to taste it. So good as well, cheese creama, guac and topped with meat could use extra meat but that's preference. YUMMMMM"}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious; however you need to make a different line to order different type of tacos, doesn't make any sense.."}
{"text":"This place is amazing it is the perfect drunk snack after a night out on the Vegas strip the food is so good my favorite is the pastor quesadillas"}
{"text":"This place is off the strip, but worth the drive and wait. The place is small and the lines are long. Its a good idea to come with more then 2 people, so you can wait in both lines to get what you want. The price is cheap. The corn tortilla are made fresh like everything there. The steak taco and spicy pork taco on point. They were so delicious. Service was ok because it's crazy busy. Its a must stop location. I want to come back."}
{"text":"I been waiting so long to try this place out seen a lot of good reviews not really sure why I found nothing amazing about this place always packed no matter what time you come food was ok but I don't think I would ever come back good prices but really not worth coming back."}
{"text":"The tacos and sopes were amazing!!! I loved the green salsa and the grilled green onions and jalepenos also!"}
{"text":"YUP. THESE GUYS ARE SO AUTHENTIC, YOU MIGHT NEED TO BORROW SOMEONE'S ROSETTA STONE SPANISH EDITION.

When I got in line, there were about 3 people ahead of me. Each one of them ordered in Spanish. When it was my turn, the first thing I asked was, \"Do you speak english?\" The guy looked at me, smiled and said \"Si!\" I know that sounds funny but whatever I ordered, he translated it to his fellow compadres that were putting the food together. Btw, im Filipino if you guys are wondering.

So for the food. All the reviews on here are pretty much spot on so here's my 2 pesos......I mean.......2 cents. I ordered 3 tacos. Spicy Pork, Carnitas, and Carne Asada. Usually my favorite is Carne Asada but these three I got were so good, it didnt matter which one I ate first or last. At 2 bucks a pop, thats a pretty decent price for a tasty meal thats filling. 

The person at the next table ordered what looked to  be a nice sized Carne Asada Fries. I asked him how much it was. He said it was 5 bucks and it was the half size. (Que the record scratch). What? That's the half size? HOLY CRAP! (I wonder what that is in Spanish? LOL). 

As I finished up, one of the ladies that works there came up to my table, looked at me and mumbled something in Spanish. I just looked at her and shrugged my shoulders. She pointed at my tray of garbage, picked it up, and put it away for me. When she walked by again I said \"Gracias!\" I should of just kept my mouth shut because she actually started talking to me. I was trying to think of how to tell her I dont speak Spanish. So without thinking it through, I said, \"No habla ingles!\". As soon as I saw the look on her face I realized I just told her that I dont speak english! 

So in closing, you dont need to know Spanish to eat good food here. But in my case, it probably would of helped!"}
{"text":"Food: Nice, 2nd best in town.
Value: Solid pricing. Great value. 
Service: Long lines go quick, very fast service despite the larger crowds. 
Atmosphere: Fast food like atmosphere, not exactly first date material, very casual. Long lines become an issue with your eating space. People are simply hovering all over you while your eating. I resorted to eating in the car."}
{"text":"It's like getting authentic street tacos, but in a nice clean restaurant with tables to eat on. There are so many choices of meat! But luckily the tacos are 2-biters (or 3 if you take small bites) so you can try a variety of different kinds. My favorite is the Adobado- or spicy pork. I feel like that one packed the most punch. 

My fiancé got the carne asada fries and he wasn't too overly impressed. He didn't like that the cheese was cold and wasn't melted, so it wasn't as epic as he thought. But maybe the adobado fries would have been better with the spicy meat. We'll have to try that out next time :)"}
{"text":"This is real Mexican food. If you're a first timer, you're going to want to try some of what you think will be good. Lemme save you the trouble--don't. Just get the al pastor tacos. It's a marinated pork combined in spices and chiles, and Tacos El Gordo does it fantastically! It's cooked to perfection. You see them cut up the meat in front of you similar to how you'd see shawarmas prepared. Meat is full of flavor and moist. 

I've also had the lengua and the carne asada. Carne asada is fine, it was slightly on the burnt side for me and the lengua was meh. I'd recommend getting the al pastor over anything else.

Next time I have got to try the mulas, which are like mini quesadillas sandwiching your taco of choice. I heard great things about it after I ordered. 

TIP: Look at the signs and line up in the line with the al pastor tacos! That is where you order your al pastor. The signs tell you which line have which items. Follow that."}
{"text":"Loveeeee the adobada here & the Champechana fries! It will always be crowded so be prepared. You have to order your food first & then pay. Make sure you're in the correct line of what type of meat you want."}
{"text":"Hint: Don't come here when you're hungry, if you have kids/a large group of people, or if anyone you are with is in a bad mood/ pissed off!
My family and I went on 4 th of July & it was an hour and a half wait for food! It was highly amusing (for me) to see people getting all crazy and in fights over waiting for tables and just being aggro over the loooong waits.

Yes, it's crazy-mad mayhem, dirty, & a pain in the ass to get a table... but it's a meal/experience you won't forget! 
Definitely go in with more than 1 person, because you have to wait in separate lines for different menu items!

You HAVE to order the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos! They were the best thing we ate~ we tried all the different tacos and the Carne Asada fries. I don't know if it's cuz we were staving or if it's really that good,  but we all agreed that the food was awesome (2 friends with us that night we from Mexico, & they confirmed that those Adobada tacos were BOMB!!!)!

So if the line isn't too bad and you're looking for some authentic Mexican tacos when you're in Vegas, this place is definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Arguably our best meal in Vegas, certainly the most authentic. Value for food .. Tacos El Gordo takes it again. We ate some 5 star meals at some expensive casino restaurants. But all week my wife and I talked about how great their $2 tacos were. I goto Vegas fairly often, and this will now be a must visit for me each time."}
{"text":"Amazing al pastor tacos !!!!!!!! Campechana fries also highly recommended, best al pastor I've had. Gets busy but goes by fast, they have a good system set up to help with ordering quickly."}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars because of the deliciousness alone. Being from LA, I have super high expectations for tacos.

But if I had one caveat: the line for Al Pastor is no joke, and then looking for a table to sit at is another adventure.

The al pastor was the most wonderful tasting thing of my whole trip to Vegas except it took 45 minutes to get through the al pastor line. The lengua was also tender as well.

Couple of things, the tacos were too good. You can also order flour tortilla tacos where the tortilla I think is warmed up first. It seems that you get more meat when you get flour tortillas. I also got the tostada, and it's not your normal tostada. It has deep fried tortillas holding all the contents together. I especially liked that those tortillas tasted sort of like corn nuts.

Would come back here again."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing Mexican food I've ever had. If you come more than once I guarantee they will remember you.  I highly suggest the pork anything. If you come here for after bar food I know your sober self will be surprised at how much better it is sober, trust me. Been there done that."}
{"text":"I love that this place is so close to my house! and it's not as busy as the other ones so that's always a plus! the food is awesome, love their adobada! I haven't branched out and tried the other meats but maybe one day haha 

also it's a very clean looking facility. I've been the old location on the strip and that seemed so dirty. not this place! the employees are very quick to clean up after you get up from your table. 

this place is pretty awesome for when you wanna make a quick taco run!"}
{"text":"Orange bang, the reason I was ok with being subjected to their shit show of an ordering process & limited menu, has disappointed me. The drink is no longer sweet, thick, & creamy; on Sunday, it was literally a watered down version of its former self. No taste, no sweetness, no deliciousness. WTF happened there?! 

I finally ordered something other than fries -- cheese quesadillas. For $2, two strips of flavorful cheese is browned on ONE corn tortilla & folded over. I basically got a cheese taco (that sounds horribly wrong :-/) Aren't quesadillas, especially ones using small corn tortillas, usually made with two tortillas? I guess not here. 

Downgraded to 2 stars because I don't like being jipped."}
{"text":"Tacos are wonderful! One of my favorite taco shops on the planet! I love the carne asada and the small tostaditas. The meat has great cooked-over-wood taste and the guacamole on top is fantastic. Go early and beat the after drinking crowd. 

As a tip - remember to tip! Tips usually men fresh grilled veggies will hit your plate and some other extras. There are multiple meats to try here from basics to brains (sesos). The fries are a culinary treat! Enjoy this authentic taco shop!"}
{"text":"This place is SO OVERHYPED. For the price and service, I received here I would NEVER go back. 13 bucks for a box of fries? It wasn't worth the price.. the fries tasted bland compared to robertos and taco y taco. The service was terrible and the workers. I'd suggest for anyone with a taco or fries craving to go to taco y taco in Hendo! They even have more options and serve elotes and have many many GOOD sauce options. Save yourself a drive to tacos el Gordo and go to TACOYTACO  I promise it'll be worth it"}
{"text":"Food is great but the different lines for different meats are extremely inconvenient, you have to stand in different lines..took me 1hour to order."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it ZERO stars. They are completely unorganized.
 Every bite of my asada fries had a piece of fat. 
Almost witnessed 2 fights here! 
Food is gross! Don't come here. Save your money!"}
{"text":"My experience was not as good as everybody else's, it seems. Everything is so confusing as we waited a long line that seemed to stretch all the way out the plaza curb. After waiting in that line for 20-30 minutes at 2am, we are told it's only the carne asada line. Being as lit as we were (and first timers), we were like screw it, no Lengua today Bc we didn't want to wait in another long line so we took our tacos to go pay and take them to go. As I'm reading other reviews now, I'm seeing that the sauce was supposed to be ASKED for at the register. Well, that pretty much was a let down Bc the tacos were below mediocre without it, the lines were freaking long, and it's confusing when you've never been there Bc you just wait in the line that's going out the door and don't think to go into the restaurant to see the other lines (obviously) .. 

Don't know if I'll come back, I'm thinking of checking out tacos y tacos which I heard was on par, if not better (without the line)"}
{"text":"Great tacos- super packed which just proves that they are bomb. The order of getting your food and the lines is a bit much since it's so packed.. they should come up with something better to organize but besides that it's bomb.com."}
{"text":"This place closed down. I tried to find it, December 9, 2014. But I would have liked it. I base my five stars on the previous visit on Charleston."}
{"text":"This Tacos El Gordo needs alil help to be like the one in San Diego on the salsas and handmade tortillas. But They are Really good tacos. Love the meat! Especially the carne asada! I recommend everyone. In overall they bomb."}
{"text":"After a weekend of partying and gambling I had a craving for some west coast authentic mexican food before my trip back down south.   Last day in town so I did a Yelp search and this place came up.   It just do happened to be next to another place I was considering eating in the peppermill.   They both had lines,  but after talking to a friend of mine who is a Las Vegas native he told me peppermill was overrated.    So me and a friend stood in line that took an hour to get to the front.   I will say this,   Know what you want while in line.  If you have someone with you stand in separate lines as they split up into different lines depending on what you want.   I got the asada tacos on flour tortilla and my friend got the al pastor tacos on corn tortilla.   Both were delicious and some of the best Mexican food I've ever eaten.    My only regret is not trying the carne asada fries."}
{"text":"This place is insane....people and food is great.  Security guard was so nice..food is omg to die for nothing like it."}
{"text":"The tacos here are absolutely amazing!!! Especially when they make the tortillas by hand."}
{"text":"This place gets crowded fast, but for good reason, their food is amazing! I enjoyed the tacos al pastor and carne asada tacos which were both delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!! The alpastor tacos tasted like heaven!!! And I've had a lot of tacos.  I also had a quesadilla and a taco de buche! OMG amazing.  Will definitely go back before our 4 hours drive home.  If you're in town take the bus get off on convention walk a few feet."}
{"text":"Tasty. authentic. yummy. The loaded fries were awesome as well as the pork tacos. Wouldeat ther again for sure."}
{"text":"Has the  slowest service...in top of how slow they are you have to then stand in the different lines to get the different kinds of tacos you want. One star only because I can't go any lower."}
{"text":"FREAKIN'  Amazing Tacos !  (I think they all have different toppings.)

And they have a parking lot !  (It's the first open lot on the Strip, so you can hit  a few kitschy t-shirt shops at the same time.)

ps open HELLA late"}
{"text":"Great food but long lines and the weather is are the factors to deal with. I would go back in cooler weather."}
{"text":"Great spot. Worth the wait n the $$$. The carne asada was great n el pastor meat delicious."}
{"text":"Yum-O!!!!! Can't give it 5 cuz the carne asada wasn't good!  I alonehad 5 tacos.. hehe!! .. it wasn't that BIG...

I love the pastor, the best I've had in Vegas so far, so much flavor and just the right amount of seasonings.  

Kinda expensive for a  tho. $2.25 or was it $2.50(I'm not sure )I know it's located on the strip that's y, but no excuses..hehe. 

For 9  they only give u 3 hot sauces (which is in the fridge) behind the cashier.. if u want extra it's   50cent.. it's limited hot sauce everywhere else.. gotta complaint!!  I'll come back next time cuz it's that good and plus they  my pics on Instagram and reposted.."}
{"text":"Omg this place was a serious buzzkill omg. I don't get the idea of waiting in different lines for different meats o_o whoever thought of that must have been on something. PLUS they should make the signs bigger because if it's freaking packed and I'm all the way in the back how would I know which line was what!!! -_- anyways, the service was so terrible I never experienced anything like this. I wanted to add to my order after ordering and he simply declined me. I literally waited 40 minutes plus and you can't add 3 more tacos to my order?! Ridiculous. I ordered the pastor and it didn't even come with pineapples. I'm upset at the fact that other people in the line I was in was able to order different assortment of meat choices but when it was my turn he declined me!!! Are u serious ?!!!? I really don't get the hype of taco el gordo either, it isn't that great. I would choose any taco truck over this place any day. I just felt like the staff was very rude and it just isn't worth the 40 minutes wait."}
{"text":"Awesome! You made my day. My husband and i had an amazing dinner, i love Adobada fries, its tastes so good! (only $10). We definitely go back!"}
{"text":"TACOS EL GORDO IS OPEN AGAIN ON THE VEGAS STRIP!! UGHHH THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN! *___* But let me tell you.. This place is poppin! I came at 2pm and we still had to wait a little outside. I can't even imagine how long the line would be late night after the club. Drunchiessss. Anyway, DEF worth the wait.

I knew exactly where I was going to be after day club. This place is cheap and the tacos are just amazing. My friend and I split the half carne asada fries ($6 compared to large $12). I ordered the al pastor taco and lengua taco as well. I was so satisfied since I was so hungover and thinking about tacos all day.

The workers there help you find a seat after you pay.
You wait in line for which meat you want then pay at the front and get seated."}
{"text":"Long lines because they are really tasty.  Carne asada and adobada, both amazing!  Decide how much you think you want, multiply it by 2, then order."}
{"text":"Best Damn Tacos in Vegas Hands Down!!! We always make a trip over here when we're in Vegas. It's always made fresh! The only thing they can be better at is the seating, I know it's always busy there that they can't help but overall it is always delicious!!! If you want good tasting tacos or whatever is on the menu there everything is amazing! I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place, but they need to expand because sometimes it gets a tad busy. However, in the wee hours of the morning, as you're exiting XS..it is quite a pleasant waltz over to grab some al pastor fries to help you KO for the evening. 

Just..so..noms."}
{"text":"It's easy to fall in love with Tacos El Gordo... the smell of grilled carne asada as you walk from the parking lot to the door, the hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, the amazing tacos... Yeah, I've fallen for this place just like many others have. Even though part of my heart still belongs to my first (taco) love, Los Parados. But, that place is long gone and I'm just glad I finally have El Gordo to fill the void.

The adobada tacos ($2 ea.) are every bit as good as everyone says they are. The best part of the pork were the pieces carved from the exterior of the pork on a spit. They had an amazing crispy, charred edge to it that added to the transcendent flavor and texture combinations of the tacos.

And, don't forget about the carne asada tacos ($2 ea.). They're some of the best I've had in town. The quality of the beef was outstanding. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the slimy green faux-guac sauce covering the meat. Next time I'll just have to get the tacos plain, with nothing but onions and cilantro.

Everyone seems to love this place, as evidenced by the long lines that snaked through the restaurant during the peak lunch time. So, whether or not you love tacos or are a taco virgin, stop by Tacos El Gordo and you'll be enthralled too."}
{"text":"The best tacos in the world just like ones in tijuana if you are in vegas you have to come here  Tacos al pastor and tacos de tripa  the best"}
{"text":"The food here is so GOOD!
The make fresh tortilla for there tacos.
I love the Taco Asada! Today I tried the FLAN
OMG it is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I'm keeping this review short and simple. OMG!!! I just had the best adobado tacos!!! It's kind of good that it's on the strip somewhat from where I live or else I'd be here a lot. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible Service and long lines for them to tell you that you're in the wrong line for the type of meat you want. They need to figure out a way to accommodate all type of meats in one line! The best meat they have is the Pork Adobada. Try to avoid during the day because it's just too hot and people tend to get rude in hot weather."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever. It's always so crowded here, but it's always worth the wait and you can see why it's so crowded here when you taste their food.

I come from the other side of Vegas, but I really do not mind the drive. They're open late too, for any late meals or snacking.

My go to here is adobada everything. The adobada fries are amazing and the adobada tacos are even better. The staff always seems so happy too, it's just a great experience every time :)"}
{"text":"We had to check this place out, since so many people recommended this place. The wait was about one hour and a half. Not worth it ! The meat was not fully cooked and the tacos were tiny. I also ordered a Sope and it's not your typical Sope. It has cheese and meat and a bit of salsa. I asked for extra salsa and did not get it. I was very disappointed, not sure if they were just having a bad day."}
{"text":"Awesome place for tacos but the carne asada sopes were my favorite! I felt like the tacos were a little overpriced but they were definitely worth the very long wait. It's a very packed restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night after a long night of partying; I read the high starred reviews and really wanted to like this place and I did. HOWEVER, the order of ordering (awkward to say) can be improved. You go in and order your food which is ready pretty much immediately. Then you have to wait in a long line to pay for it, as your food is in your face, getting cold. The tacos (I ordered Pastor) were delicious but small and go for $2.25 each. I wanted to order the carne asada fries but it seems way to expensive for what it was. If I'm in Vegas again I might give it a second go."}
{"text":"Amazzzzing! The adobada tacos are a must! Affordable. Convenient hours and location."}
{"text":"This place is all hype! Long lines, hard to find a table. Asada tacos had no flavor and the horchata was watered down."}
{"text":"I got 6 adobada tacos, and let me tell you they were some of the best tacos I've ever had, and I consider myself a taco expert. Fresh corn tortillas, pico, and the meat is cut right in front of you. The only down side is the wait is stupid long, I waited about 40 minutes, it also seemed like one of their kitchens were closed. Other than that these tacos are amazing at $2 a pop!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy packed every time I go. The last time I went was on thanksgiving day but I'm already planning another trip to vegas just for some more tacos. Fat much..? Its just so gooood! Don't judge me (: 4 stars because of the long, messy, unorganized lines. Keep in mind that there are signs indicating what you could order from the line you stand in. For example if you want asada you have to stand in that line, if you want al pastor go to that line and so on."}
{"text":"Wow- just wow!!!!! My mouth is still watering after eating the al pastor tacos.  Thank god I don't live close I would want to eat here daily!!"}
{"text":"I love tacos el Gordo!! Their buche tacos are the best in town. They get 3 stars because they are a bit over priced, and the rude lady at the cash register that refused to give me more salsa. I was pregnant, my husband and I got around 10 tacos (I was eating for 2) and the lady only gave me 2 salsas. When I asked for more she said the tacos already came w salsa!!! Wtf is wrong with thi girl!!!! I had 10 tacos in my hands, are you serious!!! Needless to say their mediocre choice for staff made them lose some really good customers!!"}
{"text":"So many delicious choices, and so cheap! I love the system they have... order all your food from the cook, wait seconds while they prepare your taco at lightning speed, then pay at a different station. That's some Mexican efficiency right there.

My favorite, by far, was the lengua taco. The lengua was so tender and so very delicious. Can't go wrong with a whole tray full of lengua tacos and a jamaica to wash it down.
The suadero tacos was a bit on the dry side, so not that good. I also tried the pork stomach (I forget the name they had on the menu)... it was soft and tripey, if you like that kind of texture, but the flavor wasn't very strong.

4 to 5 tacos is enough for a whole meal, and with all the different meat choices, works well to give you a good variety. Next time, I'll definitely try the asada fries and the chorizo taco (the chorizo taco menu item is easy to miss)."}
{"text":"Tacos que no te puedes perder cuando visitas Las Vegas. 
Los de cabeza y Tripas son los mas mamlones. 
Best Tacos in Vegas specially the Tripe and head tacos."}

{"text":"Best Tacos in Vegas!! Can't believe I'm eating these tacos in this city! These tasty tacos seem like I'd be driving to California or Mexico for them. Pork Tacos are AMAZING! Especially with the avocado sauce and all the fresh fixins! Oh and if you like pineapple, ask for them on the pork tacos! You're Welcome!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing, and totally worth the long walk from the busier part of Las Vegas Boulevard. Even in the middle of July! 

I feel it's best to come here with at least one or two buddies. One, because there are multiple lines that you'll have to stand in if you want different meats. So if you want three tacos with three different meats that are in different lines, just bring two buddies! You can each order everything everyone wants and get it all hot at the same time. 

I highly - HIGHLY - recommend the cabeza tacos. The head meat is SO tender and flavorful, that putting it simply on a taco is the way to go. An absolute must here are the loaded fries. We got them with adobada, but the fries are so perfectly cooked and LOADED with cheese, guac, and everything you would ever want to put in your mouth, that you could top it with mothballs and it would still taste good. My bffski and I went here and completely gorged with tacos, sopes, horchatas, and a full order of fries for only $20. I was also so pleasantly surprised by the large outdoor seating area. It has a roof, so you're not burning in the desert sun. Perfection.  

If you asked me to, I would probably fly into Las Vegas just to come back here. Maybe I need to rearrange my priorities?"}
{"text":"Service + Interior: 4
Price vs. Quantity: 5
Food Taste: 5

This place is legit. That's the best way I can describe it. When you walk into a PACKED taco joint and you're the only non-Hispanic person there, that's when you know you're going to get some good tacos.

When you walk in it can be confusing at first. There's numerous lines and it's not very clear why. You have to actually pick the meat you want first, and then you stand in the right line that serves that meat. That can be kind of annoying though, because if you want pork tacos AND steak tacos you gotta stand in two lines to get them. I suggest bringing a friend if you can to cut the time in half.

My partner and I went in separate lines. He wanted asada (steak) and I wanted adobada (spicy pork). The lines can go by quickly or slowly depending on if the people ahead of you are ordering 50 tacos or not. The workers make the tacos pretty darn quick and cram as many as they can on a small plate.

They have a section where you can get some fresh limes and radishes to enhance your taco eating. Then you head over to the cash register. The prices are very reasonable, and for Vegas, cheap.

Good luck finding a seat if you go during a rush. The tacos were delicious. I tried the adobada first. It wasn't very spicy, but the flavor was great! The pork is similar if not the same as al pastor, but there wasn't any hint of the pineapple sweetness. It was just a nice spiced flavor. They put a good amount of onions without overwhelming, some cilantro, and two different sauces which I couldn't tell what they were. None of the pork was fatty or greasy.

The asada was amazing! You could taste that grill char flavor and you can tell the meat is fresh. They put a dollop of guac on it too and for no additional cost *cough*Chipotle*cough* and let me tell you about the glorious after taste that the tacos leave in your mouth afterwards. You'll be licking your chops to get another hit of that savory flavor. 

The chorizo taco we got was ok. The chorizo itself was not uber greasy like a lot of other places, but the flavor was lacking a little. The tortillas are made fresh right where the meat is being cooked and they had a nice slightly chewy consistency."}
{"text":"Mhmm such a fan of this place, whether it's for the day or late in the night.

- Tacos are worth it
- Wait sucks
- Good/Quick service

Overall, can't go wrong if you can sacrifice waiting."}
{"text":"On my virgin trip to the City of Sin I only wasted away for 24 hours,  but two of my three life saving meals were at \"The Gordo\".  Discovered with the aid of Yelp,  I arrived for meal #1 around midnight after an evening of hotel pregaming before beginning my walk down the strip. Not having eaten since the Grand Canyon 12 hours ago, my dire need of sustinence was cloaked until arriving by the alcohol previously ingested.  As soon as I read the menu, my jaw dropped in wonder how such a popular spot could crank out the oddities offered.  Well, when in vegas...

There was no written indication as to which lines were for each cut (pork, beef, or specialty cuts), so I stood in line for abodaba for 10 minutes before speaking with a rep.  *Left is beef, middle is pork, and right is specialty cuts.* When relocated to the correct line, the chef would reach under a steaming towel to select and cut each cut of meat made to order.  This line isn't the fastest, but totally worth it.  Out of the corner of my eye there was an older woman hand packing corn tortillas out of fresh corn meal.  Talk about made to order.

The first night I got the cabeza, sesos, and beef shoulder.  I'm not gonna pretend to be qualified to judge these cuts, but I found the cabeza to be flavorful with a very soft texture, and the sesos were creamier than I have had in the past.  The beef shoulder alone merited my return the next night!  All of these tacos on corn tortillas were served with light lettuce, onion, and salsa verde relishes.  This surprise of an experience lured us back for a quick dinner the next evening when I chowed on more shoulder, abodaba, and tripe.  

For being on the strip, this place is a hidden gem.  Good, cheap food on the strip is hard to come by, and authentic $2 tacos are tough to beat anywere.  The lack of English can be disguising and my gf and I were the only gringos in there (other than the officers on a meal break - they know where to eat and that's always a good sign).  Spanish as a second language paid off in Vegas!"}
{"text":"THIS IS A GEM OF A FIND ON THE STRIP!

Once you are all buffet'd out and are looking to save money without sacrificing quality, then this is your spot! It's perfect walking distance from the Riviera and the Wynn. These guys are open late into the early hours especially on fridays and saturdays. 

They have some booths inside but most of the seating is located outside in two decent sized tents which you cant miss if you're driving by on the street. On cold nights they have those gas powered heating elements for those of you that think Vegas doesnt get that cold.

The parking is decent and on some nights you have street racers meeting up here just to hang out. Im suprised this location doesnt have an armed security guard like the Charleston location.

As for the food, the three most popular items that I usually get here are the El Pastor tacos, Carne Asada tacos, and the Adobado Fries. The tacos are 2 bucks a pop and the Adobado Fries are 5 bucks for the half order and 10 bucks for a large order (the half order is virtually a meal in itself!). You have the option of having everything on your tacos and fries at no extra charge. These are the guacomole sauce, onions, and cilantro for your tacos. For the fries you can get sour cream, guacomole, and extra cheese. You can even ask for grilled green onions and jalapenos on the side. Also you can have them put grilled pineapple bits as well, BUT YOU HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR THESE so if you dont than they will not give it to you. That's why I love these guys, no extra charge for all those mentioned above.

I also like this place better simply because of the fact that they have TWO service stations meaning they have twice the amount of food servers and cashiers (yes they take cards and there is no minimum) which equals faster service although on really busy nights you cant tell. Plus, it seems that they speak better english here than the other location. http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegas

If you are up for it, there is another place that serves an even better El Pastor. They are a couple miles away on Charleston just down the street from the other Tacos El Gordo. They are called Taqueria El Pastorcito. When you go East on Charleston, look for the trailer with the bright lights on the left side of the street just right before Los Tacos on the right side.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-el-pastorcito-las-vegas#query:Tacos%20El%20Pastorcito"}
{"text":"Love, love, love, this place! Lines are long, it's loud, and you come out smelling like tacos but it's worth it all. The pastor tacos are as legit as you can find. The staff is friendly and so fast. Make sure you ask for grilled onions because they are delicious and free!"}
{"text":"The tacos al pastor (with everything) are amazing!!!! I have also gotten carne asada fries from here that were very good as well. The restaurant is very clean. Would highly recommended this taco shop to anyone."}

{"text":"OMG this is a find like none other. The best taco deal in town! Their spicy pork tacos are awesome! All the tacos are only just over $2 each. Order lines are divided by the type of taco you want, providing exceptionally fast service. Cafeteria style seating. Self serve drinks. Open very late, a great late night snack! Don't miss this place, folks!"}
{"text":"QUICK STORY TIME! I had an hour to kill & was in the area. I just recently moved to Vegas so I don't know ANYTHING. I quickly yelped \"food\" & came across this-- it had good reviews so why not? (side note I LOOOOVEEEE tacos & basically all Mexican food).

BEST TACOS I'VE HAD IN A VERY, VERY LONG TIME & I THINK THE BEST IN VEGAS????

I'm the type of person that orders the weirdest thing on the menu. So of course I had to order the Lengua & Cabeza! The cabeza is AMAZING. So flavorful! The lengua was equally as good, but cabeza is by far my favorite (I order it anytime I see it on any menu).

I love the atmosphere of this place as well. It's nothing fancy at all, but I just love seeing the families in here and how busy it is, idk, it makes me happy. also-- FREE REFILLS ON FOUNTAIN DRINKS. HOLLAHHH.

Seriously, I will be coming back here again & again.... & again & again.

THIS PLACE IS BOMB EVERYONE MUST COME HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Carne was excellent cooked and seasoned to perfection even know it was packed wall to wall still was in and it of line in under 10 minutes. They hit the spot with this one"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that now that I've cut meat and dairy from my diet, I sadly can no longer eat here, but when I did eat meat and dairy, Tacos el Gordo was THE ISH. 

Adobada mulas ALL. THE. WAY. I could never possibly explain to you the glorious taste. Plus, the adobada chef used to remember me and encourage me to practice my Spanish there.  

I have never heard of anyone who didn't love the food. It's incredible. Heard skepticism? That person either experienced a worm-hole-esque fluke or is lying to you to sound cool (the sort of I-used-to-like-that-band-before-they-got-popular lie). 

You eat meat and dairy and are hungry right now? What are you doing reading this review? Go buy an adobada mula right this second!"}
{"text":"OMG when I found out LV had a location I dropped to my knees! I've had this place in San Diego! My friends were all raving about the spicy pork. I was thinking.. come on how good can it really be. I drove to SD and had to try it for myself. Heavenly tacos being sliced up right in front of you. The pork is similiar to the vietnamese bbq pork that I eat at home. It's made with this awesome green sauce that's to die for. The corn tortillas are thrown on the grill and lightly cooked. You will not get tacos like this anywhere else. I recommend this place to everyone!

Recommendation: Spicy pork tacos."}
{"text":"The food is amazing , the prices are great and the service is very friendly . Come early to beat the crowd !"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! A friend sent me here because I was looking for good Al Pastor. As soon as you get there, you know you've made the right choice because of the sheer number of people in line.

I was planning on getting three tacos, but when I saw the guy making them I ended up getting four. The meat looked incredible, roasting and dripping over the heat. 

There wasn't an open table in the entire restaurant, so I grabbed my tacos to go, but I couldn't wait. I devoured all four tacos in my car, and decided I wasn't done yet. I got right back in that long line and got more tacos. 

Two or three is usually good four me, maybe four if I'm feeling really hungry. These were so good I had six tacos in total, and I felt like a huge fatty. But it was so worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite taco shop. I can tell u about it using words but that won't begin to describe its luster. Carne asada tacos r my go to that being said others will point u in the direction of the rotating pork which has a certain allure if your into that sort of thing. It's a short scooter ride away from the house, I bring all friends and family here when they visit. Plus e z parking minus so busy during munchie hours. Make sure to ask for the red and green salsas at the register."}
{"text":"I was a little bit disappointed eating Tacos El Gordo here. The one in San Diego and the one in TJ, Mexico did more justice. The flour tortilla I had was overcooked/dry. I am presuming that's not normal as the other two locations especially the one in TJ,Mexico was perfectly cooked and very soft (not crunchy); just to my liking. I ordered the Beef shoulder which seemed like a new type but sadly it was not very memorable. It was very lean and lacked much flavor. Also I got my favorite Beef Tongue tacos here but again was disappointed. They diced the beef tongue too much so it looked more like mush. The other places served my Beef tongue in generous portions and it was more diced than mushed which is how I liked it and expected. The Adobada was also just  \"meh\"; they gave me burnt slices so it was more crispy and burnt tasting =/

One thing I didn't appreciate here was they were giving pineapple slices to selective people in their Adobada tacos. That was absolutely not cool. I would not return to this location in my next trip to Vegas. I'll leave it to San Diego and TJ, Mexico for my Mexican cravings at a Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Authentic. Cheap. You will be the only guy who speaks English. $6 makes you full. This is what Tacos should be. Get adobada. its the only taco you will need...."}
{"text":"The food here is good, and the demographic in attendance legitimizes the authenticity. 

The good food is the only thing that got them three stars. I cannot go higher than that because the waits are excessively long, and this is compounded by the fact that you have to be in one of three different lines to order the various offerings. Why do I have to wait in one 20 minute line for tacos, and then get in another 20 minute line for soup?"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had!!! There was a bit of a wait to get the food but definitely worth it. The tortillas are made fresh throughout the day and very delicious. They automatically put salsa and other toppings on the tacos unless you tell them otherwise. It is a little loud with it being busy so you have to speak loud in order for them to hear you. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had Tacos El Gordo last night for dinner.

The environment is hectic. The place was packed with people and there was a lot of confusion over the fact that you had to stand in different lines for different items. They are set up station style. This can be a little problematic if there is only one of you ordering but you want different things which is why the only thing I ordered was 8 
Tacos De Adobada because I ended up in that line. Next time I will make sure there is at least 3 people with me so one person can stand in each line to order a variety.

The tacos were on your typical small duel corn tortillas flash fried in oil. The meat was sliced right onto the shells and then the tacos were dressed with fresh cilantro, red salsa, chopped onions and then a creamy avocado sauce.

Two thumbs up for the tacos. They were delicious and after we ate them I wish I had ordered about 4 more. There is just something about tacos in the west that are truly fantastic and you just cant beat the prices."}
{"text":"This is the real deal street tacos. Its almost always packed but the lines move fast. They are pretty organized with the flow of service. They also added an outdoor eating area as there was not enough room inside. This place is like actually being in Mexico and getting down for some real grub. I highly recommend this place. 5 STARS."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place, have yet to try it, until yesterday. I got 5 carne asada tacos, and oh man, they were on point. I like the variety of salsa they offer, and I gotta say, their salsa is better than most other places. I didn't get to try anything else, but if you want good tacos, I can definitely recommend this place. Service was fast, although I did go when it wasn't so busy. 5 stars though for making my belly happy lol"}
{"text":"I'm from the Midwest, Chicago to be exact where taco places are pretty common and delicious by far one of my favorite taco spots I've found :) the cooks are amazing and always have a great attitude! I'm really glad I was introduced to this place! Trust me you won't regret going!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best tacos in the world.  Of course it was 3 am, and everything tastes good then.  the $4 for 2 tacos were more satisfying than the $60 meal I had six hours earlier"}

To wait. Their al pastor and tripas are bomb.com!"}

{"text":"Delicious and cheap. They make the tortillas right there fresh. We got the pork tacos with everything on them - 2 each - and I wished I had ordered a few more. Lines were very long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This taco joint is a must try for someone who is looking for a more authentic street taco experience. The carnitas and torts were both amazing. They slice the pastor pork off onto your tortilla as you order. The salsas are a nice addition and everything taste fresh and homemade. I'll definitely be going back as I am regularly in Vegas."}

Even though it was my first time dining there I will be coming back soon & try something different off the menu.
Hopefully next time I go I'll their horchata."}

{"text":"Very busy and cheap spot. Tacos are bon appetite. Worth every penny.  Throughout the day it's not that busy but at night it extremely busy. Seems like s common place"}
{"text":"Our friends brought us here stating these are the best tacos ever.  I strongly disagree. First the atmosphere  is so hectic, different lines for different tacos.   Although my husband enjoyed his tacos my carne asada ones were ok  the meat had fat which I had to pick out before I ate it. The salsa was not even spicy.  I come to Vegas often however I I'll not be going out of my way for this place.  I am able to get tacos that are 100 times better closer to home. For those that like this place, enjoy!"}
{"text":"My bf and I stopped by here yesterday before we were about to head back home, super packed but the line moves fast! The Mulas and tacos de al pastor are bomb! We need one of these in the San Fernando Valley!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday around 1am, line was long but moved quickly maybe about a 30 min wait.  Pay attention to the lines of what meat you are going to get.  We had asada and tripas both delicious.  Tacos are bomb($2.25) mulas(4.50) delicious, and asada fries were good as well..kinda pricey $14 but they serve a lot and we're in Vegas so i figured wherever we eat its gonna be pricey and at the food was worth every penny.  This will def be a normal stop when in Vegas.  Bummed they were out of chorizo..so next time I'll go earlier."}
{"text":"I really love Taco El Gordo at the other locations and now they opened one up closer to my home and I was pretty ecstatic. It took me a while to come visit this location, though, I'm not quite sure why.

I think the only thing I have an issue with is the set up of the place. I know they are pretty known for it and not that many people really care about the setup but I just hate going into one line for carne asada and then having to go into another line for the spicy pork.

But boy do I love the spicy pork tacos with everything especially that guac on top. I always ask for extra. BOMB. and then you can ask for chili and onions on the side, oh so good and spicy! I also get the carne asada fries half not full because the half is like already big enough anyway. I love how it just taste so authentic. The staff could be a little nicer but they aren't necessarily mean but could smile a bit more.

I also LOVE that their fountain drinks consist of Mexican drinks like Horchata or that Pina juice. BOMB. and its free refills! 

Quick tip, if you need green or red salsa ask the cashier. It took me a while to figure out where i can get salsa from because usually they just have it out and it's a serve yourself type of thing but not here. It is kinda good though because then the salsa doesn't get infested with random things if its just out there in the open.

love this place. will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Unreal tacos. This place is amazing. Went there 2x in one day, 12 PM and 3 AM. Absolutely packed both times and for good reason. Don't let the long lines scare you, they move rather quickly, I waited at most 10 minutes for probably the best tacos of my life. I'm normally a carne Asada guy but get the spicy pork tacos!! By far the best"}
{"text":"The Al Pastor and homemade tortillas are to die for!! So delicious, amazing service and the security guards are so friendly with the kiddos! Will be returning everytime I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  SO authentic.  SO good...

Every taco meat you can imagine.  All are delicious.

An oasis of yummy, affordable goodness surrounded by expensive, fake high-rise casino hotels.

This is where the workers in those fake high-rise casinos eat.

Simply awesome..."}
{"text":"I don't think so! One star for all of Vegas! I'm not eating this garbage ever again! Now way!"}
{"text":"Im not sure why this place has more than 2 stars, its not that good, OK at best. Maybe if you never had Mexican food before than that would make sense. 

To start, the lines are confusing and chaotic!The tacos, were made inconsistent, some had not enough meat some had no guacamole some had one tortilla and some had two. The meat, was dry with no taste. 

The price at $2.00 a taco off the street should be a Very Good taco, this is not even close, its more of a $1.00 taco!

So many other places are much better. I don't get it."}
{"text":"Had to see what the fuss was all about. The tacos are just OK. However, now that I have tried this place, I probably won't make a special trip to try them again. I just thought the food was average at best. It was crowded for a weekday night."}
{"text":"Great option when you're craving a taco! Very authentic and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Hype. It either is the maker or breaker of expectations. Unfortunately, this didn't live up to the hype. Almost everyone that eats late night or has a recommendation for other than regular eats on the strip, will utter this name.

The food wasn't bad, hell, it was good and flavorful like a lot of places in L.A. I would even dare to say a bit better. The service, well, I don't expect much, but it was satisfactory. The thing that makes no sense to me at all, the ordering system. Why is there 1 person and a separate line for a selection of meats? Why?! The lines would move so much quicker if they had people in the back cutting up said meats while 4-5 counter people take orders. Nope, they think having 1 guy handling each specific meat and 1 guy handling sides (grilled peppers, onions) is the way to go.

Well, it's not. It's a huge and annoying clusterf**k of people in line. It just makes no sense. Then, I wanted to buy an agua fresca, but no one told me how to get a cup. What? I ended up with a can of Coke. 

Meats and wares are good, but again, don't get the system of ordering and considering this is quite some ways away from the strip and the wait for food I can get in a good taqueria in L.A., I'll pass."}
{"text":"I think I've reached the closing of my quest for the best taco. Truly authentic, flavorful, and reasonable at $2.00. I personally recommend the spicy pork and beef tongue."}
{"text":"good tacos but a bit pricey for the size also no hard shell tacos just hard tables to sit at"}
{"text":"--LOCATION-- Near Wynn. It's a shop facing the street; not inside a hotel or anything

--PARKING-- there is a parking lot, but try walking there if you can. I walked from Palazzo.

--MENU-- tacos, tortas, quesadillas, fries, etc. NO BURRITOS. Each taco is either $2.40 or $2.25 depending on which meat you get. Each taco comes with cilantro, green sauce (i think it was guac..), and diced onion. They will cut up the meat and prepare your orders right in front of you. 

There's a radish (whole and sliced) and lime bar

I ordered 6 carne asada tacos and 8 lengua tacos. Total~ $36

--ORDER-- Each line is a meat station. You line up and order based off of what meat you want to get. I went alone and it took me 45 min-60 min from start to finish. I wanted to get the spicy pork, but I gave up and just got extra lengua.

I SUGGEST GOING WITH A GROUP TO SPLIT UP AND ORDER TO BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH TIME. 

Pay at cashier once you got your orders. 

--SEATING-- There are a lot of tables, but you may not be able to sit down because of how popular and crowded it gets. 

--SERVICE-- They move very fast and very slowly. The lines took foreverrrrr to move. But when I was finally in front, it looked like the meat station guys moved very quickly. My carne asada guy did disappear mid-order though...

--OVERALL-- very stressful experience. I was also soooo disappointed that my lengua tacos were pretty skinny. The carne asada tacos were filled to a decent amount. Some of my tacos really didn't have enough toppings, either. The meat themselves were juicy, but I admit I've had better in LA.

I wish they had pico de gallo or spicy sauces or jalapenos at the radish/lime bar. But in a way I'm glad they don't because I know that would just cause more lines and more waiting and more chaos.

 I think this is more like a 3.5/5 star for me, but I'll round up to 4/5."}
{"text":"Don't bother going anywhere else (unless it's a street vendor type thing) these are the best tacos in Las Vegas hands down. You have to try the tacos de al pastor. In my opinion they are the best taco meat they have there. They're guacamole Is amazing also and I hate guacamole."}
{"text":"Never been in a taco shop, without tortillas, we wait 15 minutes for them.to bring them, long wait and the tacos were salty and cold due to slow service"}
{"text":"One of my bridesmaids and I were tasked with purchasing liquor for my pre-wedding/bachelorette festivities, but we stumbled upon this gem while en route to the liquor store at the strip mall next to Encore. I've frequented Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, but since I've moved back to the East Coast, I wasn't keeping up with the chain's expansion so I was ecstatic to find run into one in Vegas!

I stuck with my favorite, lengua (tongue) for $2.25 each and devoured it. 3 tacos is probably more than enough. The food is super fresh and the service is quick and there's plentiful seating so you can be in and out. They also have Mexican drinks such as horchata (!!!) readily available to be dispensed.

I'm definitely coming back again when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Authentic tacos! A little pricey for one taco but it's worth it. They are always busy so be prepared to wait and they do have a unique ordering system that threw me off for a minute but the food more than made up for that. Also their drive thru is closed and they have a truck parked there, don't do what I did and have to back all the way out of the drive thru. A big lol on my part."}
{"text":"Damn good tacos, prices are a little higher than back home, but everything is made right in front of you then and there. Staff was friendly but kinda in a rush, understandable considering how many people were ordering food. Everything I had was delicious and I can see myself coming back if given a chance."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is one of the only establishments to sell the meat that I have oh so adored ever since my trip to Rosarito that I loved and will never forget. And that saying a lot since I was sent to the drunk tank that very same day (not my fault, drunk person grabbed me and dominoe effect, voila!).

Anyways, al pastor...spicy porn rotisserie style greatest mexican meat ever. They have the perfect blend of herbs, sauces (some type of creamy guacomole), meat, and double tortilla which they heat up first. Tacos are 2 bucks but so worth it, I always get four. Right after the taco joint across the street from Papa's and Beer's, Tacos El Gordo is my second favorite taco. 

They have other interesting meats too like intestines if you are feeling adventurous. However, don't get the vegetarian quesidillas...my friend happens to be a vegetarian and they charged him full price for a meat quesidilla when there was only cheese....

Sort of hard to find, go down Las Vegas Blvd past Encore and you will see it on your right if you are heading towards Circus Circus. Great place to stop by after XS, just make sure that they are open before you walk there...as you can see I have made this mistake before."}
{"text":"Love me some tacos El Gordo wish I lived in Nevada so I could have them all the time.
Tacos al pastor are my favorite! Horchata is bomb!"}
{"text":"Was so excited when I saw this place by my hotel. We stopped in close to 7pm. 3 people in line for the adobada--What?! Call it good timing! So we pigged out-- adobada, tripa, buche, carne asada tacos and cheese quesadillas. Man, were we stuffed!! The dining tables inside filled up quick, especially when it's freezing outside and the wind is blowing like a crazy. But they do have ample seating outside as well. Service was great all around, from the people making the tacos, to the cashiers, to the cleaning ladies. So nice to find a piece of home in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Place was bomb tacos were insanely delicious. I will be back every time I come to vegas. Line was long but went fast. Crowded inside but super friendly people."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for the yummy food and cheap price but 2 stars for their terrible line system.
Well worth the 45 min wait, but I couldn't believe the terrible inefficient multiple lines depending on what meat you wanted ! And then a separate line to pay!
My husband and I split to 2 lines but he got his food much faster than the line I was in so he just ordered a whole bunch and I left my line. 
Got the flan for dessert was good.
I'll be back the next time in town!"}
{"text":"Tacos here are really good. It is a hole in a wall place so don't expect it to be pretty but good is definitely great. Ordered carne Asad a.."}
{"text":"There are like four lines. Get in the line on the right that says al pastor. Put in your order and drop your tip right in the jar.  He's gonna totally hook you up, so you want to show some love. 

The love here is fat. Tacos fat too. How fat? Fattest tacos I ever saw. You try to pick one up and keep everything inside the tortillas but there's just no way. There's at least 10% more meat than the tortillas can handle.  

That's good, too, because the meat is screamingly delicious. You will never be happier to be filling your face than with a couple fat Tacos El Gordo tacos  

Places like this I always say \"I'm coming back for the Asada Fries,\" but that's BS. I know I'll be back but I'll get the al pastor every time. LOL 

In addition  to a variety of canned sodas, they also have a self serve Coca Cola dispenser.  

All the employees are super friendly, happy, and amazingly fast at what they're doing. At each station there's a different dance behind the counter.  Probably should try them all. 

Mikey C says: hooked up with a taco or two"}
{"text":"Carne Asada Fries. It's all you need. Now life is complete. Life has purpose and meaning. That purpose is to have more carne asada fries which make life better. 

They have a huge selection of great Mexican food but you need to try the carne asada fries! Tender flavorful meat on top of delicate fries and covered in shredded cheese, magic green sauce and just a drop of sour cream = happiness. And a 1/2 order is only $5 - big enough for 4 people!!

Located just north of the Wynn on the strip and open extremely late it's one of those Vegas secrets that make it an incredible trip. 

Warning - you will want this again. Crave it. Need it."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb...  Authentic tacos..no chicken tacos here.. No Tex-Mex... Beef and pork only.  I got the spicy pork... It was cheap {$2.10} and delicious! Yum... This is the north side of the strip. Yummm .. Can't wait to go back,"}
{"text":"Stood in line for 1 hour.  Had to get in 3 different lines by the time I got everything my food was cold.  I will not come back"}
{"text":"Taco El Gordo on the strip are the BEST BY FAR. Omg have to go back again. If you want really good tacos authentic come here."}
{"text":"Beyond the glitter and flash of the Las Vegas strip is a humble little taco joint tucked in an unassuming shopping center somewhere between Wynn, Encore and Ross.

In terms of ambiance this place is definitely lacking -- there are no pinatas, mariachi bands, or oversized margarita glasses in sight.  But as soon as you step up to the order counter you will be treated to a feast for the eyes.  A giant slab of sizzling pork on a rotating skewer with a giant pineapple on top, it's juices slowly basting the meat to delicious perfection.

Excuse me, I just drooled on my keyboard.  

Back to my description -- after I placed an order for spicy pork tacos my order taker carefully sliced a few slabs of pork onto warm handmade corn tortillas topped off with fresh pico de gallo, crema fresca and a thin slice of grilled pineapple.

It was truly the best taco I ever tasted and for only $2 I had lots of extra money to drop at the slot machines!"}
{"text":"Three words: Carne Asada Fries

Do yourself a favor and order two. This is one of my favorite stops in Vegas to get yummy and delicious food for a fraction of the cost of ANYTHING you would get on the Strip. The quality and selection is up to par with what you would get in San Diego so I always make it a point to stop in whenever I am in town.

The line moves fast, the restaurant has tons of open seating and all of the workers are so friendly. Plus? You can save all of your $$$$ for all the hoodrat stuff you got going on later!"}
{"text":"Interesting way of ordering but the tacos where tasty. The meat was tender and they use different tortillas for different tacos. Pastor and asada both had lots of flavor, tender and they filled the tacos up with meat. The asada fries where a good size, wish everything on it was warmer as it tasted like i was eating cold fries and toppings. Once you order you get your food then go to another counter to pay very trust worthy for the area it is in. Did not seem to slow down at all, and looked to have security on it at all times. Its worth it for a good priced and sized tacos not so much the fries."}
{"text":"carne asada fries, half order. soda.  
wow - this place is fluorescent light overload for me.  really bright white light.  
1st time there, was in wrong line, but they knew I didn't know what the F I was doing.  Get in the correct line, get your order, go to cashier.  
As I have an onion allergy, I tried to order no onions - but not really working that well.  So the fries are just ordinary shoestring cut, with some meat and paste of white, cheese oil, and green paste.  some people think this is great..but I wasn't drunk.  

So, if you like quick, greasy, loud, food - just like Tijuana- go there.  if you have any food allergies, don't go.  pretty easy."}
{"text":"One of my best experiences ever. anytime I go into the Las Vegas this is the first place I will stop at to get a good meal I definitely recommend this place. I've never had such an amazing tavo in my life until I came here. Fast service fresh food and of course very good food."}
{"text":"I'm literally here all the time because it's the only Adobada in my immediate area that serves its purpose. Thankfully, due to my graveyard shifts, it's actually open at 8:30 am."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing but definitely not worth the HOUR plus wait just to order the tacos.   The ordering process is the most chaotic,  crazy thing I've ever seen. They have 3 lines for different meats.   If you want a carne asada taco and an adobado,  you have to go to two different LONG lines!   It's ridiculous.   Mind you,  this was a Tuesday night!  I do have to give credit for the tacos.   They were really good.   Would I eat there again?   I would like to  but I won't just because the ordering process and lines were just to out of control."}
{"text":"Was looking for something quick to eat.. I have a great love for street tacos, so while looking on yelp I came across this place.. Some on the best damn tacos ever.. My Favorites: Adobada (Spicy Pork), and the  Carne Asada tacos.

Come early to to avoid the long lines and stay away from coming at lunch time, because you will be sorry!!"}
{"text":"the tacos are crazy good, if you come after having a few drinks! (they taste even better lol) that guac they use reminds me of tacos from mexico.
oh and those asada fries are soo good!"}
{"text":"About one step closer to authentic than Roberto's as Roberto's is from Macayo's.  The meat choices include all the usual including tripas, which is one step closer to authentic than lengua, which lengua is pretty much as far as Roberto's goes.  The Mexican community really likes this restaurant so it must be good!

You usually have to wait in one line to order a certain kind of meat and then another line handles the more exotic items.  Usual stuff but the food is much better than Tacos Mexico.  I'm not much of a Mexfood fan so 3 stars is really generous and if you do like it than you may rate it higher.  It is still very delicious."}
{"text":"Me decepcionó este lugar, los tacos estabas como otros tacos cualquiera. La tortilla muy chica y la carne le faltaba estar mas cocinada. Los tacos están muy caros para lo que ellos dan. No entiendo porque esta este lugar tan lleno, tal vez de puro turista que va por primera vez o no hay mas tacos en las vegas? Ademas eso de hacer diferentes lineas, fatal, es una desorganización total."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Tacos El Gordo, but man this location has no organization AT ALL! Was literally waiting in line for 20 minutes and didn't even move an inch. Three lines would turn into 6 lines from people trying to cut in line as they walked in. The employees seemed like they could careless as I brought it to their attention. Please hire a security or something."}
{"text":"The hype is real, undeniably some of the best tacos in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I found them on Instagram in Tijuana, I was so excited to come to LV and find their location here!! The carne asada tacos we're good but the line for adobada and al pastor was huge because that's just where it's at! The pastor was fresh off the rotisserie and nice crunchy pieces. The salsas were hot as we told them \"con todo\" meaning \"with everything.\" Ask for a side of cebollitas, nice grilled onions, jalapeno, and hot yellow pepper. Then you go and pay.... With 2 sodas and 8 tacos was only $23!!!!! We left a hefty tip because you can see everyone working their butt off and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS OF MY LIFE.

I woke up on a Sunday morning and immediately wanted tacos (because that's completely normal?). No line at 10:30am! 

My fat ass ordered al pastor, asada, and suadero tacos AND asada fries. Hands down the al pastor had the most flavor, it's my favorite out of the bunch. The fries are drowned in sauce and guac (in a good way!), and was freakin' amazing. All of this was love at first bite."}
{"text":"The food here was great. Definately some of the better Al Pastor tacos I've ever had. 3 stars is for the long line and the hassle of finding a table. It gets really crowded even late at night so be prepared. There is a gift shop next door and you can get cheap drinks there if you want to save a little money."}
{"text":"Arrive by car if you can, the surrounding neighbourhood is pretty sketchy. But hey, risk is the spice of life, and I'd gladly risk my life and smartphone once again for a few more authentic tacos from this place."}
{"text":"I love these greasy tasty tacos, and the spicy pork are the best for this location.    I have to thank Yelp for finding this place for me, and I wasn't disappointed at all.    I been here twice, and the employees are super cool.   
It's a pretty simple taco shop, but it does the job.  The tacos are 2.00 a piece, but three of them are a good size lunch.   I really enjoyed seeing the all you can drink Orange Bang, that's one of my favorite drinks.
It's a pretty clean restaurant, and you don't have long wait...even when it's busy, because the line moves very fast.    I think, I found my late night taco fix in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The marinated pork tacos are the best I have personal ever had hands down.  Still not a fan of there decision of having split lines for different tacos, but its worth it!"}
{"text":"this place is always packed and this is the 2nd time i went to the lasvegas one evrything is bomb my favorite is the carna asada tacos and fries....can you say.com!!!"}
{"text":"If U ever come to vegas, 100% you should make at least fifteen visits to Tacos El Gordo. This place is AMAZING (especially after a lit night of clubbing and drunken shenanigans).

Their taco ingredient variety is off the CHAIN, ranging from beef guts, pork stomach, and even pork tongue if you're feeling especially daring. If you're looking for a classic choice that you can't go wrong with, cop thier adobada tacos which feature the most amazing spiced pork that will be sure to elevate lit levels to a maximum.

AAHHHHHH DOOOOO BAAAA DAAAA !!!

Next time I'm in Vegas I'm fersure going to run into Tacos El Gordo and yell out

\"AAHHHHHH DOOOOO BAAAA DAAAA !!! \"

so they know exactly what I want to eat.

AAHHHHHH DOOOOO BAAAA DAAAA !!!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of taco trucks in LA, but I have to admit, this place is so delicious! Probably my favorite Mexican restaurant.

I almost always make a trip here when I'm in Vegas. It's super close to the strip, so the drive is not bad (assuming Las Vegas Blvd doesn't have any traffic). However, parking can be hard to find if the plaza is super busy.

My favorite is the Adobada (spicy pork/pastor) tacos for $2. The Carne Asada fries are also really yummy. They're $10, but HUGE, enough to share for 4-5 people.

I always want to try other items, but I'm always craving the Adobada that I forget to!

FYI, the water from the soda fountain tastes weird."}
{"text":"Where to start.... First off I was really excited to try since people rant about how amazingly good the food is here! So I'll start with the chaos you should prepare yourself for, prior to coming in at a busy time. There are 3 lines depending on what meat you want to order, these lines are pretty much in between those who are already eating and those who are about to pay, AND those trying to grab drinks, napkins, etc...place can get really packed! 

Carne Asada Fries- more like fries & asada in your guac! They were actually pretty good but overload on the guac. Meh.
Tacos- Al Pastor, buche, and asada were all decent, I was expecting more from the asada but not bad! 
Asada Sope - really soggy, not a fan, didn't finish it. 
They also have Nopales(cactus), which are probably my favorite to add on my tacos and they grill them for you here! Thumbs up on that!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Vegas. The pork tacos cured my slight hangover. I also was deprived from sleep, only slept 3 hours, and after stuffing my mouth with these mouth watering tacos instantaneously my  soul was lifted. Cured my hangover and also gave me the energy needed to overcome another day of partying. Definitely worthy of five stars!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at all 3 locations. This and LV Blvd get super busy and sometimes confusing or no tables to eat at. 
But, you know what? Its all worth it.
superior tacos and sopas. This is street food at its finest!
Avoid the strip location as it get soo crowded. Charleston is less crowded, but can get so or up north at Cheyenne location."}

This location is away from the touristy masses and just off the hwy, having just opened in December, I had no idea it was here, when I took the long way up to the Las Vegas Speedway back in March. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taco place in the WORLD. Seriously. Their tacos, sopas, everything is just divine.
I discovered Tacos El Gordo a few years back in this location, it then closed up and I found the Charleston location.
Its nice to see this location back in business and quite luckily I happened upon the Cheyenne & I-15 location by chance on my way to NASCAR (this is adjacent to a gas station, so you can fill up 2 ways!)

All of their food is authentic Tijuana style tacos. Not anything like the slop of Del Taco or Taco Bell (Note: I do get a hankering for these chains a few times a year) Their lengua is tender and cabeza not chalky at all.
in one word, LOVE!"}
{"text":"CARNE ASADA DELICIOUSNESS in my mouth! My friends have been telling me about this joint ever since they came back from their Vegas trip, so I knew I had to check this place out for my edc trip. 

They have so many different meats you can choose from, but of course I love my carne asada so I got four of those. The meat was so juicy, tender, and well seasoned... Just like how my Mexican babysitter used to make em. 

The boyfriend had carne asada fries and couldn't even finish a half order...! So beware, if you want their carne asada or any other fries.. Get the half order if you're just eating them yourself! He also had their al pastor taco. He seemed to love both. 

Workers were very friendly too. Especially since we walked in when there was everyone and their mom from Vegas - lines were out the door! This place goes down in the books for another must stop whenever I'm on the strip!"}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos that you can get in the USA.

They are the normal size, so small. But we got them with everything on them and the salsa and cilantro were super fresh and great. 

We order the abadoba & CARNE Asada tacos. I also ordered a quesadilla and tostada and they aren't worth the extra 2 bucks. Just go the right way with the tacos, they are amazing.

Pay attention to the lines they are confusing."}
{"text":"Sooo bummed. Just blew into Vegas for CES and ecstatic that my San Diego favorite was here AND right near the convention center! Well, the adobada didn't disappoint but the quesadilla was absolutely awful. The tortillas were dry and the cheese wasn't even melted. Never have I walked away from Tacos El Gordo but I actually left it on the plate. I'll give them another try but this location needs a little help from down south!"}
{"text":"Probably the closest thing to TJ tacos you can find. Definitely try the adobada meat!! Also not a lot of seating so stay away from peak times."}
{"text":"My friend and I tracked down this place after hearing comments of it being very authentic. A little too authentic for me... You walk in and line up kinda cafeteria style, based on what kind of taco you would like (it was unclear to us where to order anything but tacos). To get my asada (steak) tacos was right near the door and easy. I then went to order tacos sesos ( I believe this is what it was called) and after watching them cut up beef tongues for other orders, they served me beef brain!! The man behind me translated and helped me to find something I would enjoy. Don't get me wrong: many people really enjoy the beef tongue and brain - it is just not for me and tainted my appetite. 

After you order and get your tacos you go to a cash register to pay and get drinks (fountain, bottle, or can). If you are lucky to get a seat without waiting for others to finish, you can eat there. 

My friend had pork and asada tacos and enjoyed them, but the tacos did leave us hungry pretty soon after.

The service was very kind, though.

I won't be returning, but if you are interested in some authentic, unique Mexican faire. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite taco place in the entire U.S. Tacos El Gordo offers quality meats and ingredients so tasty that you'll be dreaming about it nightly, urging you to get in your car and make room for some irresistible tacos al pastor. While there are other taco places of great quality in Vegas, this one is consistently excellent and with the most dynamic flavors."}
{"text":"Azteca Tacos were amazing.  I thought El Guero Canelo was the business, but Tacos el Gordo on the LV Strip by Riviera (just past Wynn on S. Las Vegas Blvd) takes the cake.  Thankfully, they are a Tijuana brand and they are here in San Diego too.  Life is good."}
{"text":"Busy. Seems like the food is good. Just don't stand in line for 15 mins before you realize you are in the wrong line to order what you want.

This place is a lesson in patience because there is no method to the madness. Unbelievably slow for $2 tacos.  It is as slow as they are fast.

Finally got our food after like 35 minutes then there was mob as the cashier as people from five different lines tried to pay for their food.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall taco place is awesome. A friend of mine turned me on to it and I can't seem to stay away. Their carne asada fries are great. Nothing too fancy about this place. Just good food. A little pricey but its worth it."}
{"text":"Living in South Florida, being from the Southwest........ I just miss my authentic Mexican food.  All you Southwest and West coast folks already know the more east from home you go, it's just gets harder and harder to find the good good.

When we walked in, there is an about 15-18 foot long grill station behind a glass barrier where you watch several cooks cooking all kinds of different meats and things. A bunch of us were just standing randomly so a cook yelled out to us in Spanish to stand in one of the three lines in front of three small signs spaced down the grill area, all of which were under a huge menu running the length atop the the grill. Your meat/entree is prepared to order right there for you.  I am a homemade tortilla fiend, the lady sautéing meat was also kneading homemade tortilla dough in a bowl amongst all the grill cooking that was happening. Yes!

When your food is finished being prepared to your specific orders, your cook hands you your food over the glass barrier, you grab a tray if you are dining in, then you go over to a register and pay. You can select a beverage at that time.

Noone skipped a beat being friendly, I really felt like the Mexican establishments back in Texas I have frequented. They will speak English to you, no problem, even I was Spanglish-ing. Lol. There were ladies who were cleaning feverishly tables as soon as they became available.  We got there during a lull, but eventually the lines snaked through the entire restaurant.

More than fairly priced for the hefty serving of meat in our 2 tacos and 2 sopes.  We were completely stuffed afterwards.

Comfort Mexican food.

Love!"}
{"text":"Strong contender for best tacos in America.  Really!

Al pastor mulitas are not to be missed."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the place to go if you're craving tacos anytime of day... even after a wild night at the club, it's 3AM you're hungry because all you've had all day was shots of vodka and you can barely tell where you're going. Hit the uber to Tacos El Gordo. 

Price: About $2.25 per taco and $7.50 for half order of carne asada fries

Food: 
These are the best tacos you can find in Vegas. Hands down. And for the price, you can't go wrong. I prefer the carne asada tacos, but the line is way too long. Definitely get the carne asada fries!
 
Drinks: 
Basic bottled drinks in the shop, but check out the boba shop next door and get yourself some boozy boba or boozy mangonada... OF NOTE: you cannot bring alcohol into tacos el gordo because they do not have a liquor license.

Service: Fast food and SLOW but worth it. Be prepared to not only wait in the line that goes out the door, but also all the lines inside... PRO TIP: carne asada line is the longest. I would just settle for the Al Pastor if you don't mind delicious pork and pineapple. Also, you can order fries in any line!

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I know I'm going to be the one person on here with a differing opinion lol but I didn't care for this place. I came on a Wednesday night with a sober group of 5 and had a pretty non-eventful experience.  Upon walking in, the lines weren't very long at all but we had no idea what the ordering process was. Pretty chaotic and confusing if you've never been before.

 I myself am not a big meat eater so I ordered a cheese quesadilla. Was going to get a chicken taco but they don't have chicken. Anyways the quesadilla  was small, nothing like I expected and the cheese was pretty burnt. I also ordered a horchata and was sad to find out it came out of a fountain drink machine.

I guess for a cheap meal this place was ok but it is nothing I would come back for."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I had all my tacos with flour tortillas. 

Observation #1: Get the salsas on the side. Using my own sauce combinations or limiting the salsa amount would have made the overall experience more enjoyable. 

Observation #2: Surprisingly filling. The tacos look small but they really *stuff* them with meat. Fantastic meat-to-taco ratio. Although I'm still full from those meaty morsels, writing about them makes me wish I could hop over and throw down a couple more of those tasty tacos. 

Observation #3: The brisket (suadero) was dry. Beef brisket tacos sounds like a good idea and maybe others will like it, but, even with all the sauce they toss on, it was dry and disappointing. 

Observation #4: The hero was the lengua. Juicy and flavorful. It was the last taco I tried. I'd never had tongue before. And it was still my favorite. I don't know what salsa they used but it worked well. The adobada was in second (would go with less salsa). The buche was pretty good. Pretty juicy, good flavor but salsa did not help it. Chorizo was fine but not something I'd get again or recommend to someone else. I look forward to trying Cabeza and asada next time."}
{"text":"Heard very good things about this place so decided to come try it, it was delicious. Very good tacos but not the best I've ever had. 

The set up is very straight forwards, for different meats you go to different lines. They mainly only serve tacos or items with tortillas, they don't have burritos. They have 3 sauces, red, green and this avocado/ creams sauce I think. They have like limes and radish's on the side in a lil bar thing. 

It's very clean and organized. The cooks are very fast and good with your orders. The employees are all very nice. 
We came a late Sunday night so it wasn't super busy but I heard it gets freaky busy other times."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite taco shop. This place is amazing. All the meat is really fresh.. the line was quite long. But well worth the wait. All in all I would definitely recommend this taco place to anyone who wants some great tacos."}
{"text":"The food is amazing . This is definitely a place to stop and eat while in  vegas. I went during the week so I didn't have to wait for so long but a person told me that on weekends the lines are long. I definitely will be back on my next visit to las vegas"}
{"text":"Once again looks deceive you.... the tacos are not as good as they look they are garbage they sell milanesa meat as if it was carne asada and charge you the price as if it was carne asada the food has no flavor you get thrown off by the wannabe homemade tortillas the only thing they got going good for them is drunk people raving about them when they're super hungry..... I was drunk and hungry and it tastes like crap dry you're better off buying beef jerky at least I'll be flavor on it"}
{"text":"Kick ass tacos, open late into the night, and cheap.  This place is doing it right!

We walked our way over here on our first night in Vegas, around 2 AM.  They'e located towards the end of the strip, past Treasure Island.  The place was packed and right away we noticed the delicious smells wafting over from all the different meat stations.  There's about half a dozen different meat stations, which you line up at and order, then you pay at the register.

The Adobada (Spicy Pork) was so good that as soon as I finished, I lined up  and ordered some more.  At the Adobada station, you'll see stacks and stacks of marinated spicy pork roastin on a spit, with a pineapple at the top.  The pork is shaved off the spit to order 

My next favorite was the Suadero (Beef Shoulder), which you'll find at the station with the big pot of beef stewing away.  This results in fall apart tender chunks of beef, packed with flavor.

You have to eat at Tacos El Gordo when you're in Vegas.  I'll for sure be there the next time i'm in town!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to TJ for tacos? Think they're delicious? If you answered yes to those questions, you won't be disappointed by this spot. 

I'm not from Vegas, so I can't speak for how bad their lines get, but the day I went, they weren't bad at all. 

Like I stated earlier, their tacos are exactly what you'd expect a good imitation of TJ street tacos would be like. 

I'd definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is that place you dream about after a late night. 

If you had a good night clubbing or swimming or playing bingo you might end up here. This place is taco heaven. I am always so happy pulling in here. I might have to struggle for parking once in a while but still happy. You walk in and they have separate lines for each meat category. The first time I came I have to admit I did not know what adobada was. Everyone was getting it and I was like ummmm, sure why not. I had the fries. They were delicious. I was surprised by all the flavor and freshness of all the food. I think I was hooked. BTW it's like a spiced pork. The next time I tried their asada tacos and they just weren't as good as the adobada. Don't get me wrong the asada was tasty on it's own but the new cool thing was adobada. The last time I got three tacos to go. Such a good decision. They can get so busy and packed at night, especially on Friday and Saturday. They also have drinks like horchata and fountain sodas. One you get your food you pay at the register. They have some salsas behind the counter along with some canned sodas, including grape soda, yumm. One of my favorite place to get tacos. They also have a location on the strip and another on Charleston and Bruce. A place that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Extremadamente recomendado ! You can't leave Vegas without coming to this place... Debes de probar las de tripas y las quesadillas y obviamente con todo!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a different experience than most places you go to, but the food is very much like Tijuana street food.  When you go there, there are separate prep stations for each type of meat that they serve.  I'm still not clear if you can order from any of the prep stations, or if you have to go to the one in particular that you want.  I accidentially ordered brains, which was gross, but the other tacos I tried were really good.  If you want something more familiar, just go to Los Tacos.  It is literally across the parking lot."}
{"text":"The tacos are really fresh. The only problem is the lines, but thats what you get when you have a good product. The Adovada Fries were really good. We need this in LA."}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend, especially if you're visiting Vegas to step away from the strip and try this place out. However, this isn't just a place you stop by for a quick bite, make time in your busy itinerary. The lines will be long, but so worth the wait! 

We got 3 pastor, 2 chorizo and 1 asada. The pastor was definitely my favorite and  probably the best I've ever had. The meat was juicy with a slight tang and paired perfectly with the crispy and greasy, but not too greasy corn tortillas. The chorizo meat was tender and had that fresh off the grill taste. The asada was good too, but not much more.

Each taco costs $2, which in my opinion isn't too bad, considering you're inside with seating, although limited. Most taco trucks sell for about $1."}
{"text":"The best tacos you will ever enjoy in your life. The adobadas (spicy pork) is to die for! Carne Asada and Suadero are also notable options."}
{"text":"Best tacos EVER.

Came here when we arrived around 1am.  Our hotel was right around the corner of the strip mall Tacos El Gordo is located in.  We were worried about the late night crowd, but were hoping they wouldn't be showing up until later.

We get there and there were 4 short lines.  The lines on the right side were shorter than the left.  There are separate lines depending which type of meat you want.  Since there were 3 of us, we split up to get our tacos faster.  Unfortunately, they ran out of the beef tongue :(.

The Al Pastor - spicy pork tacos were my favorite, and not far behind them were the chorizo.  The Asada tacos were delicious, but the beef was too overcooked for me.  I was in the Asada line, so I saw the guy assembling all of our tacos.  He was speedy and made no mistakes.  It was quite impressive.  My biggest concern was if he was going to change his gloves when he threw raw meat on the grill, and HE DID! Thank goodness.

The corn tortillas are phenomenal and so fresh.  You can see the woman tossing them on the griddle as the cook is making your tacos.

The tacos are small in size, but are packed with so many amazing flavors.  The price is good, it just keeps you wanting more.  I could probably eat these every day.  I wanted to have them again in the morning, but had to save room for the buffet we were headed to :(. Oh well, next time. I'll definitely be coming back just for these tacos."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!! I used to go to los tacos but tacos el gordo changed my mind. Don't mind the lines at all!! its worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Al pastor was really good!!! You have to make 3 lines depending on what meet u want !!!! Really??? The Asada tacos were cold and not fully cooked! If u like Medium rare then u would be ok!!  Manager was really helpful and got me some hot tacos didn't have to wait that long to get them!! Bottom line! Not worth the hour wait!!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Tacos El Gordo for years and decided to try them out one night. This location was semi close to me so it made it easier to get to. Ordered one Adobado taco and one Carne Asada taco. 
They were pretty small and prices ranged from $2.25 to $2.45 for each. Taste wise I'll give them a 4/5. Fantastic flavors and definitely different from your standard Robertos and Pepe's Tacos. Atmosphere was lively as well. If I'm on that side of town/ nearby them I'd probably get one taco for on the road. Other than that I wouldn't drive out of my way just to eat a taco from them as well."}
{"text":"OMG.. I've been thinking about this place since we left Vegas! We went in one night for a couple of tacos.. I wanted a Carne asada taco and quesdilla.. Well there was somewhat of a language barrier that actually worked to my advantage. What I ended up with was a quesadilla on a flour tortilla what was open faced with tons of tasty carne asada on top. It was so flavorful and filling. We ended up going back there the following night for dinner."}
{"text":"AMAZING \"street taco\" place. Only $2 a taco! RIGHT??
I have been to both locations, this one and the one on the strip.
Both are fantastic!

I love it SO MUCH! It reminds me of when I have visited Tijuana, then I found out that is where the original one is! YES - so happy!

Yes, it kind of looks like a dive. Trust me,Tacos El Gordo makes me one happy GRINGO! - And I am frequently the ONLY Gringo in the place when we are here!


Here is the deal- the food is super tasty.
The Adobada tacos are my fave! It is spicy pork cooked \"gyro style\" shaved off one taco at a time! Was also introduced to a \"Mulas\" taco here. Which is basically a melted cheese, meat of your choice taco sandwich - OMG SO GOOD!

Go to either location and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a crazy good \"street taco\" place. $2 at taco! The is the deal of the strip!

I love it SO MUCH! It reminds me of when I have visited Tijuana, then I found out that is where the original one is! YES - so happy!

Don't be put off by this place, it looks dumpy. Trust me, the food is super tasty.

Tacos El Gordo makes me one happy GRINGO!"}
{"text":"First of all I'd like to say that the food is excellent and I would have given it a 5 except for two things Customer service and ease of ordering. When you first walk in no one greets you or explains how to order. We stood there for a few minutes trying to figure out what we wanted then stood in a long line only to find out that we were in the wrong line. There are signs that have the names of different meats and that's the line you stand in if you want that type of meat. The cooks were not friendly nor the cashier. The food is worth coming back for they offer big portions and quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They serve some of the best tacos I've ever had here and you know it before you walk in - everyone eating there is Mexican. 

The corn tacos they used were the softest I've ever had. None of that previously frozen dry cardboard tasting stuff.

You can choose from a variety of delicious meats - we tried the beef stomach and pork intestine unknowingly (the man behind the counter only told us what it was after we ate it). They were pretty delicious but I'm wimp when it comes to weird meat. I forget what else they have but we ended up picking al pastor and the chorizo - both delicious as well.

They topped the tacos off with different sauces and gave us a small cut of the pineapple that was roasting on their rotary grill on one of our tacos. :)

We tried some of the other stuff too (all delicious) but the tacos are the star of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The best tacos on earth! Must get the al pastor tacos and cheese quesadilla. If its your first time there, just know there are 3-4 different lines to order different tacos from, make sure you read what it says on top."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I've ever had, recommend the pork, don't think I'll be able to eat American tacos again. Haha"}
{"text":"the food was not good whatsoever, the tacos have more onion than they have meat , and the meat hardly had any flavor."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada tacos and the quesadilla. For some reason the quesadilla had only one tortilla and nothing on the top kinda like a taco. They were busy so I'm not sure if they forgot about that. Overall it was great"}
{"text":"I've been to 30+ countries, and these are hands down the best tacos I've ever had! Tacos de adobada son muy delicioso!"}
{"text":"So this was THE best taco I've had in a long time! Super fresh and delicious! The price is right too! I tried a veggie taco and a veggie sopes and both are to die for! I wasn't sure what to expect since the menu specifies meat but they did have veggie options and I was impressed!"}
{"text":"I got the carne asada and the pork tacos. Both were scrumptious. Lines were long but the place has it down to a science and your food comes fast.  Tacos are about $2.25/each... the tortillas are handmade and each tack is filled with onions and cilantro and a green sauce. 

I read everywhere that the carne asada fries were a must try... honestly, I wish I didn't order them. They come in half and a full size... we ordered the full size which was like $12-$13 and it was gross. Fries topped with a bit of carne asada meat and some cheese sauce.  It just wasn't good unless I guess you're just a big fan of french fries in general.  

Tacos were a definite five stars."}
{"text":"Came back to try it again and it was way better. Adobada fries and extra crispy tripas tacos"}
{"text":"By far the worst services I had. The food wasn't even as good as their Chula Vista location. The adobada meat tasted super commercialized. The tortas were old. I asked guacamole 4 times and he didn't give it to me. Also asked for pineapple and they didn't give me that either. Maybe if it was busy I wouldn't mind. But the line was super short. I was super disappointed. I was looking forward to eating these tacos more then eating at Mastro's!"}
{"text":"Everything you've heard about this spot is true. I was told this was the place to go for good tacos in Vegas and it delivered. Ended up eating ten tacos they were so good. Got full on the Adobada, Chirizo and Asada before I could try some of the others. Next time."}
{"text":"Seriously legit tacos. I have to eat ten or more when I go. Adobada is fantastic paired with fried tortillas and a red sauce."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is a classic for those who are up at random hours at Vegas. There are multiple people who can take orders, but there is still usually a line going out the door. After ordering the dishes and receiving your food, you must go to a different line at the cash register to pay for everything. I think that concept is quite strange, and I would like to see that changed if possible. I love that we get our food very soon after we order it, but it is such a tease to have to stand in another line after receiving our food.

As for the food, it is the perfect place to go to if you are craving Mexican food. The meat for the tacos were very tender and soft. The carne asada fries did not have as many toppings such as salsa, beans, etc. as I normally get. But, the portion was still large and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"You wanna know where all of the Latinos eat at 3AM? This place is legit eating and not a tourist trap. In fact, this one is so legit that I was one of the only non-Latino people here in twilight hours, and it was packed. This location is way better than the one on the strip because THERE IS TONS OF PARKING. Also, the line is SO much shorter! 

Carne asada fries... even a half order is monstrously large. But you should get them anyway. Either share with a friend or if you need to eat your feelings.

Those mulas. Who doesn't love fresh tortilla with griddled cheese?

Adobada is what they are famous for. Get a mula with adobada. Double win.

Maybe it's just me, but horchata on a fountain just doesn't taste good. I found it terrible, but I've only had fresh horchata at little mom and pop shops.

Super awesome dude chopping up all of the meat for orders. I was a lost puppy not really knowing what i was doing, but he was so super patient with me anyway and just super nice. Often people get annoyed when in a customer service-based industry, but everyone working here was really nice.

See ya again next time at 3AM, Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge taco fan, and I'm not religious, but somehow Tacos El Gordo combines the two, and I find myself thanking Jesus for how incredible tacos are and how wonderful my life is. 

The food at the Tacos El Gordo taquerias is always incredible. Everything is good. Some shitty Guy Fieri show would probably refer to it as a double-whammy-cry-in-your-fry or something stupid. 

Tacos de tripa. I didn't even know you could make a tripe taco taste that crispy and freaking delicious. I need like ten tripe tacos.

Mulas are always ridiculous. You can't go wrong with griddled cheese and chewy corn tortillas. 

If you are ordering carne asada/ lengua/ adobada fries, bring a friend. Even if you bring a friend, I say get a half order so you can eat more things! 

The folks working the counters are awesome. Even if you don't know what the hell you are doing, they are still so incredibly nice. I like to pretend like I'm legit and try ordering in  bad Spanish. They play along, which that alone deserves money in the tip jar."}
{"text":"One of the most badass eats on the strip.
Fusing QUALITY with affordability guarantees that I'll be back each and every time I visit Vegas, whether for lunch with buddies or after we shut the club down. (Check for hours- on weekends, they close at 5AM and re-open at 9AM.)

The adobada everyone raves about- have it sliced and placed into their tortilla sammich (starts with m) with cheese that has been slightly cooked on the flat top. Just do it. It will rock your world.

Carne asada fries or adobada fries- Unless you have 3 friends with you, get the HALF. I don't know how it's humanly possible to plow through this and anything else, even if you get a half order. Biggest half order of fries I've seen in my life.

This location in particular is located in a shopping complex just north a few blocks of the Encore. Definitely make this one happen on your next trip to the Strip!"}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas for authentic Mexican tacos. The Carne Asada Fries are the best. Lines are sometimes long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"We came in at about 3pm on a Friday and the line for the Asada & Chorizo was pretty long compared to the Adobada & Al Pastor. I wish they had a better system to get the lines moving but overall the Tacos were amazing great authentic Tijuana tacos. It's a must when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada tacos and they were super yummy! The tortillas are amazing. I also had a quesadilla with asada and that was equally as good. The meat had a really great flavor and that's something I always look for. I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is rated GAF (Good as F***). That is all. 

If you have a fitness life, beware that this is not good for your workout days, not much, if any, healthy alternatives. Pig out on a cheat day!"}
{"text":"Best tacos i have had in my 27 years of living. While i live on the east coast, they have tacos but none compared to here. If you come during the weekend its will be busy..really busy. Sooo worth the wait tho!!! I went out of my comfort zone and tried suadero, cabeza, tripa and lengua...all very delicious!!! Wish there was one closer to washington dc. Def. A better to come here than to gamble your money away. You actually win this bet!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic overall value, open late, and very tasty.

The store is located in a strip mall that is kind of sketchy. While it is on Las Vegas Blvd, I wouldn't really consider it walking distance from even the Wynn/Encore, which is the nearest major hotel. Also, when you come in there are various lines for different types of meat, but if you just talk with the cooks they'll help you out and get you what you want to order. You don't have to go to the right line.

Also, they offer free cebolitas, including grilled green onions and a jalapeno pepper, and also free pineapple with the spicy pork/adobada/al pastor (these are all the same thing here). You have to ask :)

The different meats also come with different sauces as defaults. So don't be surprised by that!

I thought the spicy pork/adobada/al pastor was by far the best, though I had no complaints about the carne asada either!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok.  The San Diego locations are awesome!  The meat is different and the desert weather seems to take some of the flavor away.  It was not bad but it was not worth the drive off the strip either. I have t blame the desert or the company is taking short cuts at this location.  $2.85 for a street taco in a not so nice part of town is ALOT!  And the owners may be taking advantage of the name and reputation it built for itself in San Diego and TJ"}
{"text":"Cheap and satisfying for late night munchies.  Definitely not the BEST tacos but if you are craving some in Vegas and aren't feelin Chipotle...head to El Gordo!  

Carne asada fries (small)-  the fries themselves were good!  Carne asada was so so as was the sauce/guac.  A small was more than enough to share.
Lengua taco- I liked the lengua better than carne asada

It may be hard to catch a cab ride after eating here, so try calling a cab instead of trying to flag one down.  Also, I'm semi disappointed there were no burritos, but $2 tacos were good enough for me!!"}
{"text":"Best al pastor tacos I've ever had... seriously- and I've eaten a ton of al pastor tacos. We walked into this place around 1am after walking the strip all day and we were starving. Not only were the tacos great but the staff is friendly, they move fast and the food is cheap.. not like those $30 + dollar buffets along the strip. Definately worth a trip- you won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this due to all the great reviews and also because, after days of paying for $25 dollar entrees, my wallet needed a break big time.  

Maybe they were having a bad day (I notice another 1 star reviewer went the same day I did).  Quite simply, the food was inedible.  First off, this is a place that LOVES their organ meats.  No fish or chicken tacos here so keep in mind that choices are very limited if you don't like tripe, brain, tongue or head tacos.  That's ok, we went for the carne asada fries, Abodabo and spicy pork tacos.  Fries looked awesome.  First bite....my mouth filled with fat/gristle/tendon.  Ick.  I'm a good sport, tried another bite.  Huge piece of fat.  One more bite.  Same thing.  Moved on to the abodabo taco.  First bite.   Fat.  I wasn't dumb enough to try another bite.  Spicy pork taco next.  No fat but no flavor either.  

So yeah it was only $20 for me and my husband to \"eat\" but neither one of us actually got to swallow any of it.  Have not had this horrible of a restaurant experience in years.  I'm left wondering, did I truly go on an off day or do regular folk just love fat filled tacos?  I'm certainly not putting out another $20 to get an answer to that one."}
{"text":"The line was out the door when we got there at 4:30 and a Friday...and for good reason. The food is great!
We had some adobada pork and some carne asada tacos. The meat is delicious and their home made tortillas are wonderful.
The ordering system is a bit confusing at first. Just read the signs so you know you are in the right line. 
The employees are working their butts off so tip well."}
{"text":"BEST tacos ever BYY FARRR. 

Adobada is BOMB. you have to get it. The staffs are all super friendly too. Don't judge the taco shop by its cover. Oh. also try Buches (pork stomach), cabesas (pork head meat), and Lenguas (beef tongue). I don't like the intestine one though...kinda gross....nor do i like the chorizo. Carne Asada's pretty good too :)"}
{"text":"Great authentic local Mexican place off the beaten path..... known for their tacos - had the carne asada and spicy pork ones - very flavorful and the corn tortillas are nice and fresh.  Had 3 and could have had at least one more!  

Conveniently located in a large plaza with plenty of parking - about 10-15 minutes driving distance off the Strip."}
{"text":"I tried this place in San Diego and they have it in VEGAS! After partying it up at XS, stopped by here to pick up some Adobada (spicy pork) tacos, carne asada fries, & a large horchata, hustled into the hotel room and started devouring these foodgasmic tacos. (Just sprinkle in some lime juice & hot sauce... tastes best mixed in with their green sauce). They use fresh potatoes for their carne asada fries and their meat is so tender & smoky.... OMG best thing ever especially when you need some hangover food haha."}
{"text":"Very authentic tasting tacos and quesadillas. You know the food is good when 95% of the people dinning in a Mexican restaurant are Mexican! We just got to Vegas and it was Cinco de Mayo and there was no better place to start off the festivities than an authentic Mexican restaurant.

I had the carne asada tacos, DELICIOUS!! The staff was great and really friendly and the restaurant had a really cool atmosphere and prices are very reasonable.
Will definitely stop by next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"So I am from Florida and for the first time in about 15 years I was finally able to eat aunthentic tacos! The place is not formal, but it is not meant to be after all they do sell to die for tacos. Place is well kept anf organized and people literally line up to get it. Just delicious food!!! And  I NEED a place like this South Florida!!!"}
{"text":"Cost to quality is just two thumbs up...!  Compared to other overpriced restaurants, this is the must-try place for real taco in Las Vegas.  

A little inconvenient eat-in, but you can find additional tables on the curb side of tents outside.  Wonderful experience with authentic Mexican tacos at surprising 2$ price tag.  Abodado taco is my favorite and Veggi Quesadillas is beyond your imagination... 

If you can speak Spanish, ordering might be easier, but fellow customers were friendly enough helping me order.

Wonderful place....!"}
{"text":"I stopped here with two people on my way out of town. Cheap tacos and horchata - any decent combo of these two automatically starts at three stars for me. In this case, the extra star is for its location. The adobada tacos were pretty awesome. I thought they'd be a little more tender, but the sauce was fantastic and there was a perfect amount of spice. The carne asada tacos were good too, but the adobada were better in my opinion.  And unlimited horchata refills for a little over $1.50? Yes please! I was really looking forward to the grilled green onions, but they looked and tasted more like they were steamed. I know they were grilled though, since I saw them sitting in a pile on the grill. It was just overcrowded so most of the onions didn't get much contact with the grill. I like when they have a little bit of char on them. Overall, it was a great stop right on The Strip."}
{"text":"Best tacos in all of Vegas! And the carne asada french fries are to die for, easily serves 3 people."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas and they do NOT close at 2am it's 4:33 am and I just got my tacos so it's deff open past 2 and they have really good food so hey"}
{"text":"The tacos at El Gordo are good but the lines to get the food are RIDICULOUS!!! By the time your group gets all the food the tacos are cold AF!! Not a pleasant experience!!!"}
{"text":"I come to Tacos El Gordo every single time I'm in Vegas. 

Every. Single. Time. I've never missed a chance and I probably never will. 

Tip 1: Be prepared to wait. The lines are long, and they have a system where you stand in different lines for different meats. There's only one way in and one way out, and there's a security guard monitoring the doors (That's when you know it's serious). 

Tip 2: The asada and al pastor lines are the longest, but the al pastor is also REALLY, REALLY good. It's what they're most known for and they take the meat straight off the skewer and chop it up in front of you. For some reason these lines are also the ones that move the slowest, which is why I'm giving 4 stars because the wait can be brutal especially if you're hungry and you have a tray of uneaten tacos that you got from a different line. 

Tip 3: There is another line off to the side that people tend to forget about!! It's on the right side around the corner and that is where you can order meats such as cabeza, lengua, and buche. These are my favorite meats so I'm always happy this line is the shortest. 

If you don't want tacos they also have other options such as sopes, tostadas, quesadillas, etc. with your choice of meat. All reasonably priced! Oh, and if you have read my other reviews about my favorite food ever (tacos) you know that I love my homemade corn tortillas! That's the only tortilla option they have here; it's oily, soft, and de-li-cious. Come here for lunch, dinner, or drunchies - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not impressed. This is different than Mexican food you are going to get in San Diego, which is neither bad nor good, just different. A tostada is a very crunchy chip with fatty meat on it. The pork is extremely fatty and the carne asada had grizzle. The carne asada fries were good, but not the best. I did not enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Located on the north end of the strip, north of encore, south of circus circus for point of reference. So if it's hot and you are staying at PH or further consider uber / cab. 

I think we came on a Friday at bout 7 and this place was slammed with a lot of authentic looking people so I'm guessing it was legit. There are various ordering lines that my group was clueless too even though they had signs. They had both English and Spanish but still confusing. We definitely ordered in the wrong line and the employee was annoyed with us. 

On to the food, we got a couple carne tacos and I think accidentally got shoulder or tongue. The texture was weird on that one, but the flavors were great. Tacos are about $2.5 each or so and guys you'll prolly need 3 at least.

Ok on to my favorite part of the meal, the carne asada fries (forget what they are called on the menu, but doesn't say fries I don't think). Also, on the menu board I think it says $13, but I don't think it's clear because we were giving a 1/2 order but it was $8 I think. The 1/2 order can be shared by two people, it's a lot of food. Tons of cheese, guacamole, and sour cream or something gooey. Plenty of meat on it as well.

The big negative here is that there is no seating and the strip mall seems a little suspect. But if you want tacos and carne asada fries give it a shot."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic tacos, but our favorite are the carne asada fries. There's always a line so be prepared to wait to order then to wait in line to pay."}
{"text":"Expectations were met the tacos are amazing we had the al pastor tacos with the pineapple and the asada mulitas. Generous with the meat and the salsas are tasty. Definitely a must if your in town!"}
{"text":"Even though the picture looks amazing it wasn't. I was very Disappointed. This place has nothing to do with the one in San Diego of H St. that is the best one hands-down.I believe because there's too many people they rush everything the park was not well cooked and had way too much onion also flavorless other than the onion."}
{"text":"Come here, expect a line. The food here is really cheap tho. I recommend getting like 4-7 tacos if you are hungry. Spicy pork was by far the best one as it had some really good sauce on it. Tried the horchata as well....that was too sweet though (and I usually am not one to say that)"}
{"text":"I had 2 al pastor and 2 Asada tacos with everything on both  and sadly to say they were good but not the best tacos of my life. The Asada was really salty. I really liked the pina colada drink. Maybe if I spoke Spanish and knew the taco secrets it would have been better. I saw some people had pineapple on their al pastor. Not sure if you say something to order it like that. 
The best tacos of my life are still in East Oakland Cali."}
{"text":"It was only my second experience with a taco establishment like this. I was intrigued by how busy it was, so I walked in. Despite fumbling a bit while ordering (I took French not Spanish in high school), I was thoroughly impressed with how tasty my pork taco and quesadilla were. You might have to wait to find a table, but it's worth it. Fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why this place is so raved about.  I got a pastor and asada taco and an asada quesadilla.  The pastor was pretty good.  Carne asada had a lot of chewy parts and tasted slightly burnt, not much flavor.  I'm not sure what the crispy thing was that they put on top of my quesadilla (it looked like a fried corn tortilla maybe?) but it tasted burnt and gross.  Maybe I wasn't supposed to eat it?  lol, who knows.  The ordering style was weird.  You have to stand in a different line for different types of meat, they load up your tray with your order, and you go to the cashier to pay.  I probably should have said to go in line but I wasn't sure how this place worked so I had to ask the cashier to wrap up my plates to go after I paid.  I'll stick to Los Tacos next door.  Their carne asada is to die for and their quesadillas are a much better value."}
{"text":"I wish that it wasn't so far from the strip & that lines were so darn long but seriously the BEST tacos I've ever had. 

If its your first time here, it could get pretty confusing but there are 3 separate lines for different kinds of meats so make sure you read the signs. You line up and then order once its your turn. Guess what? Guacamole is FREE. Well... I wouldn't call it Guac, its more of just avocado but still! Other places would be charging you $1 or more for some guac. I would definitely pass on the carne aside fries, its missing a bunch of pico. 

After you get your order, you pay. About $2 for tacos is a bit on the pricey side since i'm so used to taco Tuesday but they were worth it!

So we ordered 12 tacos and a large order of carne asada fries and were given 4 small sauces... when we asked for more sauce they said 1 sauce for fries and 1 sauce per 4 tacos. Not sure how they came to that conclusion because my sister loves putting sauce on everything, but they wanted to charge us $0.50 for each additional sauce. No thanks. 

Horchata was decent. 3 tacos definitely wasn't enough for me because they're small so I would recommend getting 4 or 5. Also DO NOT GET THE FLOUR TORTILLA. The corn tortilla tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Friends LOVED this place enough to dine here 2x in a row. I like that it's very homey, no frills and the tacos do taste authentic as if I'm out in Mexico on the streets ordering from a taco stand. You sit at long tables and join the community. 

You order first, get your goods and then pay. The grilled onions go great with the tacos. The adobada is BOMB.  Spiced pork - mmmm! I'm not a huge taco fan but I had 3 of these suckers AND still ate half a burger at Shake Shack. I hope they come to Texas!"}
{"text":"After waiting 25 min on the outside, must say well worth it! Real Mexican flavor, may need some improvement on the sitting, but the pastor mulas are the bomb!!
If looking for the Mexican flavor near the strip this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Damn, your going to have a line for sure no matter what time you go. 

Food is great.  Go with the spicy"}
{"text":"Not doing it for me. At least just me for the great reviews I see here. I am happy to say I did not buy into the hype of everyone giving this place great reviews. This place, for me, is not all it's cracked up to be. Lucky I arrived on a slow night tonight. Okay so here is my reviews of the place. I pass by the place take the turn and walk in. Man that door heavy as f****! The place is spacious and I loved that. I found it pretty cool how they have the meat set up like a deli type thing and the line to pay big as well; I liked that.

  So here I order two tacos de asada and the meat looked good along with the condiments. I was surprised that when he asked me if I wanted everything he didn't put chilly... But I guess you put it aside, but even more surprising than that was the fact that he put avocado on it. I was like, \"Thats a twist\" I was surprised because I do know some tacos shops that do that, but it was surprising because the Tacos El Gordo in the San Fernando Valley, California both inside and the taco truck don't do that. 

  Screw it lets go with it. I go and order and realize the salsas were inside the fridge, I liked that so everyone won't fight in the snack bar to grab there condiments. Yeah yeah I pay and I also got some lengua tacos aside. Now those did have the O.G. taste. As for mine they were more to be desired. I loved that they packed in the meat. Here we go with the flavor detail... Okay. The tortilla used was the yellow kind I like those so that can slide. The meat of the carne asada had a good flavor, but I felt it needed a little bit more of a way to hold on to the flavor of the meat. I added the \"spiciest\"  salsa to only to my disillusioned self... that IT... WAS... NOT... SPICY! That blew my mind.

  The thing, I believe, that took off the flavor was the fact that it was inside the fridge. That salsa tasted like nothing, NOT EVEN A HINT OF FLAVOR WAS LEFT! So now imagine this... not your regular corn tortilla with sub par meat with good flavor topped off with boring salsa and flavorless avocado. I thought when they added the avocado it was going to have a kick to it, or if that didn't have a kick to it it would have been the taco itself to rescue the flavor, but no.

  So I'm just sitting there debating if I should have a different one to change my mind. So I do order another one. The tacos are a little pricy only because of my experience. I order one de adobada. because it says spicy. I get the taco and already am doubting it just because that meat is more pinker that Patrick from sponge bob and the guacamole was watery as fuck... Should guacamole look white/green? Not in my experience, but whatever. I taste it and am automatically turned off. Screw this I am not coming again. The only thing I am grateful for is that they do stuff you good and the seating it great. But I am guessing THIS tacos el gordo have there own distinct flavor in Las Vegas.

  The Gordo I frequently would go had the same type of meat, same type of flavor, but the difference between these and those is that when they flip the meat they don't lightly press down on it. They flip it and  to press down on it a little longer to grab that tighter locked in meat flavor. Even if that meat was the same and the same yellow tortilla it would still taste good. But what doesn't do it for me was the avacado and chilly with yellow tortilla that just added texture than a taco. Over there it was nothing fancy just your salsa outside, room temperature; white corn tortilla and pressed down meat and they were GREAT!

  If you want a little taco flavor with new ingredients added go here, if you want that Mexico street vendure/ establishment taco shop go somewhere else. I got full, but not the good happy full. My who'll deal is that this Tacos El Gordo is different than the one I used to go. More pricier, different ingredients added and different flavor because of it. I have ate tacos for a many years and I do acknowledged they all have their own, but they do not steer away from the main point. I expected more thats all. I would suggest Tacos El Rey and Tacos El Torito they still do it for me. Plus they are cheaper. If I were to know they would be not your average joe I would have not cared."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! There meat are just juicy. The price is defiantly worth it, I crave this every month, and is defiantly a place I would bring my family and friends to try out when then come from out of town! The restaurant seem just like no other Mexican restaurants , when you first walk in, everything just seem simple, nothing special for first impression, but once you got those tacos on your hand, everything about the restaurant don't matter, the food are just great, I went there for lunch time today and bought some Togo for my sons snack ! I defiantly recommend tacos lover to try out this place, just right near the strip!"}
{"text":"OMG just came home from this awesome place!!! Their tacos are delicious!!!!!!!!!! I mean the best of the best!!!! I'm a taco lover for years and always willing to try different places but I stopped after my husband took me to the place last week. I'm in love that's what I have to say!"}
{"text":"In the shadow of Encore lies a taco place so magical that you will think it is a trap. The sign out front clearly advertises 2 dollar tacos.
2 dollar tacos? Yeah, right. You just walked through hotels where 10 square feet of tile work on the floor is worth more than your net worth and here you are, 2 minutes later, staring down a sign for 2 dollar tacos. There's no way these tacos can be good.

Yeah, they are awesome tacos.

The next time I go to Vegas, the plan will be - Stay at the Wynn, gamble at the Riviera, and get these tacos every time I walk in between the two places. The spicy pork taco meets expectations."}
{"text":"The kings are back.

About 6 months ago, I went to Tacos El Gordo just to find the establishment closed with no signage indicating a reopen. This was so tragic that it took out a piece of my soul and I actually was way less excited to go to Vegas again...

...but lo, the powers that be have put this place back on the map. It hasn't skipped a beat.

Tacos El Gordo doesn't make any sense. Delicious, nearly flawless, incredibly cheap tacos served almost in the shadow of Wynncore. Things on the strip shouldn't be so delicious while being so cheap because it feels like there's a scam somewhere.

Anyhow, the chorizo and asada tacos are banging. The meat is cooked so tenderly and so perfectly. It's spiced so perfectly. You can get full for like 8 dollars. This shit is psychotic and I'm so, so happy that this is a viable Vegas dining option once more."}
{"text":"This place has MOVED !! Off of Charleston near downtown !!! Still the best tacos !! The food is awesome !!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times (pretty much everytime I'm ever in Vegas). they have bomb.com tacos, I'll leave it at that. They have many varieties of meat: carne asada, al pastor (adobada) , tripe, beef tongue or lengua, etc,. A taco is about $2 and 4 or 5 tacos will fill you up. 

I always get their al pastor tacos with everything on it. The sauce that they put in the al pastor tacos are absolutely fantastic!! I also tried their al pastor fries and it is amazing as well. I did try the carne asada fries and it wasn't as stimulating to my taste buds as the al pastor. 

Overall, the food is great! however, the lines can be ridiculous. They have different lines for different meats. So, if you want to have different types meats for your food, you should bring a friend of two so they can each stand in a separate line to order all the meats at once. 

They used to have a patio outside where everyone can sit and enjoy themselves, but i think they recently renovated because the patio is gone and the sitting area is now inside but it is ridiculously small. This place gets jammed pack and there are not enough tables up for grabs for people to be able to sit and enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE this place. My friends and I always make sure we stop here and load up on awesomeness before we drive home. We were excited to hear that they were back open this time.  I was in LV, celebrating my 30th Bday with about 25 of my friends and family from around the US. Saturday night 12/12 we left the hotel to hit Tacos El Gordo, There were about 8-10 of us. We ordered our food, paid and continued to seat ourselves. Mid bite, we were approached by the police. Scared and slightly intimidated, he asked us to show our receipts. He said that the Cashier told him that we did not pay for our food. We showed all of our receipts and the officer was apologetic. No one else in the restaurant that night was asked to show their receipt. Why were we targeted? My friends and I are all professional women with careers and families at home and of course were very capable of covering 2 dollar tacos. I'm most disgusted in the attitudes and beliefs displayed by TEG staff this night. We were never issued an apology or anything. We were were racially profiled and it was humiliating, embarassing and disgusting."}
{"text":"If you ever wonder what it would be like to experience eating authentic Mexican tacos in Tijuana or any taco fast food place deep into Mexico then I highly recommend eating at this location.  With that said, be ready for long lines, total chaos, utter frustration, and complete anger as to how this company runs its business operations and treats their customers.  Though the food that we ate I would rate 3.5 stars. I'd say they charge higher than the average mini taco and have less meat. The corn tortillas were freshly made and spot on. CThe asada was good but not worth the wait. Lengua was okay which I wasn't a big fan of to begin with. Didn't try the adobado cause they wouldn't let me order in the same line as asada and told me to go wait in another line which would take another 20 min on a busy night. But I give this place two star rating based on my experience and lack of proper customer service and organization. 

First off if you see the line out the door and around the fenced-in outdoor patio then I highly recommend skipping this location and opting for the downtown location in hopes of a much shorter line. Though we were told that the half hour line would go fast, what they don't tell you is another half hour to order your food once inside.  While waiting in line, I even witness some regular customers cutting ahead of line by entering the exit outdoor patio then entering the exit door and blend in to the different lines inside. They even have two security guards that are suppose to monitor the one entry and other exit door to keep people from cutting but they could care less and better occupied their time by either eating or chatting with next door employees. 

Now if you want different kinds of taco meat and you alone then it would be an additional wait. That's because some executive genius thought it would be more efficient for them to have separate lines for certain kinds of taco meat. You want taco de asada then you wait in the center area lines for just beef tacos except beef tongue. You want taco de adobado, then you wait in different line, only one on each end for taco pork adobado. You want taco de lengua (beef tongue), then its the only one line all the way on the right around the counter. But wait, what if you want both and your by yourself?!?  Then they lecture you like a child that you must go wait in another line for that $2.25 mini taco! No ifs ands or butts. Then after waiting in multiple lines for your food, guess what? You get to wait in another line to pay for your food! Oh you want extra condiments like hot sauce, onions, or cilantro? Nope just limes and sliced radish at the condiment bar. You have to re-approach the counter to ask for condiments which your lucky if they serve you but most of time they'll say their out of hot sauce if their to lazy to go out of their way cause of the chaos that goes on. So make sure you ask for all your condiments up front as you place your order. So if you plan on eating a variety of different meat tacos then go with couple different friends or guests so you can each wait in all the different lines to order your food at same time then pay all together at the register.  I noticed that majority of the customers that eat at this establishment seem like hispanics that were born and raised in Mexico and seem to accept this kind of business operation and would never complain. But if your a newcomer or tourist, you'll be completely puzzled as to how this operation makes any sense. Otherwise wouldn't other Mexican fastfood establishments be incorporating this kind business model which they don't. 

All in all I personally would not care to comeback to this establishment but it was a one time experience I'll never forget!"}
{"text":"this place is about authentic as mexican taco hole in the wall or taco trucks get, the cooks are quick to make your order, it's fresh and deliciously prepared right in front of your eyes as your mouth waters while the cook chops away at the sizzling meats.., simple tacos with a variety of meats topped with onion, cilantro, and salsa..that's all you need!"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole, this place was absolutely delicious. After a night out of partying in Vegas, the adobada fries hit the spot! The one thing that bummed me out is there are several different lines throughout the restaurant and each line is where you order a different item. Example- I ordered carnitas tacos and adobada fries and I had to wait in 2 separate lines to order! This is confusing enough to the sober restaurant goer, but add a million drunk Vegas crazies to the mix (the restaurant is always packed) and it makes getting your order in a nightmare. Luckily their food more than makes up for this design flaw-- go check them out!"}
{"text":"Alright alright - who's this hater giving Tacos El Gordo 3 stars? I mean, it averages 4.5 stars over 1100 reviews - so who's this guy giving it 3?

Yes - it is a cheap eat in Vegas.
Yes - there are great tacos here.
Yes - there is quite an assortment of meats here.
Yes - they're pretty quick
Yes - everyone and their moms eat here because of everything that everybody raves about.

But.. I just didn't think it was THAT great. My wife loved it - in fact, we ate here twice during the 2-day stay we had in Vegas. I guess I've just been spoiled with the availability of great tacos at a cheaper price in LA, that I didn't see what the hoopla of Tacos El Gordo is/was.

It's a solid option, especially if you're up drinking, partying, clubbing, or doing whatever else Vegas has to offer, and it's late, and you want something to eat. They're great at what they do, I just didn't think it was as amazing as it was overhyped to be.

I got the buche, the cabeza, and the lengua tacos. Each taco had a lot of meat. The lady had an asada vampiro. She was satisfied with her choice. 

She did make the remark that everything about Tacos el Gordo was legitimately Mexican i.e. the layout, staff, products, and even the patrons [all walks of life] - just that the price wasn't quite Mexican, meaning, you're paying more for the same product. I guess the price was the biggest turn off for me, since there are $1 taco places near my childhood home that offer the same quality goodness that is a taco.

Was it good? Yes. Great? Mmmmm....."}
{"text":"See for yourself on the picture . It's kinda sad the everyone says there so good but there is a maggot in the food and they act like thing happen. That's not ok"}
{"text":"Amazing, economical tacos. Fast service. Eat inside or outside. Handmade tortillas while you're in line. Variety of scrumptious tacos. Great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"their taco al pastor of choice is abodaba, if you want good authentic tacos in vegas, this is probably your only way to go, it's not bad, it's amazing, it's the best thing ever, it over shadows that lengua (tongue) taco that i got by miles...i can see why they need two separate lines for it and i still had to wait over 20mins cuz some ppl in front of me just ordered like 20tacos 

they have horchata soft drink machine ;d"}
{"text":"Wow.  Tacos el Gordo can't be beat! Grab a tray, load up on some tacos al pastor, grab some radishes and limes, and enjoy the best tacos around.  The juicy pork mixed with the perfect blend of sauces makes every bite savory, hearty, and smooth all at the same time.  We went here 3 times during our last trip to Las Vegas and every meal seemed better than the last.  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to try out Tacos el Gordo, without the crazy lines and sober to say the least lol for its proper judgement.

This past weekend we went to Vegas to celebrate my cousins 25th birthday, and all weekend I was really craving tacos. Finally, before leaving I told them lets go and they agreed. For once the lines weren't out the door like they normally are which made me really excited. I was a bit overwhelmed as to what to get but finally decided on 2 tacos and a mulita de asada.

The tacos are Ok and have hand made tortillas. They are not stingy with their meat, sauce or guacamole which is a plus. The mulitas were made the same way and had sooooo much cheese in which I love. The downside to the food was the Carne Asada was wayyyyyyy too salty. 

I'm giving it 3 stars because I feel like it's just all hype. I've had better tacos in LA. Also the fact the meat was really salty. Maybe next time it'll be better."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and saw the high Yelp ratings, so we tried it!!! WOW! Delicious so far best street style taco I had. Carne Asada (beef) was cooked in front of us and the tortilla they use was delicious and different from other taco places. Fast & friendly staff. Horchata fountain machine  with so many different drinks besides soda. We will be back!!! please open a location in Henderson!!!"}
{"text":"For everyone who doesn't have the luxury of living near the San Diego/Mexico border, you can now get your Tacos El Gordo fix in beautiful Las Vegas.  For the uninitiated, it is absolutely worth visiting if you are a fan of authentic Mexican food.  Just beware of the ridiculous lines during lunch and the silly ordering system that works in theory but fails miserably in execution.

When you get there, you'll see that there are multiple lines for each of the meat stations.  Each station is supposed to be dedicated only to a particular type of meat or meats, but the lines aren't labeled and it's more of a free-for-all to get to the front than anything else.  To further cause problems, people will wait in one line (carnitas for example), but when they get to the front they order something that's supposed to be from another station (asada for example).  This causes delays because the guy at the carnitas station will have to ask the guy at the asada station to make something for the guy who stood in the wrong line in the first place, which causes both lines to get further backed up.  Confused yet?  Yeah, it's a big mess.

But let me save you the trouble of having to wait in multiples lines.  I've tried pretty much all the meats, and I can confidently say the only meat that really makes this place unique/special is the adobada (spicy pork aka al pastor).  It's frickin' delicious!  The meat has a perfect balance of crispiness and juiciness, and is packed with salty sweet flavor.  Whether you get it in a taco, tostada, quesadilla or whatever, I guarantee it will be good.  The other meat choices don't even hold a candle, but you can wait for them if you want.  You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Erin es gordo.  Amazing tacos at $2 a pop makes this a must visit when in vegas. I tried the spicy pork, the beef shoulder and the steak with all the fixings.  The meat is tender, the topping are perfect (different salsas depending on the meat) and the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Great prices! FAST service!! This place was packed when we went a d the line ZOOMED! It was awesome food too. Carne asada fries were bomb!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS tacos! Order anything from the menu, you most likely won't be disappointed.  It's fresh and it's fast. I eat here everything I'm in Vegas. I personally love the speed in which you can get a super fresh and super tasty taco."}
{"text":"The BEST $2 Carne Asada taco in Vegas!!! Also had the Carne Asada tostada - very authentic with guacamole, grilled green onions, radish, and lime garnish...... REALLY TASTY! Don't expect rice, beans (they don't sell any!) and other extras - they have lingua, al pastor or pork (the wife liked that).  Green and red salsa - the green was surprisingly spicy - I really liked it. The staff was helpful and kept bringing us extra tortillas, napkins, and salsa. The service was 5 stars and we left a monster tip!!! Easily exceeded my expectations after reading about 5 reviews - it IS THE REAL DEAL!!! Walkable from The Riviera and better than anything in their food court!"}
{"text":"If u want to taste the best tacos in the world . U found the spot .. I wander one night at 2 am from Vegas . Wasn't that busy on Thursday and I absolutely loved it ! Came back on Friday waited 1 hour but I did not mind at all"}
{"text":"Came to visit my grandma and had these for the first time it is so good !!! I love the cabeza tacos I ordered two of everything I am dying for the lengua ! It's the best and I love my tacos ! The only bad thing is I didn't get any salsa and I had to pay for the guacamole but let me tell you i loved it deff going back when I go over there it got crowded fast ! But it's worth the wait and the pastor looks so fresh and taste fresh ! Love it here guys"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend when I moved to Las Vegas.  The food is consistent, and everyone I have brought here LOVES it!"}
{"text":"After hearing the endless exultant praise for the tacos here, we decided to make it our first pit-stop in Vegas. Thankfully, it was right beside our hotel at Encore. It basically is the last stop before you hit crappy old town Vegas and sorry if you are a resident of old town Vegas, I mean \"crappy\" in the nicest way possible.

The line was ridiculous, it was a like a Mexican ride at Disneyland, throngs of people clamoring to get a taste of the goodness. Delicious meat-scented smoke was wafting from the interior beckoning us in.

We were lucky enough to nab a table and the line moved surprisingly quick. Simply put, get the spicy pork and lengua tacos. The carne asada was pretty wack but the aforementioned spicy pork and tongue was ahhhh-mazing. Oh and be sure to ask for the grilled onions and peppers, it really puts the experience over the top.

Whether you decide to have this before your evening of binge-drinking or after to mitigate the monstrous hangover you will surely have, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"They still have great tasting everything I just hate waiting in the long line that seems to never move!"}
{"text":"Have to be a time when there is no line at this place. 
food is great, but after all the waiting between lines and cashing out ect the food gets a different taste and it cold."}
{"text":"Always dependable for late night tacos.

This is really a nostalgic review this spot when it was right by the Encore. It was the best to see hot messes while you were devouring hot messes. It was always packed as all hell.

For some reason it always amazed me that they took plastic.

If you happen to be in Vegas, this is worth a stop, even in the daytime."}
{"text":"Fresh and definitely worth it! Forget your to-go taco places and dig in to tacos el gordo!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries for $5! This place is like Mexico, but in Las Vegas. Although they reasonably charge more for their food. Tacos were $2 bucks each. 

Star of the show was my taco abadado (marinated pork on a rotisserie)
It's not too often that I see it served right off the rotisserie. Not in SF or LA. The only place that does it like that is Mexico. (And also Las Vegas apparently.) These melt in your mouth little tacos were dripping with marinated (secret) juices."}
{"text":"Have you ever had Mexican food so good you dreamt about it? Well, get ready to with Tacos El Gordo. I can't even explain how delicious this place is! Just get ready to wait in line. It's so good it attracts people from all over the country!"}
{"text":"The adobada al pastor tacos Are the best and the carne asada ones are lean and not greasy like other spots. Salsa is good too"}
{"text":"Bomb ass tacos, enough said.

Lines can be long but if you dont have patience just get the asada. 

Locals were recommending the fries to us but we passed.

Everything we had was awesome, and no, we weren't drunk."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas and want to go to Chipotle instead of Tacos El Gordo or any of many authentic Mexican restaurants in town go kill yourself, j/k lol...  I definitely came here at the wrong time, Saturday at noon so use your common sense and plan accordingly otherwise the wait will be well over one hour if you want their most popular item which is asada (beef tacos).  This place is definitely legit because the clientele is mostly all Latinos.  I only had the asada and they are the most tasty tacos I've ever had!  The meat is perfectly seasoned and their guac is the bomb.  I'm literally drooling as I write this review!  These tacos look small so it takes about three to get a normal sized person full.  I want to give them 5 stars but just can't with that long ass wait!"}
{"text":"Adobada cut straight off the bone, asada fresh off the grill, and a spicy  guacamole salsa (you can't miss the cebollitas of course) are to die for. This taco joint is a must if you're in Vegas!"}

Greatest Mexican food Ever..!!! 
Favorite spot to hit up late night after the club.
Glad it's open 24 hours..!"}

Are you a basketball fan?  Do you remember when Vince Carter played his only time in the slam dunk contest, threw down his first, thunderous dunk, and stared into the audience, motioning with his hand slitting his throat and mouthed....................\"It's Over\"

That is how i felt after i took my first bite of their Spicy Pork adoboda taco.
The search for Vegas's Best Taco has ended.  It's over.

I didn't think it was possible to get an authentic taco in this town.  I been to the self proclaimed \"Robertos\" and the other has-beens where frankly after tonight I'd feed it all to a dog.

We got the cabeza (beef head), lengua (tongue), and the spicy pork adoboda.  When you arrive, there is a secret way of ordering, kind of like In-and-Out.  Based on the meat choice you want, you go to line 1, 2, or 3.

The line closest to the door is where it is at yo..Spicy pork goodness.  Be sure to hit up every line and get your grilled scallions and peppers in line 1.  

BEst of all, this place is open till 4am on the weekends."}
{"text":"After waiting in line for over 45 minutes, we find out that if we want to try the various meats offered on the general menu, we have to stand in 2 additional long lines (3 lines with a wait of over 30 minutes each!) Why?! 
The set up at this facility is different from other Taco Restaurants. The customers get in the 1st lines (depending on what type of meat you want for your tacos) order and pick up the food, then get in a different line if you want another type of meat and so on for the 3rd group of meats. Basically Asada and chorizo cooked on a fire grill is one line, Asada and adobada, and tripas another line, and the meats cooked and kept hot with steam like lengua, cabeza, buche is at a 3rd line. Once you get your food, you line up to get a drink, then pay. 
Well, with the experience of 1 line at 45 minutes, we were not about to stand in more lines so we got what we could in the line we waited for and went straight to pay and took our food to go. 
The tacos we ordered were ok. We come from Los Angeles and as foodies, we know about great tacos like Cinco Puntos. The wait at this Tacos El Gordo was not, NOT NOT worth the wait. 
If the management changes the logistics so the customers can order (anything from the general menu) and pay at one location, the pick up at another area, maybe the wait time can improve and I would reconsider visiting again."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself here at 11pm and the line is 150 people long, just be patient. Stay in line. The food is phenomenal. Best tacos period."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had really reminded me of what Mexican tacos tastes like and it was amazing I got 5 tacos then they were so good I got 5 more !!"}
{"text":"Food here was really authentic and cheap. The ambiance isn't much but if you are looking for cheap and good Mexican food, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Our favorite taco place in Vegas! Friends tried the one by The Strip but they said it's not the same so we always go to this location.  We've been pretty lucky and haven't had to wait long (max 10 min). But we're usually here past 1AM.

They have their own parking area but since they are in a plaza, there's also plenty of parking nearby as well. They do have a few tables outside towards the back if all the tables inside are taken. Usually pretty cold inside as well, so bring a jacket at night!

When you enter, you pick up a tray if you are ordering a bunch of different items and then stand in line one of 3 lines for the type of meat you want. If you want a different meat in another line,  then you'll have to go to that other line as well (or have a friend grab it for you). When you got all your items, you pay at the cashier. By the drinks is where you can find the limes & radishes.

My favorite is the lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (beef head) tacos. WARNING: If you order the cabeza tacos, they do have a spicy sauce that goes with it so if you don't do spicy foods well, be sure not to get it. I like to wash everything down with a horchata. My friends always order the al pastor and carne asada. Meats are tender and always delicious.

Afterwards, don't forget to take away your trash so other people can use the table right away. This place is ALWAYS busy!

NEVER a Vegas trip without a stop here!"}
{"text":"Me gustaría que tuvieran cebolla con cilantro para poder servir todo lo demás muy rico"}
{"text":"Sabrosos tacos, quesadillas, sipes y mulas todo muy delicioso estuve cuatro dias y fui tres veces"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Inexpensive. I really liked the adobada/al pastor. This place can get crowded. We had to wait for a table. Ohhh, but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Went on a Tuesday at 4pm and only stood in line for about 15 minutes.
-Homemade tortillas.
-Generous meat portions.
-Traditional Mexican-the tortillas are dipped in oil, salsa can be spicey
-Plenty of parking
-Average is 2.25 for each taco 
-Adobada was great!!

Cons
-Asada meat needed more flavor and it was cold
-The guacamole comes straight from the fridge so it made my tacos cold
-Not a ton of seating

Overall, this place is a must visit when you're in Vegas, at least for the first experience. They won't be the best tacos you've tasted, but they are cheap, good and traditional. Check it out..."}
{"text":"We have been eating there since they opened. We complain about the guy picking his noise, which we wanted a remake and the manager said that \"it was normal\". 

We told them that we like the mulas but we wanted remade. Manager, refused and told us to complain with the number on the wall.

I called the number and the lady told me that we do not give free food away \"no damos comida gratis\". I told her, I wanted a remake and obviously pay for it. 

That is a health department violation and they do not care about it."}
{"text":"Food is really good... Ambience is great... Great spot other then it was way packed.... Tons of people... Outside sitting was so peaceful"}
{"text":"This is only my 2nd review ever but I have to write about Taco's El Gordo. With the exception of going to TJ (I go to TJ at least 4 times a year) these are the best Taco's I have ever tasted and I go to a lot of Taco joints. Going to Vegas means going to Taco's El Gordo. What you need to get out of all the posts are that the Adobada sometimes also called Al Pastor (Pork - Not spicy at all even though they say it is) is perfection in a corn tortilla. Let me be clear I am not a fan of pork and I don't make a habit of eating it but the things this place does..... when it hits the lips. What makes this epic is the Guacamole Sauce that they put in it. Everyone I take has always loved it. For those daring enough to handle the wait you will always agree.... worth the wait. Oh and can't miss my shout out for the Asada Fries, think Nachos but with fries instead of tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Most legitimate tacos, ever!

It's effectively the same tacos that you get from a taco truck, in a restaurant. However, taco trucks tend to be a bit cheaper by a few cents per taco. For a grown adult, roughly 4 tacos can fill you up, which is about $8 without drinks. 

I do not recommend the Taco De Sesos! Thats beef brain tacos. And it smells funny, and tastes like... unflavored tofu or something. And I hate tofu. 

But everything else is great! I don't know what that green sauce is, but I see little onion bits in it. Whenever possible, request more green stuff on your tacos!

The neighborhood around is sort of shady, the shopping center where this one is located is surrounded by liquor stores and smoke shops. However! It is a better spot than the 2nd location on Charleston, which is surrounded by bail bonds and pawn shops. 

The people that work here can speak a limited amount of English, so for people that want to practice their Spanish, remember this line...

\"Yo quiero _______ tacos de _______\"

Where the first blank is the number (uno, dos, tres, quattro, cinco, etc.) and the second blank is the type of taco. Carne for example, means beef, and etc. You can just read it off the menu."}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos are the best in town! So are the Campechana fries! One of the best spots to eat if you are visiting Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"BOMB! Was in town from California and was recommended this spot. Did not disappoint! Adobada was delicious. I wish the tripas was a little more crunchy. The carne asada wasn't dry and mula's were ! Def the taco spot to go to!"}
{"text":"Solid taco spot. Line gets insanely long at certain times in the day so prepare. Food is amazing but the prices are getting high. I had to spend $20 to get full and that's pretty normal but I didn't expect to pay that much for tacos for one person."}
{"text":"Delicious! Their al pastor is a must! Even if there's a line it's definitely worth it! It's so good I stood in line a second time for seconds!"}
{"text":"Just solid great tacos!

Adobada: 8.8/10. Just great flavor, the right amount of fatty goodness.. Remember to get it fully dressed with that green suace. 

Carne asada: 7.8/10. Coooked right in front you. Good solid flavor. Adobaba still is my favorite. Make sure to grab some grilled green onions and jalepenos for free! Just ask. 

Lengua: 8.5/10:  just that delicious fatty tongue. 2nd faorvite thing on menu. Tender and juicy

Cabeza: 8/10: just try it! It's good. 

Other than that. The lines are kine past 12am.  You may be waiting an hour or so.  Remember depending on what taco you want there is a separate line for that.  Its displayed in pretty big letters . Can't miss.   Usually 3-4 tacos will fill any ones belly.  At 2.25 or so a pop.  It's a great deal"}
{"text":"You can't beat this place in food or clientele late at night.  The adobado tacos were awesome.  We fed the entire family of 5 for under $40, and in Vegas that can't be beat.  Amazing food!  This place was entirely packed.  An ambulance pulled up and parked there to eat too, a sure sign that this is good food...  medics don't wait for food that might be bad.  Because there's a good chance we will get a call while we are waiting for food, and why would you wait in line for bad food???  There's a very good tip for everyone..."}
{"text":"Awesome but didn't like that only offered booth seating. There was no guidance on how to order and where to go. The cooks looked at me like if i was a gringa, kind of felt like it. The food was a bit greasy and small for paying almost $5. I suppose when you're drunk it really doesn't matter his much food you get not how much you pay for it."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw the sign for Tacos El Gordo off the freeway as we were coming back from the Valley of Fire. We absolutely love the location off the strip. 
Walking in we were shocked that the place was practically empty.and thought it was funny that even though it was empty I still had to order from two different people ie. windows who were practically standing next to each other. 

If it were busy you would have to stand in  two different lines then after receiving your selections you proceed to pay. Which by then & half then time your eating half cold food. Nicely this time around it was just me and family ordering so after paying we got to enjoy our food while it was hot. 

My wife and Mother in-law ordered carne asada tacos with everything on it. I ordered lengua tacos with everything. And a full order of carne asada fries. Everything tasted fresh and consistent with their other location as far as flavor goes. 

My only other complaint was that the carne Asada  fries was lacking... well  carne asada. I thought It had very little meat for a full order of carne asada fries  should have. it had  lots of sour cream, guacamole and salsa but my wife and I had to poke around for the meat. I even think we got more meat on the  half order. But still love the over all taste and definitely would come back."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to some good tacos... well this was not the place. I am not sure what the big hype is about. The tacos are decent but not good or great. The line is EXTREMLY long... the way it is organized does not make sense... One line if you want asada, another for pastor and another for anything else. WTF? I do not want to have to wait in 3 different lines to get tacos. Also... I don't know what type of salsa/sauce they put on the pastor tacos or the fries but it is not good and definitely not authentic. It would be nice if they just gave them with cilantro and onion like all other places and then have a separate salsa bar. I don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"It's greasy, slightly over salted and super delicious! For $25 it's the best meal we've had in Vegas. That includes strip restaurants."}
{"text":"I had a single adobada sope and my friends had 3 al pastor tacos. This is some of the most delicious Mexican food I have ever had!! My sope came with giant slices of well cooked adobada, which was finally covered in some light chili sauce. The sope was soft and moist. 

While I was standing in line, I met some Tacos el Gordo regulars, who said that the al pastor and adobada were the same in flavor. This made me feel a bit better about not getting a second meat dish. Oh how I wish we had, had more time to order other items. We were waiting in line for over 45 minutes and our anxiety levels continued to rise. Our show was starting at 7 pm, so we decided to order a few things and book it back to the theater. 

Expect to wait for a long,long time to even get into the building. Then you will have to wait to order your food. There are 5 counters and only certain meats are served at each. This means you will have to dance around in different counters' lines. This was so disorganized and inefficient.

However, the food is amazing and is as authentic as you can get. I am most definitely coming back with plenty of time to spare and a large appetite."}
{"text":"So I constantly heard people talking about how amazing this taco shop is, and I had to try it. The lines are outrageous, and it is set up as a cafeteria style where you stand in line, get your food & then you pay. The taste of the tacos were absolutely amazing, however, I paid $2 for a  taco about the size of my hand. After eating 2 of them, & an order of fries, I couldn't honestly say I was full. Overall, would rate as average."}
{"text":"The tacos were extremely salty. customer service was the worst. I tasted better tacos."}
{"text":"The wait here is unbelievable, it wrapped around the whole entire fence for the outdoor seating area, but once you get inside, the tacos were really good. I had the regular beef tacos since the tripa tacos were not available (what a bummer ) for those of you wondering, Tripa tacos are beef intestines tacos if you ever feel adventurous! The tacos were quite small, but three tacos were able to fill me up pretty well. Average price for the tacos were $3.00 which was a HUGE plus! We waited for around 30 minutes to get inside. But more lines inside depending on what you order."}
{"text":"This is one busy taco place! But it's worth the trip and the wait. Reasonable prices and outstanding food."}
{"text":"long, long hour in line to get tacos.  It was ok, you have to wait in two different line for different kind of tacos. Asada one line, Al pastor another line that didn't make sense.  I have had better tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the oh so delicious tacos in Mexico near the border.. corn tortillas with the best al pastor and their specialty green sauce.. 2$ per taco. 
-Has a crazy long line which is split up into carne asada line, al pastor, line and every other meats line."}
{"text":"We just wanted some good beef tacos so we Yelped it and got this place. The carne asada has a smoky flavor to it and the tortillas were soggy and greasy. I'm sure there are other delicious items in the menu but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Food was good, but cold. Second time this happens. They should increase the temperature or heat up the meat and tortillas better."}
{"text":"I guess it is the best taco shop on the Strip. 
Brain and Tripa is so yum! As always."}
{"text":"Omg! The best tacos. I loved this place. You order what you want at the counter and then pay. I tried the al pastor and Asada tacos and a tostada. The tostada was excellent too. The only down side was I could have gone for more salsa and they do not have a salsa bar. They put it all on for you. They do have limes and radishes on a little side bar though."}
{"text":"I loooooooooove Tacos El Gordo! My first trip to the location on the strip. It was crazy packed, lines far out the door, but totally worth it. Excellent food.  I prefer the other location but the food is the same."}
{"text":"Horrible food! I don't get the hype. The meat was just okay. The tortillas were below average. What really killed it was the salsa!! It tasted like watered down salsa . It was the worst Mexican food we'd tried . I would have rather ate at Taco Bell. I don't understand the hype what so ever !!! Even my husband agreed with me 100% . Not worth it."}
{"text":"Who knew Vegas could serve authentic Tacos. At Tacos el Gordo you get the real deal none of this Tex-Mex flour tortilla stuff. instead you get the small corn tortillas just like in Mexico the menu is super easy and the guys working the kitchen are hilarious. 

my favorites were the tripa, that's tripe for you English speakers, clean, hot and crispy. The lengua followed and to finish the asada. I had mine with \"todo\" which means everything onions, cilantro and either red or green salsa. 

Do stay away from the sesos way to mushy for my taste. 

Tip: If you go get yourself a Mexican soda for the full experience.
 
All and all two big orale for this place!"}
{"text":"Growing up, I would go to TJ a lot and this place by far is the best thing to Mexico there is. The al Pastor tacos taste identical to the ones they sell in TJ. The al Pastor is truly authentic, not like the way most places make it by not only making them extra greasy but adding tons of cinnamon. The way the tortillas taste, the chili, and even down to the type of guacamole you get according to the type of taco you get speaks Mexico. Vegas, y'all are lucky to have them out there."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent of Tacos El Gordo ever since I visited their location on the Las Vegas Strip.  However to my dismay they closed it down for reasons unknown, so now I have to make the 4mile trip to this location... which I do gladly, only I wish they still had it on the strip because now I have to work harder to convince my friends who haven't been here to make the trip!

My favorites are adobada, lengua, sesos, carne asada, and all of them simply PERFECTION!  $2 each, and I can't get myself to eat less than 6-10 of them when I'm here.  Do not miss the chance to come to this place.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is now closed.  Sadness!  I've been coming here for years now and it was a regular stop on my Vegas trips.  I guess I now have to go to the other locations.  The Tacos de adobada was my favorite."}
{"text":"Easily one of my fav taco spot. Not a place I'd hang out, but definitely a place I'd get my food from. With that being said. Let's move on to the bad. The guy taking orders at the Adobada is without a doubt the worst ever. Rolls eyes, cuts u off as ur ordering.  Won't let u finish bcuz he just wants to move on. Only reason this place blows is bcuz of this guy. No point in complaining cuz the ladies there won't care. And I know bcuz an Asian couple did complain n it was nothing.mostly bcuz the lady spoke little English and was too busy to care. So u been warned. Good tacos, shitty service."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, tasted good, and prices reasonable.   Everyone inside was very nice. They even went out of there way to help bandage up a passing homeless man who was bleeding."}
{"text":"Love love love Gordos tacos!! We fell in love with them at first when we used to live in San Francisco. They have a great location next to Golden gate Park. I was soooooo happy when I saw they were also in Vegas!! They really do taste like authebtic TJ tacos. No other place has been able to do that. Not ones that I've been to at least. PS. Order your salsas when you order your food. After you order with the you just have to pay and they will give you your drink cup. Not like other places where you get your salsas after"}
{"text":"Great taco spot not too far off the strip. Definitely worth the trip there. Fast service and awesome tacos. Wish we we would have gone back for more before we left. Will keep this bookmarked for future Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"Tried a variety of tacos & they were better than most authentic mexican resteraunts. 
They have more then just tacos & they were opened late which was great !!!
Definitely would recommend this place if you're in vegas & craving tacos 
Will be back next time i'm in LV."}
{"text":"Being a true Mexican I must say Tacos El Gordo are not the best tacos, they are a-ok, they put very little meat in your tacos, nothing to die for, only good thing is the tortillas are \"home\" made, however I truly dislike the way they have you order your tacos, so annoying and incondiserate, this is not the place you want to stop by after work to pick up a \"to go\" order, you'll be there quite some time and by the time you get home w/dinner all your tacos will be ice cold, as you have to make different lines to order different types of meat, they need to restructure their ordering layout or take all your friends w/you and make them all stand in the different lines lol no but really its stupid, this is why I dont go unless I have 2/3 people w/me. Los Tacos are by far way better and w/lots of meat and you only need to make one line."}
{"text":"OMG!   I tried real Mexican tacos on my trip to Hermosillo in Sonora once, and I have been looking to find a place that serves tacos that taste as good.   That was 11 years ago.   Looks I just found it!

Tacos el Gordo is awesome.  Open late, close to the strip, plenty of parking, and the food here is AWESOME!   The only real Mexican I food I found outside of Mexico, and I have beef to hundreds of Mexican restaurants.   I wish they opened in Hawaii, the land of no good Mexican food."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HANGRY 
My aunts and I stood in their three lines for 15 min and maybe 2 people were helped in that time. And then there was a long line to pay as well. Since there was about 10 people ahead of us we left. Such a shame because it smelled delicious."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas, in my opinion. 
The only thing I dislike about this place is the extremely long lines!"}
{"text":"Ok, I get it. I finally get what the hype is all about!

Let's start and taco about how delicious this place is! (I had to do it. This pun was too easy.)

Set Up - As other Yelpers have mentioned, there are separate lines for different meats. If you're with a group of people, devise a plan and split up! Otherwise, you'll be stuck standing in several lines. 

Food - A M A Z I N G! Need I say more? I had the al pastor, carne and cabeza taco! I enjoyed them most in the order listed. While the carne and cabeza we're good, the al pastor was faaaaaar more superior. I also had the adobada mula which was good but a bit difficult to eat. Overall the mula was just ok. Although the adobada meat was really flavorful and tasty, def a close second!

Once you're done getting all your food, there is a separate line to pay at the cashier. 

The place is quite busy so swoop on an open table if you get the opportunity!"}
{"text":"If I can say one thing about this place located in Vegas is this, It's amazing. Some of the best tacos in Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed. I got the carnitas and carne asada, both were delicious. Stop reading this and go there now!"}
{"text":"The hype is REAL at this taco joint. Best tacos I have ever tasted. Don't be discouraged with the long lines, it goes by fast and it is definitely worth it. I tried the lingua tacos (beef tongue) and the adobada tacos (spicy pork). they were both amazing!!! The tacos come with this special green sauce and pineapples and it's the best combination I've ever tried. They also make the tortillas FRESH right in front of you! My favorite part is that they have so many condiments for the tacos. I am so sad that there isn't a location in Orange County...."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment at this location... take the extra 10 minutes and drive to the one on Charleston Blvd, it's 1 million times more worth it. 

This location is really stingy on the amount of sauce they put on the tacos... I got like a sprinkle of the green sauce on my tacos(not even exaggerating)
;( and they limit you to how many peppers and condiments you can get. They also have NO green onions. 

I've never been so depressed about tacos in my life... until this location :("}
{"text":"If it as all possible to get a freedom boner from food.....then ladies and gentlemen.....boner acheived!!!!! Fucking delicious....and the best part is, i live next to it and can walk there anytime i want....so suck it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love tacos right!?
Tacos el Gordo is truly the most successful taco place here in Vegas. Would I say they're the best... ehh so so. 

The reason why I did not give them five stars is because of how their set up is. I find it beyond annoying to have to get in line for every type of meat on top of having to wait again to pay. Your hands are full of tacos, their getting cold, lines are always long. By the time you pay, go get your drink sit down and start eating, your tacos are cold. In general I like my food hot I don't know about you guys. 

I always get tacos or half Alpastor fries. 
Sometimes I wonder how cooked their meat is so I always have them cook the meat a bit extra and use only one tortilla. 
The Alpastor fries are pretty tasty just wish the hot sauce was more spicy because I find the creamy green sauce to be a bit too sweet. 
Order the complimentary grilled jalapeños and green onions, they're tasty. 

Over all tacos are good but not the best. Every few months I crave them and every time I go I remember why this place is not a regular.

Staff is friendly cannot complain, and I find it to be very clean as well."}
{"text":"I can't believe how much flavour you can get in such small tacos. This is amazing and you can't go wrong. Must try you won't be disappointed. Security guards helped form the line are super cute and friendly. They were calm and didn't get angry with people considering how busy it is."}
{"text":"Super weird way of ordering food. 

So if you want al pastor tacos you have to stand in one line .

If you want asada tacos it's another line. 

The quesadillas are basically a taco with cheese, ( I didn't ask for a taco with cheese ), yet that is what I received. 

Also I wasn't offered any salsa or fresh guacamole. 

I recommend that customers be able to order what ever they want in 1 line and not have us jumping around in lines. 

Also please offer fresh salsa and guacamole every time ( it's part of the experience). 

And please step up your quesadilla game . A good quesadilla should never be out of reach. 

Thanks for the food ."}
{"text":"Hype. Hype! HYPE!!

Dafuq peeps, tacos were just ok! They lacked FLAVOR! Yeah, the meat was tender, but that'll never make up for lack of flavor. It's like having a big, nvm let's not go there ;p 

Easy to find taco shop due to the giant line out the door any time of day, but know what you want before you reach the door! Once you get inside the line gets divided into diff stations of meat. If you want diff types of tacos, you may have to stand and wait in multiple lines. It's best to go with friends and have each get tacos from diff lines, then share :D 

Once you receive your tacos, don't forget go to the cashier to pay before grabbing a seat. They use the honor system here so don't steal!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos!  Seems like a local place, highly recommend!  They make the tacos in front of you and it's pretty good as far as prices go!"}
{"text":"These were some of the best tacos I've had in a long time. They're definitely 5-star!I came at 9pm and the line for adobo (pork) was long, but for asada (steak) there wasn't one. As you can tell from the picture of the menu they have many different varieties. The pork adobada is excellent if you like spicy food, otherwise I'd get a taco asada where they include avocado. Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to get tacos! Not authentic at all.  The tortillas are yellow not white. The avocado is bland. The meat is greasy. And the service is awful.  They charge you after you get your food and they don't give you a receipt. So they will charge you twice if they can.  Don't eat here unless you're drunk and starving!"}
{"text":"OMG    for  great Mexican food, you can't find better.  I'm a 76 year old female \"gringo\" and I don't know a word of Spanish.  It is important to know what line to stand in for the various foods.  I go during the mid-day and rely on others to help me...the servers and customers alike.  Over time, I am learning and rewarded with wonderful foods."}
{"text":"We came here specifically for the Adobada Tacos. My girlfriend has been raving about this place since we started dating because apparently there is one in San Diego and it has the best Tacos in that nation. When we had arrived on a Monday afternoon, it was still packed! At that moment I was pretty excited to try the Adobada tacos because people were lining up for this place on a weekday. 

Finally we had arrived at the counter and had ordered 3 Adobada tacos each person and it did not disappoint! It was by far the best tacos I have eaten. We both pretty much inhaled it in a matter of minutes. The Adobada tacos because the meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was on point. We also got the Horchata to wash it down. Best combo! This place definitely worth the hype and worth the wait. I'm glad we came here and will definitely be visiting this place again.

I can't wait to come back and order their other signature dishes!

TACO HEAVEN :)

5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I didn't like that they did have chicken but their tacos are to die for. It's busy but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Solid, as advertised. Skip the carnitas and carne asada lines, double down on the spicy pork. The side greens are free if you ask for them, as is salsa at the cash register."}
{"text":"I have been hearing soooo much about this place! I just don't live close so I never thought to make the drive! Well.. I happen to be in the area last week for some training my company has going on! My co workers insisted on taking me here! Yikes! They get so busy to the point that people are literally lined out the door! Without knowing that they do allow calling in the order we stood in line for approximately 21 minutes! Was it worth it? Absolutely! They are by far better than robertos and they offer a more authentic Mexican taste! I think it's quite fascinating how they have this adobada spinning around on this wheel now personally I don't care for watching the meet spinning around like that with the guy shaving the meat sections off with this huge hunting knife lol but it's nothing a little prayer before the meal wing solve! The fries were awesome and I most definitely will be returning continuously!"}
{"text":"Best tacos since Mexico . . . And the Campechana fries? Huge and delicious. They even have easy parking. Great first meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just look at the pictures I posted!!! A picture is worth a million words! Best efing tacos hands down. Your taste buds can't afford to visit Vegas and not savior these tasty slices of heaven. Must go!!!! The server is awesome by the way!"}
{"text":"Are you interested in waiting in line for over an hour for \"just okay\" Mexican food? Well you are at the right place! Tacos El Gordo is supposedly a highly rated and preferred restaurant from what I've heard. This past visit would make number two for me and again I'm left with too much more to desire. I arrived with already have anticipating a long wait, that's a given! Day before a holiday(Thanksgiving) on the Las Vegas strip? Yeah you'd think everybody would be home that night preparing some Thanksgiving dinner but nope! 

Organization is something that could've possibly earned this place another star from me but the jury is still out on that. This location unlike the other one I have visited in town didn't seem to have a very good process in place for the crazy line. For starters, those of you who've never been there is about 4 different lines that they normally offer, depending on what kind of meat you want on your order decides on what line you should be standing. That wasn't the case this weekend. Upon arrival I noticed there was a security guard outside which I didn't think too much of because in my mind I thought he just patrolled the entire parking lot. No.. He is designated specifically just for Tacos El Gordo and manning the traffic that goes in and out? Seriously? What the hell goes on here that they need security at a Mexican fast food joint? Inquiring minds would really like to know... Once inside there was a \"snake line\" meaning that there wasn't no lining up according to the meat you want. Complete chaos! The capacity of the place easily fills up and so the security guard at some points of the wait had to stand in front of the door and make sure that it never exceeds I guess the capacity of what's allowed. Oh okay is this what he is here for? Yikes!

Hungry as I was I just couldn't have an order of a couple tacos. I thought I would treat myself to some campechana fries which is a mixture of the \"Al Pastor\" and \"Carne Asada\" meats. Large order will run you $13! Once I was to the ordering station I clearly stated that my choice of order was campechana! The man taking the order and also making the food was an excellent multi-tasker and I really have to commend him on his fast skills! 5 minutes later my order was being prepared and I noticed that the fries were being made without the \"Al Pastor\" I politely brought this to their attention. Fixed! When my order was being handed to be I guess there was another customer who ordered the same that didn't get his, by the time I took a few steps my order was snatched lol yes.. snatched from another guy. The worker saw this apologized and made me another! Security?! Umm yeah we have a campechana fry snatcher on the loose! On to the next line.. To pay.. I waited another 5 minutes so now we are talking a whole hour and fifteen minutes for some damn fries! Geezee! $14 and some change later I was on my way. Will I be back? Honestly no time soon. I just can't cope with paying $14 for some fries that weren't that spectacular. Whether you want to compare them or not I literally would prefer the Carne Asada fries from Roberto's over these I just ordered and oh save $5! Tacos El Gordo my friend you are just \"iight\"... **side eye**"}
{"text":"Love this place. The mulitas are to die for. My daughter also got the asada fries and they really good. It is always busy here! So you may need to plan your visit with plenty of time, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever had. Everything is fresh and made right in front of you. Some of the best Mexican I've ever had.  Because everything is made to order service is a bit slow but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite late night eating spot in LV.  I used to have so much trouble finding a spot to eat when I was staying at the Wynn or Encore, since Fat Burger and Earl of Sandwich is so far away.    

It's a long story on how I found this place, but it involves a rental car, spending $5 on a bottle of water and the Hoover Dam.  Anyway, this place is pretty awesome.  They have a Carne Asada Fries plate that is as big as your head (you can get a smaller version for half the price, but why do that to yourself? they're that good.).  The tacos and quesadillas are also really good.  My friend said the spicy pork tastes like chinese bbq pork and the quesadillas are not the ones that most people are used to.  It's more like a flat taco with a fried tortilla on top.  

The staff here is really friendly too.  The guy making the tacos and cutting pork from the meat slab was having a conversation with almost everyone that came in.

So if you're coming from XS, Tryst, Surrender, Blush, etc. and you're drunk or babysitting a drunk, then you should just walk to this spot.  There's also a good Mediterranean food place and a 24 hour Korean BBQ restaurant in the strip mall, so you have options.

There is also a Tacos El Gordo in Downtown LV, but I'm not sure if it's still open."}
{"text":"Just like some of the best places to eat in Tijuana Mex. This place it the real deal. Head up ! The ordering food deal is just like Mexico too. Crazy! Especially when it gets busy. If it's going to be your 1st time don't go at prime time lunch or dinner. There are 4 windows to order from as far as I could see. Pork, Beef ( different part of the cow are offered) but no chicken. I found this odd but what they do serve it very good."}
{"text":"Worst place ever for asada tacos. The guacamole gave my tacos a funky taste. The pastor meat was waaay better, it was great I loved it. It sorta made up for the gross asada tacos. However due to the very fast service my tortillas weren't fully cooked. I was hoping for better, since I got recommended this spot. My boyfriend and I were disappointed especially because we got homesick to our local tacos."}
{"text":"I've tried all their $2 tacos from the meathead, brains to the spicy pork and tripe. I have no complains about this joint. Affordable and your taste buds screams for more!! You will leave with a satisfied hunger and a happy wallet!! I will definitely be back! (I've been here twice in the past 24 hours already) and you got to love their hours of operation. Can't get any better than this when you had a few drinks with the company of wonderful people/family & an appetite for really good food after drinking for a few hours :) Totally worth the drive regardless which part of town you live at even for visitors!!

I always get everything on it especially the pineapple slice with the spicy pork taco!"}
{"text":"Visited the new location, seemed a bit out of the way.  Was also disappointed because the carne asada was a bit dry and flavorless.  You can usually cover this up with condiments, but ordered some tacos meat only for my daughter.  Also noticed there was a lot of gristle and hard parts in meat this tkme.  Seems they are buying cheap meat for tacos."}
{"text":"By far one of the best late night spots to eat in Vegas and best of all it was right outside the hotel I was staying (Wynn Las Vegas) tacos are fresh and going by most of the reviews here there are all spot on ... Porks the way to go. 

Next time I'm coming to Vegas I'm def coming here first!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever consumed.  Ate there twice on my last Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good.  Are you kidding me?  I'm in town on business for a few days. Did not want the debris on the Strip.  Wanted authentic.  Wanted good.  Wanted tacos.  I saw this place was not too far from my location, saw the Yelp reviews, and headed over. 

I must have hit it at the right time because there was zero line.  I knew from reading I had to order based on the meat I wanted.  I chose then spicy pork and one asada taco.  The meats were sliced, the tacos loaded, and off I went to pay.  Got a drink and it was less than $10.  

Wow wow wow. When I first bit the asada taco I knew I had found taco gold.  I have had asada before but never this good.  Everything was fresh, crispy where it should have been, and soft where it needed to be.  The asada had a saltiness that was a perfect compliment to the meal.  The spicy pork was not blow you head off spicy.  It had heat, but nothing that was overwhelming.  I enjoyed my meal so much that I considered, more than once, driving back to have this for dinner.  After all, the sign on the door says open at 9:30 until late.  Oh, be certain to get your tacos with everything on them.  You won't be sorry.  

The restaurant was clean, bright, and decidedly ethnic. The prices were great and service friendly.  Don't miss the lime and radish bar next to the beverage dispenser.  I tell you what, if you miss this gem when visiting Vegas, you missed some of the best eating there is."}
{"text":"my new favorite drunchies place when I'm in vegas! as a first timer, it can definitely be overwhelming with the large swarms of hungry/drunk people and the confusing line situation (theres different lines for what type of meat or food you want). although the wait was kinda long, it was entertaining to watch the cooks make the tacos. the legit taco chief was seriously throwing guac/sauce in the air and it always landed in the tacos PERFECTLY. i was in awe! the tacos are decently priced and are bursting in flavor. my only regret was not ordering 10 more tacos"}
{"text":"Place is really random off the strip but is freaking amazing."}
{"text":"There is not enough stars for this taco place! Come come
Come for their al pastor tacos! I love all of their other tacos too. They are delicious! To be honest, when I first heard it's $2 a taco I thought they were cheap...then I ate like 10 tacos so that's like $20 so is it really cheap?? I don't think so but this place is worth the drive down to San Diego because it is just so god darn good."}
{"text":"Everything I said in my previous review still holds true, but we go back here so often and the food is so amazingly delicious that I do not care at all where or how long I have to wait in line to get some! Definitely one of the most authentic food finds in Vegas. Try the adobada (spicy pork), it's our favorite! This place is golden and affordable as well. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Dos horas para poder ordenar los tacos, se hace línea para cada tipo de carne ósea lleguen al lugar antes de q tengan hambre por q la espera es larga."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos at a very low price. A must try for anyone coming in from outside of the west coast."}
{"text":"WOW, Let me start this review by saying WOW =O, Tacos El Gordo will get you very Gordo because they are amazing! I am no Mexican, but I can guarantee that Tacos El Gordo have the best and most authentic street tacos in Las Vegas. Yo puedo hablar espanhol porque soy brasileno y tengo mucha hambre! Do it for the Tacos, do it to get gordo!!! Tacos El Gordo is also the best hangover food!!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: The tacos are delicious. Meat is fresh. We just came back from mexico so we had low expectation for these tacos but man were they good. Their sauce is the best part.

Cons: Almost impossible to find a seat to eat."}
{"text":"Great place to get real awesome Mexican tacos!! They have it all from luenga if that's your thing to tacos al pastor!!! Omg so good."}
{"text":"Since I have eaten their tacos, nothing has ever compared! The best tacos ever!! I went back the following day to make sure the food was that delicious and I wasn't just drunk, and sure enough it was delish! Awesome prices and fresh food.. The employees work hard and are very friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The Pastor is legendary - that is why they have a separate line for just Pastor orders and another for all others. The other meats are very good - and they have all of the traditional Mexican meats, but that pastor - MAN! It is definitely pricey for small street tacos but worth it due to that succulent taste. Most times both the strip and Charleston location are packed at lunch so be get there early."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas, you must stop here!!! 

Conveniently located right next to Encore (and walking distance from Trump and many other hotels), Tacos El Gordo is a great place for a (sometimes) quick and delicious dinner. Their layout is basically identical to the original San Diego one as there are multiple lines for different meats. Once you reach the front of the line, tell the cook VERY clearly what meat and how many tacos you want. I say this with an added emphasis because my 8 lengua and 1 tripa somehow turned into 8 lengua and 8 tripa... After you're done ordering and receive your food, make your way to the cash register near the door and pay for your heaping tray of deliciousness. From there on out, it's your choice to bring your tacos home to-go or find a table to eat at. 

Food here is really good and hit the spot for me and my family when we visited. The quality is the exact same as the SD one and I was very satisfied with the customer service received. Personal favorites are lengua and al pastor! This place did not disappoint so next time you're famished and starving after a long trek down The Strip, make a stop at Tacos El Gordo for a satisfying and hearty meal."}
{"text":"Most amazing Mexican place EVERRRRRR!

My favorite food place in vegas and that's saying something considering how much good food there is in vegas. haha. My favorite is their Adobada Fries, it is loaded with spicy pork and has their signature green sauce on it. SO GOOD.

It's such a hole in the wall, the people that know about this place will go straight there after landing (with their luggage in hand). If you ask me, they got their priorities straight :P

This is a MUST GO spot every time I am in vegas and it's definitely worth trying if you've never been!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I can't believe this place has 4.5 stars??!? I feel like I've missed something. Came here on a Friday evening with high expectations as I was in the mood for some good old Mexican food. I guess I can say I'm lucky to have had AMAZING Mexican food from LA, OC, to San Diego and this by far cannot compare. The ONLY item that I would recommend here is Adobada. The other items I tried: carne asada fries (bland, totally NOT WORTH IT), and carne asada taco. However, I'm not that adventurous and they did have cabeza and lengua on the menu. If your into that then maybe those are worth a try! Simple menu. DIRT cheap and fairly clean. There are several lines for you to put your order. Once you've received your food you go back to the register to purchase the items.  After such a disappointment I probably would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Tacos de pastor the best marinated juicy yet crisp just delicious tasting tacos there is try them"}
{"text":"Tacos here are just okay. They arent nasty by any means but for the price, not worth it. You could find better for cheaper."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and have Hispanic family, so I love me some Mexican food. I was craving some bomb tacos and wanted to give this place a try. I came here with some friends and let me tell you. Pulling up to this joint was already a red flag, the restaurant was inside of a building that was previously a gas station. The parking sucked, cause they still had empty gas pumps in the middle of their \"parking lot\" waste of space. 
Upon walking in the place looked really dirty and unsanitary. Tacos are tacos so despite all of that they still gonna be bomb right? WRONG. These tacos were so nasty, the meat was cold by the time I got to sit down, when i ask for salsa they put a huge splat of guac on the entire tortilla and the entire meal was so bland. No flavor at all. I forced myself to scarf them down cause I was hungry. But 20min After I wasn't feeling too hot. I ended the rest of the night throwing up dry ass asada and tortillas. I would NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Although the LV Blvd location is now closed, I've now been to all 3 TEG's in town...and in my opinion, they are still one of the most overrated and overhyped joints in town. 

For starters, this location has so much potential and I just can't understand what they are doing here. From just Yelp tips and seeing the place by driving by, I know they've been working on getting this location open for at least 10 months or longer. If you haven't been here yet, this new setup is in an old gas station...yes, the entire gas station is now a restaurant. Well, not quite yet actually. Even after almost a year of working on opening this location, they only have a very tiny portion of it open. There are a whopping 12 booths available to sit at. TWELVE! And if you've ever been to a TEG before, you know it's almost always busy and can be a big pain to grab a seat.

That also brings me to my next issue with El Gordo. Because they can get so busy, it can take a ridiculous amount of time to grab food, especially if you want different meats or items, and if you have a couple people with you. When you finally get your food, you then have to move to what will probably be another long line at the cash register. Your food is likely getting cold by that time, and if not, it will almost certainly be cold as you're standing around waiting for a table. The whole thing is just one big mess and makes me dread going here. Other similar restaurants are able to make this process much less frustrating, I don't get why TEG can't do the same.

When it comes to the food, it's always so hit and miss that I just can't see what the fuss is all about. Sure, the al pastor is decent, but there's much better in town. Plus, unless you get lucky with someone decent behind the knife, you're probably going to end up with a portion nightmare. Every time I've visited a TEG, one taco is loaded with meat, the other has barely any, then they're drenched in sauce but super skimpy on the fixins (onion, cilantro, pineapple, etc). And on this particular visit to the new location, my tortillas were way overcooked and tasted stale like they had been sitting out a while. The onions and cilantro also appeared to have been sitting out for a while, and they forgot my requested pineapples...dang it!

While pricing isn't terrible, the tacos are pretty small and I can easily spend over $10 just by myself. But that's just about the set price for any taco joint, so no real complaints there. They also seem to do a decent job at keeping this location clean, which is a major plus in my eyes. But with what is just ok food and a frustrating ordering system, TEG barely hits the 2.5 star mark for me."}
{"text":"I've actually had this place in Tijuana and I was so excited when I found it on my trip to Vegas. Lines are ridiculous but totally worth it. Only thing they need is more seating but the food was top notch when it comes to authentic tacos!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Delicious, cheap, easy food when you're having a late night on The Strip."}
{"text":"Oh my Jeezus Lord! Tripa? Cabeza? Suadero? Lengua? Grilled Jalepenos con cebolla y nopales? This hole-in-the-wall joint is where it's at! I now live in SF and the one thing I had to let go of in SoCal was good Mexican food. So when I stumbled upon this place in Vegas, I was like oh, let's try it. And next thing you know, I was in the zone...In...The...ZONE! This girl was like \"Leena, I can tell when you really like your food...you're really into it and it looks like your really like it!\" Uhhh...yea! That was this moment. 

There are a bunch of lines so just go to the shortest one...I went to the older man because he looked like he knew what to do with a giant cow and a grill. Then you can speak to him in your broken Spanish and ask for errrything. I notice that the non-traditional folks ask for cheese and all but if you want it really legit, then all you need is their special salsas and cilantro. 

OH and I forgot about the spicy pork! So good, so good so good! I do like the fancy pants restaurants. But it's places like this where I'm like, why did I just drop all them dimes on that meal when i just enjoyed these tacos and they were just as delicious...if not more! ::sigh:: #foodieproblems

Oh...but the drinks...I would suggest either BYOB OR a bottled beverage that they have....I would like to go back though and try their homemade beverages but as you can see, with 2 different animals and 5 different parts inside me, I was a bit occupied ;)"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. If the tacos taste authentic, it's because they are. This company has locations in Mexico and close to the border. You should definitely get the adobada spicy pork and the carne asada fries. 

There are multiple lines each with a different selection of meats, so pay attention to the signs in the front, by the counter."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is a cheap and delicious alternative to typical strip eats. My bf and I tried the tripe, spicy pork, and beef shoulder. We loved the crunchy tripe! Spicy pork was also good. Beef shoulder was okay. We also shared a half order of carne asada fries. We could barely finish it, but we wanted more! Free refills on drinks is an added plus. We'll definitely return next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good al pastor tacos but they have this avocado mayo sauce on them that I could've done without. The red salsa is good though. I give it 3 stars for the sweet wait staff but the line is ridiculous and not really worth the wait, plus I had a tummy ache afterward."}
{"text":"came here super early for breakfast, so all they had was beef. i had one of each: shoulder, cheek, tongue and something else. 

was it a feast. the tacos are piled high with meat, theres very little room for toppings. with a splash of green salsa on top, it was super delicious to down. 

i really miss this. it was greasy, wet and honestly, a little too much. but it was so freaking delicious. i ate it so quickly haha."}
{"text":"Very good! I've had the steak tacos&avacado more than once. Get the cilantro sauce. Very authentic No glitz or glamour just the real deal food."}
{"text":"I've been back a few times and seriously, this place...is awesome! 



I can't believe it, how do they do it? Everyone who works here is so nice and happy. I like all the tacos. I eat all the tacos. I smile about the tacos. Thank you place."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town Hands down! I got the al pastor and carne asada taco. I must say...the pastor was THE BOMB and the best I've had and I eat tacos almost every week. The carne asada was good as well. They make everything fresh and in front of you. The handmade corn tortillas are delicious. You wait in different lines for which ever meat you want. They hook it up with the meat too. So good that I stopped by twice while I was in Vegas and I was only there for 3 days. Must have for all the taco lovers!"}
{"text":"Tacos are great but when you have to wait 36 mins in each line to get a different type of taco it makes you feel like your at a concert waiting in a long line."}
{"text":"Tacos are good here. Every type of meats have a tasty flavor. The lines on the weekend days are horrendous(long). Be prepare to wait a while to eat but food is good. If you can make it here during the week, even better.  I've been here several times now and it's usually the same identical experience. Tacos are about $2.25.-$2.40 each taco. Parking, same thing. Weekday ok, weekend forget it. Overall, good place to eat tacos."}
{"text":"Vile. 

You steered me wrong, Yelp.  El Taco Gordo is disgusting.  You show up and there's a giant flat-top griddle.  You have to go to a different station for each meat you order.  (Annoying.)

My asada (\"steak,\" in theory) tasted like little gristly chicklets of shoe leather.  

I spent the rest of my night cradling my stomach in agony.   AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best tacos I've ever had. This place has amazing quality tacos and I love that there are so many options besides just chicken, steak, or pork.

They have so many different cuts of beef (get the lengua, aka beef tongue!) as well as different spicy pork options.

My only negative is that it's really confusing to order from. Each station has its own meat so if you want a pork, a steak, and a beef tongue taco, you have to order from three different stations. It's not very tourist friendly - you just have to figure it out on your own.

Also they have horchata from a beverage fountain. I thought it was homemade horchata, but I was fooled when they just handed me an empty cup and told me to go fill it up myself. It was super sweet and tasted completely artificial. Definitely don't recommend this. Just stick with water."}
{"text":"This place has everything if you love Tacos!! Cheap tacos, great location, and the meat is great and seasoned just right!! These are true street tacos! This is no place for someone who is health conscious, no fish and no chicken (at least none I saw) 100% beef  and the cilantro, salsa, onion, lime.. just perfect. I had the asada and chorizo... delish."}
{"text":"The tacos were good but they didn't seem to embrace non Hispanics in their establishment. Won't be back waaaayyyyy to many nice Hispanic restaurants in town....adios!"}
{"text":"Quick tip: The line on the  middle right is for pork tacos only but you can still get carne asada fries there and believe me folks, you want those fries. 

Some people have acid flashbacks, I had a taco flashback to being 18 and partying it up in Rosarito beach and eating a delicious drunky taco. 100%, totally, undeniably legit pork tacos. I love that people say that the carne asada fries are \"really big, enough for 2-3 people,\" yeah or enough for one drunk person at 3am. 

We came on a Monday at 2pm and the line went out the door. Be willing to wait, your taste buds will thank you for it.

Twenty bucks will buy you four tacos, one carne asada fries and two drinks. Where else in Vegas will you eat this good for that cheap? That was a rhetorical question.

Last note: Leave the staff a tip, they work their asses off and do it with a huge smile."}
{"text":"Whether you're hungry or just drunk, Tacos El Gordo is a great place to get your fixing of tacos. It's located just past Wynn in a small strip mall with plenty of parking. I can imagine the line can be a long wait if you arrive at peak hours but we waited about 20 min at 11:00pm. They have one line but multiple stations and you just order at each station the food you want and pay at the cashier near the exit. Seating is limited.

Be sure to ask for the grilled onions and hot chili peppers (green one has a lingering kick so be careful)

The Mrs and I ordered abodaba and asada and they had guacamole, onions, and cilantro for an awesome $2.00 tacos each. I highly recommend this place and avoid the other touristy spots."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Lines were confusing just a bit even with knowledge going in. Can't wait to go back! That is all for now."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch this week while in Vegas.  I was inspired to go here by the great reviews but we have had much better here in Atlanta.  The ordering process was so disorganized.  You go in and the cooks ask you what you want.  Then, you have to go to the cashier in a separate area and tell her what you ordered.  The people behind the counter forgot a couple of things we asked for. We ordered steak quesadillas and an assortment of tacos. The meat itself was good.  However, I could not taste any cheese in the quesadillas.  Also, you have to ask for salsa instead of it being included in the salsa bar most mexican fast food places have.  The salsas also were not very good.  No heat and lacked flavor.  Almost any mexican will tell you that it's the salsas that make or break a taco. Also, the cooks were openly cursing which is not good when you have kids with you."}
{"text":"I tried the sesos (brains) for the first time. It was like eating soft tofu. The spicy pork tacos is where it's at. 

Absolutely simple and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is the worst!!!! The line was huge just to enter the place! When I finally got to order my tacos I was super disappointed with them! They have to be some of the worst tacos I ever eaten and not worth the wait. Taco Bell has better food! I will not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love El Gordo's! It's a close as it gets to eating an authentic Mexican taco."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best tacos around! This location has expanded recently. They took over the suite to the right side of them so it made my last experience less hectic with faster order lines and more seating. The outside patio has double in size also. 

Onto the food. Ooh...Mee...Gee! The adobada (spicy pork) is to die for, carved off a huge slab of flavored pork rotating inside of a flame roasting cooker. Every bite was bursting with flavor and the green guacamole cilantro sauce on top just made it that much better.  

If you rather op for something other than tacos then no need to worry. They offer other items on the menu like tostadas or quesadillas. I also love the nacho fries with either adobada or carne asada meat. For those of you that can't decide between the 2 then make it a half and half. Mmmm....I could just smell the food now. DROOL!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone who can speak Spanish ...and anyone who likes Mexican food . place feels authentic enough where I felt out of place but nice enough where I was able to order without being too judged.  FYI me and my gf was the only Asian in fact I think the only non mexicans there.  I couldn't really understand what they were telling me but I just said yes to whatever.  They have 3 stations and you just kind of tell them what you want. Portions are small but cheap so you just orders a bunch. The Mexican version of dim sum I guess. The place is open late but can look pretty intimidating if you during the late hours"}
{"text":"This was the first place we came to eat during our weekend getaway in Vegas just this weekend! I have came here before and I just fell in love with it! I had their carne asada fries, the large size, and immediately began scarfing them down! I didn't share with my girlfriend or our friend because I am just hooked on these fries! The staff there is pretty cool AND there was no line when we arrived around 10:00am. DO NOT come on Sunday morning du to the large line that will be there when you arrive. Small place but very nice there. This is the place to hit up for a late night taco or burrito run or anytime of the day. People, come to this place. You will not be disappointed. If you are, Ill personally buy you a couple tacos to change your mind!!!!!!"}
{"text":"MIND BLOWN!!! 

umm... yea... OK... so it's just a taco place.... NO!! it is like AMAZEBALLZ taco place!! My theory for all Mexican food is... the more ghetto the place looks... the better it freaken tastes!! That is WHY street food made from a cart is so delicious. This place is not the most fanciest looking place... but they do a darn good job keeping the place constantly clean. 

HONESTLY... the employees look angry & mean... but they are freaken NICE!! they just literally have no time to smile because they are cooking & taking orders at the same time... plus never having a moment to breathe w/ all the people they see in front of them! *bravo bravo * but once it slows down they all start to relax & smile... especially the third time you order from them... 

Three different lines to order your food based on what you want. I went around 1 am on a Sunday night & the lines were to the end of the booths. Everything here is made from SCRATCH!! Everything is well priced *as in cheap!* Pretty much the ingredients are all basic & similar... just simple goodness...

TACO DE LENGUA $2 - the most TENDER cow tongue that I have put on my toungue Hahaaha just melts into your mouth. Served on 2 small corn tortilla w/ salsa verde & chopped onions.

TACO DE ADOBADA $2.25 - perfect amount of spicyness on corn tortilla  accommodated w/ cilantro sauce, red sauce, & onions. You can also asked for grilled pineapples. 

TACO DE ASADA $2 - the beef was not as tender as I would normally like it but still good! Topped w/ salsa & smashed avocado 

CORN MULA W/ ADOBADA $4 - corn tortilla sandwich in a sense & adobada is the same thing as al pastor (something new I just learned)  =P  

FLOUR MULA W/ ADOBADA $4 - much PREFERRED the flour tortilla for the mulas. Such soft chest goodness especially when you watch them press the dough right in front of your face & then cook it on the flat top topped w/ cheese on each tortilla. PLUS I added avocado ... OMG de-ri-cious!!

SOPES W/ ASADA $4 - thick DOUGHY texture hand made corn tortilla  on the bottom w/ crispy corn tortilla on top & asada, avocado, & salsa in between. 

TOSTADA W/ AL PASTOR $2 - CRUNCHY goodness!! 2 crispy tortillas filled w/ al pastor, cilantro sauce, & red sauce."}

So supposedly this spot shut down for about a YEAR... & it was ALWAYS a place to get your grub on because it was 24 hours & this is where you go after dancing up an appetite at Encore or XS. So i dunno if this location is a bit bigger... but definitely a bonus that the tables & chairs move unlike the Charleston location where the booths are bolted down ahahahaha

The staff is just as quick & efficient i would have to say when it comes down to getting the tables cleaned & showing up out of nowhere w/ foil to wrap up my leftovers! =]

I thought that the food would be the same as the Charleston location... but it was different =[  I will unfortunately have to say it was not as good as the Charleston location.

1/2 AL PASTOR FRIES $6.00 - I wouldn't say i would order this again.... but it wasn't bad to try. I thought it was a bit dry... just not enough of everything for each bite of fries.

FLOUR MULA AL PASTOR $4.25 - this is my go-to when i eat at tacos el gordo, but i was bit disappointed w/ the flour tortilla because it wasn't as GREASY as i would typically expect it to be... me & the hubby assume maybe the flat-top needs a little more \"dirtiness\" breaking into. 

AL PASTOR TACO $2.10 - ALL-in-ALL i think the Al PASTOR needs a little more seasoning to it in general. I don't know why it would be so different from the Charleston location, but the flavor is just not as BOLD."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is horrible. 

I was here after I have been many times to the location in San Diego and normally if I am in line for tacos and a friend of mine is in line, whoever finishes first pays for it. 

Here though when I got to the front of the line the lady said I had to wait so she can count them. I told her I had 10 tacos total and I will send them up to verify the other 3 that was coming. She said no so we sat there. Eventually she took my tacos away and put them behind her.

Apparently she's afraid that I was going to steal their tacos. That's just not how you treat a customer."}
{"text":"The best tacos in town, very affordable, and tasty.  I thought since moving from Tucson  I was doomed to never find a taco like at Taco Tote. 

Confusing as heck on how to order but it goes as follows: 

The line with the pork hanging on a spit is for pork adabado. 

The line in the center is for tongue, brains, aka nasty bits that my friends who like their food a bit more \"authentic\" swear by. 

Then the last line where someone is making tortillas is for chorizo, steak, and probably chicken, but I always order the chorizo so no clue. 

The staff speaks English, but they move fast so if you want no onions, no sauce, no avocado (and you're sick if you don't get the avocado)  speak quickly and clearly. They are super nice though and remade three tacos after my husband corrected them that he didn't want onions on his pork tacos."}
{"text":"Excellent food and quick service.  Very authentic and savoury food.   Will be back again for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I adore tacos and I've traveled, nothing beats these Al Pastor tacos with extra sauce."}
{"text":"We came here really late and night and boy was this placed packed!  But the lines are self explanatory and they try to serve people as quickly as they can.

The food is YUMMY!  The meat is so flavorful!  

Best tacos I've had in all of Vegas!  Just be prepared to wait in a long line!"}
{"text":"Wow I thought I Would have never have eaten tacos as good as in Mexico I'm a cook from L.A. and these are better than any tacos in L.A. even king taco! They taste identical to Tacos el gordo from Tijuana the al pastor is beyond delicious and asada is amazing I would give it 10 stars if I could. Don't go to chipotle that place is a joke and it's beyond expensive! The only bad thing is that o live in L.A. and they are here."}
{"text":"Late night eats for cheap. Tacos, tacos and more tacos really help soak up all that drinking you've probably been having. The carne asada fries are delicious and I'm not sure why this hasn't caught on here in NY.

You just get so much bang for buck and after spending for all that booze and gambling, this is a much welcome reprieve from it all. It's a dessert oasis here, offering sustenance and a break from walking all over."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT EVER HANDS DOWN. I love them so much and as you can see many many others agree. This is getting out of hand. To a point where no matter what time of the day you go the line is out the door. Not only is the line out the door, it can extend 2x as long as the line inside. 

They used to have 2 kitchens in the restaurant so there would be 2 lines. However they have recently expanded the seating area inside and minimized it down to 1 kitchen. They did also shut down for a few months a few years ago. It may have some reason to do with why they took out their seating in front of the store and removed the kitchen. But now they are up and running again and giving the people of Las Vegas more delicious tacos.

There are multiple lines that once you get inside depending on what type of meat you are craving. I always end up in the adobada line. I have not tried any other meat since I've been going there and it's been well over 5 years. I should try more but I can't resist the rotating meat on a stick. Also don't forget to ask for grilled peppers and green onions in the kitchen !"}
{"text":"By far best tacos I've had. (except for asada tacos, all thought they were good I've tried Better) but the pastor and the campechana fries were . 

Will definitely come back to this place when I come to vengas again."}
{"text":"I really thought the place would be good.  We ordered the asada fries, asada tacos, tongue tacos, pork stomach tacos (little did I know that it was pork stomach), and al pastor tacos.  All I really enjoyed was the al pastor tacos.  Everything else lacked flavor, which was really disappointing, considering all the reviews.  I'm sure I'll be back for the al pastor tacos when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best value on the strip, clearly popular and for good reason.  Plan on eating big and getting big flavor."}
{"text":"Quality of there food has gone down alot the size of the taco you get is alot smaller from when they first started in Chula Vista Ca, taco's where alot bigger and full with meat and flavor, but seems like they reach there clientele so they did what most food chains do and cut back so they can get more profit! 
                     I DON'T RECOMMEND"}

                     I DON'T RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"I love these tacos. They are perfect. The other half and I ordered steak tacos and the Carne Asada fries.... Like they are from heaven. The smoked flavor is perfect"}
{"text":"Came to this place yesterday and it was fantastic the people at the country terms togoed our food and wrapped it with foil and then today came the lady was rude as hell giving an attitude then saying there's a limit to the sauces and then to top it All off, she said if you wanted togo you have to say it to the people makinf the food and instead gave me the foil and said to do it myself.. so much for tip !!!!"}
{"text":"If you're absolutely famished and have no other choices eat here but I would cook at home and starve a little longer before I go again.  Food was cold and plain and I go to LOS TACOS where it's a lot better!"}
{"text":"even if this place cost 3x as much, i'd still give it five stars. 
adobada taco was excellent."}
{"text":"There was the longest like I've ever seen for food period !! After mid night in a crazy hot weather I was in the line for almost an hour and the food was worth it, I'll suggest checking for  less busy  hours to go, so no one waists their time staying on the line for so long especially while you are in a vacation in Vegas !! Have fun"}
{"text":"Delicious food, reasonable price. The tacos here are to die for. It's no wonder it's always packed. The only bad thing is the long wait line but once you get your food you'll realize it was well worth the wait. Would definitely be back to this place anytime I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Got adobada,asada, buche and tripas. All we're delicious except the buche it was hard not chewy like it's supposed to be. Got fries for my little one and cheese quesadillas for my big boy. Delicious food and not as crowded as the location on the strip. Will definitely come to this location next time we're visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I put 5 stars because the \"  Buche Tacos \" are delicious be aware that you would have to wait at least 10min for them to take your order and another 10min for you to have a table . It's a really small place for the people they go there but the time it's worth the food . Highly recommend to get \" Carne  Asada Fries \" and \"  Buche, Chorizo tacos \" . Also , they would serve the cilantro and salsa for you not all the tacos go with guacamole so it's depend what meat you choose for them to add the guacamole. And don't forget to ask for Roasted chilis and onions ."}
{"text":"It was crowded with Latino locals and non Latinos like me. It was a cheap and great place to eat. I gave it 4 stars because the flan was AWFUL. No flavor. I could tell it wasn't homemade or something comparable. It must have been pre-packaged or store-bought. The rest of the selections were made right there, so it was fresh and yummy! The guacamole was heavenly! Smeared it on everything...pico de gallo is delicious...you also have to wait in a specific line for what you're ordering. If you're new to the place, it can be rather confusing..."}
{"text":"Came in at lunch time Got our 10 Asada and 4 Al pastor tacos. I Couldn't believe what was all the hype about. Not juicy. Teaspoon of Guacamole too plain. The hassle for $2.50 tacos. The taco trucks in LA are better. Maybe they're known for Adobada tacos. We assume all tacos were good. Left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Went to this taco place on a Saturday and was not prepared to see the amount of disorder. 

They have 3 different lines but only sell specific meats in each line. I don't understand how this could be efficient whatsoever. 

For example if you want carne asada and pastor you have to get in line twice, and these lines are not short. 

Good thing we went in a group and we all split up once we knew what we each wanted. Someone was designated carne asada, another pastor and someone scouted for a table to sit because it was so full. 

The tacos were good but I wouldn't say worth waiting and going through so much hassle."}
{"text":"We went to Las Vegas back in March, so this was our first time eating here. That first time eating here ended up being the only thing we were eating in Las Vegas haha. The Al Pastor is just absolutely THE best Pastor I have ever had and I am a huge Pastor snob. The asada was amazing too, but the fresh made tortillas for the asada was even better! I also love the fact that they have Orange Bang! I'm soo hungry for their Al Pastor right now!"}
{"text":"Must have when you are in Vegas and craving good tacos . Crowded but worth it. I always pick pastor"}
{"text":"Amazing food! These tacos are so delicious- I can't believe they're so cheap! The spicy pork fries are amazing. I'm not sure how safe everything is for those who are gluten-free like me, but I've eaten there at least 4 times, and only once had a reaction (could have just been some cross-contamination). This isn't the type of place I'd ask to see the ingredient list, so I know I'm taking my own chances."}
{"text":"This place gets 3.5 stars.  I've had a lot of Mexican food in my life, some authentic and others not so much.  The food is very tasty, 4 star in terms of taste but the way the restaurant is run is very odd.  This place is very popular and there's usually a line waiting out the door from videos and pictures that I've seen.  As the name suggests, this place is all about tacos done many different styles.  There's chorizo, lingua, Al pastor, cabeza and many more!  Depending on the type of taco you want, you have to stand in a specific line that makes them.  So if you want 2 or 3 types, you might have to stand in 2 or 3 lines.  It is a MUST to come in a group if you want to try multiple types without standing in different lines wasting time.  I'm not sure if how the restaurant runs is a result of popularity or based off some tradition.  The staff speaks little English and caters to Spanish speakers.  Indoor and outdoor seating is offered but it's a fight to even get seats(we were a group of 2).  Food is good but restaurant service is a mess."}
{"text":"Yea....this is simply one of the best places to get an authentic taco anywhere.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a try because all my friends rave about it. The tacos so-so, nothing special that stuck out to me sadly.  Ordering was kind of confusing because they had lines for everything. Although the lines were confusing, I though it was cool how they had separate lines for the different types of meat. It wasn't just one general line for ordering."}
{"text":"Walking distance from encore where everything costs a minimum of $50.  Food here was good and affordable.  Beers next door were 2/$3 instead of $10 at the hotel.  Pissed off transient camping out front cursing at diners who weren't giving him free food didn't add to the ambiance.  There was 2 security guards on site, which is telling."}
{"text":"Two words to describe this taco joint... Authentic-mouthwatering-delicious-up all night-dreaming of these bomb tacos! Oops! That was more than two words! 

Being pretty new to Vegas I find it really difficult to find ethnic foods that I enjoy. Most \"ethnic\" food joints lack authenticity in Vegas. Food is either to greasy or lacking flavor. Nothing like good ol Cali...but that's besides the point. I felt like my soul was set free when I took a bite into the carne asada tacos. Brought me back to the streets of LA. 

The carne asada fries are HUGE and made with perfection! The french fries are crisp and not floppy and soggy. Washing all this down with an ice cold horchata....a blissful intoxication!"}
{"text":"The tacos and sopes here are so good. It gets pretty busy, but they are super quick with the food. This is now a must go to place for me when visiting in Vegas."}
{"text":"Their carne asada tacos are so good. The customer service was pretty good but there was a language barrier. The cashier didn't understand that much English so I had to get someone to help interpret what I wanted to order"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely my last. Customer service sucks, the wait is ridiculous and the food is not that great. I've had better."}
{"text":"Listen, this place is just overglorified.
I've been to this location and their San Diego location and they both have been crap.
Not worth the wait in line and not worth the money."}
{"text":"2 words my friends, Adobado Fries!

They take a large to-go box and fill it with thin crispy fries then they start loading on the goodies. We're talking thin porky slices of spit roasted adobado (this seems like al pastor to me but hey whatever), cheese, sour cream and guacamole. If you're really hungry I guess you could use your fingers to attack the fries from the side where there are less toppings, good luck with that. I stuck with the fork and made sure to get a little bit of everything in each bite. Dang this are good. I'd like to start calling them \"Fuck Yeah Fries\"! 

After a night of tiki'ing at Frankie's this is the place to nosh your buzz into a more manageable state."}
{"text":"I love it too much here! Only downside is that it's so good there's always a lot of people but the wait is definitely worth it. Must try!!"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised this place has 4.5 stars because these tacos are probably one of the worst tacos I've ever tasted. The wait was ridiculously long, the service was horrible (super rude waitresses), and the food was ridiculously salty. The quesadillas are double the price but they're really just tacos with a chip on the top. Do not recommend. Super disappointed :( 





But the lollipops were on point. One star."}
{"text":"I wanted a burrito but the name tells it.  I see why there are so many fans of this place.  The tortillas a freshly made; pressed right in front of us.  I've only tried the tacos de asada and the flavors were bursting!  With everything on them, no need to add any salsas.  They were perfect!

Busy location.  One of the lines to the very right was long.  I moved to the very left and the other line looked like it didn't move.  I see they're separated by the type of meat.  Must be popular.

Service was friendly.  Tip jars are for the individuals.  Great cuz I wanted to make sure the man who made my tacos got his tip.  My order was neatly placed and wrapped for take out.  Upon removing the foil my tacos were still in tact and the foil cover didn't get them all messed up.

The parking lot is well lit.  I was hoping they had a drive thru.  It looked like maybe they did at one point.  The restaurant is also patrolled.  Anyhow, terrific tacos!!!  Yeah 4.5**** is about right.  Glad I got to try them!"}
{"text":"While in Arizona visiting the Grand Canyon I searched for some places to eat because we were staying in Vegas for the week. So when I saw this place on yelp I immediately yelped out and told my mom we must try this place. I was rushing her to get back to Vegas so I could try it. Good thing they close at 3:00 am because most places closed at 9:00 pm and this was one of the only ones open. When I got here I had to have some carne asada fries and a al pastor taco. So after ordering I sat down with my family to eat. Oh heads up the Jamaica drink mixed with sprite and fresh squeezed lime juice is amazing. So after we ate, we decided to just sit a little while and people watch. Well around 12/1 o'clock the crowd started coming and lines were out the door. After a while we left. But overall the food was good and the prices were reasonable. Will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas. Very good ambience. Loved the place"}
{"text":"Bad ! No Stars 

Very  bad the tacos not very good and the attention to the client is bad the cashier is very bad person. you ask the tacos you the give prepared of very bad quality, i believed that would be very good but in is fame and nothing more"}
{"text":"We went at 1am and the service was really quick. Tacos are delicious... even the cow tongue!!"}
{"text":"Tacos el gordo is Tijuana style street tacos- in my opinion the best! Every time I go though I swear I will never come back because of their service system that they have in place . The tacos are well worth the 1 hr wait, but the waiting in a second line to pay for them kills the experience. By the time you sit down,  your food is cold. At el gordo in Chula Vista CA, once you've eaten your first round, you can always ask one of the nice ladies cleaning the tables to bring you another round while you pay for it. But here in Vegas you ask for that favor and they look at you like you're insane. I go during the week now so I can get my food in a timely manner. Their best meat is the adobada but you need to go after 6 pm to eat it off the \"trompo\". Anytime before that and they will give you reheated meat from the day before."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. These Tacos are AMAZING. Like if you are going to eat at ONE PLACE while you're in Vegas... PICK THIS ONE!!!

The guys serving up the food are so friendly and will give you grilled pineapple if you tip them. (I know from experience haha)

It's a hole in the wall kind of place and it is always packed but with good reason. The food is unbelievable!!!

Make sure you order a MULAS with Spicy Pork. It is like a cheesy quesadilla with spicy/delicious/fresh pork and amazing toppings. I don't even know half of the ingredients that came on my tacos but WOW THEY WERE GOOD!!

Super cheap too. I would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"No hesitation. Five stars. All the way. 

This taco place has my heart. This taco joint is love. Tacos El Gordo, I can't hold it in anymore. I. Love. You. The adobado, also known as \"spicy pork\" & carne asada tacos on corn tortillas were magical. Granted, we are from Florida and aren't provided true mexican food very often -- but this place was on a whole different level of amazing. My husband and I were smiling during our whole visit to Tacos El Gordo because the food and service were impeccable. I'm glad we ventured away from \"The Strip\" for cheaper food. We got stuffed for $17.00 and it was one of our favorite parts of our trip to Vegas. Thanks so much for the amazing food. We will be back! We already miss the food. It truly is a shame that Florida doesn't have food this delicious."}
{"text":"Taco bout doin it right, and Tacos el Gordo does just that. I've been to the one in SD, and just like the one in SD, they have separate lines for each type of taco meat to place your order. My wife and I waited in line for over an hour in SD, but luckily, we didn't have to wait too long this time.  I'm so happy that they have one here in Vegas; I grew up with Roberto's Tacos, but Tacos el Gordo is on top of the taco game. 

The adobada is off the hook! They have a guy cleaving off the meat, and it just looks so fresh! The adobada tacos were so juicy and flavorful, best pork tacos I've had in my life! The green sauce also complements it very well. I'm not a huge fan of soft tacos (prefer the crunchiness of hard tacos), but the meat here was so good that I forgot I was biting into a soft tortilla. For some odd reason, I can do burritos but just not soft tacos haha. I also wish they served Spanish rice, because well, I just love rice haha. But fortunately, no rice nor beans at this joint. They do have fries and combination fries that I'm willing to try sometime. 

Also had a couple of their asada, chorizo, and suadero (brisket) tacos, but the game changer was definitely the adobada. I will definitely be back for those!"}
{"text":"Good tacos first time trying them... but it won't be the last time.. tacos are small but they have good flavor"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! great variety and everything seems fresh. Service was fast, the food was great and the prices good. You can't ask for anything better."}
{"text":"After finding out about this place on a Vegas podcast I listen to (Shout out to the Five Hundy By Midnight Podcast!) I make it a point to come here at least once on my trip.

These are hands down the best tacos I've ever eaten. So good!

My standard order is usually 3 tacos and a Horchata to wash it all down

I highly recommend the pork belly tacos (I usually order at least 2)

They have seating both indoors and out (under a tent) and as you can imagine, seats indoors (AC!) in the Summer fill up quick.

Tacos are $2 each and a bargain if you ask me.

Can't wait to go back and get my Tacos El Gordo fix!"}
{"text":"When you show up at a place slightly off the strip at 11:15 for lunch, and the line is easily 30 minutes, wrapped around the store, and out the door, you know you are on to something. The masses cannot be wrong, and they aren't. If I lived here, I'd be getting tacos here once a week. 

The assembly line moves fairly quickly and each taco is made, sliced, and chopped to order. I went with the spicy pork and tripe tacos. These little guys are surprisingly filling; don't let their size deceive you. The pork tacos were tender and juicy, with just stumble hints of sweetness and spice. Excellent. The tripe tacos are a little chewy, a little crispy, and a little funky. If you like funkiness and organ meat, this is for you. The fat in the meat almost gets caramelized to the point of it sticking in your teeth. Its some quality offal. 

If you are in town, come slightly off of the strip and get yourself a few tacos, and thank me after."}
{"text":"Authentic street tacos with tons of meat options from the standard carnitas to organ meats like brain. The spicy pork was amazing and the best taco I've ever had. This is a quick service operation where you line up in front of the station that is serving your taco of choice then you pay at the register. Additional condiments to are available near the drink stand. The sodas include horchata and cream sodas. We were there around 2am on a Monday and the line was very reasonable at about 10 minutes for both the tacos and register. They have plenty of seating options both indoors and outside. The location sits at the top of the strip just north of the Wynn and walking distance from Circus Circus and Rivera."}
{"text":"dang i haven't been here in years. but it's not as great as it used to be. my opinion and my family, that it was bland. the tripe was good though! but the abododa tacos which is suppose to be the best is not as flavorful and great anymore :( so sad."}
{"text":"We just got dropped off from an Uber and we can't get in. They said they closed at 4 but now it's 4:22. They should have closed 22 minutes ago. 4 am is not a real time

I just saved two other Uber drivers from getting dropped off."}
{"text":"best damn tacos in las vegas hands down!

go here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This a good place to have a small after hours drinking meal. The location is pretty convenient on the strip. When you get in, there are multiple lines depending on what type of meat you want to order. The lines get long especially at night. The best part about this place is the fresh tortilla. You see the cook prepare them right in front you. The tortilla feels fresh and warm. It isn't thick so you don't feel overloaded with carbs. The combination of meat and tortilla is pretty well done. As for the meat, I feel the best meat is the pork. It was splendid, flavorful, juicy and totally fatty. This is a perfect item when you have been drinking for hours. Unfortunately, I can't say this about the asada and chorizo. The asada was very disappointing. It was flavorless and slightly dry. The chorizo was somewhat better than the asada but similarly it is also dry. Another weird thing in my opinion is that depending on what type of meat you want to order you might have to get back in another line since each line has a different type of meat. Now the price is kind of expensive for the amount of food you get. Each taco is around $2.25 and it is not worth $2.25. I say at max this should be around $1.75. Overall, I would say come back when you want some good street tacos at night but don't bother during the day because for the price you are kind of getting ripped off."}
{"text":"I came here cause a few of my friends decided that this was the GO TO place in Vegas. Its off the strip but its definitely worth trying. I don't eat meat so I just had little quesadillas. The cord tortillas were made fresh right in front of you. I was amazed at the efficiency and the way they ran the food and cashier. I would go back 100%"}
{"text":"Oh...my...gosh...these tacos were DEFINITELY worth the wait! The second they hit my table, I engulfed them! The Al Pastor tacos were so flavorful. Many taco places don't do Al Pastor right but this place did! All their meats were BOMB. The salsa is nice and spicy and they even offer grilled chiles! If you're looking for an amazing taco experience, try this place out!!"}
{"text":"This has to be hands down my favorite place to eat!!  It's always crowded and you have to wait in long lines but it's worth it. My first time ever trying lengua and I was a bit freaked out at first but it ended up being DELICIOUS!!  I love the green peppers and onions, they compliment all the food so well. Best tacos I have had so far, I love this place!!!!  Just wish it was closer to my house lol"}
{"text":"Such yummy fresh Mexican food! The real way- I'm from southern Cali and this place hits the spot!"}
{"text":"This place is always bomb if you come almost all the time their is a big line but their mulitas are the best you gotta try those everyone is friendly the cooks are amazing and funny they are always positive when they help you and take you're order their was one cashier that was a B*%!H but she must not like her job oh well but I sure love their food lol"}
{"text":"They definitely have an interesting way of service. There are multiple different lines depending on the type of meat you want to get. So let's say if you want al pastor and carne asada then you have to wait in two separate lines. Then once you get your food, you go to the front counter and pay. 

I came in around 3pm on a Sunday. The security guards were managing the lines and told us to go to a certain line for al pastor. After about 15 minutes of waiting, we were next but the guy said he ran out of meat and told us to wait in a different line. We had to start waiting in a new line for al pastor and ended up waiting another 20 minutes. 

We ordered 8 al pastor tacos with pineapple for about $20. Watching the beautiful seasoned pork turn on the vertical grill was one thing, but eating it was another. The fresh corn tortillas are toasted in all the juicy drippings from the al pastor. I asked for pineapple with my tacos and I loved it as it added a refreshing taste from all the fatty oil on the tacos. 

Overall, El Gordo is definitely worth the wait. If you're passing by then stop by if you want a cheap bite to eat, but be prepared to wait over 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"My top picks are Mulas with Carne Asada, Tacos Al Pastor with the green crema, and the Quesadilla with Chorizo is oh so good! The lines are a little confusing but so worth it. Oh how I missed Tacos El Gordo! I lived in Vegas for 16 years and was only able to enjoy Tacos El Gordo for 2 of those years. I moved back to So Cal and recently visited Tacos El Gordo while we stayed next door at the Encore. It was delish, I recommend it all my So. Cal friends when they are visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I pass by this place EVERY day on the way to work and I've always been curious if it was good or not. My Dad and I even stopped in once, but the place was packed and there were several lines arching throughout the restaurant, so we walked out in favor of the Riviera food court, which is NEVER busy.

This time around, the joint was practically dead. I quickly found out that you don't go to the desk with the cash register first, but straight up to the counter in front of the kitchen. I ended up ordering the Taco El Adodaba (Spicy Pork), the Taco Asada (Steak) and a Asade Quesadilla. With a bottle of water, the bill roughly came out to $11 or so.

I am a VERY plain eater when it comes to Mexican restaurants. I usually am the person who will order a burrito with only meat, cheese, rice and maybe potatoes inside. These tacos were slathered with guacamole, onions and salsa. I did remove the copious amounts of guacamole, but I actually thought the combination of all of the toppings and the meat tasted pretty good! That's saying something when a plain person like myself can enjoy such loaded food.

This joint is a little bit different in the fare you would expect from a Mexican place as well. They don't have rice, beans or chips...and the quesadilla is definitely different than ANY other place I've had one before. I can only describe it as a small tortilla with meat and cheese in the middle with a corn chip on top of it. It was different, but not bad at all."}
{"text":"So I was with my sister and I told her I wanted tacos. She immediately took me to this place. They on serve tacos, enchiladas and loaded French fries. You have to try the pork tacos, it's on a big spin wheel similar to gyro meat. It's seasoned with pineapple. So good, so authentic. Never had tacos this authentic before. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I don't throw out 5 stars for a restaurant very often but this place is absolutely the bomb.  The el pastor blows me away.   Even the lengua (which normally grosses me out) was tasty and prepared just right.   Tacos El Gordo ain't cheap and it's no where near my house but the drive is worth it.   It's greasy, unhealthy, gut-bomb good.  I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good, the the long lines and the wait to get a table is annoying.  Also. $2.35 a taco is overpriced for the amount of meat they put in their tacos.  Their nacho fries are ridiculously priced at $14!!  As much as they sell, they can afford to be more reasonable with their prices. Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and is the real deal.   I am from LA so were are spoiled by great Mexican food.  This place has the Hardest working people and so friendly.  The food is delicious and so fresh.  Homemade tortillas, fresh grilled meets and veggies.   Yum!  Be prepared for a line but it is well worth the wait.  Best meal i have had in Vegas in last three days.  Also the cheapest.  Great value.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The lines are outrageously long BUT I now know why. The food is insanely great Mexican. We loved their pastor and lengua tacos. We also had lengua fries w cheese guacamole and sour cream. Oh my goodness."}
{"text":"When you first see the place and the reviews, you would think that this place is a \"Must Try.\"  Yet, when you think about it, the people lining up for this place must have not had mexican food in California as it does not meet the quality of a good taco or carne asada fries as some of the amazing places in East LA. 

I've tried the el pastor taco and truthfully, it was overspiced, and the flavoring seemd off (in comparison to LA grub).  However, the service was quick and they get tacos flying out to customers within less than 3 seconds.  The one thing that sort of grossed me out was that because they were working so fast and so hard, the sweat was just flying all over the place.  Yes, sweat flying into the tacos and grills.  Not exactly my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Authentic, fresh food prepared to order.  Note:  there are different lines depending on what you are ordering.  Be prepared to order when you arrive to the counter.  We had the steak tacos with \" everything \"  (steak, onion,  cilantro, red salsa and thin guacamole sauce.  

After ordering, you wait at counter watching your food being prepared, then have to walk over to another counter to pay and add drinks if you want.   Highly recommended asking for a side of verde salsa during your checkout."}
{"text":"My boyfriend absolutely loves this place. While I also love this place, I need to give an honest review and not let the delicious food get in the way of me looking at the overall picture.

During a spur-of-the-moment 3 day trip to Las Vegas, we went to Tacos El Gordo a total of 5 times, sometimes more than once a day -- Yes, that's how much we love this place. This place is so authentic that they don't even give you the option of ordering a burrito! (So if that's what you're craving, you're not going to find one here.) The meats on the tacos were cooked well and the combination of everything they put on it was perfect. They are generous with the guacamole and everything else, but... half the time when I get my tacos they are cold. This is because sometimes they will cook the meat in advance and store it in a nearby metal can and continue to cook more meat. This is effective when there is a lot of customers but cold tacos aren't as good as fresh, warm tacos! 

With that said, leftover tacos still tastes amazing so no worries, but warm tacos are still better.

PROS:
- Generous guacamole & everything else on the taco
- Delicious
- Great hours
- Fair prices
- Fast taco making

CONS: 
- Half the time I saw my asada come from a metal can and not the grill"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Came here on a Tuesday afternoon and it was slammed. The tacos here are made to order so it may take a bit of time. I knew this place was going to be good when I saw one of the workers making fresh tortillas on the fly. I tried the carne and al pastor tacos, which were both delicious. The al pastor tacos were definitely my favorite though. This place reminded me of when I was getting street tacos in Tijuana, way back in the day."}
{"text":"I've been to the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego as well, so I was excited to find out that there was one in Vegas when I moved here. I remember thinking that the adobada tacos at the one in SD were  great, and the other stuff was just fine (good, but not amazing). So I came to this one with the same mindset. 

Funny thing is that it kind of turned around. I like most of the other cuts of meat here; the El Pastor, Carne Asada, but my favorites are Tripa and Lengua. Tripa is a must. They get it nice and crispy, almost like chicharrones, and the texture adds so much to the taco. Lengua is really well flavored, carne has a good char flavor to it. If you want, the fries are also a good alternative, like Carne Asada Fries. Lengua fries makes it a little fattier and more savory which is also nice.

It's also close to downtown, so it's a great place to stop by before heading out there for some drinks."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. I don't eat why everyone likes it. Gross gross and gross. The meat is fatty, the workers are rude, shoddy part of the strip. No thanks!"}
{"text":"I go here every time I go to Las Vegas but they need to speed up their time on how long the order take because I spent over 30 mins in line on a Wednesday evening and I think the time was a bit over but the food is amazing and it's something you should try when you visit Las Vegas. I believe they take their time on making the tortillas handmade and the guacamole on top makes it amazing. I always go for the carne asada tacos and stop by 7-11 for a soda because it's a bit expensive their for drinks so I need to go somewhere else for that."}
{"text":"OMG, I'm definitely coming back to this place! So many choices of meats to choose from. The flavors of the different meats are soooo good too. I polished off 6 tacos and I'm loving every bit of it! The only issue I have is....... They don't serve beer."}
{"text":"These are the best, freshest tacos I have had in Las Vegas. It is ALWAYS packed in here and the food is ALWAYS good. 

I HIGHLY recommend:
1. Carne Asada quesadilla - PACKED with steak on a soft thick tortilla with lots cheese, pico and guacamole.

2. Buche tacos - pork stomach that has been simmered for HOURS until tender and highly seasoned. 

3. Spicy pork taco - cut right off the spit fresh for you.They also add grilled pineapple at your request. Excellent

4. Tongue taco - seasoned and tender. 

I personally think these are BETTER than most of the tacos I had in Tijuana. But the sign here says they are from Tijuana so I must have missed them. Hard to remember anything in Tijuana actually. I could have ate here and just forgot from all the tequila I drank while I was there. Who knows?!

This place is open TWENTY FOUR HOURS!!!"}
{"text":"Just even thinking about our visit here is making my mouth water... 

Wifey and I came here around 11 PM and this place was chaos... the good kind, of course. We got in a line for what we wanted and ordered our tacos and a quesadilla. The layout is super weird because you walk right in to order and get your food on your left, then you move over to the right where you'll hopefully find a place to sit... and oh yeah, the cashier where you pay for your food is at the far right with a line just waiting for you... seems like a total honor system. But at $2 a taco, you're a cheap bastard if you can't get it together. 

The tacos are small street tacos, however, they're also the closest to authentic street tacos I've ever tasted outside of Mexico. You just can't be disappointed here..."}
{"text":"There is something distinctly wonderful about late night food in a city like LV.  The insatiable appetite for indulgence, the unrelenting yet ever flowing booze from all corners of the town. With the infamous Tijuana chain Tacos El Gordo in the mix, the game has now changed ... for the better. 

Located inside of a strip mall just around the corner of Wynn/Encore, this spot is the perfect alternative to the spendy options of late night spots mid-strip. Folks who are familiar with the Cali locations should notice the mini-spike in prices here from .15-45 cents per item. It's still a inexpensive deal on the Strip and an even cheaper / tastier option that most tacos in NYC. I digress.

The late night hours from Thursday-Sunday is often their busiest times here. Lines from post-XS / Tryst crowds of drunken club goers crowd up this small spot. No sense in sprinting to Earl of Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas#hrid:rCEJrFmkm-Y5nNg1MhO7VQ) when the $10 for a sandwich translates to 4 tacos and a drink here.

A true San Diegan Mexican treat - the carne asada fries ($10) are the real deal. A mile high mountain of carne asada beef, salsa, cheese, and crema over fries is terrible for anyone's diet but delicious nonetheless. Tacos of all kinds - adobados, carnitas, de cabeza, orejas, lenguas - are superb in every sense. Vegans ought to look the other way but carnivores of the Mexican loving kind will be delighted with most everything on the menu. There is no words to describe the joy of fresh, shaved, carnitas on a perfectly grilled corn tortilla with a little salsa verde, cilantro and bits of cebolla, all folded to make for a juicy, super sabrosa bite.

I could go on and on about these tacos, but if there is any thing worth mentioning it's that the Downtown location (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegas) is even better. Orale."}
{"text":"This is by far the best in all of Vegas. Good food, good service, good location, good menu options, very clean and tidy.

I go several times per month for lunch with co-workers. Never disappointed..."}
{"text":"Love this place always open not far from strip and a must when visiting Las Vegas. A good place to go as a night cap when up late enjoying Vegas and food is very authentic and fresh at a great price. Locals will also tell you it's a great place for tacos after the club. Always packed but they must be at a great pace will always stop when in Vegas."}
{"text":"AKA.= The new Los Tacos

No, just kidding. The food at Tacos El Gordo has a completely different flavor than its neighbor, Los Tacos. Ordering your tacos may be a little tricky, but do not be intimated: The cooks speak English too! Place your order and then take it over to the cash register, deli style. 

I recommend the suadero tacos (it's brisket), my favorite. The tacos are small but tasty! They are traditional Mexican tacos. Two homemade tortillas, your choice of meat and toppings. I also recommend the tostadas. 

The place is clean, the staff is friendly and there are no vegetarians in sight! This place holds a special place in my clogged heart."}
{"text":"Great food!  Authentic tacos.  Get the spicy pork .... so gooood!?!"}
{"text":"WTF with the price increase?? Half-order of carne asada fries now $7, carne asada tacos now $2.25??"}
{"text":"LENGUA here is the BEST I've ever had.  Every piece was so incredibly tender and flavorful.  You can't even taste little bumpy taste buds.  I don't even care if you're scared of trying lengua... get over it!

Living in Norcal, carne asada fries here were a nice treat because they make it Socal style wtih fries, lots of meat, cheese, sour cream, and guac.  $10 for a huge styrofoam container full.  You can easily share this among four people in addition to your tacos.

Docking 1 star because the pork adobada gave me diarrhea.

How to order?  You wait in one of the many lines.  Tell the cook what you want and they will make it for you as you wait in front of them.  Then take your tray of food to the cashier, order a drink if you want, and pay."}
{"text":"Street tacos, fast, dirty (in a good way!), and flavorful.  Most people get nostalgic with their mom's spaghetti, fried chicken, or whatever.

Not me.  Throw me a plate of tacos de buche, extra crispy tripas, and maybe some sesos if I'm feeling dangerous and I'm blasted back into the past as 11 year old me on an LA street corner taco shop munching away on organ meats.

Would've been 5 stars if i was still recovering from the night before and if they tacos were $0.50 cheaper.

Bottom line: fast, authentic, TJ style tacos at American prices.  Get away from the buffets and get down on some buche."}
{"text":"Three star tacos, extra star for authenticity and prices.

The adobada was great. Flavor, texture, whole package. Not exactly spicy, but I liked this one.

The brain was tasty, but not on the same level.  Can't be 100% sure that I'm just not that big a fan of brain, but I do like some head cheese on a banh mi...

I thought the corn tortillas were a bit soggy, but the whole experience was good. A bit overrated on Yelp, but a solid taco bar.

Next time I'm going 3 adobadas for $6."}
{"text":"I came here at night for a late night dinner.  Man, living in LA where we have hundreds of taco places, I have NEVER seen a taco place this packed.  There was basically no room for you to walk around and the lines are long.  Make sure you read what sign for each line, because its different meat.  The best way is to have a least one other person so you can have multiple choices of meat.  If you ate by yourself you'll have to get in line twice :(. Anyways, we got the carne asada and al pastor.  I love the charcoal taste of the carne asada, but waitttt the al pastor was every better.  The al pastor with the sauce was perfect.  This is definitely one of the best tacos I've ever had.  I think I'll have to stop by the San Diego location, which is closer to me!"}
{"text":"The food is super good, the workers are very fast and even though it's always packed, the wait isn't too bad, I give it 4 stars because I think the tacos are a bit pricey for their size, $2.25 a taco that I eat in like 2-3 bites"}
{"text":"These little beauties are what tacos should all be: flavorful, juicy, and fresh. Get the adobada pork and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great, great tacos. I'm a big guy and I inhaled six tacos straight away. My wife is slim and petite. She also packed away six tacos and was looking for more. As you enter the restaurant you will notice three stations at the front counter. Each station has a tip jar(?) and on each jar is listed the types of tacos prepared at that station. We had lengua, tripas and cabeza tacos. All tender and succulent. Did I just use \"succulent\"? The horchata is from a powder mix. I can cope. The grilled peppers are fantastic alongside the tacos. Norteno/Banda music blaring. Stuffed bull heads mounted on the walls. Go with an open mind and a healthy appetite and have a good time. One of my coworkers asked if she needed a passport to travel to this part of town. Funny Anglo."}
{"text":"Easy to find, hideous purple building surrounded by lots of parking. They have  lots of options for tacos and we tried every single one of them. They only one that was good, in my opinion, was the al pastor (or adobada). The rest of the tacos were dry and salsaless....but the pastor tacos were juicy ans great! Its like they put less salsa on the tacos so people would buy a side of salsa in little containers by the cashier. I personally wont return unless i'm craving some al pastor tacos."}
{"text":"Totally overhyped tacos. The campechana fries were good and the highlight of our meal there."}
{"text":"I just ate here.  Enough said. This place is awesome. The food is great but the lines are long. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"By Serendipity we found this out-of-this-world place on our way to visit our kids and grandkids in Utah for Christmas and ordered the ADOVADA or Spicy Pork done on a Spiral, like the Greek Gyro Lamb meat and ordered a Sope with this meat to try... well, I had to order another one because it was outstanding.  My husband ordered the Quesadilla with the same meat and my son ordered a taco and a Mulita with Carne Asada.  Everything was ABSOLUTELY delicious.  Today on our way back to California we just had to stop and both if us ordered Sopes.  Make sure you ask for cooked onions and peppers in the middle and Red Hot sauce when you pay.  This is  WOW experience!"}
{"text":"Tacos and mulas were delicious! My daughter loved the carne asada fries as well. Can't go wrong with anything you order. We'll definitely be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"We got 2 chorizos, 2 Asadas, 2 Adobadas, 1 Tripa, and 1 lengua. The Lengua and adobadas were great! The meat was tender and flavorful. However, the other three (asada, tripa, and chorizo) were severely overcooked and burnt. Next time, we will definitely stay away from the latter three and order the adobada and lengua only and probably try a few others."}
{"text":"In Vegas, you won't know tacos until you come to Tacos El Gordo.

Well, what about it makes it so amazing? Everything. This is not a typical taco stand or a Roberto's that around your corner, this is amazingness in a taco. You start off going up to a different portion of the counter and ordering something that is specific for that portion of the counter. I have tried a lot of different kinds of tacos, but the most appealing taco for me is the adobada taco. The meat is cut off a rotating roaster kind of thing and if you are lucky enough to get it off of it, the tacos are even more amazing. Those are personally my favorite, and I'm sure it is popular amongst other customers as well. They also have an adobada version of these in fries, you know, like carne asada fries, but with adobada, and I perosnally think it is way more delicious, and so if you like carne asada fries, I recommend trying the adobada fries.

Sometimes it can get a little hectic ordering from the counter and it might be a little complicated if you can't speak Spanish, but you should still be able to get away with ordering still. The dining area isn't too bad at all and once you take a bite of the food, you'll be enjoying yourself. Tacos can run about $2 each, which may be on the pricier side, but still delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"When I came to Vegas this place got so much talk but really these were the worst tacos I've ever had in my life the meat was so gross I couldn't even eat them! Not to mention the horrible service! definitely NEVER coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Is it sad that almost a month later and I am still craving these tacos?  Why can't we have places this good in Indiana?  The ordering process is a little challenging, but once you figure it  out it's totally worth it.  These tacos are sooooo delicious and I want more!!"}
{"text":"My family stopped in for a quick bite yesterday afternoon before running some errands. My parents and friend had been here before and enjoyed it quite a bit, so they were stoked it was open. The location is very convenient on the Strip right across the street from the old Stardust.

The tacos al pastor were delicious, and for $2.10 each, they're a little higher than other taquerias, but much less than a full-service restaurant. There are different stations at the counter that you go up to based on what's type of meat you want - everything from carne asada and al pastor to sesos, lengua, and cabeza.

I appreciated the plate of cebollitas (grilled green onions) and grilled peppers that came with the food. And there was a station to grab as
Many radishes and lime wedges that you want! I don't often see Orange Bang in many places nowadays, so we were stoked to get some here."}
{"text":"I thought this place was goin to be really good but it's ok not the best I tried to over price for tacos u can make at home better salsa was not that good the tortillas were good other than that not impressed....."}
{"text":"Om om om... The only reason I did not give them 5 stars due to price and limited seating. But anyway, back to taco love land.. Amaz.. yes indeed. As you wait in your line of choice (each line has a designated list you can choose from of meats). You can order quesadillas, mullas, tacos, vampiros... with any meat of choice depending on your line of choice. As you wait you will notice fresh corn tortillas are being made and the meat sizzling on the burning grill. As you order you place your order with the man that chops the meat on the block and preps your order to your liking in a matter of seconds. If you ask for the everything you will get cilantro, chopped onions, salsa and guacamole.. mmmhmmm. You place your order on your tray and then walk over to the cashier, who they makes the count and charges your per item. She also is in charge of drinks, and if you want extra salsa (free) you request from her. As you head for the door to eat, don't forget to grab your limes, radishes and salt or pepper. As I mentioned earlier, depending on the time of day, you might not be able to find seating. THis is located in an older center north of the Wynn hotel, right next to some souvenir store. Definitely on my list of stops when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I heard that this was a good place for tacos, not true, long lines, poor service, food not that great. I will not be stopping here again."}
{"text":"Came here after lounging at Tao beach all day. Between my sister and I, we ordered:

3 lengua tacos
3 spicy pork tacos
1 campachana fries
2 coke zeros--you know, cuz we're trying to watch our figures.

I loves me some pork so of course I ordered the adobado (sp) tacos for myself. I thought they were really good, however I don't think they are as good as the al pastor from Tacos Mexico. The ones there come very greasy and seemed to be slow cooked amongst ingredients such as onions that you can clearly see on the taco (aside from the toppings). I love the greasy, juiciness of that type of marinated pork. It seems I've only been able to find them at Tacos Mexico.

Anyhow, my sister and I swapped a taco and that lengua taco on MY lengua blew my mind! So tender and juicy! I already thought I discovered the best lengua tacos in town (Super B Burrito) over by Eastern and St Rose so I didn't have high expectations. God, I love it when I'm proven wrong in that sense.

The campachana fries were delish with half of it topped with carne asada and the other with the spicy pork. All in all, great food especially after sitting under the sun getting drunk. The restaurant was very clean, as well as the bathroom. I can't wait for my next excuse to be on the strip so we can stop by again."}
{"text":"Ok. I really, really wanted to love this place. TJ style tacos? Yeah, my mouth started watering preemptively...but it was not to be.

I tried both the adobada and the carne asada tacos. The adobada meat was not very flavorful and none of my meat had even a hint of crispiness. The avocado sauce they put on top is tasty, but not enough to make the taco great.

The carne asada tacos were alright. They did not put an actual salsa on them and that would have helped a lot in my opinion. The guacamole was a nice touch. This taco also had a bit of mystery meat in it.

My husband also tried the cabeza and lengua tacos. He found them to be very flavorless.

They do give you grilled onions and chiles and they do make their own tortillas, but the tacos are still very overrated. Maybe we came on a bad day and at a bad time, but still, we've had better tacos.

Also, the line system can be confusing. Basically, you order different tacos at each of the stations."}
{"text":"I personally love this place for all your Hispanic food needs. Nothing like it in Vegas and I'm happy it finally opened up."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing authentic Mexican food at a great price.  I ant get enough of this stuff"}
{"text":"Great taco's! Our favorite were the pork ones. Great stop whenever in Vegas and post night out."}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a little taco spot on the strip.  A couple friends recommended this place so we went.  It was easy to find and everything was easy about this place. We walked in and there are menus in front of you before you walk in and when you walk in. 
Here's how you do it. You walk up to the counter, I'd go to the left counter because everyone goes to the first counter they see when they walk in (creates a cluster-f*ck). Once you see the Al Pastor (spicy pork) spinning with that chunk of pineapple on the top and bottom, your mouth should start watering. I ordered 2 carne asada (steak) tacos, hubby ordered 1 carne asada taco and one Al Pastor tostada. They put all the condiments on for you so if you are a condiment nazi (like one of my friends) make sure you ask for it on the side. I wanted it the way it came, with everything on it. As soon as you get your food take it to the cashier, order any drinks you may want, and pay. I couldn't resist the orange and pineapple bang!! As soon as we sat down I scarfed down my tacos like nothing, they were pretty good, Zeke loved the Al Pastor, it's his favorite and he said it was really good. Be sure to ask for napkins from the cashier because that is the only place you'll find them. There are no napkins to grab anywhere else, just from the cashier. Also, if you need to use the restroom you have to ask for the key from the cashier. I stood by the restroom waiting for someone to come out like a geek for a while until an employee told me to get the key. Doh! 
Anyways, if you're looking for some good street tacos to satisfy your late night munchies, to sober up, or cuz you're hungry for some... I'd say come to this place."}
{"text":"Just didn't do it for me... I think part of the reason was that I didn't really know what I was ordering and the staff didn't help much. In fact, the people taking the orders basically laughed and spoke in spanish to one another as I was ordering... and knowing just a few words I can tell they were basically talking shit. For that reason, 1 star. 

Regardless of the humiliating experience, the food is overhyped. I've had better."}
{"text":"Tacos El MF'n Gordo!

Best tacos in town, and probably best I've ever had.

Adobada Tacos are the way to go.

At barely $2 each they are a steal. The spicy pork, semi crunchy corn tortillas and the green salsa all come together to form the perfect taco, you can taste the individual fresh ingredients with every bite.

Get yourself a drink (horchata preferably) to wash it all down.

I got 4 Adobada tacos and one drink and paid around $10! Definitely a steal."}
{"text":"Amazingly greasy as FFFF. But it's too good lol. I don't know which meat Id say is the best. They're all too good."}
{"text":"Went at my brother's suggestion late on a Sunday morning just before heading back home after a trip to Vegas recently.

I wasn't impressed with the carne asada tacos.  The meat wasn't as grilled or seasoned as I like it, but it was fresh, so I'll give them that.  The avocado salsa was delicious.

They would have gotten 2 stars if not for the ... AL. PASTOR. TACOS.  Sweet baby Jesus.  They were incredible.  Crispy meat, perfectly seasoned. That alone brought the rating up to a solid 4 stars.

Not a fan of having to stand in different lines depending of the type of tacos you want, but now I know that next time I'm in Vegas, I won't have to bother with anything other than that al pastor line, so no biggie."}
{"text":"I've been here twice & both times my friends and I got diarrhea (tmi) even though I got sick from eating here the first time I had to come back because the alpastor tacos were so good ! But this second time around is probably my last because once again we all got sick.. Good tacos but idk why we get sick"}
{"text":"Terrific food, great service in a little neighborhood taco place. Very fresh, tasty meat and awesome tortilla chips and salsa. I will come back for sure! In my school neighborhood and on the way home."}
{"text":"After a long night shift of yelping and eating nothing but tasteless diet popcorn I got off shift and my hubby asked if I wanted breakfast. Of course I replied and we drove over to Tacos El Gordo and sat in the parking lot. We waited with several others till 9am when they opened their doors. (kinda sad but true!) 
The place is clean and during our visit the staff was busy milling around cleaning an already spotless dining area. Restrooms were also well maintained which was a good sign! 
Because of the early hour, the Pork Adoboda was not ready so we each ordered a chorizo & Carne Asada taco and waited for the pork to be ready. 
The chorizo taco was ok, the corn tortilla, made fresh before your eyes, was soft and flavorful. The chorizo was soft but not so tasty. I tasted more of the salsa and guac then the meat filling. The chorizo taco was ok but I wouldn't order it again. 
The carne asada taco was my least fave. They use the less desirable cuts of meat and the presence of connective tissue and other Non-meat parts was really kinda gross. 
Thank god the pork tacos were ready. They were excellent. The pork was slightly sweet and spicy and the cool creamy green sauce and salsa they put on top complimented the meat perfectly. They were so good we ordered 2 more! You know the food is good when you eat in silence =) I would definitely return and order the Adoboda tacos. The place had brisk business at 9am so you know the place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco spot in town. No matter what time of day you come here it will be busy, doesn't matter what location either. But there's a really good reason. I was told they had the best carne asada fries ever. I wanted to be the one to disagree but I couldn't because it's true. It's a little difficult to order because you'll have to know which line to get in but don't let that bother you. 
Hint: this place totally hits the spot after a night of drinking"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and so glad they brought it over from Mexico. They have 3 separate lines to order from so pay attention to what's on the menu in each line so you don't waste your time. I had the pastor, carne asada, and buche tacos, and an asada mula. Everything was delicious. I came during the day on a Friday and it wasn't too crowded but I can imagine at night thus place gets packed."}
{"text":"I've Been looking for good Mexican food in Vegas. Tacos el gordo has been recommended to me by local Las Vegas co workers so I finally decided to give it a try. 

Oddly, there are two separate lines for certain meats. My boyfriend and I Waited in line for about 25 minutes in the \"carne asada line\" Which was long enough so I didn't get to try the el pastor. Not to mention place was about 25 minutes drive. 

Let's just say I've had better tacos and quesadillas. The meat was a low quality, unseasoned, no flavor very bland almost paper like. The \"salsa\" was more like pico de Gallo and the \"avocado\" was a blended paste of some sort. The cheese in my quesadilla was not even melted, partially cold and topped off with a burnt corn tortilla. 

The tortillas are handmade and fresh, I'll give them that. But other than that, their operations are very confusing. Place was decent, not worth the hype. 

(Didn't take many pictures due to the fact that food was not satisfying) 

Ps, hoped this helped those True Mexican food taco lover s"}
{"text":"This place has been set up for organized chaos. There were 3 lines. Each one was for a specific type of meat. The line for the al pastor was the longest of the three.  The man was amazingly quick.  Made the tortillas warm, carved off some meat, scooped some onions, salsa and a guacamole crema. My sister was in line for the lengua. This server was just as quick and efficient. After getting our tacos, paid and got seated at one of the few empty seats. Started with the lengua. The lengua was not tough at all. Melt in your mouth amazing. The tortillas were full of flavor and the salsa was a perfect match.  Then went on to the al pastor. The flavor of the meat was great. The meat was tender and the sauces made it even better. The tortillas was dunked in the juices from the al pastor. Had this meal at 12:30am and I was already full but it was so worth it. I heard that the one near the Wynn always had a line for the lengua and the shorter lines were for the other meats. The location is a bit far off since it is in downtown but it is worth the drive. Definitely going to try to come back. Puts LA taco trucks to shame."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I'm so glad we resisted not eating anything while we were walking up the strip until we got to Tacos El Gordo. The tacos were awesome. We specially liked the beef tongue and beef head. Their asada fries are huge. We got a small one and we thought it was still big enough for two. The service was great and the food is cheap! One of the best fast food restaurants in Vegas.

{"text":"WOW. 

Coming here after a night of drinking was a life changing, food experience. Everybody in the place was Spanish, so you know it's authentic. Maybe it was a good thing that they started speaking to me in their native language even though I didn't understand a dam thing cause I don't want the Gringo treatment.

Make sure you get into the correct line. Go to the right for adobada, and the left for everything else. Some chica cut in front of me only to be told to move over (that's what you get, HA). All I said was \"two\", and the cook asked if I wanted everything on them. Of course! After warming the corn tortillas in some fat, He sliced some meat off of the rotating spit (the same kind they cook gyro meat on), and speedily added the onions, cilantro, and a green sauce. Spicy, greasy, crunchy, creamy...complete taco perfection. Hands down the best I've had."}
{"text":"\" the carne asada tacos and the adobada tacos are bomb here!\" \" those are the best tacos I've had\" please......

All I could hear from my friends is them talk about this place n San Diego.  How good the tacos are and what not.  They found a Las Vegas location and insisted we go when we got there on our Vegas trip this past weekend.

Arriving at the restaurant, the employees wanted us to make two lines ( for the beef and the pork meat ).  My gf said lets split up in the lines so we could get our orders.  We decided to order:

1 taco of shoulder meat
1 taco of stomach meat
1 taco of carne asada
1 taco of adobada meat
1 order of adobada fries

The employees gave me a bit of an attitude until they forced me to speak Spanish.  They gave me my orders and went to the GF to check on the fries.  She was still waiting for the order and said they were taking a bit long.  I talked to the cook there and he was like she didn't order anything and putting her down.  I switched back to Spanish mode and told him to make the order ( with an attitude ). If that wasn't enough, the cashier girls were giving my gf attitude when she was paying because they couldn't understand that she was paying for the fries and I was paying for the tacos.  Back to Spanish mode, put them down, explained to them in a way you explain a 5 year old how to do things because obviously these people came from Tijuana yesterday and think they can give customers attitude when they themselves can't understand English in the US.  Really pissed me off that these immigrants like to talk smack in Spanish when you don't speak Spanish.

Going back to the food, I had my eyes set on the carne asada tacos and adobada ( since everyone is ranting about them). I couldn't be more disappointed in the flavor of the meat.  The asada taco's meat was tender, but really bland.  I guess cause its so bland, they smacked so much guacamole on the taco to make up for the flavor ( which made it worst).  The adobada taco meat was really dry and no flavor either!  What was the hype about??  Surprisingly when we were tasting the stomach and shoulder tacos, we were like OK that's pretty good.  The shoulder taco was kinda like carnitas style with some of the broth it was cooked in.  The stomach taco was not all chewy and nasty texture.  Had some of the broth that it was cooked in as well.  These two tacos were the best ones out of the others, how ironic ha ha.  I think the brain, stomach, head and shoulder meat is all cooked in the same broth.  The fries were pretty good too.  They were thin, crispy fries smothered in some salsa they make there.  Personally me, that salsa was OK but too much on it.  Again, the adobada meat did not help the fries.  You might want to eat the fries as soon as you can or else they will become soggy from the overload of salsa they put in.

This place really did not live up to the hype.  Rude employees, flavorless meat and expensive tacos.  I would have given this place a 1 star, but the shoulder and stomach tacos managed to change my mind.  I would like to try the head tacos,brain tacos, tostadas and quesadillas next time, but I feel like it wont be for awhile since it would have to be because friends wanna go and has to be the San Diego location.  If the San Diego location is just as bad with the immigrant workers and attitudes they give, I will gladly say I'm done with this restaurant. Never again...."}
{"text":"This has to be the best taco place,  you can't go wrong with anything. The El Pastor tacos are so delicious.  The lines are long and you have to look for a seat,  but the food is worth all the bad about this place.  I will return no doubt about it.  Worth the drive and I guess now the even pick you up."}
{"text":"The asada tacos are my favorite. Place gets really busy and you have to get in different lines for different tacos, so go with friends! Very good food!"}
{"text":"I go to this place all the time and I always end up regretting not because the food is not great but it does get pretty heavy. Trust me I'm all for the savory and tasty food but it's either I over do it on my order or idk. I got al pastor tacos (fave), the girlfriend got an asada taco and we shared asada fries. And don't forget the horchata!"}
{"text":"It was for sure your local authentic tj fix. if you can't drive all the way south of the border...then here you go. I ordered practically everything on the menu. It was for me on the salty side, but I am a person who eats really bland. the service was quick, there are always going to be available seats in spite of the long lines. And---anywhere, no matter what location you go to, EXPECT the lines, even if its not 'eating-time' (lunch or dinner) they are always packed. I love that the lady-bussers are very clean and quick. the turnover of tables were very quick making the line go fast too, they are experts on what they do."}
{"text":"The food is so good that we ate here 4 times already....must eat it the proper way with the limes and radish..we are from Hawaii and never tasted tacos this great!"}
{"text":"Came here at 1am with my drunk friend a couple months ago when we were in Vegas. At first i was a bit confused on where to order and where to pay when we first walked in but we were drunk so understandable. 

I love the sign attention that they it brought in so it was pretty easy to find even at night. The taco quality was soooooo amazing and delicious that i even remember how good it tasted to this day even though my best friend and i were drunk. 

I can't wait to come back and try this place again."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty the place is always packed just be ready for anything to happen especially on a Friday or Saturday night it's wild in there, but its worth going to try the tacos."}
{"text":"This place is clear reviewed very well. We went with high expectations and we were not disappointed! You will wait in a very very long line. But we felt it was worth it. The Al Pastor tacos are so delicious. The meat is flavored super well. After 45 minutes in line to get our tacos, we almost waited again for more."}
{"text":"All I can say is... we're in Mexico. Authentic cheap fresh street style tacos! Lengua all day! They even hand make their tortillas right then n there. Can't get any better than that my fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"It was really good, I want here to try the food out and like I expected it was amazing. The only problem is the carne adobada has lots of fat and grissle which was no bueno"}
{"text":"Spicy tacos were fantastic. Carne Asada tacos were great too. Cheap eats and great quality.  The staff was great.  Quick in and out."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!! The food here is delicious, best tacos I have eaten in the USA!! Good prices. Tortillas are fresh hand made!"}
{"text":"Was not worth hype. Long wait but figured worth it but was wrong. You can only order your meat selection based on what line you choose. I had carne-asada. Fresh tortillas but dry tasteless poor quality \"steak\".  Came out freezing cold even though slapped together in front of you. Some odd version of guacamole plopped on top. 

So many other great Street tacos in LV valley. Tried 2x with same result. Will not go back a 3rd."}
{"text":"2 dollars tacos with a large selection. Ingredients are fresh. Open late, friendly service and yummy food."}
{"text":"My shortest review to date:  Mmmmm...GO THERE NOW.

Now excuse me while I figure out how to get away from work so that I can go there now..."}
{"text":"I had to do an update on my favorite taco spot in Vegas because of the competition that is popping up in the valley. This is my go-to spot whenever I have that taco jones a-brewing. I absolutely heart this place! I never leave here with a sad face. Why? Because their TACO ADOBADAS are the SHIZZNIT SUN!!! 

There are a bunch of things on the menu, but for me, the taco adobadas are the only things I will usually order. This establishment so far is the only restaurant that serves their adobada tacos (marinated pork) Mexican Street Vendor Style. The adobadas are put onto a vertical roaster and spins continuously to keep an even roast. They're then trimmed from the spit and served on a corn tortilla. IT'S SO GANGSTER!!!

The makings that they put on it are good. They'll ask if you want everything. Everything means onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. You can also opt for slices of pineapple to top your tacos. The slices of pineapple will give your tacos a sour sweetness which is a plus. I do wish that their hot sauce was A TAD BIT SPICIER. I think they need to up their game in that matter. Their hot sauce may not be that spicy, but they do offer free grilled spicy peppers that you can enjoy with your meal. Definitely ask for the grilled peppers. 

For some reason I think the East Charleston location tastes better than the one on the strip. Maybe I'm tripping. I also like the fact that you're in a restaurant where they give you a place to sit and have fountain drinks that you can refill. Orange Bang All Day!!! 

There is great competition out there with some of the street vendors popping up in the valley, which is a really great thing. I've had tacos at these other street vendors that easily gives Tacos El Gordo a run for their money. All in all, Tacos El Gordo is still my favorite. Great service, great food, and a great atmosphere to stuff your face in.

EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"}
{"text":"Unorganized bologny. I stood in line or what seemed to be a line and two people cut in front of me. Taco was good. Ordering system sucks. It was at a slow time as well. I hate to come when it gets busy. Sorry but that's my first impression."}
{"text":"Ay, ay, ay!!!!

These tacos are for realz yo.  I'm from \"La Villita\" in Chicago therefore I am a certified taco expert. These are legit. 

Super fresh (made right in front of your face!), tasty and totally authentic. 
I wasn't expecting much because honestly, Vegas has not impressed me with its taco-ness. 

They are a but pricey at $2 each but they are the best that Vegas has to offer. 

I tried the taco de tripitas (fried tripe) and a taco de carne adobada (think al pastor). 

Deliciously good and worth the wait to have these delicious morsels prepared fresh as you stand and drool behind the glass envisioning them entering your face."}
{"text":"At first, I ordered an abodaba taco, sesos taco, and carne asada taco. They're a lot smaller than I thought but so flavorful! The abodaba, which is al pastor, was sooo good! I accidentally ordered the sesos not knowing what it was and since it came out all white and mushy looking, I gave it all to A to eat and am glad I did since those are cow brains. I really wish they wouldn't just put beef on their menus and explain which part of it it is! The carne asada was just ok to me so I went back and ordered another two abodaba and a suadero, which is beef brisket. The suadero is super salty, which is just how I like it and I devoured the abodaba quickly. I got one on a flour tortilla for A but stuck to the corn myself. I usually don't like corn tortillas but these were so good! I would order a whole bunch of abodaba and one suadero if I ever came back and I definitely want to."}
{"text":"Waiting in line for tacos sucks, but these delicious beasts are so worth it! I'm salivating just thinking about them!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ive ever had!!!!! Superr friendly people ...loveee this place!!!They need some locations in southern cali tho...Id be there every weekend!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible they treat your worst then trash never coming back again just download the yelp app to put this up and so u guys are aware of this smh !!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible tacos Al Pastor. The greasiest thing you can have here. And I say that because the Carne Asada was just okay. Mostly flavorless.

Unfortunately the ordering system is extremely ineffective. Each line is for a different type of meat. They were so slow when they were refilling the Al Pastor station that I spent 1 hour standing in line, from the beginning until I ordered them. 

Inefficient system. Excellent tacos with amazing guac but lacked some sauce on top.

Parking is a pain in the same plaza, so go accross the street and walk."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is the best in Las Vegas.  We make it there at least 2x while in Vegas...would definitely recommend you cone n try it...its always  pack but they are fast to serve you n they always someone on the floor cleaning."}
{"text":"Really good Tacos!! I have to stop by this spot everytime Im in Vegas. The best Tacos outside of TJ. The Carne Asade and El Pastor are my Favorites!"}
{"text":"This place was one of the most anticipated places to visit when in Las Vegas. I said was because the last time we went back (July 2016), it was very disappointing. I was looking forward for their delicious adobada, it was not the case unfortunately. Not sure what happened, but it was bland and didn't taste as nearly as tasty as it was a year and a half ago. Neither was the grilled green onion and jalapeno. The carne asada tasted better this time though. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's took 20 minutes to order our food, but good Mexican food for relatively cheap price. My husband and I shared the 3 taco combo plate. 

If you're in area and really craving tacos I wouldn't dissuade you from going, but I probably won't be returning anytime soon"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really did. Especially after waiting in line for 40 minutes. I think they just have the lines to convince people to order more when they finally get to the front. When I finally got to the head of the Adobada / Al Pastor line and ordered 4 adobada and 4 Al pastor  just to have the guy tell me they were the same. Now I'm not Mexican but I have eaten alot of Mexican food and I know that Adobada and Al Pastor are not the same thing. At least not at all the other Mexican restaurants I have been to. But he didn't budge so I just ended up with 8 of the same tacos shaved off the spit. Then my buddy who was in the carne asada line said they had not cleaned the grill so all of the meat had burnt black bits all over it. And you could definitely taste it..... the carne asada was not tasty at all. The Adobada was ok but definitely not worth the wait. Oh and did I mention we had to go outside and sit on the curb to eat because the tables were all full.

None of this would have mattered if the tacos had just been great like they were supposed to be. Hell it would have added to the story of the quest for the great taco...... but this ain't the place! Clearly there are drunk people eating here and inflating the reviews."}
{"text":"Street tacos at their best. Touring Vegas when I saw the huge line. Tacos and a huge line means try it! Glad we did. Ordered Al padtor, meat was juicy and thinly sliced with a packed taste. The tacos resemble the original versions from Tijuana D.F. Their made with hand made tortillas and topped with onions, cilantro and amazing guac. Asada was on point and we had to try the Nopal taco. Delicious grilled cactus on top of taco. I approve these tacos!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable place! Authentic great tacos! Definitely worth seeking out to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Well, our first time here to tacos el gordo here in Vegas and we definitely were in for a treat. I have to say, the food here is top notch. Very tasty and full of flavor. The wait time was not very long since nice they had 5 different lines to order the different types of tacos. Definitely 2 thumbs up. Our definite stop over next time we visit Vegas"}
{"text":"BRUHHHHH.. If you know me, im a taco lover. I love mexican food from mariscos, tacos, tortas, tostadas, menudos.. lets just say im a big fan of mexican cuisine.  This place is legit as they get.  That adobada they got roasting on the stick with the pineapple is where its at.  This is definitely a MUST have when in Vegas and i'm not kidding.  The only thing weird was the worker that kept calling me papa, never heard that slang back in Cali but fuck it just keep serving me them adobada tacos son and we good!"}
{"text":"Wow! So delicious. My husband had come with buddys to another location and wanted to bring me and the kids back for his birthday. We were not disappointed and left stuffed because we wound up order more because it was so delicious. From the meat to the sauce.. amazing!!    I do LOVE me some chips and salsa and was slightly disappointed they dont have that but the rest of the food makes up the difference."}
{"text":"Super great tacos, carne asada and adobada. Homemade tortillas you can watch them making. Prices are awesome for Vegas and quality of food. Absolutely delicious, so glad to have stopped. Will be back as often as I can!!!"}
{"text":"Words can not explain the delectable scrumptious  mouth watering tacos this place has. Thank god for Tacos El Gordo on the Vegas strip! I'm a New Yorker and I didn't have a car during my stay in Vegas but man oh man was I glad I yelped this gem! 

Please head my advice, GO THERE! it's totally worth the walk!"}
{"text":"In a city of good food, this place stands out, which really says something. The constant revolving door of people is no joke. This place is more popping than some buffets in Vegas.
Food: Al pastor. Sliced off a huge spit of dripping marinated pork. Absolutely the crowd favorite. Warning, it is pretty spicey may not be sutable for young mouths. I tried all the meats because they all smelled so good! The second winner, the Lengua was nice and juicy and they give you a plentiful amount. Sadly the most disappointing meat was the Asada, it was the saltiest taco I've ever had. Maybe the cook had a bad day or an oopsie, but super sad because I knew the meat is tender and would have been delicious if I tasted more than just NaCl.
Ambience: Great drunchie meal, after a night at Surrender. Also great for families, in fact most of the patrons were families.
Price: Not as cheap as 1.50 a taco( they raised their prices) Still pretty cheap meal though! Around 10 for 3 tacos and a drink. Vegas food is pretty cheap so if your really hungry go to a buffet but if you just want a meal-snack hybrid these tacos will hit the spot for a few bucks you won at Circus Circus."}
{"text":"Do I really need to tell you how great the tacos are? Just get your butt in here and order yourself some al pastor and tripa. Be prepared to wait a long time during rush hour, so don't bother complaining. No one likes a whiner (I'm looking at you drunk Asian lady behind me in line)."}
{"text":"It was pretty confusing.  There are separate lines for different types of meats or fries.  Stand in the line of the meat you want to order and don't be a noob like me and stand in the shortest line.  I realized there were separate lines once I looked up and noticed that there were signs haha. 


VAMPIRO:  I ordered an asada vampiro. It's kind of like a tostada with melted cheese and a special salsa.  It was really good.  The crispiness of the tostada and the taste of the melted cheese is an awesome combo!!

CARNE ASADA TACOS: A safe choice.  And I wasn't disappointed. These met my standards and were comparable to the taco trucks in LA.


It's pretty cool to experience and it's pretty affordable.  As chaotic as it gets in there, they have a decently organized system.  Seating is available outside under their covered patio.  Parking can also be limited, but we got lucky during the time we went. I definitely want to come back and try their carne asada fries!!"}
{"text":"Had their steak tacos, unfortunately they were burnt and almost inedible, however the other times i went here i got their chicken tacos and they were great."}
{"text":"Ahhh, I finally was able to try this place out and it was soooo good! I visited this twice during my recent trip in Vegas. The food was as good as the photos I kept seeing on my Instagram feed. 

It's a different way to order your meal than I am used to, but it's pretty efficient. You line up according to which ever part of meat you want on your Taco or fries and order when it's your turn. They call your name if it's fries because it takes a few extra minutes longer to prepare the fries for the carne asada fries. I got the half portion with two tacos (one lengua and one al pastor) per person and it was still too much food for 2 people. With 3 people it was perfect. Their Horchata was good, too! 

Thanks for the recommendation Mary-Ann!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of tacos and I never crave Mexican food, but tacos el gordo has me craving them like crack! When I first tried them, my friends brought it back to the hotel after a long night of clubbing and they tasted SO AMAZING. I wasn't sure if it was because we were super hungry and drunk, but I tried them again a couple of vegas trips later while SOBER and they were just as good as the first time! There is always a line out the door here even if it's not after clubbing hours. They have various stations here that form different lines for different meats you want. For ex: Lengua, asada, etc will be in one line and al pastor, pollo etc will be in another line. This gets tricky if you're here by yourself because the lines are so long that your food will get cold jumping from line to line.

If you happen to be here by yourself, ask them to cover your order in foil before you hop to the next line. There is a good amount of seating here, but they are always packed. These tacos are a bit on the pricey side, but for food on the strip it's what you would expect.

Their food is cooked FRESH you can see them slicing the al pastor and chopping up carne asada. I seriously eat about 6 tacos by myself because it's so good! My favorite is the al pastor and carne asada. Both meats are super flavorful, you don't need to top it with red or green sauce like at other taquerias. HIGHLY recommend you try this place at least once during your vegas trip. It's located in a plaza on the right side at the very end of the strip past Encore & Wynn."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. There was a line all day, every day we were there. Cafeteria style check out was a little confusing but after the first visit you'll come back for more. Portions were smaller then I expected but a quick walk to the counter and you can reorder with speed!"}
{"text":"We all know how the restaurant closed for a year, but now its back!
Well that is about as exciting as I can make it sound because the food just isn't the same as before the closure.
There is a salsa bar and previously I never had to use any salsa because the great Mexican flavors spoke for themselves without any help from the salsa bar, but now there just isn't that flavorful seasoning that kept me coming back nearly once every week.
The one noticeable improvement is the carne asada taco in which the quality of the meat is much I improved over the previous fatty version.
The price per taco is now $2.10 so they increased the price by 10 cents, but who cares?
A feature that is no longer there is the huge red tent where you could dine outside and enjoy your food on the Law Vegas strip.
Also new is the armed guard that is protecting diners from attacking taco thieves and it's a comforting feeling to know my tacos are safe.
Who knows? one night there could be quite a show in addition to your meal, yay!
Bueno? no gracias."}
{"text":"There are three lines for different meats. Carne Asada tacos not worth the wait, BUT the AL PASTOR are worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"When you arrive here, you could be a little put off by the location. Don't worry, go in and enjoy! These guys are fantastic, and they really make you feel welcomed! Get the pork adobada tacos, infact get 3 and then add a carne asada into the mix! This place is the real deal and is as close to authentic as you will get this side of the border. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Gotta have the spicy pork fries, all the tacos are good.My favorite ones are lengua, cabeza, adobada and beef. The beef usually has the fresh tortillas the others are the bag ones. Always ask for the peppers. Top it off with orange bang or horchata. Don't forget to tip them"}
{"text":"bit of a line, but worth it. greatest tacos ever!!! especially since they are open 24/7. if you geat sick of the Vegas buffets and are fiending some o.g. tacos come here and gets some! they make their tortillas fresh right in front of you and hook you up some cooked scallions and chillis at a reasonable price. must go to in vegas."}
{"text":"So, it's my first night in Vegas on a business trip. I'm pretty buzzed. Nearly drunk. You'd think greasy Mexican food will cure your hangover. Right? That's the logic at least. Here. You leave with the same symptoms and you risk peeing out of your ass. Pardon me for being so blunt and raunchy.

The food is just--sad. No words to explain it. Dry, dry,dry. Some drier than the others. One protein saltier than the other. Salsa bar is on point.  Two stars for the welcoming personalities and rapid service considering there was a long line that formed outside."}
{"text":"When you thrash your body after a weekend in Vegas, you need some serious rest and recovery. The tacos here helped with the recovery. Cool thing is the tacos don't call apart before they hit your mouth. Everything stays intact so you get all the flavours your intended to get. Service was a bit slow, and the guy seemed pretty uninterested with the task at hand. Good food though."}
{"text":"The Al Pastor tacos here are MONEY.  Do yourself a favor and whether your down on luck or just looking for a quick snack, come here.  

This place is kind of far from the strip so be warned.  Also, the lines can be long, but it shouldn't take you longer than 15-20 minutes to place your order.

4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is heaven. 
For me this is a must go to every time I am in Vegas. 
The variety of meats for your tacos is just plain a cut above most Mexican joints. And did I mention their prices? $2.50 for most tacos!
The meats are cooked to perfection with your choice of tortillas. 
Love the fresh condiments. 
My favorite are taco lengua and taco sesos."}
{"text":"Tacos are good but lines are long and slow , the locals get to hop from line to line without being detected, while outsiders are force to get in the back of the line for didferent variety ot tacos, asada has its own line , so does al pastor and so on, they need to work on their system , but over all tacos are good NOT great."}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco shop in Vegas to get your after-club food fix. Their Al Pastor tacos are unrivaled, and they're Adobada Fries are a great twist on the popular Carne Asada Fries. The service is always great and the establishment is always clean. If you are looking for great tacos, any time of day, then Tacos El Gordo is the place for you."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever eaten. The spicy pork is amazing, as are the quesadillas. Cannot recommend highly enough. A diamond in the rough in terms of good food on the strip."}
{"text":"The best in all the land! Hands down!!! It's all the rave!!! More locations in the city would be great!!! And a drive thru!!"}
{"text":"Killer tacos!!!!!! Top 3 taco spots in Vegas, hands down! I get them to add the piña every time  only problem I have with the place is that everybody else knows how good it is too, which I can't complain about since im being part of the problem by writing this review in the first place lol"}
{"text":"Finally! a place to satisfy my late night cravings (other than Earls). This place is super delicious. The spicy pork wasn't like anything I imagined. It kind of reminds me of an asian chasew pork. I highly recommend the spicy pork tacos... and this is coming from a beef lover. Originally I wanted the carne asada tacos, but I've converted to pork! Only for this place, of course. The carne asada tacos are good though, but the spicy pork is better. Get the Adobada fries too! delicious! I don't know what that green sauce is that they use, but it's so good.

Inexpensive and yummy! It's on the strip too, just a block past the Wynn."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 is because there's too much kitchen smoke where you eat. Burns your eyes. Also there's separate lines for separate meats no good. Good food for late night drunken nights"}
{"text":"Their al pastor tacos are ridiculous...best I've ever had!!  Be prepared to wait though.  It took me around 45 minutes to get my food :("}
{"text":"Truly authentic!!! I'll have to stop here every time I come to Vegas & so inexpensive!!! I defiantly suggest that French fries dish (forgot the name) it was different kinds of meat and loaded with all kinds of goodness."}

{"text":"pretty good tacos. Not for those who have never been to a Taqueria and I think that's what this places I would have to say the food is really good fresh and hot. It's not your typical Taco Bell. But what happens is the process is much like a conveyor belt or kind a like a chipotle style where you go in order and they ask you what you want and they Kinda speak mostly Spanish but you could just point and Grant and tell her you want this taco or that taco and show them how many by the number of your fingers and they understand. And the tacos, about the size of like your hand. and are filled with mainly just meet I'm no real veggies like a full-blown in a Taco Bell taco that you're used to but they have some side condiments and onions and hot sauce and some peppers they can put in an overall pretty good I had mine on corn tortillas him they also have a gigantic rotisserie with spicy type pork with a pineapple on top that's pretty good I recommend that I think it's called taco Al Pastore. Overall each taco was about two dollars and so an average meal to be about $10-$20 per person. Yeah I would like to go back I think it's a good place to go to if you want that nice quick meal thanks"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times loved the place. It's a bit small and looks like it was either an old Wendy's or Carl's Jr. that was closed down and rebuilt into Tacos El Gordo, so the seating areas are that of a typical fast food restaurant.

However, the food there is pretty good. It's one of the best taco places I've been to yet and it's decently priced. I believe it was a little over $2 for majority of the tacos, I personally liked any of the steak/beef ones as I do not eat pork, but from what my friend told me the spicy pork is definitely one to try. 

The Adobada fries are definitely something everyone should try when they first visit or never had it. It's actually really good. But if you're not with anyone or want to have tacos and the fries, I do however suggest getting the half order. The full order is about $10 but it is something that is either a meal itself or needs to be shared with at least 2+, otherwise you'll have leftovers to take home or a very full stomach!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in all of Vegas! The Mulas Al Pastor are the best I've had outside of Mexico.  We find ourselves making at least one trip every time we're down in Vegas.

The ordering can be a bit confusing because you stand in a different line depending on what you're going to be ordering, but once you figure that out, it's pretty straight forward.  Their trompo is really good, and because of that, I have a hard time ordering anything else.

If you like street food, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Neat place where they make tacos in front of you. Very authentic food. The tacos were good (we had steak) but I bet the tongue, etc is what they are known for- we weren't that adventurous. We would stop by again when in Vegas! Reasonably priced food on the strip."}
{"text":"This place has the best adobada tacos!!! 
The flavors of the meat and the delicious green sauce that they have over them is to die for!  You gotta try them, you'll be back for more!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based on Yelp reviews. It was delicious!! We want more, it's too bad we're 4 hours away. FRESH meat & FRESH handmade tortillas. Only a few mins away from the Strip .MUST TRY THESE TACOS!"}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos allll day :')

I made it a point to come here during EDC weekend after trying Tacos El Gordo in San Diego for the first time last year. This location is off the strip and it was well worth the $80 round trip uber LOL. My cousins and I didn't want to go to the one on the strip because we knew it would have been terribly crowded during the weekend. Tip - come with a big group so you can line up in different lines!

As you can see from the photo below, we ordered enough for a village. I clearly eat with my eyes too....and ordered more tacos than I could eat. I tried lengua tacos for the first time, but it's definitely not as flavorful as al pastor and asada. We also tried the al pastor fries *drrooool

Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Man, came here with the family today. This place is amazing, the staff clean the tables immediately which is good because this place was packed!! We had the carne asada fries which was decent and the adobada tacos, the salsa, peppers and tacos were probably the best I've ever had. These really were awesome, it's no wonder this place is so highly reviewed. Looking forward to my next trip!! Thanks a bunch!"}
{"text":"I was a little bit peeved to note that they don't offer chicken as a meat option. Apparently, that's not authentic. However, I must say that I was quite impressed with what I got.  I decided to get only carne asada (and I don't see why anyone else wouldnt). The tacos are fairly priced, considering that they don't skimp on meat and do include guacamole with each one at no additional cost. I'm a man with a moderately respectable appetite (king burger and fries at Fatburger) and I was satisfied with 3 tacos at lunch time. They didn't stuff me by any means but I was full enough and my wallet wasn't too light either. The combination of the cilantro, lime, onions and house salsa was enough to satisfy my craving for real mexican tacos. If all you care about is tacos, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place.the food is always fresh and definitely worth the wait in line"}
{"text":"One of the best tacos I've ever had. I will definitely return. They cook meat in front of you. Add the toppings in front of you. They are fast. Long wait but well worth it. You can always ask for onions and chili on side. Best place for tacos"}
{"text":"BELIEVE THE HYPE

I have lived in San Diego and visited Mexico multiple times. If you are looking for good, authentic mexican street eats, Tacos El Gordo is the spot. Whether you are a tourist or local, you have to visit this place at least once when in the area. Located next to the Encore, there is free parking either at the Encore on in their parking lot (I visited at 1am, so parking was abundant, but the lot is on the small side).

What I ordered (you can ref pic in gallery):
- Taco Asada (Beef) $2
- Taco Adobada (Spicy Pork) $2
- Taco Lengua (Beef Tounge) $2
- Mula Lengua (Quesadilla) $4 *Flour tortilla, but can get corn
- Fountain Drink (Orange Bang) Free refills $1

I ordered all items with everything, as I wanted to try them as they should be. At first, the portions seem on the small side, but let me tell you, they are generous with the meat and it is filling.

Each item prepared fresh before your eyes. Service was friendly and very helpful seeing as it was my first time there, and spoke enough english to get the point accross. Establishment was very clean. All the meat was chopped evenly and tender. The various toppings complimented the corresponding meats perfectly. The flavors blending together were magical. If I hadn't just lost 95 pounds, I would have ordered another round of tacos, or three, and a few more mulas. Should have probably used a fork and knife for the mula, but it was 1am, was oozing cheesy goodness, and was ripe for consumption so I folded in half like a giant taco and went to work on it. I'm craving one right this moment.

Whether it is lunch, dinner, or a late night hunger fix, you need to go to Tacos El Gordo if you are anywhere near one. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am a Carne Asada fries fanatic so I just had to come here and try theirs. It took me 45 mins to get here because I live on the opposite side of town but the food was worth it. Their carne Asada fries are huge! I absolutely love the fact that they give heaping dollops of avocado on top. My fave!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I can't quite give it five stars, but Tacos El Gordo is very good.

Several people had recommended Tacos El Gordo to me, and I was excited to finally check it out. There are a number of tables indoors as well as a small outdoor seating area with heat lamps. The restaurant is also very heavily lit with bright white lights, so you will have no difficult finding it even at night.

As other reviewers have mentioned, there are separate lines for different items, and then a line just for paying at the register. Don't know that this is the most efficient system, but it's what they use. I ended up getting food from two separate lines. No waiter service. Food is made fresh so it can be a little bit of a wait. I forgot to ask for some pineapple garnish, but did get some grilled green onions and peppers (free, but you have to ask for them). 

Most tacos range from $2-4 a piece, and there are a few non-taco items on the the menu as well. I ordered a sope de lengua, plus three tacos (cabeza, buche, and tripa). I'm pretty sure my tripa got mixed up with something else, because it didn't taste like tripe. The cabeza was also a bit gamey, more than I expected. However, the tacos overall were very good. Don't forget to get some radishes and lime at the side bar!

By the way, they also have drink cups and desserts at the register. Once you buy the cup, you can self-serve your beverage at the soda fountain next to the garnish bar. 

Probably one of the better taco places in Las Vegas, though I haven't had many tacos here yet. Tacos El Gordo also has a location on the Strip."}
{"text":"I got the Carne asada fries and they were pretty good, some of the meat had fast and tendons and had too much salt or seasoning. Pricing was good and they were fast, much easier to go in if you speak Spanish. I will be returning to try the tacos."}
{"text":"Cool place to eat tacos made right in front of you avocado salsa is so good will definitely come here again and again"}
{"text":"3 stars bc they didn't have real fresh Horchata. It was just some soda machine crap. 

Cabeza rocked!!! Best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite taco place in Las Vegas but those lines be extra long. If you're in a rush pass it up but if you have time defiantly try some good fresh tacos. The lines are a bit confusing too. It took me a while to find out where I was suppose to pay. In all easily the best tacos I've tried in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I am hooked on the Vampiros. They are made by frying the small corn tortillas with cheese then filled to order. The pork adobada is out of this world and are sliced to order. I order them with everything on them, and they drip and drop while you eat them and they are oh so good! I have also ordered the regular taco but the Vampiro you don't see everywhere.

I have read reviews of people complaining of the price, $4 for the Vampiro and $2 for the others is a great deal considering it is Las Vegas and I am willing to pay the price to sit down and eat in an air conditioned building or be inside when it is cold. 

The location is in an industrial area so do not expect anything fancy, and they are beginning to add photos on the wall and the building has been recently painted. It can get very busy, so do not go during rush periods if you expect \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"When planning my trip to Las Vegas I did my usual Yelp scoping of the local food options. As soon as I saw Tacos El Gordo, I knew I wanted to go. Immediately I described this place to my boyfriend as the Katz's Deli (http://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york) of taco shops.

Just like Katz's, you get in line for the meat you want and watch as your food comes together. It is almost like dinner and a show. These guys are talented. Hand making fresh tortillas. Chopping and slicing meat. Tossing salsas and sauces onto the tacos. Those guys are good and they are fast!

I tried the adobada and asada tacos. The adobada was beautiful on the spit. The meat is sliced off directly from the spit into the tortilla. The meat was succulent and flavorful. The salsas complemented the pork well. The tortillas were just slightly greasy and cooked from the flattop. The asada guy was busy flipping and chopping piles of asada. Flip flip, CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP. The meat was thin and chopped well. It had a nice grill flavor too. This taco was topped with cilantro, onion, and a light green sauce. It was good but not as good as the adobada. 

The place was packed on a Sunday night. There are taco shops on every block on Charleston so clearly they are doing something right!"}
{"text":"Was looking for Mexican food in the area and this place popped up. Figured I should try it. I'm glad I did and after reading reviews, I'm glad there wasn't any lines.

I had the asada and beef tongue tacos and a half order of adobada fries. So good!"}
{"text":"I can not believe I waited nine years to actually go here. The food is 5 stars, the wait , the crowds  and lack of seating make it  4 stars for me. Traditional street tacos and fries!!!!!

Probably not the best idea to show up here at Noon on any day, but I did. Massive crowds and lines that took about 20-25 minutes. We made a couple of rookie mistakes, you need to be in the right line per the meat you want on your tacos or fries.

We ended up getting el pastor tacos and a small adaboda fry.  The fries were ridiculously good and the tacos awesome. It was so crowded we just decided to get it to go and took it downtown to the Container Park for a mid day picnic.  

This place could easily triple in size and still be SRO, the food is absolutely great."}
{"text":"Great tacos but they've been closed in the middle of the day on more than one occasion mid week. One would think that lunch rush would be a good time to make money for an eatery."}
{"text":"A great tacos place. Just like TJ and street tacos. Good price. Great taste. Good variety.  On the strip."}
{"text":"Love this place. I moved to Las Vegas 3 years ago and remember eating the best tacos at tacos el gordo in TJ and San Diego, and had not been able to find good tacos out here. However, when I realize that had tacos el gordo here I decided to give them a try and so glad I have. They are just like the real thing. A little more expensive that other taco places but so worth it. It worth the commute as well cuz I live in north las vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to the TEG in Chula Vista, their first in San Diego. This location is more expensive I think? I remember paying less than $2 per taco. Same set up as the CV one but not as clean... And since its in Vegas, def weirder crowd? We went to this location just before midnight and the lines were super long! Since there was only 2 of us, we decided to get carne asada tacos and al pastor. No onions and sauce on the side is how I order my tacos, otherwise you get a ton and very over powering onions and too much salsa to the point that you can't taste your meats. I've definitely had better street style tacos but TEG is a good option since my fave place is only located in Anaheim and Orange County area. 

Divide and conquer... Or be prepared to wait. 3-4 different lines depending on the type of meats you want + a line to pay."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place. Been here a million times and everything is delicious! Everydamnthang! Adobada with that extra pineapple, head tacos, fries..."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad never will give a good review if the service is not good how you can retain customers if I waited to get myselection of tacos from different lines and when I got to my so delicious tacos they are cold and the grease that could be ok is cold white on the plate you definily need a organization if you change it it could be better than king taco but...........not yet."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had.   Split lines for meats makes it almost impossible to order multiple items unless you're with another person or group to strategically plan it out.   Can get crowded on the weekends, but totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Walking down the strip in Vegas we were hot and hungry. Saw this little place with a line out the door and thought that's it! Everything is made right in front of you - fresh tortillas, charred jalapenos, all the meats grilling. I got the asada, spicy pork, pork, and beef tongue tacos. My favorite was the spicy pork - they cut it off this huge spit that looks like shawarma. Delicious."}
{"text":"The best tacos in the area hands down! You can tell by the line this place is good and definitely worth the wait. The green sauce they put on the spicy pork tacos is out of this world good! I cant give this place enough stars!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I don't usually rate places but I do give credit when credit is due. I came here and ended up overindulging and ate 7 tacos and loved every bite. This has now become a must stop spot for me whenever I'm in town. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. The line was not so bad when I went, but worth the wait. Delicious food at a very reasonable price, and it's fun to watch for its creation. Quite a quick snack."}
{"text":"I'm 100% Mexican n tasted tacos in Mexico many years BUT this place is for sure the best or the closest to the best al pastor tacos I Eva tried !!!!!!!
I been trying for months to find al pastor tacos like this restaurant in Chicago but nothing so far
If I Eva go back to Las Vegas 
Which btw I went to the chef Ramsay restaurant n tried his $70 steak which was good 
But Idk man 
The al pastor tacos in here are kinda close to that steak I had"}
{"text":"The tacos are disgusting. They are greasy and full of fat. I can't believe so many people would rate this with positive reviews. Its a disappointment to real Mexican tacos. Tacos el Gordo needs to start over. I'll never eat this junk again. Gross!"}
{"text":"I tried Tacos El Gordo in anticipation of a great, quick meal through the rave reviews on Yelp. I'm not one for cow tongue, brain, eyeballs, intestines or any other functional organ. So naturally a wait of over 15 minutes in a very confusing system, (half of the menu is ordered in one line and half in the other) I lost my appetite. 

When I finally got my vegetarian quesadilla the only thing I was tasting subconsciously were the cow parts. Egh. 

They do offer some rad flavours in their soda fountain like tamarind, vanilla and some tropical fruits. The prices are also pretty fantastic so I'd recommend this to those who love their meat. It's just not for me."}
{"text":"Can't talk about customer service because hubby and his cousins went to but the tacos and brought them to the hotel room but I can say that they were BOMB!!! So good we were all complaining because we didn't get more. Definitely coming back every time we go to Vegas"}
{"text":"The tacos are good but this place is a fucking chaotic mess. I'm not from here and have never been so I didn't know what I wanted already which is a sin I guess. Pass."}
{"text":"If you are drunk on a late night and want greasy mexican food, this is the place to go!!! food is fast and fatty. Large variety of food and drinks. You can sit inside, and get a taxi when you done. 

Fast, cheap, and good, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"First time trying the infamous taco joint everyone has been reviewing about. Fair warning if it's your first time and Spanish is not under your belt, Good luck ordering your meal. I had a tough time figuring out what's really going on. They have three super are sections to order your meats so I made that mistake in ordering everyone in one section. Thankfully they called over someone who spoke English and helped me order my tacos. 

When I finally order and sat down with my tacos I noticed I didn't get one of my orders. My fault for not knowing Spanish. They serve everything super fast, faster than fast food. 

Beef tongue, steak and the spicy pork were my choices today. Honestly the beef tongue was my favorite of the three. Still can't believe I tried it ! Sounds gross but it was super soft and didn't resemble anything like a tongue. Highly recommend ya to try it."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, because of my love for Mexican food and because it was midnight. El hubby and I decided to come eat here.  Unfortunately we were too excited to dig in and forgot to take pictures.  I do have a pic of our receipt and for 2 this is dirt cheap.  Not only was this dirt cheap it was soooo good.  Everything had a lot of flavour.  The only thing was when we got here we were a little overwhelmed and a bit confused until the security guard instructed us that you have to order at different counters depending on what you want.  Then you have to go to the cashier and pay, kinda like cafeteria style.  Overall I highly recommend this place for any time of day."}
{"text":"Want real Mexican tacos hundreds of miles from the borders?  Want them at almost any hour?  Tacos El Gordo is as legit as they come for \"Tijuana style\" tacos.

After a 15 minute wait and $120 later, eight (8) of us had probably our best Vegas meal at 5:00AM after a night of wayyyyyy too much alcohol.  We had tacos de carne asada, adobada and my personal favorite...mulas.  They were all fantastic, and while the prices are a little high, you are on the strip and they are open until the wee hours of the morning.  I would gladly pay $3 a taco for carne asada deliciousness at those hours. 

I will say that the San Diego locations have disappointed me the past couple times I have been there, but this one hit the spot in so many good ways.  I will come back again and again, as any Vegas weekend with tacos in the morning hours is always a good night!"}
{"text":"Authentic street style Mexican tacos in brick and mortar.  All the right fixin's, nothing fancy, and damn good! Be sure to get the roasted peppers and green onions-included in the price of the tacos. 

I love fusion food, exotic flavor combos, and fancy chefs, but nothing beats a simple and awesome street taco. 

The cashier was gracious and explained some unfamiliar items. Stations are broken down by meats, pay at the end. We ordered 8 tacos, different meats because I just couldn't decide. The fries are huge (we got a small) and that alone could have fed us.

Great food, great prices."}
{"text":"Food was great! As we got there we saw huge lines and thought \"oh boy, this is gonna take a while\" but to our surprise, line was moving fast and we got to order before we knew it. Only thing I recommend for them to add, is hot sauces.. maybe where they have the limes. You can't have tacos and no hot sauce. But over all it was great. 8 tacos and a drink for $22."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.. Kind of weird, as I'm from SoCal where Mexican food is aplenty.. But in a world of lavish entertainment, ridiculously expensive meals, and extravagant sights, it's sometimes nice to just hit up a homely place.

If you're expecting amazing Food Network quality eats at a downtown cart price, you're looking at the wrong place. It's just a nice little gem in Vegas.. If it were in SoCal, it'd just be a common marble."}
{"text":"Lines are ridiculous.  You will have to wait no matter what.  It gets confusing which lines are for what when you're in the mix. 

I don't remember which meat is the one that I always get.  I think it might be pastor.  One of my friends mentioned that it tastes like char siu, and I think it kinda does.  But anyway, tacos here are delicious and flavorful.  Don't forget to ask for pineapple and them green onions. 

And the strawberry bang here is awesome.  My first time ever having any \"bang\" related beverage was here and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my tacos de asada they were very salty! I added lemon and nope still salty. My gf on the other hand loved the apastor tacos! So get those instead of the asada"}
{"text":"So me and my husband love to go to this place whenever we go to  las vegas the tacos are so good . If u are looking for a please to eat tacos in Las Vegas this is the place to eat but let me let you know the lines are so long and you will be waiting about 30 minutes to get your tacos !!! That's is the only bad thing and the place is to small for the amount of people that eat there. They need to be Moore organize if they work on that i would have giving it a 5 star other than that the food is so amazing  and delicious. !!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Service tho... Really need to be improve. The guy on charge to make the Adobada fries was rude, I had an special request and he called me abnormal WTF?? After all he did not make my special order the way I asked for and told me that I will have to get in line to get another fries. 

Great food. 
Horrible service -0"}
{"text":"The food is great and very authentic. The only thing I didn't love about this restaurant was the lack of direction on ordering the tacos. We got into what we thought was the line but it was only the line for the steak tacos. I wanted to try a couple of varieties but could not. I loved the limes that you could get from the condiment area. There were radishes and onions(?) there too. We would definitely return to try other tacos."}
{"text":"Best taco shop in Vegas! Only issue here it's always so busy but well worth the wait. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Yum yum and more yum. Can't go wrong with spicy pork tacos here! Tacos are authentic here. Gets pretty crowded but the lines go pretty quick! Everyone wants to chow down on some tacos after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Best place ever, they're ordering kinda sucks but well worth it. Asada fries are bomb. It was so good we went nack the second day we were there.

Bomb.com"}
{"text":"Definitely overrated. I ask you, how can you claim you make good Mexican food (supposedly full of flavor and spices) and you can't even be bothered to put a little salt in the guac? Everything I've ever tried here is so BLAND!

The only redeeming thing about this place is when you see the little, old Mexican ladies making the tortillas in front of you. Having said that, I grew up on the Texas/Mexico border. Every taco shop on the border does that.

Don't get me wrong. The tacos here aren't awful, but they're certainly not worthy of four or even three stars. My guess is that most of the people who gave this place a good rating were a little drunk when they ate the food.) The location is two seconds from Wynn.) If you're sober and want good tacos, go somewhere else. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I dislike Mexican food. Or at least I did before my friend dragged me here.

It was life changing and is one of my must stops whenever I'm in Vegas. The lines are long so be prepared to wait, but it's definitely worth it. Hey cook the meat in front of you and there's zero doubt about how fresh it is.

The Star is the Al Pastor meat (pork marinated with pineapples and then cooked while it's spinning around a flame.) so so so flavorful and good on fries or in taco form.

Come here and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"SECURITY GUARD AT DOOR HAD THE WORST ATTITUDE!!!! So I went a couple weeks ago & started out by sitting at a table which I had to wait for while my husband was standing in line. Security had told me I couldn't drink my alcoholic beverage on property which I understood & didn't have any complaints even tho there were others drinking near me on the tables but I didn't say anything,  the security guard then started giving attitude to the people in front of my husband by putting her hand up as in motion to stop & said in a rude voice \"You know which line your going in?, cause you know there are different lines & I need to know that you know where your going!\" When they were confused she smirked and said \"ya there's different lines & you don't know where your going!\".... This girl straight up thought she was a cop! Anyways it was our turn & before she said anything my husband said \"just letting you know,  there are other people drinking on the tables not fair you singled out my wife!\" She replied \"one problem at time!\" With again her hand up in a stop motion... I told him just let it go... anyways, with an attitude she told us which lines we needed to go in since we wanted different meats & I have never heard of such a thing so to make sure I understood her I asked \"so we need to go in 2 different lines cause we want different meats?\" She replied \"ya you guys are making it hard cause you guys want different meats!\" I said \"No! You guys are making it hard by making so many different lines!\" You should really work on your people skills cause you have an attitude!\" She responded laughing & said \"really??? This is the 1st time I've heard someone tell me that! I said \"I find that hard to believe!, you need to remember your not a real cop your just a rent a cop!\" She responded by saying \"how do you know i'm not a real cop!\" I said \"well if you were then you are abusing your authority which you just want me to think you are to scare me\" then she turned & said something under her breath which I didn't hear but my husband did & she said \"that's what happens when you drink too much!\" Which btw I was no where near drunk! Lol if I was I would have had no self control & she would have been on the floor!!! Anyways my husband said let's go after he heard what she said & he told me after we left what she said cause he knows there would have been problems! Lol so sad to say I didn't even eat here cause security guard chased us away,  other customers saw when I walked out & was like don't let her chase you away just ignore her but no! I'm not going to spend my money where there are people that hate their job & need an attitude adjustment!!!! SHE IS CLEARLY tired of explaining the situation of the lines & it is clear THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT JOB FOR HER! She needs to be fired!!!.... I would give it another try if I didn't see her at the front door!!"}
{"text":"My bf and I ate here yesterday. First I would like to mention the seating is very limited and be prepared to wait....I was in line for 30 min!! They have three different lines where you order different kinds of meat or so that's how it appears. Little did we know that you can pretty much get in any line and order whatever you want. They should make that clear because it can be somewhat confusing. Anyhow once we finally got all our tacos they were good, the adobada, tripa and taco azteca were my favorite. They did in fact taste like TJ tacos. A bit pricey though, typically a taco runs you about $1.00-$1.50 but here they are $2.00 and they are not big....2-3 bites."}
{"text":"We are from San Diego, and have been going to the El Gordo there a few times, and were never that impressed. And then we tried this location.... it was a bit better than we expected. The Al Pastor taco was tasty and the meat was nicely cooked (crunchy), although it could come with more meat. The others we ordered were also pretty decent. My final verdict? Overpriced tacos that taste decent... will I come again? Sure."}
{"text":"Ok so the food is good but that set up where you have to make different lines for meats and then another line to pay is just not worth it. Lines seem like a mess, everyone seems lost. The food is really good, authentic Mexican tacos but I could not fathom coming back here on a weekend. The setup is too stressful for tacos."}
{"text":"Really really really good. As a first-timer I found the set up a little overwhelming/confusing, but then I put an asada taco in my mouth and everything was right in the world. So much flavor. The avocado sauce is serious. The grilled peppers on the side are necessary. Spicy pork was super tasty. 

I wish they had chips. I may not look like a gringa but I do eat like one..."}
{"text":"Came here because of the great reviews. Good tacos but the Carne Asada line is just that...only for carne Asada and its long! So if you like variety of meats you have to get in different lines. I waited about 30 mins in line just to get my food. And then..... I had to get in another line to pay! Oh, and good luck finding a place to sit."}
{"text":"Never again. Never. I don't give a damn how good you think these tacos are. Do. Not. Come. Here. You could drive to TJ and get tacos faster. You don't believe me? Go ahead and try. Oh and by the way, the tacos- no mames. Nothing special. To top it off, you think the people taking the order care if they get it right? With that kind of volume they don't give a damn. Plenty of drunkards will throw their money away at a business that does NOT deserve it. They're the antithesis of an efficiently rum, high quality restaurant. Too many mexican places in town that are way better. Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"waited in line for my \"Adobada Taco\" and after eating it I was bummed I didn't get 2 of them! For me it was the clear winner! Unless you don't want it on your taco it comes with onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. I asked for the pineapple on my taco and I couldn't ever imagine ordering a taco again without it! My man had the \"Asada Taco\" and he said for him that was the clear winner. I have renamed the tacos here at Tacos El Gordo. They are now called \"Crack Tacos\". I'm addicted! I loved it so much I asked if we could go back the next day and I got no complaints! The tacos are only $2.00 each. The food is made fresh right in front of you. I thought it was awesome to see this lady making tortillas right in front of me and knowing that tortilla she was making was going on my plate. You can choose corn or flour tortillas. If you want they offer free grilled scallions and peppers to eat along with your food.

I like this location better then the other one. I don't know what it is about the LV Blvd location but it didn't have the same feel and the tourists might have something to do with that I don't know. There is more seating inside at this location as well.

Parking can be a pain but it is because everyone else knows where the crack tacos are too. If you go with a group then you might want to designate someone to get a table.  I can't say enough about this place! Just eat here already!"}
{"text":"The most authentic taco's This side of the border. A must stop in Vegas. Skip the Asada I'm sure it's fantastic but you can get beef anywhere. Order everything else even if you don't know what it is and get your mind and taste buds blown."}
{"text":"FINALLY!! I've been waiting for this location to open f-o-r-e-v-e-r! With the location on the Strip closing, it couldn't have come at a better time. Walking in I saw the usual lines for adobada, asada, etc. You have to pay attention to the signs so you know what line to get in. I only ever get adobada, so I usually go straight to that line and hubby usually goes straight to the asada line. Sometimes I do feel like an asada taco, so hubby just gets mine when he gets his and that saves time and my food from getting cold. This last visit the line wasn't bad at all and the place had a good amount of heads in it. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in the adobada line and hubby waited less than that in his line. The wait time will no doubt change depending on the day at time, but the wait is worth it. I had an \"Adobada Taco\" ($2) and an \"Adobada Mulas\" ($4, I requested mine to me made on flour tortillas) and they were both so good! I asked for them both with pineapple and the dude hooked me up with a fair amount. The adobada has such great flavor and is very addicting! The taste just keeps you wanting more. They do have seating inside, but I noticed they are working on the other part of the building, so maybe they will add more seating there?? That will be good for those who like to eat inside, but a lot of people, myself included, just eat at our cars. They offer a variety of meats including asada, adobada, lengua, sesos, buche, tripa, suadero and chorizo. You can get any of these meats in a taco, mulas, tostadas, vampiro, sopes and even over fries. This place is absolutely legit when it comes to tacos and I'll be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was really good and the workers here were really welcoming! My family and I stopped by before they closed and they were still really nice and the food was really fresh. The mulitas are a 10/10!! Really good cheese and handmade tortillas. I highly suggest you order the mulitas with al pastor!!! Really really good food and I would highly recommend this spot, but from what I hear it gets really packed so don't be surprised by a long line, unless you go around 1 am."}
{"text":"Amazing! !!!!!!  This place has the best mexican food in California hands down. I highly recommend it everyone and there mom should come. The service is awesome the prices are great"}
{"text":"I have seen this place popping up on yelp and decided to look through the reviews and pictures. I was happy to learn about the 2 separate lines since I would be wanting both asada and adobada and thanks to Nelson Q's picture that I can add pineapple to my taco.

The seating inside this location is limited. They have 2 tent type things outside were you can eat. If my memory isn't too foggy this location used to be a taco bell when I was a teenager. The car clubs would hang out in this parking lot and drink etc. Well, the parking lot being ghetto fabulous hasn't changed a bit. Maybe more ghetto then anything. The inside was kinda chaotic. I know it is on the strip so a lot of tourists especially drunk ones are going to want some of these $2.00 crack tacos. They are addicting and delicious! I like that I can get adobada tacos on either side. They have more then one line for the same thing since they get so busy at times.

There is a parking lot so if you can find a spot then you can just go back and eat in your car if you can't find a spot at the tables."}
{"text":"This place is crazy. There is a line for each meat. So don't be confused when you walk in and see 4 separate lines, they are different and you wait on each for different tacos. The pork was a crowd favorite and my personal favorite as well. So good and authentic feeling. This place was a nice change of pace from other food in Vegas. I've been visiting family here for years and wish I found this spot sooner."}
{"text":"In an ideal world, this is how it supposed to work out: 

Wait in line for few minutes, order tacos as one order, pay at the cashier, and enjoy delicious tacos.

So much for the ideal world ...

Once you walk in, you will see separate lines for different types of taco (two lines for adobada, two lines for asada, one line for fries, and ..... ONE line for beef tongue / tripe / beef shoulder). 

So I lined up and waited to get one beef tongue taco and one beef shoulder. So I waited ... and waited ... and waited ...

Why did it take so long? Oh I see, everyone was ordering at least 10+ tacos for each order. Taco El Gordo, how can you only have one line for beef tongue / should line? Anyhow, and so I waited for 30+ minutes ... 

Finally it got to my turn! And guess what? THEY RAN OUT OF BEEF SHOULDER -_-! Dude, not cool at all. I only ordered beef tongue and beef tripe tacos. 

In the end, I basically did not want to wait in another line and I just simply overpaid for a $10 carne asada fries because there was no line. Oh, did I also mention it took them another 10 minutes just to get the fries out?  

Well, these tacos better be amazing right?

tacos de lengua (beef tongue - $2.25 each) and tacos de tripa (beef tripe - $2 each): For $2 tacos, they tasted okay. Is it worth 30 minutes wait? Hell no!  

Taco de adobada (spicy pork - $2): Probably the best taco out of all three that I've ordered, but it wasn't crazily good. 

Carne asada fries ($10): Not like it was awful, just not at the price that I paid for. I still can't believe I paid $10 for somewhat average fries ($5 would be a better price). 

I will stick with my East LA tacos ... they are still the bomb and my ultimate taco standards."}
{"text":"We know Tacos el Gordo because the owners are from Tijuna and the original restaurant. We're very exited to know that finally we have good Tacos al Pastor in town.
Tacos are good, the green sauce with avocado I would like more without mayo.
Love that they open 24/7.
Portions are good size.


My only suggestion to this place is your security people, are very rude with customers, probably you can higher a better company."}
{"text":"One of my only memories of my last trip in Vegas was my friend shaking me awake in bed saying we need to get some tacos. Wait, did she just say al pastor? I jump out of bed, throw on whatever clothes were hanging out of my suitcase, and brush my teeth for a shorter amount of time that the American Dental Association would have preferred (9/10 of them can agree). We decide to Uber it from the Aria because, at that point, nothing was getting in the way of me and these tacos.

Except when we get in and see the chaos of the lines here. There's a different line for different meats (just like in SD), so strategy is important here. I decided to line up in the adobada line and she posted up for the asada. We ended up with a king's feast of 6 adobada tacos, 1 adobada mula, 2 asada tacos, and 1 adobada fries. Given that I'm basically twice my friend's size, it was easy to say that I had to finish most of that. We struggled with the fries in the end, but decided to secede given our valiant effort and that I wanted to make it alive to work the next day. 

As for the taste of the food... the adobada here is excellent. Not the best I've had, but the salsas here make up for it. The fries here will cure any hangover you throw at it, but don't try to be a hero and order it alongside your food. We decided to walk back to our hotel to try to work off all that we ate, but I doubt we even put a dent in our caloric surplus."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE.  Been to Vegas and just found this local spot.  Order one of eveything!"}
{"text":"Look, I grew up in San Diego with family in Tijuana, MX. I grew up on these tacos! I've lived in other places that never had SoCal style Mexican food. Now I'm here and so are they and I couldn't be happier than pig in shit! I'm HOME!! LOL!
I've been to their original location in Tijuana, I've been to their ones in San Diego and here. 
I could sit here and write up a play by play action about ALL of their items. SO what I'm gonna do is just sit here and YELL AT YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO GO HERE! I DON'T CARE AT WHAT COST. I DON'T CARE IF IT IS OUT OF YOUR WAY. I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T GO TO THE EAST SIDE. YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE YOUR ASS THERE AND EAT! EAT IT ALL. 

Welcome to my home!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We walked 2 miles to get here... WORTH IT! Amazing tacos just like the ones we have in Tecate! The Al pastor tacos were my favorite! We also tried the tripe...they were good, but I liked the flavor of the al pastor better. I'd suggest bringing a friend/spouse so you can each order things from separate lines. The wait was around 20 minutes on a Saturday night at 8:30. You order first and then bring your food to the other side of the restaurant to pay...the honor system seems to work for them. I don't know how they keep track of who has paid and who hasn't. This place is pretty cool! The tacos are about the size of your palm...I had 3 and my hub had 5. We were both full and happy! Cheapest/ best food you'll find on the strip! Family friendly."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Tacos el Gordo!!!

If you're in Vegas and you would like some real authentic Mexican tacos this is your place. I lived in San Diego for 12 years and Tacos El Gordo was my favorite place to get tacos. I even went down to Tijuana (I lived like 15 minutes from the Mexican border) for some Tacos El Gordo and it tasted just as good. 

My favorite is the Adobada and Carne Asada tacos and also mulitas (2 corn tortillas stuffed with lots of meat and cheese) The Adobada and Carne Asada were sooooo flavorful,tender, and juicy! The meat is piled high on your taco then they add onions, cilantro, guacamole, and salsa. The delicious meat just melts in your mouth. I also get grilled green onions, grilled jalapeños, lime and radishes on the side. Last time we were here we ordered it to-go so we can eat it at our hotel. I couldn't wait to eat at the hotel so I ate it in the car. Lol."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in Vegas! $2/taco a lil pricey but it's so delicious. Try to avoid during lunch hour cause it's so packed in and out, it makes it hard to snatch a table. It dies out around 2 but it is a really good place to grab a quick bite :)"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican fast food! tt looks like it took over an old Wendy's from the architecture of the place. As soon as I saw that this place was packed with Mexicans, I knew this place had to be good. 

Right when you walk in, you see where you walk up an place your order. Everything is prepared on the spot, as efficiently as a Chipotle assembly line. You see the meats cooked right there in front of you so the aroma is mouth watering. Your first stop is the guy serving up adobada which he slices off a skewer and you see all of the juices running down.

I ordered four different tacos: adobada, carne asada, lengua and cabeza for about $2 each. All of them were generously filled with meat, onions, cilantro and sauces. The corn tortillas are made fresh as is everything else. 

All of the meats were tender and flavorful but the standout star was adobada. I made the mistake of eating that first, and although all of the other tacos were good, they paled in comparison to the amazing adobada taco.

I had the flan for dessert and it was good, not the best I've had but worth getting if you have a sweet tooth. 

I'm sad that this place is all the way on the other side of town. I won't be able to go to a Roberto's or Amigos Tacos without comparing them to the yummy goodness that is Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"Prices are ridiculous. Almost $3 for a taco that you can eat in literally 2-3 bites. But I will say this, they taste very very good."}
{"text":"They have the BOMB tacos! Well worth the the wait. Just like the tacos in t.j back in the days. You member! The asada & al pastor tacos were soooooo good. Our entire group couldn't get enough of the tacos."}
{"text":"This place is out of business. When we come to vegas we like to eat here. So we stopped. And saw they were no longer in business"}
{"text":"Packed always but worth the wait. Lengua and asada always on point. Great meal whenever you want great tacos."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas, some of the best I've had around the country actually. Place gets packed as an after party food spot, but I go during normal hours to stuff my face lol. Their al pastor tacos are the best ever, but I'd recommend trying all of them. 
Weird quesadillas though. Delicious, but super small. They just take the taco tortillas & stack them to make the quesadilla."}
{"text":"Imagine the best possible taqueria, but take away homemade aguas frescas and put it an old Wendy's building.  Then you're basically left with tacos el gordo.  

Fresh homemade tortillas, good variety of meats, and sopes so big they stack a tostada on top so you can hold it together.  Free grilled peppers and friendly staff.  None of the meats were the best I had, but they were consistently very good."}
{"text":"Yet another place from my memory of a Vegas trip from years ago that held its ground :)
The hubby and I started out lunch food tour with these tacos as our \"appetizer\" if you will. Lol
We ended up just getting 2 adobada tacos with everything. 
Soooooo good! The tortillas are perfection, with slightly crispy edges. The meat is succulent and overall no shortage of fillings. 
The line was insane and completely out the door the entire time. Tho FYI there are multiple lines inside based on which tacos you are actually ordering. So it's funny that we had wanted adobadas anyways but that happened to be the shortest line so win win for us!
Seriously yummy tacos so glad to see they are still here and thriving!"}
{"text":"With so many choices for tacos in this town. El Gordos is true down home Mexican taco spot. Just watching them prep them right front of you is cool as the smoke and sounds of the grill are right in your face. This is not a white table cloth spot, this a late night must or when you are craving a taco truck taco this is the spot!!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I make sure to visit this place! This taco shop is a decent sized place that is almost always packed full of people. It is located by the Wynn hotel and there is a parking lot for those that don't want to walk or want to be dropped off there. But be warned, like many places on the Strip there will be a long line (although it is definitely worth it). And there is also security monitoring the doors to make sure people don't cut and that the whole process is more \"organized\". 

How it works- there are multiple lines you can go in depending on what kind of meat you want. So if you are coming in a group I would recommend each of you to tackle a different line and order for one another. For example, if my friends and I want Asada and Adobada, one of my friends would stand in the Asada line and I would stand in the Adobada line. After getting the tacos we would split them up on our trays and then go pay at the registers.  

There are two different lines for the most popular meats, the Asada & the Adobada (4 in total), and 1 line off to the side for the less popular (but still amazing) meats like Cabeza, Lengua, and Buche. Each taco is about $2.25-$2.50 each, and they also have grilled onions and peppers if you ask for it. What's amazing is that you can have your tacos on either a homemade corn 
tortilla or a homemade flour tortilla. I'm a sucker for a fresh tortilla! They also have sopes, quesadillas, and tostadas too but they don't have burritos. My favorite meat hands down is the Adobada (spicy pork), definitely give it a try! 

Honestly I think the biggest struggle isn't even the wait- it's to get a table. Because the place is always packed with people I literally feel like I have to fight someone to get a table. Every time I have been here I literally had to watch the tables like a hawk for someone to get up to leave, but there's always other customers trying to do the same thing. I would honestly recommend just taking it to go if you don't have the energy for that. Also, if you come during the summer expect to sweat. The AC is just not strong enough to accommodate all the customers, and workers behind the counter. The last time I visited, I was hit by a cloud of smoke coming from the stoves after walking in.  

The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because sometimes I get a little hangry waiting for so long for some tacos, (even if it's worth it), and the fact that finding a table is struggle. Other than that, amazing tacos at a decent price- so definitely try it out if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, taco place. $2.00 street tacos, $4 quesadillas, and $5 half order fries (with meat) or $10 for full order. OK, so $2.00 isnt exactly CHEAP for street tacos, but this is near the strip and nothing else is that cheap around the area. i had the spicy pork taco which was good and we shared the half order of fries with pork. i dont know what kind of creamy white sauce they put on the fries, but it was really good. 

the best part of the experience was the lady helping us with our order. you're suppose to just walk up to the counter and order from the cooks, but one of the ladies came up and asked us if we needed help ordering. she explained almost the entire menu to us (which is pretty small) but as indecisive as i was, she was very patient with me and waited until i finally decided on my ONE taco.

the worst part of the experience (this is more for the BF), is that he had an upset stomach later that night from his two tacos and fries. :("}
{"text":"Took my family there before heading back to Utah for the first time and it did not disappoint !  We all had the spicy pork 30 tacos will try the other meats next time I'm sure they are just as good We will be back !"}
{"text":"Great tacos.  A place for a quick bite not a meal but do t set you're expectations any lower; the food is well prepared and service is friendly. Not for everyone but if it's for you you'll be happy and full"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in Vegas. I love the tacos lengua and cabeza! There are separate lines for different types of meat for the tacos so be sure to look up top to see which line to go to. I believe there are 3 lines total. The food is always on-point! 

We've been here many times and for us the best time to go is mid afternoon on a weekday. Otherwise, the place is so packed. There are limited tables inside and people try to save spots even though their family members are still in line."}
{"text":"El pastor tacos are amazing, one of the best tacos I ever had. I will def be back ...  :)"}
{"text":"I just can not say enough good things about this place and so happy we have them in Vegas!  They serve a taco that is just amazing. This location is the one on Las Vegas Blvd near Encore.  You sometimes ask yourself  aren't all tacos alike? The answer is NO!  Tacos El Gordo or as we call them tacos el fatty have turned a simple taco into some deliciousness in every bite.  Let start with the carne asada tacos. They serve these tacos on a street tacos size corn tortilla as they should be!  The carne asada is cooked to perfection . I must admit I enjoy the carne asada taco but I would not say it's what they are known for, but the fresh guacamole and salsa in the tacos are great. However, my purpose in visiting TEG is Al Pastor! OMG if you eat nothing else please, please have the al pastor tacos with everything on them. We have many taco shops in Vegas but the al pastor tacos is by far the best I've had anywhere. That is locally in Vegas and worldwide! This is the best al pastor taco ever. It's a perfection of the meat being cooked shawarma style. They cut it fresh onto your yellow corn tortilla  and top it off with a green sauce ( know as the crack sauce) it's not spicy and adds to the perfection of the marinated al pastor pork and cilantro and onions. This is WOW in your mouth  they also serve cesos, tripa, buche.  
So the only thing people sometimes get confused as they are not use to the Tijuana Taco stands model.  If you go iba group when you arrive send  one person to order the asada and another for al pastor tacos. This will speed up the experience and make it much smoother and on your way to enjoy your tacos.  You order from the different lines and then you go pay and sit and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I thought I knew good tacos until I ate here.  This is my standard for good Mexican food.  Al Pastor tacos are always the best.  Also, sopes.  All the sopes.  You just have to know what to order.  People of all different types congregate here for good food. Hell yes x1000"}
{"text":"Home made tortillas and good food. steak and avocado have a different texture but still good. The cashier workers do need to smile a bit more though."}
{"text":"After hearing Vince L saying that after eating the tacos from Tacos El Gordo, tacos elsewhere is no longer the same, my bf and I made a visit for lunch on a Friday afternoon. 

When we arrived, there were so many people there and we were a bit confused with the ordering.  The tiny paper that were taped to the bucket at each station was a bit hard to see at the chaotic time.  I went to a line to order the cabeza taco and the person behind the counter directed me to a different line, then I was like OMG, I totally didn't see that each line is for different items.  Then after we received our 3 cabeza, 2 lengua, and 2 tripa tacos, we head over to a different counter to order drinks and to pay.  I asked if the horchata was freshly made and she said yes...THAT is not true because it came out of the fountain and it doesn't taste homemade.  I then opted for the orange bang.

Right around where the drink fountain is where we found limes, turnips and other condiments.

The food was really authentic and yummy.  I will definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"They moved off the strip and their tacos are now each 2.00 so one star off for that. Now located 15-20 mins north of Vegas but they offer a free shuttle going and coming from the Wynn Hotel, except the driver dropped it off at some 7/11 instead.... Lines are still long as ever. Still the best tacos though! Ask for pineapple on the side, soo yum!"}
{"text":"HOLY JESUS!! Preeeeeeeeetty damn close to tacos from the taco stands in Mexico. The Al Pastor is the best, hands down! Not a huge fan of pork but this pork is on another level. ;-) Loved the Lengua (tongue) but was not fan of the Adobada tacos. 
These Taco Shops are usually always busy but this location in particular is ALWAYS packed because it's on the strip, especially after midnight. 

The quesadillas are to backflip for! they crisp the tortilla, melt the cheese and add meat-SO DELISH!...try everything you can possibly fit in your tummy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos, but it was a bit expensive and the tripa was burned. Still worth the drive over. The soda machine had a lot of options, which is nice if you're into that. And they have a large selection of meats!"}
{"text":"DAMN these were some tasty tacos!!!! My buddy and I were extremely hungover while visiting Vegas and we kept on hearing about Tacos El Gordo. So we decided to take a walk to find this gem.and it was well worth it. At $2 a taco its a steal. The pastor and carne asada are bomb.com and I highly suggest checking them out for yourselves. They even have whipped juices in which they taste like a familiar chain drinks orange whipped juice w/ banana..... that is all. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"After driving to its location on Las Vegas Blvd and seeing that it was closed, we yelped this location and quickly drove over to get our taco fix.

Now, there were separate lines depending on what kind of meat you wanted when we went so our line for the adobado (marinated pork) was the longest. When we were finally at the front, yes, Tacos Al Pastor were ordered. Before Tacos El Gordo, I didn't even like tacos and now I love them.

Fun Al Pastor trivia: The vertical rotisserie that the meat is spun on is called the trompo and the meat is thinly sliced off from the spit.

After you collect your goodies then go pay the cashier (you can also choose your drink now) and try to find a table to sit at. 

What made this location my favorite: We had been looking around for tables while we stood in line, but man, some people definitely wanted those seats. After we paid and walked around to see if a table would free up, an employee came by and asked if it was just the two of us. We said yes, and she said to follow her to a different section and they made us our own table to sit at. Thank you for this!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN TOWN! I dream about the tacos here! They are so good and tasty! The long lines mean it's worth it and that you should definitely get them! Their tacos are fresh and they make it right in front of you! It can get really busy sometimes but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Read the reviews here on yelp and decided to give it a try.  So glad we did!  I am born and raised in Texas and we know our Mexican food.  When we first walked in we were a little skeptical but as soon as we received our food we were completely sold!  Not only is it SUPER cheap, but the food is amazing!  The spicy pork tacos were delish!  The spicy pork quesadilla was amazing too!  First time I've ever had a quesadilla where the bottom layer was a soft tortilla and the top was crunchy.  Then the fries!  Wow!  I only got a half order and it fed 3 peeps and we had to stuff ourselves to finish them.  So we had 3 people with sodas that ate until we waddled out for $20...WHAT?!!!  Can you say fat and happy???  YUP! = )"}
{"text":"Walked over here with my gf before the mad lunch rush.  This place gets crazy busy, so be prepared to wait in a disorganized line.  I prefer the SD location because it seems more hole in the wall.  But, still the tacos here are awesome!  My favorites are the lengue, pastor, cabeza and asada."}
{"text":"The adobada tacos  are phenomenal. The only thing that keeps me from giving them a 5 star review is they can sometimes be inconsistent.  Most of the time, you will have a great experience and the food will be fantastic, but every once in awhile you will go and just wont be that good.   I'm not sure what they do different on those days, but I'm always willing to go back some other time and try again because of how good it is when they are doing it right!"}
{"text":"TACOSSSS!! I really do enjoy their tacos. The meat is always tender, they give enough toppings and their staff is friendly considering how busy they always are. The adobado fries are one of my favorites! Crema, avocado salsa, guac, fries, cheese and meat, what more could you ask for! I would definitely recommend ordering a half size, the fries really fill you up. I like that they're not stingy on the meat. You will definitely get your moneys worth here."}
{"text":"i have heard that this taco place is in Tijuana and it's one of the best taco places ever , well i spent over twenty dollars on taco's and i thought this was one of the worse places i had eaten from being a Mexican restaurant for good taco's they only put guacamole and onions on yr taco and everything else they serve they do not make the taco like an authentic business of many years i am use to having skirt steak lettuce and cheese on the taco i don't know anyone who would just want guacamole on tacos, fajita  burrito, and  quesadilia i thought it to be gross"}
{"text":"If you want authentic tacos, come to tacos el gordo. Be prepared to wait in line, but it is totally worth it! Tacos are small, so you can try all different kinds! You do not want to pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Quick eats with generous portions on any hour at a price that's affordable which even makes you crave for more, this place fits the bill!

A place that stays open into the wee morning hours located on \"The Strip\" along the Riviera Resort and Wynn Resort side of the street. Security guards are a common sight, for added feeling of secureness while you eat. Sit out in the outdoor canopied patio on chairs or on the cushioned seating. It sure will satisfy your stomach's need for Mexican cuisine of tacos. At a price of two dollars, five bucks to ten bucks a meal, fill up with all the fixings that goes with the taco you order which is best but, u must ask for it (at no extra charge) are: onions, spicy pepper, guacomole sauce, cilantro, sour cream, cheese, jalapeno, grilled scallion/onion, guacomole (mashed avocado), and even pineapple chunks. The food servers will add it to your order. After receiving your order, you should go to the side dish server and add up with the salsa (green or red pepper sauce), chopped horseradish, chopped onions, slices of lime as you please for yourself.  
My Favorite meals is: Taco Al Pastor (\"Al Pastor\" in Spanish means, in the style of the shepherd. It is a dish of Central Mexico in an adoption of the spit-grilled meat or pork marinated over one or two days with dried chiles, and pineapple as meat tenderizer, thus cooked slowly with gas flame on a vertical rotisserie called a \"trompo\" which is literally, a spinning top). The vertical rotisserie of pork is an obvious sight and to see the server take cuts or slices of pork from the spit griller. 
My favorite is the Vampiro (means vampire). This succulent super taco of chile quesadilla wrapped around juicy grilled carne asada (steak) fabulously good meal sounds like an immortality. My vision of it is a steak through its heart; as in a stick through a vampire's heart. Okay, this brings a smile to heart (love) a vampire. 
Other favorites: Taco de Adobada (spicy pork), Taco de Carne Asada (steak), Taco de Suadero (beef shoulder), Tacos de Lengua (beef tongue), Adobada (red chili-garlic) Fries. But you must try the Taco de Tripa (tripe), Taco de Lengua (tongue), Tacos de Cabeza (beef head), Tacos de Sesos (beef brain), Tacos de Buche (pork stomach) which are exotic fare to munch on. For first-timers, dare it, is delicious! One bebida or drink favorite is the Horchata (a Mexican rice and cinnamon milk-like drink). Other dish on the menu are Quesadilla (a flour tortilla or a corn tortilla filled with a savory mixture containing cheese, other ingredients, and/or vegetables, then folded in half to form a half-moon shape) with meat, Sopes (soup) with meat, Tostadas (meaning \"toasted\" is a Mexican fried tortilla), Mulas (shredded beef on tortilla with cheese and salad), Carne Asada (steak) Fries, Campechana (seafood) Fries, Taco Azteca (or Nopal Asado, is grilled cactus).

Just have patience as you wait in line to get the servers to take your order. With a price and generous portion like it is, you are not the only one lining up for these eats. The strong scent of food that permeates the air is enough to keep you staying in line. Betcha some of the people in line are in it for more. Visiting and eating during early morning hours is quite a feast from one taco to the next. Although any time of the night or day will do. Mexican cuisine at its simple fare doesn't get any better than this! More!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat be aware tacos are small and you have to know what you want before entering, also be aware that once you have your food there's no place to sit at when it's crowded."}
{"text":"Soooooo yummy! I love how they melt cheese on your sopes and mulas. The carne asada fries are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb! This place never disappoints, The line is usually super long but well worth the wait! If you are in Vegas this place is a must!!!! I always manage to eat here at least once every day while I am in town. Everything here is good!!!"}
{"text":"I'll pick Tacos El Gordo over any in America. So glad they have expanded from Tijuana to San Diego and now Las Vegas. They are authentic street style tacos. Tacos al carbon are the best. Tons of flavor and the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"After getting out of the club Tao about 5: am we were very hungry decide it to go for some tacos it was crazy pack wrong move to go in there it was beyond insane after being in the line for about 20 minutes the security guy told me that I was on the wrong line he said to me \" this line is only for the adobada tacos \" move to the other line 35 minutes for me to be able to order my tacos they were super greasy the guy that made my tacos was super cool but the other guy that was making the alpastor Tacos I think he was the owner because I think the name el Gordo is cause of his size he was not cool at all I was talking to him ordering some tacos from him and he completely ignored me the orchata water was out of a fountain machine gross to end it all I think you can get better tacos at tacos pepes and they are cheaper"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative number I would. After reading the other reviews on Yelp, I was excited to try this place while in Las Vegas. The ordering process is confusing at best. One of the people in our party was so frustrated they  actually walked out the door  and did not order anything,I wish I had gone with them !!!  I wanted my tacos on flour tortillas but instead I got corn tortillas.  One was the pork taco and the other was beef. I took one bite from the beef taco and I swear this was not beef but the most disgusting taste I have ever had. I promptly spit it out.  Daughter got a overpriced quesadilla which amounted  to a small piece of queso fried on a grill and slapped between two extremely small tortillas.  Even the toppings were lame and were nothing, really.  If you want the worst , overpriced tacos on the planet- go here."}
{"text":"I learned two things. 1) do not go alone unless you only want one kind of taco. and 2)  \"Adobada\" and \"Al pastor\" are the same thing (at least as far as Tacos El Gordo is concerned)... Oh wait!! 3 things!! That these tacos are crazy good!!!! It was a madhouse inside, 4 different lines to get particular tacos, though, we were in the adobada/al pastor line and were able to order a carne asada taco from it. The guy yelled out to another guy, and after waiting a little longer, we got the carne asada tacos without having to wait in another line. (I'm not sure you can do this from all lines, this was my first experience.) We just had the two types of tacos. The carne asada was spicier than the al pastor. I somehow thought it would be the other way around. So, first you wait in line, then you pay at the cashier desk off to the side, and then try to maneuver your way to the soda fountain on the other side. They have all the Ole brand drinks (plus coke, sprite and orange fanta? I think?) I couldn't tell you what they are, I just know horchata is an option, and that's all I care about. I was at the Charleston location, and I noticed they also have a shuttle to offer shuttle service to the restaurant. Yes, it's that good. I get stressed out in crowds, so this was a pretty stressful experience especially for my first time, but so worth it. I've never even been that much of a street taco person. I now know it's because I've never had good ones. Looking forward to refilling my anxiety meds to eat these again. :D"}
{"text":"This isn't my first time here at Tacos El Gordo and it definitely isn't my last.

This one in particular, is at the end of the strip, near circus circus and encore. I love Tacos El Gordo and I personally have not had any tacos better than this place. 

The special here is the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos. The server cuts the meat from a rotating pig that makes you just want to drool when looking at it. The tacos are constructed so quickly and I have been to vegas many times to notice the same exact server!

I also always order the Large Adobada Fries which can feed around 5 people. It is a whirlwind of flavor with a special green \"crack\" sauce that is so unbelievably good I cannot describe it any other way.

The tacos are about $2 each with the large fries being $10. For vegas, this is great, cheap food. I would order 3-4 tacos and split the fries with friends."}
{"text":"We finally got to try this place out and it was delicious. We originally went to the one on the strip but it was crazy packed with lines out the door. Thankful that our lyft driver had told us about their second location. Everything was delicious, my husband loved their sopes. Great portions of food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was not good at all. Too greasy and salty suadero tacos, al pastor flavorless, and so did the Sesos were just boiled, would not recommend this place and not worth the price we paid for this really bad tacos. First and last time here."}
{"text":"i will never go here im from la and we been up for more than 24 hrs so our feet hurt feom walking around and so we took out shoes off. well the security guard said we could not be at the shitty restaurant without shoes  we were basically spending alot of money because its was a couple of us and so we were not welcome in if we didnt have shoes wtf the manager and the people working of full of shit plus the food taste like crap never again"}
{"text":"Me and my family have been to this location a couple times. It's been pretty busy each time we have been here but it has been worth the wait. The meat on the tacos and sopes we ordered tasted fresher and juicier. Even though it was busier, the employees worked pretty quick to get the line down which isnt always the thing, Overall, I would come back and eat at this specific location."}
{"text":"Me and my family went to this location for the first time. We has been to Tacos El Gordo before but decided to go to this one. We ordered carne asada tacos and tacos al pastor along with a couple of sopes. Overall, it was good. The tortilla on the al pastor tacos was different though. It was yellow and slighter tougher. The carne asada torilla was much softer and tasted fresher. Overall, I would come to Tacos El Gordo again but not this specific location."}
{"text":"Too good, can't wait to go back and their open late nights! Their right next to the Encore casino and their service is great and fast!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and a bargain at 2.25 a taco. Tacos El Gordo is extremely authentic and you can watch the staff cook and prepare your meal.  Everything is in Spanish so it was a little difficult to understand the menu.  This place always seems to be busy and we waited in line for around 45 minutes until we could place our order and we ate outside since their wasn't any indoor seating available."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with high expectations. I've heard such great things about this restaurant in San Diego, so when I found out that they had another restaurant in Vegas, I had to check it out. I got two tacos: taco al pastor and taco de asada. The taco al pastor was really good, but I felt like I've had better. Also, the taco de asada was really disappointing. The meat was cold. I probably won't be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. Walked in for a early day taco. I had no idea what i was getting but this food was a smash. You guys rock."}
{"text":"Best pastor in Vegas.... I've had the chorizo and carne Asada as well, but the pastor is my absolute favorite. They make Roberto's look like Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Pricey compared to LA, but good for the strip. Very flavorful, would go here again"}
{"text":"Update:

This spot is my plan B...Only if my favorite taco stands (Tacos Cancun and Taqueria El Pastorcito are closed.

The service here is very quick and efficient, and they are open until 4am which is a big bonus for all you night owls.We stopped in after the Yelp Burstday celebration at the Stratosphere and it wasn't packed at all. We got a little bit of everything-Tostada, Lengua, Cabeza, Crispy Tripas(My favorite here) and the fan favorite, adobada.

It definitely hit the spot and cured our taco cravings for the evening...ALOHA!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(211/365) \" Plan B for Tacos\""}
{"text":"Pros:
-Lots of good food.
-The food is good.
-There is a lot of it.
-The food is cheap.
-You can get lots of good, cheap food all hours of the night.

Con:
-Lines are long.

Seems to me like the pros outweigh the con! This place is best approached with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Since there are different lines for different food items (one for asada, a different one for adobada, yet another for carne asada fries, etc.), you'll probably want to bring some friends, or stick to just one kind of food.

Everything is delicious! And it's cheap, so you might as well just try one of everything. They have nopales (the quesadilla is my favorite), so there are options for vegetarians, too (although if you're very uptight about it, this is not the place for you...your nopales will probably touch a whole lot of meat before ending up on your plate).

Ask for some grilled peppers and green onions to complete your meal, and stop by the condiment bar for extra hot sauce, radishes, and limes.

¡Buen apetito!"}
{"text":"Very good place feels like Mexico  workers are great and respectful the food is so good  first time in Vegas!!!!! Thank you  will be back soon ................."}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give a bad review so as to keep this little gem hidden from the rest of Vegas. Great food, quick and clean. They are opening one closer to my house which fills me with trepidation. I guess I can kiss my diet good-bye."}
{"text":"Terrific tacos, and overall good place to eat. The carne asada fries are genuinely the best I have had (while on a quest  to find good ones), and the tacos are well-prepared, balanced in flavor, and consistent. The atmosphere is ambient, lots of working families, and the customer service is serviceable enough. The star is the food."}
{"text":"It's late. You're drunk. It's Early. You're hungover. What sounds good? Something Greasy. Something Quick. Something Tasty. Something... Mexican?

Yeah, so they don't have Menudo, but the next best things are tacos, quesadillas w/ vampiros, and some horchata. And Tacos El Gordo did it right in SoCal, they did it right in Vegas.

Tucked away at the end of the south Strip just 2 blocks from Encore/Encore Beach Club is Tacos El Gordo. Order at the counter, some meats on the other side, Lengua Extra, bring to register, pay for food. It's just that simple.

Everything is pretty decent.  I will say, don't know if its the alcohol sh*ts, or the Tripa, but I had the runs in the morning. My friend says they don't wash the tripe properly... which could be the reason.

I will say the lengua fries were bomb dot com, and the cabeza quesadilla on hit!"}
{"text":"Look at all the 4 and 5 star reviews! need I say more? ok.....: I had to travel to Cali to get decent Mexican food in my belly, after living here for 10 yrs I discovered this place with help of a friend and OMG! THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST TACOS IN LAS VEGAS! take it from a Mexican...I know! 

.....why are you still reading? go get some tacos! now!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. The ordering process is horrible. I waited in line for an hour to get our tacos, on a slower night! The meat tastes like charcoal. The place is filled with smoke because they have no ventilation system. The guacamole tasted like nothing! I love runny guacamole but this one had no salt, no flavor, it was bad. I wish there was a taqueria like the ones in Mexicali, where I'm from, which is what I was expecting. Don't believe the hype! This is not as good as the original."}
{"text":"Omg I ate there yesterday and all day today have been basically peeing out of my ass... That's all I had to eat. I feel like vomiting as well! I will NEVER eat here again!

Are 2 vampiros omg I regret going there! I have ate there before without an issue as big as this. I've gotten stomach aches from it but not like today!"}
{"text":"Amazing spicy pork and carne asada tacos!"}
{"text":"So immediately after entering I'm reminded of a beautiful place in Mexico. One were you could find both love and pleasure. The beautiful paradise of Coahuila St in Tijuana. Many a times I've headed to this resort like street and have found love. No where on earth will you be more likely to find love at a cheaper price. Then upon walking out you can find pleasure in the taco stands posted outside. Thank you Tacos El Gordo for paying homage to where I want to be buried but also to all us fat guys looking for love..."}
{"text":"Love this place the Tacos are cheap and will get you full there's free refills on horchata and other drinks Best Tacos in Las Vegas so far Tacos From Tijuana"}
{"text":"I love love love tacos el gordo, especially this location. This is the very first tacos el gordo location I have been to and I don't understand why I don't come back here more often. 

In comparison to their strip location, I felt like this location had better tasting adobada. Plus, it's less busy and I check out my food much faster. 

If you've NEVER been to tacos el gordo, you just go to the counter with food and order right away of what you want. There's usually a carne asada line and an adobada line. After you get your food, then you go to the counter to pay. 

Must try: 
- tacos of your choice ( my fave is the adobada, you can ask for pineapple in it) 
- campechana fries (carne asada + adobada. SO YUM! 

Honestly can't wait till my next cheat day to come here."}
{"text":"They're back! I was so sad when they closed it last year.

Taco de adobada (spicy pork) is the best one there. It's spicy, juicy and rich in flavors. Drools*. When you order, they'll ask if you want everything on it (toppings & sauces), say yes!

Avoid long line by going in the day time, it's super packed after midnight but it's also the best time to eat when you're drunk :)"}
{"text":"In town, read the reviews and decided to try it out for an early lunch before heading out for a long shopping day.  

We ordered the adobada tacos and the adobada fries 
Tacos are $2...and they are very good
Fries are $10 large/ $5 small (get the small enough for two people)
The menu reads spicy pork but it's not spicy  

This place is a great find!  If you visit Vegas, this is a must! We will definitely come back and eat here."}
{"text":"Alright! Everyone is a winner when Tacos El Gordo opens up a new location on the strip. Whether you're a tourist, drunk late at night, a poor college student, or just simply looking for a quick and affordable meal. Actually if you're staying at a casino on Tropicana and walking is your means of transportation then.. sorry, sucks to be you, but at least you have Earl of Sandwich at the Planet Hollywood. HOWEVERRR if you're a beast and can walk 4 blocks or so in triple digit heat then you indulge yourself by all means.

Why I love Tacos El Gordo:

1. Corn tortillas that are slightly fried before you get them
2. The asada is cooked when you order it (or at least in my experiences). That deserves a high five.
3. ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK HORCHATA for $1.40? Don't mind if I do.
4. The spicy pork shawarma (adobada) looking thing, most definitely the star of the establishment. There is a slice of pineapple sitting on top of it, leaking all of its delicious juices into the delicious spicy pork. Plus you get a slice on pineapple added to the taco. 
5. Plenty of meat is given, along with the onions, peppers, and green sauce (I'm not sure if its guacamole or not). 
6. The bathroom is CLEAN! Be honest, you know how most cheap eats don't have the cleanest bathroom.

They also have beef head (Cabeza), beef tongue (lengua), and tripe I believe. No chicken just in case you're wondering. Lastly aside from the tacos they have asada or adobada fries ($10), tortas ($4), and quesadillas ($4). All the essentials to a drunk meal.

Random note: 3 tacos @ $2.00 each plus one drink comes out to be $7.99 after tax"}
{"text":"I love going here every time I'm in Vegas. This place has definitely became a tourist attraction. The line is pretty ridiculous, but it goes by fairly fast. The only downside is it's very hot and always will be hot, so waiting in the heat can be very frustrating. I don't like how they have different meats separated because if you want different kinds, you have to stand in different lines. A lot of waiting in line. The tacos are BOMB!"}
{"text":"Took us about 45 minutes from arriving to get our food. Parking lot can get full quickly with the Korean BBQ place right next to it. Place was packed, with a line out the door for carne asada. If you wanted anything else than that then you get to cut the line. I waited in line to order food while my bf staked out a seat. We ended up sitting directly next to others since the tables were arranged pushed together to save space.

I was confused as how to pay, so here it is. You order and get your food, then you take it to the cashier and pay and get any drinks. Pretty smart. Oh and they don't have sauce... I would have killed for some green sauce on my food.

Food: 
1. Carne asada fries: I love the cheese. Added a lot of flavor. We sprinkled limes and mixed the guac around to make a type of spread. The fries were good even after they stopped being warm so that's a super plus! ($13)
2. Carne asada tacos: pretty good! I ordered it with everything on there and they were the best part of the meal. ($2.25/each)
3. Carne asada sope: i love my sopes. So when you substitute cheese for rice and beans...... I'm not having it. It was really dry and I wouldn't have it again. Also had that with everything on top. ($4.50)
4. Horchata: from the machine. I like it haha. It was missing the cinnamon sand so I would recommend it! ($1.75)

If you want chilies and onion, ask for it. Or else they won't give it to ya!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good quality cheap eats and some places open really late, this is the ONE. Tacos EL Gordo hase open kitchen and few staffs constantly sweep floor and wipe tables. It's probably the cleanest taco joint I ever seen. My favorite tacos are Taco De Adobada & Taco De Lengua (spicy pork and beef tongue). Spicy pork is tender, juicy, and flavorful. Beef tongue comes in huge chunks (the most generous portion, but then again, they do cost $2.25). I always leave feeling satisfied and comforted after visiting Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"The food is ok but not worth the wait, we were in line for 45 min and the line only moved half way. There ordering system is horrible, if your hungry don't go there it will frustrate you!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but the other customers were extremely pushy and rude. Luckily, the cook realized they were trying to pass us in line, and told them they were to wait. Very authentic food -- but not enough seating inside. We had to eat outside, and when it's 117 degrees, it's hard to enjoy anything outside. Would visit again...on a cooler day!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, but confusing process. This place was jammed pack, but rightfully so!"}
{"text":"I never liked tacos growing up because I don't like messy food, and eating a taco in a hard shell is impossible without half the food falling in your lap. But then I married someone who is part Mexican, and I realized that I had never actually had a real taco. And these, my friends, are REAL tacos. Order me a cabeza taco while you're there? :P"}
{"text":"The Tacos are very tasty and delicious, especially the Al Pastor/Adobada. The first time we went, it was very packed! It took us about 30 minutes before we got to order our food. So if you are starving like I was, maybe it's not the best option, but the wait is totally worth it. This last time we went, there was hardly any line, people do orders many tacos, so that could also be time consuming. But other than that, it's a nice place to eat at when in Las Vegas. It's always a must."}
{"text":"Tripas tacos were too salty. Asked for pineapple on tacos and they still forgot. I've been here before and I was impressed. But not this time. They really need to set up a better strategy for ordering the food. I would recommend that you order and pay in the cashier and wait for your order to get called. Simple right?"}
{"text":"I used to be impressed but no any more. Last time I went the quality had dropped. They moved far from the strip so it's not worth driving this far."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. But they need a better system. It's pretty chaotic inside. Different lines for different foods. The nice taco man ordered for wife from other food stations so she didn't have to stand in line again. The cashiers could be a little friendlier. 11 am and the place was already pretty full, at least you know it's good place to eat. Tip your taco man!"}
{"text":"I was told by family it was a pretty good place that the al pastor tacos were to die for i wasnt to impressed it had to much fat food didnt really have flavor the meat wasnt thin sliced they serve you bug chunks of meat  and a girl cook was really rude to us not the best had better Mexican authentic tacos would recommend when drunk tho i guess we came from Colorado to try ."}
{"text":"After hearing about it from a friend and reading the reviews we decided to give it a shot and we were not disappointed! We tried the taco el pastor, carne asada taco, carne quesadilla, and the the carne fries (a lot I know) and it was all amazing. They top the carne with a generous amount of fresh guac that will blow your mind, and their fresh made corn tortillas are to die for. The pork is awesome, especially after watching it be cut right off the spit. We were a little confused on how to order and it was busy, but just ask anybody and they will be able to help you. The only thing I would have done differently is asked for some salsa on the side. Besides that we loved the food!"}
{"text":"This tacos are soooo damn good. I usually stop by after walking the whole night around the strip they're so good omfg. The best tacos in my opinion are tacos al pastor. These tacos are kinda pricey but they're soo worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and a Carne Asada taco both were delicious!!! No line and fast service, I will be back if in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner from postmates from Tacos El Gordo and it was amazing. I had the shrimp tacos that come on blue corn tortillas, delicious. And then the complimentary chips and salsa were outstanding. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as always. Me and the family ate here friday and we just love this place. Great customer service and the food always tastes the same as the last."}
{"text":"Instead of \"Tacos El Gordo\" it should be renamed \"Tacos El Bruto\" = the dumb one.
If you want steak tacos you must use one packed of customers line and if you want other flavor then you must make another packed line. If you want 3 or 4 diff flavors you may spend 45 mins in line just to order.   Then you have to make another huge line to pay since there is only one cashier. The fact that you see a lot of people is not because they are good  but because the dumb ordering system and because the tacos are cheap  for las Vegas Blvd. the tacos are mediocre at best. Skip it not worth the hour + wait."}
{"text":"$2 tacos. Freshly made tortillas. Spicy pork, asada, lengua ... Oh My! I love everything we had. This place doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food for a good price.  All workers are extremely friendly.  I highly recommend the al pastor and carne asada fries"}
{"text":"While in Vegas, we decided to try some tacos from tacos el Gordo. We have a few places on Oahu that have authentic Mexican food but nothing like this. From the flavors of the meats to the taste of the pico de gallo, everything was well seasoned and tastes great! We tried the al pastor, chorizo, and carne asada tacos. I'm glad we stopped by to try it and will defiantly be back to try more things! If you haven't tried this place, you may wanna give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice & the food has always been really good... and this has become one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.

I'm pretty adventurous with food, so my party ordered: Carne Asada Fries, Taco de Lengua (beef tongue), Taco de Cabeza (beef head), Lengua Fries, Taco de Adobada (spicy pork), & Adobada fries.

[FOOD]
* All were really really good! The lengua was my fav, and cabeza has a bit of a gamy taste. 

* Their fries were also really good... And HUGE portions. They're apparently known for their Adobada fries, but I wasn't a fan for some reason. I preferred the other 2 fries over this.

* They also have my favorite drink: Jamaica Tea (hibiscus tea) & it's perfectly sweetened, and free refills! Score!!!

* I believe corn tortilla is the default for their tacos. I prefer flour tortilla & they're able to provide that instead... And it's a little bigger too!

* They have this green sauce they put on their fries (cilantro aioli type) and it's soo good! I asked for extra sauce to add to my tacos
 
* They provide a pretty generous amount of guacamole on their fries

[PRICE]
* Reasonable & similar to Robertos & other fast food style Mexican restaurants. Although their fries are a little more expensive ($12 for a full size, $7 for half), their portion sizes make up for it. 

[ORDERING]
* This can be a little confusing; You order first at 1 window, wait for your food, then walk over to the other side of the room to pay.

* They keep their hot sauce with the cashier. It's free, but they keep it refrigerated. I'm not sure why they don't display them together with the veggies.

[Restaurant]
* It's more fast food/to-go style: you order, receive your food, and pay at different counters. 

* There are people cleaning the tables & removing empty containers while you're still at the tables, but no ones serving you.

* It's actually pretty clean for a restaurant on the Strip. Most fast food joints on the Strip are a bit janky. But, this isn't too bad!


It's a bummer the closest location to me is this one (on the Strip) & I wish they had one on the west side so I could eat here more often."}
{"text":"Just like it's a good sign when you go into a Japanese restaurant and all of the workers are Japanese... you know you're going to get some good Mexican food when you walk into a Mexican place and all of the workers (and most customers) are Mexican!  And this place rocked!  The menu is simple - think the taco version of In and Out Burger menu.  Just tacos, fries, and that's pretty much it.   The adobado tacos, $2 each, amazing!  Pork marinated in a red chili sauce with vinegar and oregano.  There is one line for all things abodabo, so make sure you're in the right line.  We also got the abodabo fries - the same pork over fries with a bunch of yummy sauce all over it!  And the half order is HUGE!  The other line is for all other tacos - we also got carne asada tacos.  Those were good too but I'm an abodabo fan!  You can also get a side of grilled veggies.  And then there's a jalapeño, lime, and radish bar... to garnish your tacos.  Salsa is behind the counter where you pay so you have to ask for it.   Definitely a must do when in Las Vegas! The only other place you can experience Tacos El Gordo is in Tijuana."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie !!!! Best tacos ever !!!! 

This place gets BUSY. There was a security guard outside telling people they has to wait outside for the line to go down but there's also a menu out there so when you do finally get in you know what you want! It's hectic, there's around 5 or 6 separate lines some are only for ordering specific things & then a whole other line you have to wait in to pay at the register. When you get up to the order window you tell them what you want & it's made fresh right there in front of you. Quick grab & go. The line to pay is pretty quick & if you're with a group I suggest you have someone keep a look out for a table cause it's hard to find one. 

Asada tacos are so bomb!!! We all bought enough to share but really I just wanted them all to myself lol ! You gotta be patient if you're gonna come here but it's worth it. Just keep reminding yourself that it has to be delicious because of how busy it is lol ! Definitely a go to spot when I'm in vegas & I need a taco fix."}
{"text":"We were eating in less than 5 minutes. Might be the best mexican food I ever had. Friendly staff and perfect food. Anyone not giving it 5 stars probadly prefers Chevys or Chipotle.  I'm 100% Mexican and I approve this message."}
{"text":"This place is right off the strip and well worth the adventure, as it is cheap, delicious, and authentic.
The biggest drawback is the long lines, which are awful when you are starving and have to smell everything going on inside.
The carne asada fries are a must and do not disappoint.
This is a great alternative to the pricey strip! O and they are open really late."}
{"text":"This place took me straight to the days of college crossing the borders and eating tacos.  I really like how there are different lines for different meats.  I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"Del uno al diez le doy 4 razon para ordenar hay que hacer linea para diferentes tacos ni que estuviera cruzando la linea a usa. No hay como en en la Cuidad de mexico ordenas como tu gustes y todos al misno tiempoeso se llama exelente servicio. Prefiero ir a tijuana son mas rapidos para servir.nesecitan mejor organizacion aqui y mejor comunicacion ."}
{"text":"Shy of driving across the border this is about as Mexican as tacos can get. Want cabeza tacos? How about some sesos? Yep, its here. Lengua is delicious. Nothing like having a taco kiss you back while eating it..However the sesos is beyond my current culinary fortitude. Regardless of my palate limitations I highly suggest coming here for a memorable taco experience, and yes you can have a taco experience. They change lives.."}
{"text":"3 bad and 1 good.
the bad:
#1 - they are expensive for being tacos
#2 - you have to stand in multiple lines depending on the type of tacos you want
#3 - you have to stand in line again to pay before you can eat.
the good:
#1 - tacos are good.
Tacos get 4 stars. place gets 3 stars at best.
You should be able to order your tacos at one time and pay there. it would cut down the time in line significantly so you don't have to eat cold tacos. or pay and then give the tacos person your receipt. I'm a genius, I know."}
{"text":"I came with my fiance on a Saturday night a little before midnight. It was pretty busy but the line moves quick. It was my first time there so I was a but confused with ordering because there are 3 separate lines depending on the type of meat you want. We only got pastor tacos and adobada fries. It was really good! I cannot wait to come back. I wish they had a location in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had! I had the carne asada quesadillas and they were amazing. Cooked to order, fast service and very filling. I really wish we had a location back home in Utah but it will definitely be a must to go there every trip to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Omg! I've heard so much about this place but until now, I've never known the deliciousness that is TACOS EL GORDO. 

Coming from someone who loves her street tacos and eats them once a week or more, these tacos were a winner. 

Each taco is $2.25, a bit on the expensive side, but trust me, they are the best. 

I absolutely loved there asada taco! One of the best I've had. They give a lot of meat on each taco and put on your sauces for you. 

The half adobada and half asada fries were to die for. This was a large portion and the price was decent. 

Parking was a breeze and since this location is off the strip, it wasn't too crowded when we went."}
{"text":"The Al Pastor were like none I've had before. PHENOMENAL DELICIOUS PERIOD. I've been looking for this style of Taco in LA and no luck, go figure. The service was great cause the Paisas making the Tacos were down to earth and I understand the Lingo ;-) I also enjoyed the Chiles asados and cebollitas. Nothing beats these Tacos Estillo Tijuana!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. Literally the best street tacos I've ever had in my life. Do not miss the opportunity to visit this place if you're in Vegas! The spicy pork is to die for!"}
{"text":"Food-five stars 
Prices- five stars
Customer service- ZERO STARS, the guy at the tacos al pastor station always has an attitude, I tolerated it for many visits but yesterday I decided it was enough so I walked out, I love the food but definitely won't come back, until they hire people that can act professionally and respect the customers."}
{"text":"As a Mexican is my review the end all be all for a taco stand?  No, of course not, that's silly, my head is not THAT big.  But as a Mexican did I have higher expectations for this place?  Probably . . . yeah.  I may not love it as much as everyone else but by no means did I not like it.  Heck, if I had only tried the adobado (spicy pork) tacos I'd probably give it a five star.  While we're at it, the tripas (intestines) are pretty damn good as well and I definitely don't mind the tongue either.  

What gets me though is the carne asada.  No matter how much toppings you have on your taco or whether you partake in those chiles, there's no escaping the fact that the meat is just pretty bland to me.  Every single time, whether in taco form or on top of the fries it just really doesn't do it for me.  And it's a huge disappointment because whenever I have tacos I always want one with carne asada.  While I'm complaining, the horchata has tasted pretty watered down to me whenever I had it, although the whipped orange is delicious.  

This is an actual Mexican franchise and it should be commended for having body parts that turn the average person off.  Tongue, brains, intestines, you name it and they all range from good to great with the adobado being the star of this place.  The set up is a little weird for most people and thus causes everyone to think they have to start at the right side thus delaying my quest to get those delicious adobado tacos but once you get through the process is quick enough. 

If you're adventurous enough, come on down and try those tacos you'll never see at a Taco Bell.  If you're not, well then I'd still choose their carne asada tacos over what they have at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This ain't Taco HELL (play on Taco Bell, if u didn't get that one?)!!!

Like Tacos Mexico, I really like their intestine tacos =) YUM.
Don't judge the deep fried goodness that is intestines....all things fried are delicious.
Just something bout eating it with fresh veggies and salsa. 

I can't get enough of it but, it's soooooo far from what I'm used to driving. Which is prolly why I crave it all the time..."}
{"text":"I thought my eating habits were already bad; and thennnnnnnnnnnnnn, I had this place.

I had been seeing pics of their \"orange bang\" drink on Instagram so wanted to come here to taste it for myself...hoping that it's like a drink back home in Hawaii.

Came here one Friday after Tao. Got my fave tripas tacos and their orange bang. My drunk friends got a plethora of tacos and carne asada fries. Omg --- SO GOOD! Orange band included; it wasn't as frothy and creamy (more watered down) than I would like but, it'll do.

In fact, El Gordo was SO GOOD that we came here the next night after The Bank. lol
This time, we decided to change up the meat and had TRIPAS FRIES ---- oooOOooooOOOooooooooohhhhhhHHhhhhhh. Talk about LIFE CHANGER right there!

It's pretty busy with the afterhours crowd with long lines but, the wait to order and to get your food isn't bad at all.
Note: there are THREE lines in there. Each for different kinds of meats. Make it easier on yourself and have each of your friends (if you have more than 3) stand in each line to order things.


Honestly, felt sick to my stomach with all the bad food I ate that weekend (including El Gordo); but, I'd effing do that again! 

If imma have a heart attack after that food; at least, I know I died a happy woman =)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a cheap lunch in Las Vegas after Sunday mass so I found this place nearby.  When I first entered the place with my brother, I was confused when looking at the multiple lines in a busy crowd.  There were signs that labeled specifically for different meats.  For instance, one line was for lengua and tripe, another line was for asada, and another for al pastor and so forth. So if you want to get different types of meats without wasting time, it is best to bring in a group of people and have them order from different lines while you order from another line. Teamwork is crucial here.  By the way, there is a cashier line near the exit, which is separated from the rest of the multiple lines. 

I ordered 2 lengua tacos and 1 tripe taco from the same line.  I also ordered the horchata drink when I went to the cashier line but was disappointed that the horchata was watery and bland.  The tacos, however, were amazing and delicious.  I loved the texture and moisture of the lengua tacos and was intrigued to order the tripe (intestine) from someone who told me about it while I was waiting in line. I liked the texture of the tripe taco but wasn't a fan of the grimy taste.  

The tacos were affordable and service was okay at best. I ended up getting these to-go so I can meet up with my group of relatives in another place. 

Overall, I am glad that authentic tacos such as these from Tacos El Gordo exist in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It was really busy late night on Saturday. It took  over 30 minutes for the 3 of us to get 12 tacos because of their line system. That did not bother me very much though; it was the cashier who counted the number of tacos herself, overcharged me an extra taco, and failed to give my receipt when I paid for my food. After getting seated, I realized that had happened. I quickly went back to the cashier to let her know so I can get a free soda since I didn't want to wait in line for a taco.  Due to the language barrier, a coworker of hers explained the situation. The cashier refused to admit she overcharged me and did not do a single thing to make matters better, even after I did the math and showed her the amount I was charged in my credit card. If it were an accident, that's totally understandable. I think it was intentional. On the flip side, I really enjoyed the tacos despite the ordeal. Anyhow, just watch out for this kind of thing. I know it seems silly to trip about $2, but it is the way the situation was handled that can make any meal turn sour. Luckily, there is a Tacos El Gordo in San Diego."}
{"text":"How do I give this place more than 5 stars?! I walked in without really knowing what I was looking for. It's kind of at the end of the strip and I just wanted some tacos. Let me just say this, BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD!!! Maybe it's the combination of day drinking and starvation from the Vegas lifestyle wearing in me down, but I can say I am 100% satisfied. They are like authentic street tacos you get on the side of the street in taco carts but they make sure they fill up the meat and sauces without being stingy on it. Definitely worth a stop. I know I will be coming here every time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"My carne asada tacos were dried. I was hoping it was going to be bomb, but it was not all that.  Tacos are small."}
{"text":"Bottom line - the tacos are awesome. Those that are giving this place a bad review are hating on the furniture (it's a hole-in-wall where you pay $2/taco - what do you expect??) and it not being authentic (we were the only white peeps in here so...). We had both the spicy pulled pork and the carne asada. A few pointers:
- There are a few different lines for a few different things - don't be afraid to ask someone who works there. 
- Lunch/brunch time on Sat or Sun is suicide...come either late night or on an off-meal time. 

I wish this place was near my house."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing and worth the sometimes long lines!  The food is 5 stars
The ordering method is HORRIBLE!!! I wish they could just make one line to order not 3 is so confusing and time consuming if you want 2 different types of tacos you have to stand in 2 different lines.  It's really not practical.
The restaurant experience I would rate a 2."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite authentic taco place in Arizona. I am a loyal foodie and I usually don't take too many chances once I've found the best of the best. The previous taco shop I preferred has limited late hours and has become overpopulated... If you're looking for great service , spotless (clean) environment , you can't beat tacos el Gordo! They're bi-lingual and friendly the meat portions and toppings were extremely generous and filling 2$/taco."}
{"text":"Ruined for life! The Al Pastor is as authentic as you can get! I'm from the central California Valley and the places that make it don't even come close. Worth the wait!  also try the sopes. The asada line is the longest line most people get in this line. This way you order is by getting in the line of type of meat you want."}
{"text":"Affaire absolument un endroit incontournable pour bien manger des tacos ,pas trop cher et très convivial"}
{"text":"A short distance from all the commercialized mayhem of The Strip is a little taste of Tijuana. Tacos El Gordo is open late. Until what time you ask? No one knows, just late. The line was trailing out the door at 2am and the tables were filled with hungry people devouring tacos. Tacos al pastor, asada, chorizo, lengua all of simmering and steaming up the protective glass. Tacos are about $2 each which is a little on the high end but they are So Good and So Worth it! Better than anything you'll find in a tourist trap."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas after hangover best place to eat im glad The aré back in las Vegas blvd"}
{"text":"This place very easily deserves my 5 stars
Their Tacos de Adobada tasted like sex in my mouth. Yup... if you don't believe me try one and try saying it doesn't taste that good. 

OMG if you are on vacation or even live here you have got to come try some of their tacos. I'm honestly not much of a taco guy. I usually stick to my burritos but I ordered 2 Adobada (spicy pork) tacos, 1 Lengua (tongue) , 1 Asada (beef ) and it more than filled me up. 

What makes this place special is their Tacos de Adobada
I know alot of places don't have this and thats why its awesome. 

Here is a tip though. It is confusing if it is your first time to order food here. You go up the counter to order what kind of meat you want with 4 or 5 people working behind the counter based on the meat of choice. Go all the way right say two Adobada tacos. The guy tacos up  right there and hands it to you. I asked for three types of tacos and he pointed down the line after I got the Adobada and so i moved to the next meat lady."}
{"text":"I don't know what else to say besides the fact that I've never tasted better tacos! 

One word: Adobada!  Oh my goodness yes!"}
{"text":"I didn't think they were better than my favorite taco truck.  Sorry, but too expensive for the size also."}
{"text":"Food was solid 4 stars.  I really enjoyed their tacos, fries, and horchata.  But man on man, what a chaotic place!!  We walked in thinking it wasn't as busy as we thought.  Yay!  But we didn't really understand their ordering system and ended up waiting way longer than we should have.  

If you are alone and want to eat different types of tacos and fries, you are screwed.  I felt like we needed at least three people to eat all we wanted.  So, first decide what you want from the menu.  Then determine which lines offer you those items.  Wait in line.  Get your food and go to the cashier by the entrance.  Find a spot and eat.  Ok, simple enough, it sound like, right?  Wrong!  The place was already packed at around 4PM on a Sunday and each line took forever because each person was getting like 10 tacos.  And forget it if you happen to wait in a wrong line.  By the time you realize it, you'll not want to wait again in the correct line.    

The food was great, but I don't know if I'd want to experience the the mayhem again.  Well...we'll see."}
{"text":"First time here, I really liked how you can order in English and they understand. They cut the pork in front of you and it's really delicious. I've never had such great tasting tacos before, definitely coming back and 5/5. I ordered adobada meat and it barely had any fat at all, although we also ordered carne asada fries and there's a bit more fat in that meat... still good though. I would recommend trying this place but if you have not been here before it's the best Mexican food I've tried in Vegas."}
{"text":"Super delicious, authentic mexican food. Gets pricey if you order a normal amount. They are small, so it does take more than a couple tacos to fill you up. The line is long all the time, so expect to wait but in the meantime, it is fun to watch all that is happening."}
{"text":"Overrrated. Expensive. Way better places to eat and visit in Vegas so don't waste your time here. And what kind of Mexican place doesn't have burritos??? Disappointed."}
{"text":"Tacos are good. The tortillas are delicious. They offer grillled onion & jalapeños. 

Only 3 stars for 3 reasons.
1. VERY long line. There is security that organizes the lines but there were many people cutting in front or sneaking through the side door to order. Seriously, a family of 12 walked right past everyone and stood in the \"coveted\" carne asada line. 
2. The staff is a little rude - but I get it they are busy. We ordered 20 tacos and when I got my onions & jalepenos I only got 2 jalepenos. I asked for more and the lady said there were a lot of people and she couldn't give me more. 
3. The whole system is backwards. If they had people pay first and call out numbers it would go faster and they wouldn't lose money like the groups I saw who got there food and sat down and ate without paying. 

You can see a lot going on because you are in line for so long."}
{"text":"The ordering process is horrible. We waited for an hour in line and they were out of the food we wanted, chorizo. I guess if you want to order the chorizo taco azteca, get there before 11am. There was no seating and people were literally eating on top of the trash cans outside. The food was ok, but you can tell they rushed everything. We got the asada fries and they weren't even warm enough to melt the cheese."}
{"text":"Still very good the second time around. The TACO highlights:

LA LENGUA (beef tongue)
ADOBADO (pork)
CARNE ASADA (beef steak)

Those are a MUST. All super full of flavor, with that good salty seasoning tast. Very rich and tender in meat. The line is usually really long for the Lengua so you know it's good. I spend a good $10.00 for 4 tacos and a drink. I call that a good steal because really I tapped out at my 3rd taco.

I want to try their fries one day, but do beware as I heard that it is very filling even for a big eater. A GOOD PLACE FOR AFTER THE CLUB SOBRIETY FOOD and LUNCH TIME DROP IN AFTER A LONG WALK ON THE STRIP and IF YOU'RE BALLING ON A BUDGET."}
{"text":"Being from San Diego and having spent a lot of time in Mexico, these tacos are about as authentic as you can find.  I'm pretty sure they are horrible for you, but they're tacos...what do you expect?

What I like is that everything is made to order.  It doesn't sit under a heat lamp getting all dried out and rubbery.  The tortillas are hand made right in front of you.

Oh...if they only sold tacos con birria de res...one can only wish."}
{"text":"Bomb.com!! 

After a great concert my hunger was high, and a yelp search happen to come across a taco spot on the strip that seemed letigimate and authentic.....  Grab a taxi and request Tacos El Gordo. Right at the tip end of the strip on this strip mall location (across from a walgreens) we reached our destination I open the door and the whiff Mexico tacos! You know the ones you would smell when you'd go across the border before all the violence?! Yes! Those! 

The BF and I ordered:
      -a carne asada Mulita (it's like two tortilla's with melted cheese, guacamole, steak pieces, cilantro, onions, hot sauce)
     -Two carne asada tacos (beef steak tacos)
     -Two lengua tacos (tongue): super good, just the way lengua should be, be cautious of the green hot sauce which is flavorful but spicy! 
     -El Vampiro (this was similar to the \"mulita\" but the tortilla crispy/burnt like and I don't think it had melted cheese)


The tortillas are freshly made so the taste is delicious. Warm, not tough, soft tortillas.... Also note the tortillas are small.

It is very small on the inside but have more seating available on the outside. 

You come out with a happy filled belly and your long locks smelling like tacos.... Oh yeah and its extremely affordable. 

Hidden gem on the strip of Vegas when in search of good cheap food! I will definetely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ate their again tonight. Great food. I love the spicy Pork and Quesadillas plus all the flavored drinks. The guys making the tacos were nice and got the job done as always. I Will be definitely coming again."}
{"text":"Decent tacos, piss poor restaurant.  

Lunch line was 45+ minutes.   They have 3 lines which is incredibly confusing.   No help from any employee, which would help the line move faster.    

Outside, in the 100+ degree weather there are no fans, no misters, no service.

Tacos were like $1.40-$2.00 each, and not worth the wait.    I'd much rather pay $15 for 3 tacos at CABO WABO that are made with much higher quality ingredients and taste a whole lot better."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best taco spot I've ever had. The carne Asada, chicken, and beef tongue taco are all good, but You have to try the spicy pork taco, it's the best taco there for sure! El Gordo puts a special house sauce on it and you're going to want more than one. Don't forget to try out their carne asada fries and spicy pork fries that comes with the same sauce  on the taco #BOMB  They also carry all of the original Mexican drinks like Horchata, tamarind, orange whip, and melon juice. Last thing they carry if you wanted a snack or candy are little tamarind balls (located right next to the check out counter)"}
{"text":"The food is great! The system for ordering and paying could be much more efficient. Their lines are separated by meat selection. 2 for al pastor, one for carne asada and another for other meats. You'll usually wait in line to get in, another line to order and a third line to pay. The food is good though."}
{"text":"Tried this on Saturday while we were in Vegas and we're looking for something to eat for lunch, walking in there are multiple lines, alternating deponga on what you plan to order. If you wanted al pastor you went in one line and any other kind of meat you went to a separate line. My boyfriend and I both ordered 2 tacos de al pastor each and a small side of carne asada fries. The fries were not that great, that's why they are not getting the full 5 stars. They didn't have enough cheese and were mostly covered in their avocado sauce, and although it is good, I like my carne asada fries to be cheesy. Now the tacos were absolutely delicious! Fresh hand made tortillas, and the meat was delicious, I wish I had ordered more tacos and skipped the fries"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  We have a new favorite place for tacos.  Adobada is second to none.  You must try the Mulas."}
{"text":"When you haven't had dinner, it is 1am and you are close to the strip...this is the place to go.  Definitely hits the spot.  I highly recommend the carne asada mulas on a corn tortilla!  GRUB!!!!"}
{"text":"I mean, can't really go wrong with this place especially when you're coming from a long drive, it's 1AM and you're just craving some good old tacos. Frequented different locations, this one twice. 1AM on a week night and the place is still poppin' one hour before closing? BOMB. 

Adobada, that's the favorite. Carne Asada is a safe bet. The tacos are simple and delicious. The quesadillas are not your regular quesadillas. This one comes in a small tortilla (same size as the tacos) with melted cheese and then \"everything on it\" (guac, cilantro and onions) and a piece of a tostada. Think open-faced quesadilla with a chip to scoop the goods. Tastes so good. 

Definitely a go to taco spot... especially in Vegas. LOL."}
{"text":"Authentic, affordable and very good. The only thing that I don't like is the way they have the lines setup but oh well, the quality makes up for what this place lacks in service. The quality is over the top in so many ways. The drive through doesn't work but oh well, this is more of a lunch place rather than a dinner place but we do go there for dinner fairly often."}
{"text":"This is very simple.

Best taco's in town! You have to try them all, over time I have and haven't had a bad one but my favorite is one churizo and one asada. 

I go here as often as I can when I can.

The price is always right, the carne asada fries are amazing. The service is very good for a a walk up type of place."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! My boyfriend and I are great fans! They are not too spicy or bland. The employees really know what they are doing. Looks clean and sanitary for a fast food taco spot."}
{"text":"This was our first stop after reaching Vegas. Lucky for us, the wait was not long or crazy (what this location is known for).The line to order may be different depending on what you want. We tried the Adobada tacos (spicy pork) & asada. The Adobada tacos are sooooo good!Ask for pineapple strips (which add a nice sweetness). There is a drink fountain with flavors like Tamarind. The condiment bar was super clean with limes and radishes. Well maintained!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! This ones super clean and not crazy busy I think I really like this location 
The lines went long 
The workers were nice and super helpful 
The tacos were great! Just not as dirty as the one on the strip but still just as good! 
It was easy getting the food and finding a seat and parking was super easy! Great location
Tacos:
Asada was great
Al pastor was amazing! Reminded me of Cabo street taco stands 
Seso(brain) amazing! My fav! 
lenuga(tongue) cooked very well
cavesa(head) was amazingly good 
bucha(stomach) was cooked to perfection! 
Tacos are all about $2ish 
The best was the sopes mmhhh! Super delishious! With that guacamole sauce 
?? If I'm correct lol"}
{"text":"Overrated and over priced. Decent tacos but nothing to rave about, prices are ridiculous."}
{"text":"One of the most legit taco spots I've been to!  Looks somewhat sketchy from the outside and not much english on the menu, but the tacos will blow you away.  Stumbled upon this place not knowing anything and now that I'm back in LV I want to go eat here."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. Quite a chaotic scene, but worth the wait. Would be nice if they had rice, beans and chips."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty very good tacos. Probably the best Mexican in Las Vegas.  It's just too crowded in the restaurant and the line is very long."}
{"text":"Some friends from out of town stumbled upon this place.  We went there and the line was out the door.  You walk up, order, and then pay.  They make the food to order right in front of you.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Let me just say everything I had was absolutely delicious. I would go back anytime.

Really wasn't sure what to expect. Though it might be a tourist trap but looking around at the clientele quick dispelled that thought. Menu was easy to read but descriptions are lacking, so be ready to do some quick searching with your mobile. Next up was the intimidation factor of ordering. But workers seemed friendly enough once at the counter.

Unique ordering system - be prepared to wait in multiple lines depending on the type of food you want. Best to visit with 2 or three friends so each can get in a different line. Seating is adequate but generally the place is packed and you may have to wait to sit inside."}
{"text":"This place has great street tacos!! Just be sure to look over the menu beforehand, the staff members speak mostly Spanish. This makes it difficult to communicate if you only speak English.  The pastor tacos are amazing!"}
{"text":"Come on. Who doesnt know tacos el gordo in vegas? This place is the best to get tacos. Specifically their al pastor tacos. I can eat a total of 6 of them all by myself. Im glad they have added security to guide the lines. I recommend going earlier in the day because late evening/night it gets extremely busy with drunk and hungry people. But this place is a must have whether youre visiting or youre a  local"}
{"text":"Are you having a dry spell. Are you in need of a food-gasm? This is the place to go for some authentic food south of the border!!"}
{"text":"Dropped by around 1:30am and it was PACKED. Good thing they close at 4am on Fridays and Saturdays! 

You go in and order first, then pay. There are three different lines depending on what you're ordering, so make sure to save time and get in the right line :) We got tacos de cabeza ($2), lengua ($2.25), and adobada ($2), and a half order of adobada fries. All the meats were tasty, especially the lengua. So tender, mmm. My only gripe is that I wished they put more meat on our tacos and fries! 

Would I be back to this Tacos El Gordo? Maybe. I like it, but I don't know if I would go out of my way or make it a point to get food here, especially with all the food options available in sweltering LV ;)"}
{"text":"Food is good, price is decent, place is spacious, but very slow that is not necessary to be. 
Good for first time try Taco in Vegas. 
Not good for hungry people. It can turn you down due to the line"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas. That is all. Also, the carne asada fries are pretty good too. It seems to stay busy most of the time but get your taco fill here."}
{"text":"Walked in and as mentioned by other people the ordering process is chaotic.  The noise level in this place is crazy and you can't hear the guy cooking the meat when placing your order.  My son was with me and he could not hear him either.  He had to repeat everything 2 or 3 times.  I love chicken - I can't believe that an establishment would NOT serve chicken.  We ordered the Taco Asata instead (Steak).  The meat was tough and stringy and not seasoned to my liking.  We also got a quesadilla.  The cheese was spongy more like egg then cheese.  My son ordered onions and peppers on the side.  The items were not cut but served whole.  They were also not regular onions but spring onions.  One of them came lodged in my throat and I literally had to pull it out with my hand.  Awful.
Over $13 for 4 street sized taco / quesadillas and 2 soda cans.  They will never see us again."}
{"text":"I've had tacos on the east coast, west coast, and in between and this place is the best! I can't ever  leave Vegas without having eaten here at least 3 times! (I saw they also have locations in California) 

Adobada tacos are the way to go with extra salsa and some limón and rabanos. The carne asada fries weren't my favorite, but hubby is obsessed! Another thing I don't like is that it seems that the way the line is set up makes things move slower, but I guess it works for them. I'm not mad. I'll wait as long as I have to for these AMAZINGGGGGGG TACOS!"}
{"text":"They tried to steal from me!
Don't get me wrong. This is my favorite taco spot, but I went in tonight on a usually busy time for them. I ordered my tacos and went to the cashier. I ordered 6 tacos and she charged me for 9. Not only that, she charged me for the most expensive tacos. Thank God I checked my receipt. So when I brought it to their attention, the lady tells me that she can only give me more tacos, and she can't give me my money back. Somebody done told her wrong. I demanded to see the Mgr. And she changed her tune and brought me what she said was my money due. CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS PEOPLE."}
{"text":"We took a cab to Tacos El Gordo as it is past the Wynn on the strip and our cab driver was SO EXCITED to take us there. He absolutely loves the food. We took this as a sign and ordered a bunch. My favorite thing was the carne asada fries. It's a large container of fries with carne asada, sour cream, guacamole/spicy green and cheese. We also go the pastor and lengua tacos. My husband really enjoyed his tacos. They were tasty but with the fries, the quality of the asada meat starts to show itself. I couldn't handle eating too much of it. It was fatty and tasted low quality. Again, people without meat phobias were really enjoying this place. My husband did say that the lingua was the best he has ever had. 
Tip for newcomers: go to the window/bar/ordering area and order. When you get your tacos, go pay at the counter and they will provide you with a cup for a drink. Then you can sit down. This was a very confusing process... probably shouldn't have been but you know how it is in a new place."}
{"text":"My friends and I love to try new taco places and since we were here in Las Vegas, we gave this place a try.

The food was delicious; very juicy and tasty. I would definitely recommend the tacos adobada, probably some of the best I've ever had. It had a very interesting and robust flavor.

I didn't care too much for the carne asada tacos, they were a bit chewy and cold. Still delicious though. 

The service was great and kind. I will definitely come back here when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"I was here for 24 hours and I ate here twice.  If that doesn't convince you to try it, I don't know what will.  Amazingly, both times I stopped in, there were no lines.  I don't know how I managed that because, according to other reviews, it's always busy.  When it is busy, make sure you get in the right line.  If you're in the Asada line and you want adovada, you're SOL.  Stand in line according to what type of tacos you want.  I love the pork because it has a spicy/sweet sauce on it and lots of crunchy onions.  They also have Orange Bang! which makes this girl super happy.  If you actually want a cheap delicious meal on the strip, this is one of the few places you'll find one."}
{"text":"I'm coming here everytime I come to Vegas!!! It was my first time coming here and I'm glad it was my last stop before heading home. 

Ordering System: after waiting in line to get into the place, you wait in the line of the meat you want. So al pastor has their own line and the other meats are in another. After ordering, you go to the register and pay. 

Food: GET THE AL PASTOR!!! It's what they're known for. They top it off with a red salsa, a creamy green salsa (they call it 'guacamole'), and onions and cilantro. FYI the salsas have a kick! Luckily I didn't get any asada. It looked dry and my friend said it wasn't that good. They also have meat and fries, quesadillas, and I think mulitas. 

Price: each taco is $2.95 which is kinda pricey for a small taco, buy hey it's Vegas and it tastes really good. A regular drink is $1.75 and that's including horchata and jamaica (it comes from a soda machine, but still good) and unlimited refills. 

Service: nothing bad, nothing too great either. COME FOR THE FOOD"}
{"text":"Tacos el Gordo! 
You rock my world!!! 

First met you 4 years ago, to this day I've returned countless times and will continue to do so. 

If you are hungry and on a budget stop by here!
If you got a hangover and need delicious tacos to sober up, stop by here.
If you want to avoid walking through casinos to eat somewhere, stop by here.
If you want to park and walk straight to your destination, stop by here.
If you love al pastor, stop by!!!

The menu is so plain and short! I love it
The food is made to order & its quick! 
Corn tortillas are made fresh daily right in front of you. Watching the guy cut the spicy pork off the shawarma grill was an experience in its self. Food should always be made with love and thankfully thats the vibe i get from Tacos El Gordo. 

Craving it as Im writing this :/"}
{"text":"This place might be the most chaotic taco shop you've ever stepped foot into, but it might be the best you've ever had. 

Before you enter, know that there are three separate lines for food. Each line represents a variety of different meats - just take a gander at the sign in front of each window to see if your favorite protein falls under that category. The crappy part? If you want multiple types, then you need to stand in different lines. That's why the buddy system works wonders, especially if you all want a little of everything. Even then we still ended up consuming partially cold food because we were greedy and wanted stuff from each of the queues in the restaurant.

I heard this is a step up from the previous location that had almost no seating. We came on a Friday night and it was definitely jam packed with peeps, but we were able to secure a table for four without any problems. Again, this is where the buddy system comes into play and everyone needs to do their due diligence - it's almost fun how you all need to work together to ensure you don't starve at the end of it all.

I would run down each of the taco meats we had, but the spicy pork, chorizo and asada variations were all delicious. Not only that, they were STUFFED with meat and I had to eat some with a fork before trying to finish it off with my hands. No complaints as every morsel was absolutely fantastic. I do think the extra love and flavor comes from their amazing handmade, in-house created tortillas. Those things were perfecto in my eyes.

One thing that is a must is their asada fries. You're able to get it with any meat, but the beef was fab. We got the large to share amongst four, full grown adults and we barely finished. We were so full after the various tacos we had just pounded that it took a lot of courage and energy to muster up the strengeth to finish this heaping amount of delicious fries topped with steak, guac, cheese, and sour cream. You're gonna feel like you're about to give birth when you're done, but every bite is worth the pain you'll feel after over eating.

Parking is a cinch as they share spaces with a huge shopping center.

If you're in Vegas, you have to check this place out. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"My apologies to every taqueria I hold near and dear to my heart...this place is hands down the best I have ever been to.  Our office goes to Vegas a couple times a year and we all CRAVE Gordos.  Cabeza tacos are my favorite but there is one thing so ridiculously good that we never see even in California...mulas.  For God's sake make sure you get mulas, they are heaven and you'll be hard pressed to find them anywhere else.  Go here and make it part of your Vegas experience, be sure to thank me later..."}
{"text":"Not my favorite.  This is the 3rd time I have been here.  I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and went back but I dont think I will be back.  The lines are always ridiculous, no type of organization and barely any room to fit customers who want to dine there.  Aside from these, my main complaint is the steak itself, I was not a fan.  Kind of flavorless and chewy.  I guess I was expecting more.  There are better taco places in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing especially the carne Asada. However, it's very easy to get confused with how they ordering works and especially if you are vacationing from the city other than Vegas, which about 43.1 million people do every year lol"}
{"text":"This was a favorite when we were living in Vegas. Definitely get the El Pastor. Tip: There are different lines depending on what you're going to order (Pastor is on the right) so pay attention before you get in line. People usually won't tell you until you're already at the front, and by then it's too late, and the lines get long."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!! I got the carne asada tacos and it was so good I wanted more, but I also got carne asada fries so I had way too much food. The carne asada fries were good but I've definitely had better. It was missing pico!! If it had it on there, I think it would have been a lot better. The tacos were SUPER good. I wish I got more and these tacos are only $2 each! (and it comes with guac!). 

It's kinda at the edge of the strip right after Encore, but don't worry because there are tons of people still walking around at 2 or 3 am! (:

*CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I am a VERY picky eater when it comes to Mexican food. My standards for taste are high, thus I am ALWAYS hesitate in trying Mexican food. However, we were walking down the strip to our hotel and came across this place. My husband wanted to go in, so we did. We had tacos de adobada and pastor that were AMAZING! So delicious! We came back the next day for lunch. My husband and I shared the carne Asada fries, which is big enough for 2 or more to share. It was really good. He stated the fries were salty but I didn't notice. I also got 2 tacos de carne Asada that were good. My husband for 1 taco de lengua and 1 buche, he stated that both were good. We also got an horchara that was not bad. In the side you could order grilled onions and chiles which was great. They also have lime and radishes. The food was great. I would definitely come again and tell people that I know about this place. I wish we had a place like this in Northern California."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting. I don't know why but they are racists towards Asians and don't care about quality. The food was undercooked and cold while the tortilla was stale. On top of everything there was a hair in my tortilla and they wouldn't issue a simple refund because they are stingy and greedy. Stay away from this location. Tons of better places down the strip from here that are so much better for the same price. 

Always check for your food for hairs at this place"}
{"text":"I have been complaining for years that there are no fast food mexican spots in vegas to go to after clubbing. Not till one of my friends said we should go try this spot. I was like there is no way there is a legit mexican spot in vegas and I do not know about it. Well I was definitely wrong. I ordered the adobado fries kind of like carne asada fries but better. It was pretty good in my opinion. The good thing is it is walking distance from surrender and xs! Definitely going to be going to this spot more often when I am vegas, because EARLS is just an overprices subway. Just saying."}
{"text":"Ugh this place is frkn amazing! I love, love tacos and every time we are in Vegas I crave them, weird I know! So I was so happy to find Tacos el Gordo! The tacos are very flavorful, the salsas are good, I just wish they had a hotter one for us chile lovers.. The tortillas are amazing, I love the smell they have ( reminds me of Mexico).  The lengua tacos are so good, the lengua aka tongue is very tender, definitely a must try!  Can't wait to try more stuff off their menú!"}
{"text":"Growing up in los Angeles and making trips to Tijuana in my late teens to party should tell you I've got experience in eating my share of great tacos. 

Tacos el gordo saved my life when I moved to Vegas. Price is fair. But seriously so good!!! I've been looking for this style tacos, Homemade style!!! 

They turn tables pretty quickly. I've been pretty lucky I always seem to get there right before a large crowd. Don't let lines intimidate you they are quick. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"BEST tacos ever!!  Literally!  Every time I make a trip out to Las Vegas, I have to stop by this taco joint!  By far the best tacos everrrrr!!  There are usually a line out to the door, but that's a given since its simply the best!  There is also a taco salsa which is great! The workers are always so nice, but very pushy, only because everyone is ready to chow down on their tacos!"}
{"text":"WOW! This is a great taco spot. Come prepared to wait in line, but it will be worth it. As  mentioned before the line system is very complicated. You line with the taco your ordering. There was a security person at the door when we arrived. She was very helpful in pointing people in the direction that need to go.

Very affordable for the strip and delicious. Make sure to bring an appetite. Also there is not much seating, so be prepared to order to go."}
{"text":"I will tell you that the line for this is unbelievable all the time. HOWEVER, for a 24 hour taco shoppe in the heart of Las Vegas, what isn't a wait. 

I came here with a group of seven around midnight on a Saturday. I grabbed a table outside and chatted with the security guard by the door. My friends proceeded to go in and wait in the 40 minute line which had been out the door since we arrived. 

40 minutes later and a lot of dead bugs on the table in front of me from the fluorescent bulbs above, the food was served hot and ready. Just from tasting their salsa selection was fresh and delicious, giving its own spice to the flavor. I got two tacos for a decent price and carne asada fries. Overall the food was incredible! 

There are a lot of make believe Mexican food joints scattered through our Vegas however this one represents and is delicious. The food was great with their own spices and peppers to the mix, truly a traditional Mexican style of cooking. 

Sadly I dock one star for the ridiculousness of the wait and one for the cleanliness of the lobby and outdoor seating. Good place to visit, not so much to stop."}
{"text":"Worst staff ever! I understand theirs a lot of people and their busy but after waiting 40 min for Asada fries my husband finally asks how much longer and they actually forgot the dam order!!!! We came all the way from California to try this place!!! My husband tries to get our money back and the cashier has an attitude! Did not give us our money back got our fries 20 min later!!! Seriously!!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't have a huge variety of food options but whatever it does have is delicious to me! My personal favorite would have to be the \"Carne Asada fries\". They have two sizes (small or large) but lemme tell you, the small size is sufficient enough for one person, unless you have a huge appetite, like me, then just go for the large! The service is decent but it's pretty quick, for the most part. Definitely a good place to grab a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"All that hype and all that talk is definitely worth the 1 hour wait! The BEST tacos I've had in so long. I wouldn't recommend going here if you're a vegetarian, if you wait in that big line for a quesadilla be ready to see the cow brains slowly sizzling in some pot. haha 
And for all you meat lovers don't miss out on these tacos, I had basic Asada tacos and a quesadilla with meat and it was amazing. Great taco spot and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. If you feel like Mexican food this place is a perfect choice. But it wouldn't work if you are on the diet... The portions are huge. Lol"}
{"text":"Eh, the first time i went here i was pretty drunk, and my last memory of it that was sooo good. I thought how? im vegatarian i dont even eat meat, but they have grilled cactus and i had a sope of \"nopales\", guacamole, cilantro and cheese. Now that i went back sober, it wasnt as good as i remembered, but then again this is from someone who has not tried all their tacos, adobado fries or asada fries which smelled painfully good."}
{"text":"Yummy! I don't usually go for Mexican food but it was late, we were near Fremont Street Experience, and looking for some good cheap eats. The first thing you notice when you walk up to this place is the smell -- in a good way! Imagine the mouthwatering smell of a ton of roasting meat and spices wafting out into the parking lot preparing you for the tastiness inside. 

They offer a bunch of different taco fillings with unusual meat cuts such as beef head (cabeza) and beef tongue (lengua), along with the more standard steak and pork, all for $2.00 each. We got the cabeza, lengua, asada, and adobada. They were all really good, especially the adobada. The meat was very tender, and the seasoning was extremely tasty. 

We also tried out the fries, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're in a hurry because it takes them a while to make. It's probably better just order a few more tacos which you can get within minutes. But it did taste pretty good; it's got fries mixed in with a bunch of meat, cheese, guac, and sour cream. Definitely share with a friend because it is huge!"}
{"text":"If you are craving for good taco truck quality taco? This is a place to go. It's open 24hour, normally crowded, parking convenient, and condiments are always available. Absolutely must-try taco place on las Vegas blvd!"}
{"text":"Man. Working I'm working in town and heard about this place . Had to try there Adobada.. Heaven .... If your  in Las Vegas you gotta try them .."}
{"text":"i am a 23 latino man who has had tacos all his life. i can honestly say that these tacos are on of my top three all time best. there is always a giant line for a reason. you can see a sence of pride in the food these guys make. i dont like the fact that there is never any seats and that the lines are way too long but the tacos are so great that i must give this play a perfect rating."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is the only place to go for real authentic tasting tacos at very affordable prices!  Located right on the strip, this is a very popular spot and is usually very busy.  They have a tasty selection of food to choose from.  I ordered the Tacos Adobada (spicy pork) and Tacos Asada along with a Sope Asada .  The Tacos Adobada was sooo mouth watering delicious! The pork was so tender and the salsa sauce was flavorful.  The Asada tacos and Sope were really good too, but the Adobada was the winner.

When it is crowded (which is usually all the time) ordering can be a little confusing, especially if it's your first time. They have several counters where the meat is prepared.  Above the counters are the menus the items you can order from that counter. You pick up a tray go to the counter and place your order. They prepare the food in front of you. While at the counter you can also order grilled jalapenos and green onions. Very yummy.  

After you visited the counters you go to the register to pay and also order any drinks.   Then you find a place to sit and enjoy. There is also a salsa cart with a variety of salsas fresh radishes, and limes. They offer free refills on the fountain drinks.  The inside seating is limited, but they also offer outside seating as well. 

Family owned straight out of Tijuana! They keep the prices affordable, $2 tacos! So please don't forget to Tip!! If you like the authentic feel and taste of a real taqueria, then Tacos El Gordo is a must stop when visiting Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Some great authentic street tacos! I could eat here everyday! The tacos were a plump and full. The tortillas were delicious, reminded me of my nanas!"}
{"text":"There are a few Tacos el Gordo around town... stop now because this is THE one.  The \"trompo\" is always so hot and glistens with spices and herbs as it roasts by the flame, the \"piña\" on top is always succulent and sweet.  Yes, at times the line is out the door, but the wait is always worth it for the tacos al pastor.  You never buy enough as each neatly packaged taco slides down effortlessly.  It is a beautiful experience when washed down perfectly with a \"Mexican\" coke.  Hint*. Bring your own bottled Mexican coke, as it is not always available here*.  All in all, you may as well be on the streets of Mexico City / Chilangolandia / taco heaven when you enter this establishment.  The best usage of this building ever (looks to have been a 1980's Wendy's). 5 stars hands down, just a beautiful joint!"}
{"text":"I have to admit this main reason I look forward to coming to Las Vegas. By far the best taco place on this side of the border. The carne asada tacos and pork tacos are unbelievable and well worth any line you might have to wait in. The place is run like a well oiled machine and is cafeteria style."}
{"text":"I used to tell my wife\" come on there not all that\" when I was urged to go to El Gordos. Ok.I am no.longer in denial. Best tacos in Vegas. First timers and newbies stick with the Adobada with the green sauce. Bomb.com Mulitas, Adobada fries and tacos...all excellent
 There is a reason this place is always packed when every shop around it is empty. Cabesa is pretty good too. EVERY time we go to Vegas I stop by here."}
{"text":"Pretty dam good. Lines take awhile during evening rush hour here. Very popular place!"}
{"text":"Can't stay away. Despite the crowds and overpriced tacos lol. For some reason I keep finding myself back at this joint on the strip, drunk or sober ... It's something about the al pastor mulas. Pro tip though, don't get the quesadillas. They're almost 5 bucks for a little cheese on a tiny tortilla. Other than that, tacos el Gordo is a staple wherever you go"}
{"text":"I went to Tacos el Gordo a couple of weeks ago because of the other yelp reviews and just had to add my 2 cents. This place has absolutely fabulous authentic taco stand food! I do have to say that I did subtract a star for the fries. I shared the adobada fries and the fries were a little limp and weren't really cooked long enough. But the adobada was wonderful! I wish I had just gotten the tacos or a burrito instead and skipped the fries.  I also had a carne asada taco that was just perfect. Overall, the food is really, really good. It can get a little hectic when it is busy, but not overly so, I don't think and I think the separate lines, besides being a necessity for the different items, also speed the process. The check out process could be a little more efficient as far as getting from the food lines to the check out, but they have two cash registers, so that is helpful. I am going back tonight because this is one of those places that once you have been, you keep thinking about when you can go back."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place! 
Easy parking. Not too much of a wait line. Lines are based on what you want to order.  Order first, then pay before you head out the door.  

Hubby and I had:
- asada tacos 
- al pastor tacos 
- asada mulas (had no idea what it was, but everyone else ordered it) 
- grilled green onions and peppers
- horchata
- orange bang

Asada tasted better than al pastor
Mulas - tortilla, cheese, meat, gauc, and salsa

All the food was delicious!  Next time, we'll skip the drinks.  Cooking staff worked fast!  And mostly friendly. 

Yes, I would come back!"}
{"text":"Its hard to describe how amazing this place is. I'm not sure what kind of sorcery they put on their recipes but this place changed my life. The tacos are out of this world the bomb. I mean, I'm from Chicago. Everyone knows we have the best of the best when it comes to authentic, local, organic and or  quality food. You name the country we've got the restaurant and its legit. However, this taco stand reigns supreme on any Mexican taco joint I've ever tasted in Chicago. Getting here was a blur. I was drunk and in tears from missing my flight that night. My cousin took us in a cab and it took what felt like forever to get here from the strip. According to my cousin they used to be located on the strip but I guess they relocated because they couldn't keep up with the demand  it was just way too busy there. We finally got there and the line was long AF. I was still drunk and crying so my cousin sat on rock with me outside consoling me while his fiance and my hubby went inside to order. After about 30 minutes in line they emerged with a giant tray of tacos, cebollitas, jalapenos and horchatas. We all drunkenly sat on the floor and ate with our hands like savages in the night. My husband said he saw an older woman making the tortillas by hand. You could totally tell the tacos were so good. By the time we finished I had sobered up about 20% and felt wayyyyy better. Just as we realized we were on the floor in the middle of nowhere, we started trying to figure out how to get back to the strip. Suddenly, a man in a security outfit emerged and started walking toward us. My cousin freaked out because he thought we were in trouble so he blurted out to the stranger in uniform \" No Habla Espenol!\". The stranger than replied in perfect English, \"Sir, I work here I'm headed back to the strip, just wanted to see if you folks needed a ride?\" We accepted his ride, jumped in his taco truck and laughed all the way back to the strip. Good times, good times....."}
{"text":"The carne asada fries are great.  Everyone here is very friendly and helpful.  The ordering procedure is a little weird whereby you need to line up and order by what type of meat you want and then pay at a detached cashier station.  I went to the wrong line, but still got assisted."}
{"text":"Lengua tacos are tha bomb, on fresh handmade tortillas. Pina drink is a nice treat. Line system is a little ridiculous - different lines for different meats - which makes it a pain to try different meats. Carne asada was not as good as the lengua."}
{"text":"These tacos remind me of the tacos from Mexico. Everything they include tastes like it came straight from Mexico."}
{"text":"Nothing beats their Carne Asada Fries and their Abodaba (spicy pork) tacos. Its pretty cool to see the Abodaba chef strip the pork from the hanging meat thing. They work pretty damn fast too. Grab a tortilla, strip the meat onto the tortilla, put some lettuce, add some sauce. BAM. Repeat.

The one thing that threw me off here was that there were so many lines for different things. Whoever organized this.. didn't organize this. Theres a line for Asada. Theres a line for Abodaba. Theres a line for fries. Theres a line for beef tongue/tripe/shoulder. And... once you thought that was all done theres a line for the cashier. If I came here drunk/hungover I would not have the capacity/patience to take this all in. Which is probably some of the customers, since this is Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas many times but never had the chance to pass by this place but so happy I stopped by this time the food is absolutely delicious the cooks are super friendly. The tacos of Al Pastore are super super amazingly i'm tasty. The sauce that they put on all the tacos are very good not spicy at all gifts at the perfect extra touch. I recommend this place if you're looking for some on authentic Mexican tacos"}
{"text":"Was so glad to see this next to my Hotel Encore! The Al Pastor Tacos hit the spot 3 am in the morning .  We back the next day and this time had one person on another line getting different tacos .  They need to figure another system. U can wait A LONG TIME just to get one type of taco.  Different lines different meat.. Very inconvenient."}
{"text":"WOW! I wish we had Tacos El Gordo back in LA.  I came here for the first time yesterday and i was impressed.  

My boyfriend and I ordered al pastor tacos and I ordered a suadero quesedilla and suadero tostada.  The al pastor meat was delicious, and I love how they put sliced pineapples on their tacos it was the perfect combination.  Their Grilled green onions and chilles were good too! Everything here was fresh and made to order.  Even their tortillas were made from scratch.  Another plus about this joint was unlimited refills of horchata.  the drinks were only $1.40 the Al pastor tacos were only $2.00, the Suadero tostada was $2.00 and the Suadero Quesedilla was $4.00.   

We left Tacos El Gordo full and satisfied.  We will be coming back our next visit to vegas.  This place is amazing and service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"my brother had tried this place out in san diego and he told me it was really good and we had to try it, so we came here late friday night and gave it a try the food was really good. we tried one of each of there tacos and all of them where good. we also tried a asade sope and a pastor sope and i was really impressed. the had a quessadia looking dish that had cheese meat guacamole and of course the tortilla that was also really good (probably my favorite) it was a great experience and i will definetly be back"}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a friend.  It was a pretty good experience and wouldn't hesitate to try again.  I was a little bummed that the selection of meats was limited.  I guess you live and learn.  

I had the choice of beef or pork as the other meats had already sold out.  Chose the pork and had three tacos with all the trimmings.  Service was pretty quick and food was good.  Wish you were able to get some chips or another side but hey it's a good taco stand.  

I would come back if I was in the area just to try the other meat options."}
{"text":"Amazing! Very crowded, but well worth the wait. TJ tacos in Vegas. Truly the best both worlds."}
{"text":"My bf and I had 2 tacos each, I had tacos de lengua (beef tongue).... They were so good!!! A bit pricey but totally worth it!  My bf had carne asada tacos and also said they were bomb! Definitely has that Tijuana taste."}
{"text":"Don't know what all the hype was about, tacos were dry and bland no flavor what so ever besides the onion and the cilantro I had on mine. Yea good price for a quick bite, maybe if you're drunk and starving they are good but I can think of far more places with WAYYY better tacos."}
{"text":"Best tripa in town !! Super crunchy and tasty ! They way it should be !! Great job guys !!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and came here. Super smoky but it reminds me of childhood while parents cooking. Food was so great and they handled rushes so well. Wish I could come back but it'll be a while!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype and bring your cash. These tacos are delicious flavorful and fresh. It's difficult to be a sane human being and not eat more than 5. My favorites are the chorizo and beef shoulder with all toppings. 

Not familiar with the menu ? The staff will help you decide with the choices. The place is 0 frills and all about the food. Seating is limited and nothing special so don't expect anything fancy. Just come here hungry and ready for fantastic tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing food and prices.    LOVED it.  People were friendly and food is quick.   Only thing that could be better is ordering is a little confusing at first."}
{"text":"Heard great review of this place from various cab drivers...however after standing in the line, looking at the menu there is no pollo taco ..very disappointed...try to include pollo taco if u can"}
{"text":"Only bad thing I have to day about this place is its always busy and have to wait. I guess that's a good thing. Tacos are to die for! Definitely got to try this at least once, twice or ......"}
{"text":"This place is cool but I've had better Mexican food. The carne asada tacos are good, not a fan of there guacamole. I've also had better. My family liked it. I can go without coming here again. I loved the different varieties of meat and the spicy pork is the best taco here and of course I love my Horchata..can't go wrong with that. It's always overcrowded and you have to go on a hunt just to get a seat. Good thing is it's open late a good place for a quick grub or after the club hunger in Vegas."}
{"text":"I made the mistake to try this place again based on reviews.. I had this bad experience at the one in Chula vista..  awful system. 
It is very terrible how they have lines for separate tacos..  then another line to pay.. super crowded place.. 
If you come here, be ready to eat cold tacos.. nasty.."}
{"text":"Omg this tacos are good with a bit small portion of meat but good the only problem is the service super bad u dont even know where the line starts and plus u stand on different lines  to get different meat so when u do like 100 lines finally u pay n  u have to look for table n when u finally are going to eat your tacos are cold n mad because all the time u did standing up please change your service"}
{"text":"My all time favorite taco shop in all of Vegas ! We will drive clear across town from our house just to have these ! Food is fresh and always hot and delicious! Come here every month at least if not more"}
{"text":"Wow! I'd have to say the tacos here are delicious. Flavor all around, tried 5 different kinds of tacos and all were great, service is fast. Greasy just as how most mexican tacos should be, but greasy in a good sort of way. Thumbs up! Gracias!"}
{"text":"Good tacos, long lines. More of a fast food place but don't let that detract you from coming. The loaded french fries were delicious"}
{"text":"This is where you want to eat! Delicious tacos, served hot with fresh ingredients. As an added bonus, it's super cheap!"}
{"text":"Nothing bears authentic Mexican tacos! I spent 8 yrs in Mexico so I can truly say this is the real thing! My husband is veggie and he had thevveggie quesadilla, spicy! I had 2 asado tacos and one spicy pork  with the lot! Delicious and Affordable!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and good pricing! The tortillas are unlike any other taco spot. They specifically have a certain salsa/guacamole for certain meats for the tacos. I wish there was a location near Los Angeles. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Chips were NASTY! Salsa was garbage...meat was grisly & the service was shitty. We got our chips & salsa 5 minutes prior to getting our meal. Not to mention we sat at our table for 20 min before the waitress addressed us! Had to find my own silverware! I would rate this restaurant a negative 5!"}
{"text":"Love love love the tacos here! We have been to the locations: Las Vegas, Tijuana & San Diego! All three locations never failed to impress! If you see a line, that's normal! Don't hesitate to jump in the line. The tacos are well worth it!"}
{"text":"Staff spoke minimal English, so ordering might be a challenge. It doesn't matter of you screw up your own order.  Whatever you get is going to be fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing super fresh tacos! They are literally cutting the meat up in front of you. Great pricing for being on the LV strip. Granted its in an area that might look a little scary to some people. I'd say go during the day, but I'm sure it's a great place for dinner or after drinks.

I can't believe it took me this long to finally try this place. (Because the other million times I've gone to Vegas)

I had the pastor and lengua. This might become a must visit next time I'm in town again."}
{"text":"By far the best meal I had in Vegas, even if you forget about the price/value."}
{"text":"Tacos de a pastor are bomb!! Dont get the tostadas they over cooked a dry. I also don't recommend  the quesadillas as they are just the same as the tacos with just cheese added on it.  I usually prefer asada tacos but i found it was a bit salty. It may have been just the batch i had so i would give it another go next time im in the area. 

The line are based on the meat you would like to order. Which can be a bit of down fall as most want steak and there are only 2 lines. I will say they do give you a lot of meat."}
{"text":"I love this place because it is close to my house and great as hangover food! Authentic Mexican cuisine! This place has seen many people who came in from around the world! Especially Senator Hilary Clinton came just for their food and the Hispanic community. 

They did sort of renovate a little by maximizing seating space and placing the register to one side of the room as the drink dispensary and condiment bar is on the other side making space accessible with no crowds.

They have 3 lines for certain orders that make it productively fast. They do dine in and take out orders. They have a fountain drink dispensary and bottled or can drink vendors too.  If you're a real Hispanic food enthusiast, you have to get their signature Horchatas! Or Fanta sodas lol.  Also, you can't forget the complimentary salad bar (sauces, sides)  and condiments for your order. 

Today I ordered 4 Small Adobada Tacos and a small box of Al Pastor Fries which came out to a total of $17.  

To me, that was way too pricey for a small portion. I do admit the Fries are big for a small order but they are not generous on the Al Pastor meat. I had way too much fries and too little meat on my plate. - if you do decide to go and get their Fries, make sure you tell them to put more meat in the meal. Let's see if they don't charge you extra for that lol. 

Overall, I still love their food. It would satisfy me if I could taste more of the meat I ordered for my fries"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I believe it is so much better than Roberto's taco shop here in Vegas. Actually better than most of the other taco shops in general. 

After out drunk bingo night, we decided to fill our stomachs up on the Las Vegas strip and found this place with a huge crowd lined up from the inside out to the edge of the sidewalks onto the street! Lol a little exaggerating but this place is always busy. I can't blame them because they're Mexican authenticity of their food is delicious especially after drinking in the night life. 

When you get to this place, it's so full they have to have security guard the doors to make sure is not over crowded and organizes the lines much easier that way. 

Now as you walk in, there is 3 stations to order from to make the lines quicker on what options you are going for. One line was for Al Pastors, second line was for Asadas, and third line was for others. I had to go with the Al Pastor and Carne Asada Fries  I RECOMMEND THESE OPTIONS! It's so good and full of meat, cheese, fries and toppings just loaded with carbs. 

The menu is pretty moderate on prices and still inexpensive for being on the Las Vegas blvd strip. For my Al pastor fries I only spent $8 and it is a huge serving good for 2-4 people."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food with a simple menu of 10-15 tacos $2/taco. We had el pastor tacos and beef tacos"}
{"text":"Well like always they are packed. No matter what location you go to there is a long line. Expect it for one of the greatest tacos you'll ever have in your life. I'm a big fan of the Adobada tacos but what ever you get from here you'll be happy you just came."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to stop by after reading @jOanne & @keith's reviews.

Good thing I read the reviews first because I walked in and immediately saw the large kitchen counter where you order....there are 3 ordering stations where you order directly from the cooks.  Since I already knew about it, I walked up like I knew what I was doing....until they started speaking to me in Spanish.....then I got a little flustered.

The menu is very simple....there are only a few things you can order and it's printed in large letters above the kitchen counter (see pics).  I decided I wanted to try the Chorizo Taco & Carne Asada Taco....and then curiosity got the best of me and I went for an order of Carne Asada Fries....they are $10 while the Tacos are $2....what does $8 more get you?  I was about to find out.  I threw $2 in a tip jar on the counter in front of the cooks and waited patiently for my order.

The food is homemade and made from scratch right in front of you....including the Tortillas.  You have to grab a tray and wait for your cook to make your order because they hand it to you right after they make it.  From there, you pay at a register on the other side of the room by the door....kind of like a Cafeteria in a Hospital or Convention Center.

My cook made me the two Tacos first and told me that he'd call my name for the Carne Asada Fries.  He asked me if I wanted everything on the Tacos...I said yes even though I had no clue what that meant....after I got the Tacos, I realized that it meant Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole, and Salsa....perfect!

I jumped right into the Chorizo Taco first....it was pretty good.  Good proportions on the toppings and the size of the Taco was decent, worth $2.  Next was the Carne Asada Taco....but before I could take a bite, the cook called my name for the Fries....when I picked it up I knew I was in trouble....the damn order of Fries was huge!  It must have weighed at least 3 to 4 lbs!  Seriously!  (see pics)

I finished off the Carne Asada Taco...which was pretty good.  The meat was fresh and cooked perfectly....it wasn't overcooked and didn't have too much fat on it.

Then I looked at the beast called Carne Asada Fries....no wonder this damn thing is $10....it can feed 4 people!  I knew there was no way I could finish it and felt bad because I was going to waste a lot of it.  I grabbed my fork and attacked it.....basically, it's French Fries (think McDonald's sized cuts) covered in Cheese, Guacamole, Carne Asada, Sour Cream, & some other kind of Cream.  The Fries were cooked just right....not too soft, not overcooked.  The flavor of the dish was awesome.

I gave it my best shot, but could barely finish just under 1/2 of the plate (see pics)....great value though....could easily feed 4 normal sized human beings.

The only gripe I had about the joint was a lack of a Salsa Bar....or Hot Sauce.....I would have loved to pour some on my food, but had to do without...that's what kept me from giving them 5 Stars.

Will I return?  Yep!  Next time, I'm bringing backup to help me with the Fries!"}
{"text":"The tacos were decent for a 2.5 hour wait. The taco was sort of soggy and they put way too much guacamole on top (about as much as there was meat). The meat itself was quite tasty but overall, I'm not sure it was worth the 2.5 hour wait."}
{"text":"Now that is one hell of a taco! \"Spicy pork\" shaved off a gyro-esq device, served hot and crispy. I loved it, but could use a bit spicier salsa."}
{"text":"Tried 3 tacos: asada, spicy pork, cabeza. Also had 1/2 asada 1/2 spicy pork fries. 
Everything was really good. Not best asada fries I've had though. Best taco was spicy pork. 
Good place to go for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Al pastor/abodadas are amazing!!! Wayy better then the asada. Tacos are seriously way better then rosarito in mexico tacos. Only downside is its always packed, and hard to find seats, but other then that food is great!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican tacos in Vegas!

I like ordering their carne asada quesadilla on a flour tortilla with all the dressings on it. 

Must check out and they just open another one on Las Vegas BLVD."}
{"text":"We love love this place we come everytime we are in vegas and we always go at least twice and still take some back to LA haha great experience great food lovely people! I totally recommend trying especially after a hangover it HELPS"}
{"text":"Went to this place today. Was a hefty walk to get there.  It is passed Encore a little ways.  As prior reviewers have said, there were long lines and long waits. We had a group of 3 and each person stood in a different line. The one waiting in the asada line didn't get their tacos until like 10 minutes after the other two finished eating. We had to eat outside because there was no indoor seating. Eating in 100 degree weather is not fun. 

The good part was that we highly enjoyed our meal. I had a tongue, head, shoulder and asada.  I liked the asada and shoulder best out of those. I also tasted the adoboda and chorizo. All three of us were pretty happy with our tacos. 

I give 4 stars bc of the wait and the fact we had to eat outside dripping in sweat. The food, though, was great. It's also fun watching the guys make the tacos right in front of you."}
{"text":"What a score. A total organized kitchen with authentic slow cooked meats ready for you fast food style. Tacos were super tasty and plenty of options available. Surprisingly no chicken but not a big deal for us. Wish I could have eaten twice as much didn't have a big appetite."}
{"text":"My friend Erin G. was craving some Mexican food and so she influenced me to get some carne asada and horchata. AY DIOS MIO. MUY BUENO!

Erin said, \"My tummy feels happy.\" My tummy agreed with her tummy. 

It was tummilicious... 

TUMMY APPROVED!

This was probably the best part of my trip. I wish they had this in NY."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very disorganized and the food was bland. It's a very busy locale and really need to add space and install a better way to order food.  Won't come back again."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Asada tasted ok, chorizo bland, al pastor great. Would of given more stars but the service sucked. The al pastor guy was nice, the asada guy and the register lady clearly didn't want to be there and as a customer I noticed. They were very serious no emotion, zero customer service. I asked the lady what kind of salsa she had and she said red or green. I asked her what kind of red salsa... Tomato or taquera and she just handed me the salsa and ignored me. Such a shame I heard nothing but great things about tacos El gordo from San Diego and figured this place in Vegas would be great too but no wrong. Last time coming here from LA."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place have 4.5 stars?!! I was so excited to try it because of all the good reviews. I got two steak tacos and two beef tacos and one spicy pork taco with grilled veggies. I'm highly disappointed the tacos were so nasty and the guacamole taste so mushy. Nothing special what a waste of space in my stomach."}
{"text":"$2.50 for amazing flavors! Stop here every chance I get! Staff is always friendly and food is prepared right in front of you...no hassles! The Adobada, Lingua, and Chavez's are Money!"}
{"text":"Sooo gooddddd my wife got asada tacos I got the asada fries everything was so fresh we will definitely be here again when we visit last Vegas...."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Tacos el Gordo for a long time. I always see such great reviews, especially for their Vegas location on The Strip. However, driving through Vegas, I did not want to deal with walking through The Strip in 110 degrees heat, so I decided to try their downtown location instead.
 
Parking: Easy to locate. It's in a huge shared lot in a shopping plaza. I found parking right in front of the restaurant!
 
Restaurant: It's so hot in Vegas during the summer, even the AC in the restaurant could barely keep anyone cool. It was extremely packed with limited tables. The ordering process is very confusing. There are 3 separate lines depending on what you want to order, you order first and pay after. The line for their Al Pastor is inside! The tacos are a bit pricey, about $2.25 for one, but they give you plenty of meat.
 
Tacos: I ordered myself an Asada and two Al Pastor. I personally love the Asada, the guacamole they put on it is amazing especially when paired with their red salsa. I like that the beef isn't bland and is salted perfectly. I could eat 5 more of these! The Al Pastor was okay, I like how when you ask them to put everything on it, they throw on the onions and cilantro and their red salsa so you don't have to do all of the work. I felt I've had better Al Pastor before, but this one is decent too. If you want extra salsa, you have to ask for it!
 
Overall experience here was great. These tacos were just what I was craving for after an entire weekend of hiking. It's definitely pricier than the typical dollar tacos I normally get back at home, but it definitely lives up to the hype! I can't wait to come here again in the future at their California locations!"}
{"text":"BOMB ASS TRIPE TACOS!

Ok everyone's all bla bla bla pastor tacos... bla bla adobada bla bla... whatever ya'll weak. TRIPE TACOS FOR LIFE! 

When those crispy buttery pieces of small intestine hits your lips...YAAAAAY! I mean... unless you're weak and can't handle your gut meat like a pro.... Next time I want to try the cabesa and lengua too... but the bf already thinks i'm part zombie with my tastebuds... 

They give you a side of grilled whole green onions (which is like the best thing on planet earth) and grilled whole peppers.... omg my mouth is watering. The fries looked really really really good... but alas, i'm \"dieting\" and i have to not order fries at all costs possible or else i eat them all. 

I'm only knocking off a star because their ordering system is just... how do i say... IDIOTIC. ok  first of all.... you have to get in line by meat options... so... i can't even.... like... WHAT!? what if i want like.... options... I dunno... luckily there was a few of us to split in line... but guess what... no one wants tripe tacos so that line is awesome short... by the time i finished eating my tacos.... my bf was bringing the pastor tacos and i got to do round two immediately! Ok anyways, you get in the line by taco meat... and then you go pay for them at another counter separately.... i really don't see what would stop a taco burglar from just getting in line... getting a bunch of tacos and then sitting down to eat them... but then again, you might get taco karma and only be subjected to gross tacos for the rest of your life or something."}
{"text":"Just off the strip near the Wynn. The lines are long but worth it. You know if Mexicans are eating there it is the bomb. First let me say the carne asada had so much flavor, I should of ordered 4 tacos for myself! We also ordered the carne asada fries and they were FIRE! This is the spot. I would go there every day if I could."}
{"text":"This ain't your average taco joint. They have several in San Diego and when we saw it in Las Vegas, we just had to go in. This place does not disappoint. Their tacos are about as Mexican as it gets. Their salsas... delicious, and don't forget to ask for some grilled onions. Squeeze a little lime on them and enjoy. Compaired to the high priced gruel you'll get at some of the casinos, this place is heaven, and very inexpensive. This is one not to miss."}
{"text":"Real pastor on the spit. Game over. This is what I've been looking for forever. Just like it used to b in Mexico. Keep it up guys. Love ur spot"}
{"text":"After hearing all of the rave reviews about this place, my boyfriend and I finally had a chance to come. We also had the great fortune of coming on a Sunday night in February -- there's still a line to order, sure, but it was not nearly as long as this place is known for. 

For a newcomer, the ordering system can be confusing. Basically, there's four places around the open kitchen where you can order. Order directly from the cook. Once the food is prepared, take your tray to the cashier in the corner and pay. That part of the process seems to take less time, but, with only one cashier on duty, you're bound to wait a while. Have someone in your group save seats, if possible. It was chaotic enough for us, so I can't even imagine how it is during the summertime. 

This eatery offers tacos, quesadillas, carne asada fries, mulas, tostadas and sopes. Don't expect fish, shrimp or chicken here. This place strictly serves pork and beef. I get it -- Tacos El Gordo wants to stay genuine and traditional.   Interested patrons do need to know that the menu is limited, though, in case that's a dealbreaker. 

We ordered the lengua (beef tongue) taco, the quesadilla with meat, the carne asada (steak) taco and the spicy pork taco -- all for $12. Everything was delicious, but the spicy pork taco was definitely the favorite of the meal. Love the sauce it comes with, too. 

No idea when I'd have enough patience to come back in the months to come, but I'll absolutely try to. This place is worth it, and so are the prices."}
{"text":"Circled around the original location for 15 minutes before realizing it was closed down. Came here at 2am and it was worth the wait. Delicious tacos and fries."}
{"text":"Not exactly a restaurant style, would describe more as a pickup and to-go spot. Three different lines for the different foods that you want which makes it slightly inconvenient because you would need to switch lines and start from all the way in the back to get something that isn't being cooked on your original line. However prices are super cheap and even the tortillas are made fresh right in front of you. Worth it"}
{"text":"Ever heard of a \"better than sex cake\"? Well these are \"better than sex tacos\". I can never go back to my town and be excited for their tacos ever again. This will be a regular stop whenever I visit Vegas. The staff was super friendly; the only thing I would change is the seats (but they do have a few pull out chairs). Can't eat 10 tacos in skinny seats. :)"}
{"text":"Best street food by far. I have been here 2 days and had it twice.. off the hook hands down the best."}
{"text":"This place has the best Tacos & carne asada fries! I am at the place all the time! Trust me when I say you have to try these tacos!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, fabulously authentic. I am from Houston Texas and we stopped by this place hoping for some great Mexican food and we were not disappointed! I had the spicy pork tacos and they were amazing. Other members of my party tried some of everything and they could not pick a favorite! Wish this place was a local spot for us, but we'll just have to come back here next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great location right on Las Vegas Bvld! It is even better that It is opened late (i think 24 hrs?). I stopped by after a night of clubbing and drinking. It definitely hit the spot. Possibly the cheapest food on the Strip! Everything was salty IMO. A squeeze of lime made it better. 
-Cow brain: yes you heard me! Try it. I had cow brain before and this was not too tasty and fresh. I think it lost some creaminess and the flavor was not working for me. Fun to try. Not the best I've had. 
-Tripe - my second favorite. tripe was clean and tender. 
-Beef shoulder - my favorite. Beef was tender. 
-Lengua - It was not good. Too salty. 
Would I come back? maybe if it was late and I was hungry. Good location but not the best tacos I've had."}
{"text":"Heavenly! Coming from Hawaii, been cravin some authentic street tacos and this local joint did not disappoint. Nothing fancy here just delicious tacos with the perfect condiments and side dishes. Tried all the tacos and can't decide a favorite, all so tasty! Food highlight for our Vegas trip, go figure. 

Aloha n Mahalo"}
{"text":"The bomb! Best tacos around. Line is long for lunch so get here with time to spare. Worth the trip for sure. Pork tacos are my fav!"}
{"text":"They cut their meat a little thicker than the San Diego locations and charge for salsa. Other than that I have no complaints and was happy to find a taste of home just a few scorching blocks from my hotel :)"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had and I've had a lot of tacos lol Fresh handmade tortillas and fresh meats. I want to go back to Vegas just to eat here! LOVE this place! If I could give it 10 stars I would! Fast, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Tip: DIVIDE AND CONQUER!!! ...the lines

It's best to come here with a couple of your friends so that you can split up and wait in the different lines for different meats, otherwise, you're going to be waiting in line forever to try the variety they have here. Make sure to look at the signs at the start of each line to know what you're getting in line for!

A bit chaotic like the previous location, but still as delicious as it gets nevertheless. Because we ended up waiting for a full hour for all the food, we definitely felt the need to over-order, ultimately getting almost $120 worth of tacos and fries for 7 people. TACO FEAST!

My favorites: Lengua, Adobada, and Buche! The food here will take your taste buds to taco heaven."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST when I come to Vegas. Who can say no to delicious, affordable tacos that are available at all the right hours? Perfect for late night bites as well as mid-day snacks/lunch/indulgence.

I've tried a good variety, but my favorites are still Beef Tongue and Spicy Pork. Beef shoulder is good, but a little tough and not as tender as the tongue. Brain is an interesting choice, but only if you are a foodie wanting to try new things. My least favorite so far is the tripe - don't get me wrong, I love eating tripe, but this just wasn't the way I liked it. It just tasted too organ-y if that makes any sense.

The food in quesadilla form is also pretty tasty... Ahh my stomach GROWLS as I am typing this!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas! Long lines but worth the wait.  Tacos el pastor are the best!! My only complaint is they don't have a all you can eat lol if you love tacos this place is a must try"}
{"text":"Tacos to die for. All the food will make you come back for more. Simply delicious. I take everybody here when they come visit me."}
{"text":"Drunk food at it's finest. When you find yourself leaving the Encore at 3am, have a hankering for some recovery food, this is the logical place to swing by. The place was packed. No surprise there, most of the people there were in the same state as we were. Between the three of us, we managed to order enough food to sample a small portion of the menu. I tried to order chicken tacos, but to my surprise, they don't have chicken. I'm not a huge fan of pork, so this left steak tacos for me. My girlfriend had the adobada tacos, grilled jalapenos and we all shared the carne asada fries. The table favorite was the fries. All 3 of us have been talking about them since. I now have a go to place when I'm in the area, those fries are going to haunt me."}
{"text":"Came here twice, BEST TACO EVER! Taco will never taste the same again....(lol, extreme but true, unless you have another location you can recommend in LA. I'm all ears) boyfriend and I are still seaeching for a replacement we can enjoy in LA."}
{"text":"Best tacos north of the border!!!! A must try if visiting Vegas. They have amazing tacos al pastor. Yes their line as can get long but thats because the food is soooooo good. Plus the mexican drinks are good too. You have to try this!"}
{"text":"Slice of mexico city street food in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is a must every time I'm in Vegas. The long lines are worth the wait. Their tacos are the best!"}
{"text":"Our favorite taco place in the entire world. Super clean, I think the only thing I don't love is how crowded it always is!"}
{"text":"The tacos, the mulas, the vampiros and the horchata in this place are bomb!! the only bad on this place is sooo crowded there is very little place to enjoy our food- they should expand their sitting area - well I guess we will have to enjoy we just have to eat standing up after all we are in Vegas LOL- ohhh I forgot the management is not organized you have to make different lines to order different kind of tacos- asada or al pastor - QUEEEEE???!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos a fantastic. Specially the Al Pastor.  If you want authentic Tijuana tacos without  the TJ thrill, this is the place to go.    Place is very clean and all employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"YES. try the spicy pork! Sooooo good!!! Even better than the asada ones! I like how each protein comes with different toppings/salsas. I've had good asada tacos at a variety of different places but have only tried the adobada here and it is amazing! My only complaint was the inconsistency in the sauce servings. I ordered 3 asada tacos and one came with a nice portion of avocado salsa and red salsa, and the next two were topped with very little of it. Wont stop me from coming back next time i'm in vegas. Only thing, next time i will only order the adobada because it was that good!!!"}
{"text":"It's as good as it gets for authentic Mexican tacos. I prefer this place over other Mexican restaurants because they have big, juicy, and flavorful meats for their tacos. This location compared to their other ones is much cleaner too. 

In addition, they have a variety of meats, from beef tongue to steak, and the \"turning meat.\" Although they don't have any lunch specials or happy hours, $2 is a good deal. If you're craving for a \"street taco\" type taste and feel, come here!"}
{"text":"Simple and old school food. Just a place if you want to sit down. I tried something I've never had before. de Buche? (Pork stomach) all in all not bad. I think it's just knowing what it was I had to get over."}
{"text":"this place it makes you feel like seat in a local restaurent at Mexico city! Hahaha! Fast and nice food!"}
{"text":"I have to assume that all those who've given this place 5 stars are eating tacos for the first time, or they're eating after a night of heavy-drinking, because TEG is as overrated as they come.

The tacos are okay, but they add all this sauce-crap without asking, and most of the time you stand in line for what amounts to a taco assembly-line, with the same care that goes into most assembly-lines.
And they don't have tacos pollo, for those who don't eat pork or beef (not referring to me by the way)....what's that about?

If you want a superior taco, go across the street to Taqueria el Pastorcito for their Al Pastor. Puts TEG to shame."}
{"text":"What, best tacos I've had outside of San Diego, incredible flavor, and it only cost 9$"}
{"text":"I'm definitely definitely excited that this place came back to the same location it was before. It's now close by all over again and I can't wait to eat tacos after the club tonight. On second thought I'm gonna go before and after the club. Lol"}
{"text":"Let me help you understand how good this place actually is. I don't normally like Mexican food. It isn't my preferred food category, but this place was so good. Everything was cooked in front of me and everything was spot on. It definitely hit the spot for that late afternoon hangover."}
{"text":"I can finally say I've tried all the tacos El Gordo locations in the United States lol. And I can say this location is nothing like the ones in San Diego. I tried the adobada fries and adobada tacos. The fries do come in 2 sizes, half and full order. 
It was good but I can tell it tasted a little different. But it did satisfy my cravings.  

The concept is the same. You wait in line to order your food and then pay at the register. The line went out the door and wrapped outside."}
{"text":"I'm so thankful for Tacos El Gordo, especially at 2AM. Their food is always cheap and tasty.  They're open late at night and they are just a few blocks from my house.  Just the smell of their food coming from the restaurant makes me want tacos even when I'm not even hungry!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos in Las Vegas!! Been Eating Tacos El Gordo since I was 8, grew up around the original location in Mexico. When I heard it was we coming to Vegas, told everybody about it. Try the mulitas and adobada tacos."}
{"text":"This place has the best authentic Mexican tacos  in Vegas. period. You have to stand in line for each type of taco you would like to order and that can take a while to get your tacos, but this place is completely worth the wait. I frequent this place almost every week. If you want the true experience of Mexican cuisine make sure you get everything on your tacos. They will ask you if you want everything on it. My personal favorites here are Adobada (spicy pork) and carnitas. The adobada isn't too spicy and has wonderful salsa and creamy guac on them. Don't go anywhere else if you are looking for the best authentic Mexican food in town!"}
{"text":"The pastor and adobada tacos are bomb! There are separate lines for different kinds of meat, and another line to pay, which I think is weird and inconvenient. But nonetheless, the food is well worth the wait. I always look forward to this place whenever I travel to Vegas."}
{"text":"As we were walking by, we saw a huge line... We thought this must be a go to... And it sure was. 

We've never had a taco this delicious. It is made in front of you and fresh. All the seats are always so full and you have to stand around and stalk people to get a seat. I think the competition to get a seat, line, and the crowd makes this restaurant very special."}
{"text":"Walked across the street from the Wynn and felt like we hit the jackpot with tasty breakfast burritos that didn't break the bank. Their coffee was surprisingly tasty too."}
{"text":"Omg !! You guys I came to the famous TACOS EL GORDO in Las Vegas !!! Honestly my Lyft driver was like there ok and I was ready to be disappointed but can I say IT WAS SO GOOD, it definitely will be a must when every I come back to Vegas. Yes the Al Pastor was more I expected but I am a tripa type of girl and that was so amazing they left my mouth wanting more.. so if ever you are in town come into get these mouth watering tacos !! Ok I'm going to go get some more ?"}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend family and friends to eat here..  tacos taste just like they do in Tj but with out the kiddnappings,shootings and long border lines.. lol..  the lines there are kinda confusing but pretty much theres 4 stations , each one serving you different meats of the tacos you want... Once you get the tacos .you head to the register and pay...  just thought id put that  cuz we were confused on what to do.."}
{"text":"best authentic tacos I ever had, so I was on vacation in vegas last week, after hearing from many of my clients that I should go here as well as lyft drivers and other peers I decided to give it a try, the line was outside the doors all the way to the tree, but don't hesitate because it moved pretty fast, before you know it i was inside. there is different lines for what your getting, like there is a Carne Asada line and then all pastor line. they also serve toungue, brains and other crazy shit but I didn't try that, I had the Adobado al pastor and the Capechona fries. both were AMAZING. the tacos are real, authentic, fresh tacos. best tacos I ever had. I'm from Florida we don't got much options here. and the Capechona fries were delicious, if it's 2 people just ask for a half size, it's still huge and half the price. after you order. ur food is ready within minutes. the. u make the line to pay and afterwards you sit down and enjoy some amazing tacos. it looks like it takes forever because of the amount of people but it moves pretty quick. definatly worth every second and penny!"}
{"text":"Overrated coming from someone who spent a lot of time in TJ and was almost born there. Lol. The best tacos were Carne Asada , adobada was close but not as good as tj. I asked for tripe and the tripe was close but not as good. The lengua I ordered I never got that's why I'm knocking down a star. I still recommend it compared to a lot of places in Cali, where I'm from. Solid 3.5 Starz"}
{"text":"Mm tuve una muy mala experiencia en este establecimiento la comida está muy mala aparte el tiempo de espera no vale la pena estuve casi 2 horas haciendo línea para poder tener la cena pero no total decepción son muy malos la salsa no tiene sabor alguno y la carne no tiene sabor el aderezo que ponen a los tacos es horrible no recomiendo este lugar y no pienso regresar si quieres tener una buena cena busca en otro lugar por qué en este no lo encontrarás"}
{"text":"This place is delish! By far the best tacos I've had in Vegas. The meats are flavorful & tender. Try the carne asada quesadilla. Mmm"}
{"text":"I went here like 3 times the last time I went to Vegas and it was so goooooddd !! I've never been to a taco place that includes guacamole without an extra cost. This is a real authentic taco place, and it's cool to see them prepare it right in front of you. When I go back to Vegas, this will be my first stop!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the wait time can sometimes be ridiculous and forget about siting unless you leave a friend behind to save you a spot."}
{"text":"Nearly 500-reviews and a 4.5/5.0 review on YELP for cheap tacos in Vegas? I \"had\" to try this spot on my last Vegas excursion.

=========
LOCATION
=========

It's located at \"the edge\" of the heart of the Vegas strip in my opinion. I consider everything from like Excalibur to the end of Wynn the HEART of the strip. Sure you've got the Stratosphere etc. if you go down farther but with Sahara being remodeled, there's a deadspot past the Wynn.

Anyway this place is RIGHT past the Wynn/Encore, on the Strip, headlining a little mini-mall. Seating is limited inside, BRUTAL due to the Vegas summer heat... and there's a ton of seating outside. Unfortunately the inside is pretty small and the lines tend to make things chaotic.

Also adding to the chaos is there's 2 separate PAY AREAS inside, both on opposite ends of the place. They hand you the food cafeteria style BEFORE you pay, which is cool. What I hated was there's 4 stations and depending on WHAT TYPE of taco you want you have to go to the different stations/lines. One for Abogado (spicy pork), one for Carne Asada and Chorizo. Finally a third one for all other things (tongue, shoulder, brain).


=========
THE FOOD
=========

~ CARNE ASADA TACO - The steak was seasoned amazingly. It came with an avocado mash and some other great toppings. (5/5)

~ ADOBADA (spicy pork) TACO - This was interesting. The meat looked delicious, nice seductive red glaze to the meat. It was pretty good, not amazing. However the green avocado sauce they put on it bumped it up a bit. I recommend adding that sauce on ALL your tacos. (4/5)

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oCNAyy80KNhlFskH_cio4A&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA


~ MULAS - I \"think\" this was a giant taco with an additional tortilla atop it. (4/5)

~ CHORIZO TACO - It was pretty good as well. Torn between giving it a 3 or a 4. They chop up the tasty looking sausage in front of you... and the grounded meat streams out. (3/5)

~ QUESADILLAS - These aren't your normal \"quesadillas.\" They are a large taco w/some cheese burned into the tortilla, filled with meat / toppings with a HARD-AS-ROCK CRACKER thing put atop kind've like a hat. It's really terrible. (1/5)


=========
AND SO.....
=========

It was a good spot. 
Definitely a good place to go if you're balling on a budget. Can't beat $2.00 tacos and $4.00 MEAT quesadillas. I think there was a lot of locals here. I'm curious what the VAMPIRO was. My friend MIGUEL Z. thought these were the best tacos he'd ever had. 

As a tip, ask the person who makes your food for some peppers... they're free and they'll only give em out if you ask. You get a big plate of like 3-4 types of grilled peppers and grilled onions.

I will be back..."}
{"text":"Best food in Vegas by far! The best bang for your buck considering all the overpriced, bland options you have at the strip. Turns out price is not a good indicator of quality and you don't have to spend so much after all to get decent food!"}
{"text":"Whether you go at 11am or 11pm, there are lines out the door here. But the wait is soooo worth it!

Coming from Hawaii, it's hard to get any kind of legit tacos in the islands. So I was really looking forward to Tacos El Gordo. The lines were kind of discouraging but moved fairly quickly. You have to wait in different lines for different types of tacos.

We got the beef (I forget which one, there are several), the tongue and spicy pork. They were all frickin' broke da mout!

It is a weird system though. You stand in line for your tacos and then take your order up to the register to pay, then find a seat and eat. With so many people in the restaurant, I'm just wondering how they prevent people from skipping the payment part and just sitting to nosh as soon as they get their tacos. Honor system I guess.

Well worth the waits as these are some seriously good tacos."}
{"text":"Tried asada and suadero tacos.  Asada is an easy pass next time..but oh, the suadero is sooooo good.  This is my first time indulging in authentic tacos, and being Filipina and not knowing a word of Spanish, I have to admit, I was a little intimidated placing my order.  But watching them warm the tortillas and cut the meat was so interesting and the guy next to me helped me out a bit when he realized that I didn't speak a lick of Spanish.  
I forgot to order Adobada, so that'll have to be on my next must try list along with their fries and maybe quesadilla.
Me Likes!"}
{"text":"The best street tacos I've ever had! Loved this place and will definitely come back the next time I am visiting Las Vegas! The tacos were so good because everything was fresh. Service was great as well. I had three Carne Asada tacos and was tempted to get back in line and order more when I was done! Great food!"}
{"text":"I have had this book markedfor almost a year now and I finally got to go! Yay! Love trying new places and new food. I really love Mexican food any kind of Mexican food really. So when I first arrived I was a little confused but caught on a little after. So it is a small place and there are 4 lines. 3 are for the different meat types. So you basically stand in each line if you want something from each. You can however order the other stuff from any of the lines as long as it's not meat. You have to try everything I think. After you get your order you then go to the cash register where they ring you up. It moves along pretty quickly so it's not too bad. The quesadillas are a must!! They are a very small tortilla so you may want a couple of orders. The tortillas are amazingly good and the cheese......if I had to describe it I would say it was an EXPLOSION of flavor in my mouth!! If you can't tell the quesadillas were my favorite. Everything needs to be tried At least once! Highly recommend to anyone right After a long night of partying or to the person who loves greasy, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Whoa!  I can't believe it took me so long to finally discover this gem.  I never thought anything on the strip could be authentic.  But this place really takes you back to Tijuana.  The al pastor they call spicy pork.  Make sure you ask the server for a slice of the piña.  That's my fav taco by far.  I'm still undecided if I want to try the cow brain taco next time."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times with friends!  Dragged In!

Not really my choice to go for Mexican food!

The staff is average when it comes to taking care of the customer, the restaurant is average when it comes to the ambiance & atmosphere if you are to dine in.

Would I go there on my own, No!   

I think there are many better Mexican restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley, many which I have given Awesome Ratings!"}
{"text":"Awesome taco place. Tip-different tacos served at different stations. Pay at cashier near front. Definitely liked the lengua. So authentic and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas. They pack the meat into whatever it is that you order, so it is well worth the price. My favorite is the Adobada Sopes ($4). ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!

It can get quite busy during the lunch hours 12pm-2pm and there is no real line formation, which can be confusing if you aren't familiar with how the meat is stationed on the grill, but even that is worth the trouble when it comes to this food. It's seriously THE BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"As others have said, you MUST order the taco adobado (or two, or three). The meat is carved from a giant skewer and is perfectly seasoned. Order it with everything (\"con todo\"). FYI, this is NOT a spicy food.

Tried the carne asada- only average. If you're adventurous try the tongue (\"lengua\") or other useful animal parts (I didn't, so mangiador emptor).

Don't be intimidated if you don't speak spanish- they're used to gringos. Take the walk- it's good for you and definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We went to Vegas just for a few days and decided to stop by here after hearing about it from some famous mexican singers. The tacos were absolutely delicious! They were that tasty that we ordered more and also some sopes. I recommend anyone around Vegas to stop by this place if you are craving mexican food!!! Oh and btw,  the place is kept really clean l. Its also very spacious... And tortillas are handmade too!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are great...BUT.... Location poses some challenges as you have to wait in one of 6 or so lines depending on what you are ordering. The real bummer is that you'll have to wait in an additional line to pay once you have your food. Impractical to handle a tray, wait in line and watch for a table...lord help you if you have a toddler who is as energetic as mine! This place is like a living headache!"}
{"text":"This place was SO fricken good! But I went during peak lunch hours on a weekday and it was crowded!  Three long lines that move somewhat quickly. I'm not Mexican and being my first time here, I had no clue what half of the menu items were. After talking with a few people who frequent thus place they suggested the Carne Asada fries and adobada taco (spicy pork). It was so good! Plus, there's a help yourself bar with limes and radishes. You can also request for grilled onions and peppers at no charge!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable, authentic Tijuana-style Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. You must try the next time you're in Vegas. I've been here twice. The second time we came here around 11am I believe and there was hardly a wait. Thank god because there's usually a ton of people. This time I got the larger carne asada fries (probably the best I've ever had). It was about fifteen bucks for a larger. Do you guys think it was worth it? You can also get the small too. I think they charge you extra if you get it to-go? Because the lady at the cashier asked me twice \"this is for here right?\" -I think that was the only downfall."}
{"text":"Lengua tacos! Those lengua tacos are what they're known for and I seriously have been daydreaming of them ever since my first visit...

I arrived here around 10 pm and there were TONS of people waiting in line to order. The place was pretty chaotic and it was pretty confusing at first knowing where to line up. I guess there were certain lines for each type of meat, but it really doesn't matter because the cooks all communicate with each other anyway.

So I had their lengua tacos, buche tacos, and their campechana (half carne asada/half lengua) fries and it was just heaven on a platter! Probably the priciest hole in the wall mexican joint I've been to, but the quality is there!

Don't forget to ask for the sauces at the checkout counter. I found that the fries were on the dry side and the sauces made a huge difference in the taste. 

I would highly recommend anyone in Vegas to go here and try it out. I already know that I'm stopping here every time I'm in the city from now on. They just need to open one in LA now."}
{"text":"loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love this unique place! this is the best place to have unique authentic tacos. i love walking in and taking in the smell...the smell of Mexican street vendors..reminds me of when i go to mexico and i smell the different aromas of each vendor. if you want REAL authentic tacos you MUST go to Tacos el Gordo..the best part is that they close late. so after the club come here to sober up."}
{"text":"Tacos al pastor great flavor I didn't like. That u need to make different lines to get your order and another to pay and just a few tables to seat."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo are the best tacos in the USA. I think they might export their meat from mexico. It tastes amazing almost as in GDL. Everytime im in Vegas this is my first stop after a good night out!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas. 

Los mejores taco en Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Waiting in line his long for tacos is lame.  No food is this good.  Only in Vegas (or disneyland) would people put up with waiting in line for an hour to pay twice what food should cost.
The local taco shop in phoenix is just as good.  Actually, it's much better because there isn't a ridiculous line for overpriced food.
And, to make it worse, the food ordering process once inside is completely lacking any assemblance of logical process.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out a much more efficient process for getting orders processed in a much quicker fashion.  Maybe somebody thought wasting peoples time was a good idea??  Never again will I waste my precious vacation time trying to get food here.
On top of having to waste your precious vacation time, the portion sizes are ridiculously small, overpriced, and NOT anything special.  I've had a lot of tacos that were better.
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. We had tacos and a quesadilla. We tried about 5 different meats, all were amazing. We especially enjoyed the huge spire of adobada meat. They have about 10 different types of meat to choose from. They have 4 different order lines, dividing the meat into those 4 different stations. This was confusing at first,  but it worked out, just be prepared to stand in a couple different lines if you want variety. The horchata here is also especially good. Definetly worth it"}
{"text":"Ive never been to a place more overrated than here. Its like walking into a sauna full of smoke burning your eyes while you wait to order your food. The tacos are flavorless you can see when they put the meat on the grill has no seasoning at all their whole system is ridiculous you order at the smoke window then walk way to the other side to go pay with no ticket you have to take your whole tray of food to the cashier it's hotter than hell in there all for some overrated flavorless food not worth it would never come back here again even if it was free the best thing about my meal was the Sprite. The only good thing this place has going for it is the fresh handmade tortillas."}
{"text":"Si siempre está hasta la madre you know the tacos are good. Me personally am a fan of tacos al pastor con todo you won't be disappointed I also like to make eye contact with the man carving the meat while throwing four five bucks in the jar y luego una horchata and im a happy fat camper. If you don't know about tacos el gordo you need to get your life."}
{"text":"These tacos are fierce! make sure you get al pastor tacos with todo! they still dont beat the tacos my Abuelita makes! boo yah!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos I have had in a long time ! Everything is freshmade in front of you !
Go for the tongue and al pastor.
2.25$ tacos ! So cheap and so good. Do not hesitate."}
{"text":"Great tacos at a reasonable price. Usually get the Al Pastor tacos with a chunk of roasted pineapple on the side. Last visit the Al Pastor meat was more fat and less meat. Was a bit disappointed! This place would make a crap load more money if they served breakfast. With all the casinos, construction, and conventions it is a promising business opportunity. This place tends to get really busy, but worth the wait. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Tacos are great. Had spicy pork and steak. Both are made differently and fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a good taco place but it always packed the line is super long it's good but not worth all the trouble, I think the taco stands in Mexico are better."}
{"text":"Very dry brisket tacos and awfully packed because it was cheap. Taco Bell is much better in my opinion and cleaner too."}
{"text":"I finally was able to bring my family to try these famous tacos. I was so excited as soon as we got into the parking lot. We parked close to the foot spa and the owner came out and told us too move. We walked in and there was a line. This made us even more excited. Seeing the al pastor    And the pineapple was love at first sight. The cooks were working hard and really nice. They were very attentive and taking care of all the customers. The tacos looked amazing. While I went to pay my husband told me the ladies who are cleaning yelled at them. Apparently, you can not hold nor sit in a table without food. The cashiers have so much cockiness and very rude. We finally sat down ate the tacos. Al pastor are amazing. Chorizo are even tastier. My kids loved the carne asada. If you come please note not to park in front of the business's. Food is amazing. Take it to go or eat outside. Don't mind the rude cashiers. Cooks are amazing. Enjoy."}
{"text":"ever get hungry after the clubs?? well stop by this taco shop located near the WYNN hotel, they have amazing tacos there!! you have to try the Adobada tacos there a spicy pork taco with guacamole sauce. as well as there campechana fries a mix of carne asada n adoba on a bed of fries!!! got to say tho late at night the lines get pretty big but its worth it at the end!! so if u ever feeling drunk or just hungry n your near the strip then come check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Good food but very rude ...lady was mad because I didn't know Spanish!!! Very pricey  !!!!! Wouldn't go back not worth it..no air conditioning"}
{"text":"After 1600 reviews and a 4 1/2 star average rating, I'm not sure what else I can add...   All I have to say is, this place is Legit."}
{"text":"They raised the prices but I keep coming back. Delicious food but long lines. Carne Asada fries have me addicted"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I've been hearing SO MUCH about Tacos El Gordo and I finally got to try it!! This place is PACKED and lines are LONG. I only tried the adobada because that's the one I always keep hearing about and that was the only one with a long line. And even though lines are long, they're super fast and efficient so it doesn't take too long! I forget the pricing but I don't remember it being too terrible or anything. Also the place could be cleaner, but what else do you expect from a joint like this. These tacos are super juicy and flavorful, would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"100% the best al pastor tacos you'll ever find. So authentic and so flavorful. Literal chunks of pineapple. They are cutting the al pastor off the spinning rod as you walk in. It's a little disturbing but... welcome to the jungle. It's so damn good I ordered more tacos after I finished my first order. In my defense, they are small. Definitely check this off your list while in Vegas. It's worth it"}
{"text":"Tacos are absolutely amazing.  Make sure you get in the right line and the Al Pastor Fries are worth the wait.

In Las Vegas there are many options for Mexican food, but nothing comes close to Tacos El Gordo.  Simple the best taco you can find anywhere."}
{"text":"This place makes one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. The spicy pork tacos are delicious!!! Service is a little slow, but worth the wait. If you're in Vegas make the trip to try this place."}
{"text":"GOOD inexpensive tacos. They have three separate ordering lines dependent of the type of meat you are ordering. Large seating area, kept clean. We all enjoyed our tacos, we had carne, beef, pork and spicy pork along with the carne asada fries. We all devoured each bite! I would recommend this place if you are looking for some good tasty not overly priced tacos. The staff all had a smile on their faces and seemed to enjoyed what they are all doing. The Tacos are made right in front of you."}
{"text":"We came here straight from our road trip from the Bay Area, based on Yelp recommendations. Tacos were absolutely delicious! We ordered 13 tacos altogether for our family of four. We sampled the carne asada and the al pastor. I liked how they provided grilled green onions and jalapeño peppers with the tacos. The tacos are street taco sized, priced about $2.25 each, so don't be surprised....hubby probably could have eaten more. Definitely big flavor in small packages."}
{"text":"slightly disappointed in this place........I don't know if its because I had such high expectations, due to all the hype, but I did not think there was anything that great about their tacos. I have had way better Al pastor other places. It wasn't bad and was still enjoyable, just not the best with so many other options."}
{"text":"LOVE ME SOME TACOS! I fell in love with authentic Mexican tacos when I went to Cabo, Puerto Vallarta, and Cancun. I'm not talking about the Americanized tacos like carne asada, but the kind you get at the OG street taco stands. My favorites are the Cabeza (beef head), Tripa (beef tripe), Lengua (beef tongue), and Buche (pork stomach) tacos...which are only offered at the more authentic taco restaurants. Even then, some of them are not good (not as fresh), so finding one that's authentic AND fresh is a real gem! 

Tacos el Gordo in Las Vegas is one of my favorite stops for authentic tacos! It's soo good--the best next thing to going to Mexico for tacos. It's so satisfying! 

All the meat here is fresh, tasty and juicy! They have a HUGE spit-grilled Al Pastor. I was literally standing there watching the JUICE drip off the spit as meat was being sliced off. *drools* So tender and incredibly tasty! At Tacos el Gordo, you can also get grilled pineapple with your Al Pastor tacos and I absolutely LOVE their green sauce.  So. Freakin. Delicious.!!

This location in Vegas is on the strip so it is busier and the line can look a bit crazy all wrapped around. But the wait is not that long! It's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"My friend raved about this place after her boyfriend took her here. I'm so glad she took me!! The mula is amazing, it's like a stuffed taco quesadilla, it's awesome!! The carne asada & abodaba are worth the drive for me to go here!! The prices are also awesome, lots of food for cheap!!!! You have to go here!"}
{"text":"A lot of people often wonder where to get authentic mexican food. This is total dive where you can find just that. I haven't tacos this authentic other than in mexico. They were really fantastic.

The location is in a strip mall in one of the \"dodgier\" sections of vegas. There was lots of families eating there, so i felt safe. However, I did feel like I had to order all my food in spanish, because everyone there spoke spanish! Unfortunately at the time, I was getting my spanish and german confused.... so that was difficult.

I got two adobada tacos and two asada tacos. I also got a can of fanta. It was about $10 for all this food. It was all incredibly delicious. Someone had commented that it tasted packaged- well, all guacamole consists of is mashed avocados with some other stuff like peppers and garlic, so most guacamole is pretty much the same.

I definitely preferred the adobada tacos. I felt like they were more flavorful. Plus, the first thing you see when you walk in is a thousand layers of pork, on a spit. It sort of calls out to you ; ) Oh, and I\"m pretty sure their tortillas are homemade. no store bought stale tortillas here : )

really delicious, very authentic, I think most people will enjoy this place, unless you're used to your mexican food being somewhat fancier and covered in cheese and sauces. If you don't like authentic mexican fare, then i'd skip this place. Also, I stopped by on a saturday afternoon and it was quite crowded. I'm lucky to have found a table. That may be something to watch out for though."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The popularity just went over their heads. The cooks treat you like they are the owners. They're good but I don't think I want to wait 30 minutes + just to eat the tacos. You ask for adobada and by the time you get in line again to get asada or tripa, waste of time. Your first tacos are already cold by the time you seat down and eat. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"This place says it closes at 2am and they close 30min early. if you plan to eat here make sure you get here by 1:30 they don't announce that they close early at all until you get here which I believe they should be informing people of it bc last time  that I remember it was open 24hrs"}
{"text":"Expectacular no pueden irse de las vegas sin peovar estos tacvos mexicanos muy buenos, cuando lleganos habia una fila muy grande pero vale la pena les recomiendo los tacos al pastor spn muy ricos ojala en florida hubierannrestaurantes de estebtipo los tacos solo valen 2.25 pedimos 50 tacos para 4 perdonas ybquedamos bien recomendado"}
{"text":"Is it worth the $20 cab ride off the Strip & the hour long wait for tacos? Not really. I really wanted to like these tacos - as reminiscent of authentic tacos of a bygone era - but this is NOT that place, sadly. Points for simply good food & authentic ambience. Would I make the trek back ? Probably not - but nothing here is offensive (great late night smells); this is just a good taco shack -- if you stumble upon it."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food for a great price. They open late, so that's a huge plus for late night cravings!"}
{"text":"If you happen to drive down The Strip and pass Encore, it is likely that you will see a line out the door from some mysterious store front. That, my friends, is the throng of people waiting to get their hands on some authentic Mexican tacos. Tacos El Gordo doesn't have much competition in the area so it is natural to see hordes of people crowding their 3 Vegas locations.

TIP: There are separate lines for tacos. There is normally someone standing at the door to direct people to the appropriate lines but if you're like me and tend to order the unique meats e.g. Cabezza, Buche, Lengua, make sure to go inside and go to the line on the furthest right (closest to the bathroom). It's always the shorter line. If you're looking to order a bit of everything, those lines will typically be the longest. There are also 2 lines if you're looking to order the Adobada, which is El Gordo's version of the al pastor. 

Their meats are some of the most tender I've ever had but when it lacks flavor, you're just eating flavorless chewy meat. I had to pack on the onions and sauces to give it some life. They're supposed to be known for the Adobada but I found it to lack any sort of spice. They top it off with a small slice of pineapple but I was looking more for spice than sweet. 

Cabeza -- Probably my favorite which I'd probably stick to if I come back. Tender juicy cuts of beef head with a distinct smokiness that gives it just enough flavor. Of course, I still had to pack on the hot sauce and onions to give it some fire and texture. 

Stop by at this foodie attraction when you're in town. If you're going with a group of people (which is probably the best strategy), come up with a game plan so you can get by with the least amount of time wasted. 

Oh and don't forget to pay for your tacos like I did. After you get your food, take it to the front counter. It's all by honor system there."}
{"text":"The last stop on the Taco Trek for our group.  This place also has an al pastor wheel but I got a carne asada taco Azteca style which means it comes with a fresh grilled cactus pad.  I love cactus can this was super good!  Also, you can get at no extra charge, grilled vegetables to go with your taco.  When I saw it consisted of grilled scallions and two grilled peppers--one a jalapeño, I had to get the veggies.

The taco was very tasty and I ate the onions and peppers almost as a side dish.  Another thing different about El Gordo is that you can get either flour or corn tacos.  I got the corn this time and it was quite flavorful.  The tacos here are smaller than at the other places we stopped, but they are good and worth the price with the vegetable dish.  At $2, the place is on par with the other taco places in the area.

A little difference with this place is that you pick up a tray and place your ordered dishes on it.  Then you go to the cashier and pay for what you ordered.  It's very much cafeteria style.  Last night was quite busy and when our group arrived, we got a lot of stares.

A good stop of the Taco Trek!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food you will ever eat in las Vegas. I'm eat in the al pastor tacos and I have no complaints. Yu.......mommy!"}
{"text":"Best tacos on the strip!!!!! The line is always huge so be patient!!!! Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Food is amazing the line system takes getting use to.  A def need to stop by place . Glad they have many locations but they need to come up to the Bay Area"}
{"text":"It was our 1st time there and im sorry but the only bomb tacos they have is the asada other than that sorry its just bad and salty, we had to wait a loooong time and seriously it wasnt worth the wait

But why do I give THIS place 3 stars? Well beause the people who work there are very very friendly they seriously work soooo hard and deal with a lot of drunkies so shout out to them and those asada tacos."}
{"text":"I tried so hard to order, first time in this kinda authentic place; in the end just one guy at the cabezo/lengua/anything organ counter was patient enough to answer all my questions and gave me little chunks of meat to try. I love you. Tacos were greaaaaat, fresh and simply good!!"}
{"text":"Want to know how good this place is....this specific place is?????......I'm in L.A. but would drive all the way down to Las Vegas just for their tacos.

I know I can go to their closer locations but no, this is the place for me; I feel like I'm cheating on them anytime I have a taco de Al Pastor somewhere else.

Oh man, not to mention their loaded fries....Dios Mío....I'll gladly run 6 hours to work off those calories.

There's no wrong time for this place, just bring your appetite and patience, the line can get long but the taste stays with you forever! #fattymode lol."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas, best tacos in town for sure. The adobada tacos are delicious and the adobada fries are amazing. Every time we come to Vegas we always stop here. Friendly service, you get your food fast even tho it gets packed I never wait more then 10 min waiting for my food."}
{"text":"OVERpriced, OVERhyped, and shitty customer focus! The place was empty, no lines, and yet i received cold onions and jalapeños. The worst part was the service I received afterwards! I asked the lady at counter how it became 15 dollars for 5 tacos and drink, and she gave me a look of frustration and only pointed to menu. It was 2 years ago since I had visited This place...definitely the last time. This chain needs mangers!"}
{"text":"Good tacos. A bit over priced therefore the 4 stars. I have had better tacos for a lot cheaper. The service was fast although I felt a bit rush while I was ordering. El taquero, kept rushing me. it's not that I wasn't ready to place my order, I just had a question. He seemed annoyed at my question regarding suadero. 

Super clean place and super packed. My family and I got there at midnight and the place was packed with people who had left bars or nightclubs. Whooo hoo only in Vegas.

Minus star because the AC was put on super super cold temperatures. My aunt had to take her tacos to the car because of the cold temperature.

Overall, good tacos. Not the greatest!"}
{"text":"My Las Vegas Foodcation had only three stops. Emeril's, Wynn Buffet, and Tacos El Gordo.  Tacos El Gordo was my friend Jorge's pick.  He kept going on and on about how great the tacos were.  He mentioned how they had these killer asada fries and how the tacos were authentic baja style.  So before we leave Vegas, the foodie brigade and I, (Rogelio, Jorge, and Blanca) make a stop at Tacos El Gordo.  This location was in a little strip mall and not in the best area on the Strip, but maybe that made the tacos better somehow.  As soon as you walk in the chaos hits you.  There are several lines and depending what you want to order, you stand in that line and order.  You get your food and then pay the cashier.  Figuring this out was hard, thank goodness for the adobada guy.  He took the time to explain it to me and even called me Chula.  He made sure he got my full order without having to stand in the other lines.  My friend took advantage of this and made me get his order to.  The food was delicious, but the stand out for me was the tacos de lengua.  I am really picky when it comes to eating lengua (tongue), but it was so juicy and delicious I had to go back in and order some more.  Although I had to wait a bit, the adobada guy chatted me up and remarked about how the tacos would taste just that much better after my wait.  

Asada fries delicious...they have this really tasty creamy green salsa.  Tacos OUTSTANDING! oh and they have grilled green onions, jalapenos and chile güeritos...not the pickled variety but the yellow ones.  No one ever has those and those are my favorite.

I looked up other locations and there are several in and around San Diego.  Next time I'm in San Diego I'm going to look one up and will keep a look out for any popping up closer to home."}
{"text":"found this place using Yelp. this place is always busy for a good reason. the tacos are great and for a fair price for being on the strip. the only thing is that the lines are confusing.  Depending on what type of meat you want you have to stand on different lines. it is more confusing when you don't know where to pay especially with the amount of people ordering food. sitting is easier to find outside in the heat then inside. I still recommend this place. great food."}
{"text":"Probably the best and freshest tacos we have ever had.  When we got there at around 10p the line was at least 50 deep from inside to outside for tacos.  The place is run efficiently from what I saw and they have separate lines depending on the type of meat for tacos you want to order.  We ordered tacos al pastor, tacos de tripas, tacos de buche and tacos de suadero...they serve sopes and other items as well.  The Tacos are damn good and we had them to go because there was no place to sit and they wrapped for us nicely to keep the warm.  The place is next door to the Wynn.  We will definitely be back!!  5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Pros:
-The adobada tacos at this location is just as good, perhaps even better(?!) than the one in National City.  

Cons: 
-Lines were about 35 minutes long on a Sunday afternoon.  
-This location could use some better ventilation.  
-The table located in the middle of the restaurant is definitely not for the claustrophobic when it's busy."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch following a morning of training near the strip.  I had read the reviews on this place for a while and always had wanted to try it.  People, listen, if you want good Mexican street tacos, come to this place.  Had two al pastor tacos and one carne asada.  They were awesome!  A bit on the small side, like mexican street fare, but at two bucks a taco, you can get filled for ten bucks.  Good luck trying to find a deal like that anywhere else on the strip that isn't commercial fast food.  next time, and yes there will be a next time, I'm going to grab some asada fries, because these other yelpers keep going on and on about them."}
{"text":"Really good al pastor, make sure to add pineapple!  Try the tripa and suadero as well"}
{"text":"This is the best place for tacos in Vegas. Be prepared to wait as the lines can get pretty big you have to get into 2 different lines to order different types of meat went in on 2 consecutive days yes they were that good will return back when in Vegas !!!!!"}
{"text":"Haw heard a lot about this place and have never checked it out UNTIL NOW! Well I can see why this place is so hyped up, the food is super fresh and really good! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Orale!!! I went from Las Vegas to TJ real quick!  This is a definite must when in Vegas. 

We are huge taco foodies and are always looking for the next taco place to keep visiting and this has made the list. Authentic Tijuana-taste in the carne Asada tacos as well as the adobada. 

If you close your eyes and taste that smoky carne asada... You will be transcended to blvd. la revolucion. 

When ordering: 
-find a tray or you'll end up carrying your food 
-stand in the correct line (separated by meat type)
-be patient as the tortillas are being made in front of you and the lines can be lengthy after hours 
-though not mentioned flour tortillas are an option and I strongly suggest you try them!
-do tip the taqueros if possible, as they are quick and efficient and can digest multiple orders as given; we had an order of 20 tacos all prepared differently and they completed them with effectiveness and a smile!"}
{"text":"Great meal. Had a taco, quesadilla, and tostada with each different meat. Each one was great, el pastor was the best. Take a few people so you can divide and conquer each line to save time. When we left the line was out the door."}
{"text":"I do not understand the rating this place gets. Although you get your food quickly, everything was cold within minutes. The asada is decent, but nothing great. Being from SoCal, this place has nothing on King Taco. The tortillas are fresh, so that is the reason for the 2 stars. I will not pay this place another visit. Maybe I got a bad batch of tacos. The guy that took my order also forgot two of the tacos, but after taking one bite, I was actually glad he did."}
{"text":"Good tasting food I agree so it deserves better than the worst rating

Here's why I will never go there again:
Too crowded
The place is too small, I ran into several people and there is no room to walk even outside in seating area. We went there at 5:00 so only waited for 1 customer in front of me.
No air condition swamp coolers instead
Rabid flies especially outside
Seriously smokey from the cooking
Very unhealthy, greasy, and the pork was red
When grabbing a tray to place food on it my hand came in contact with something sticky
There was so much going on in the kitchen I'm not sure what I saw but there was blood. I'm pretty sure on the floor.
My girlfriend got sick a couple hrs after eating

I have been to Tijuana 5xs and this place is just as dirty
But dirty in a bad way

The health department may send them back"}
{"text":"My favorite place to visit when I come to Las Vegas. The food is to die for. Great prices, and great customer service. I highly recommend this location if you want to stay away from the long lines at the strip."}
{"text":"Tacos were decent highly recommend the vampiro de asada. Their system of purchasing food and paying for it, is really horrible. The restaurant was clean, however, overcrowded."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of tacos this is the place. I love there carnitas, it is well cooked. The service is fast and friendly. The prices are great as well"}
{"text":"The tacos here are great!  It's the best taco I've ever had. The tortillas are homemade.  They are soft, tender and just fabulous!!  I like the lengua(beef tongue).  It's juicy, tender and flavorful.   The meat are chopped into tiny cubes, The taco comes with a generous portion of meat and tops with a heaping tablespoon of sauce, onion and cilantro.  You got to make a stop here if you're in Vegas!!  Their coconut popsicle is good toooooooo!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came hereon the first night here in Las Vegas from San Diego! The service was amazing, the food was delicious and the customer service was great!

We ordered Campechana fries and two adobada tacos and our bill was $9.79! 

The fries were loaded with cheese, guacamole and sour cream! My husband and I even asked the cook for extra onions and salsa! We loved the fact that he was really nice and didn't give us any negative feedback because of our requests! His name is Mauro and we loved him (: we definitely come here again! 

Excellent food and excellent service"}
{"text":"The fries are different tasty!! But it's alright I've had better tacos next door to this place. The ordering aspect is too crazy it reminds me of lunch time in high school at the cafeteria noisy and rushed."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! I would recommend anyone to come here if you want tacos. I had 4 of the spicy pork tacos. This was enough to get my 125 lb body full. There are separate lines for the different types of meats so make sure to bring a friend or two to wait in the other lines for you. Get the pineapple on the side along with the grilled onions and chilies. They take card or cash. Horchata is good here too! 

I came at 11am on a Sunday and it was busy!"}
{"text":"WOW. WOW. WOW. I frequent the actual original location in TJ and this place has a bigger menu and OMG it is even better than TJ! Salsa is delicious, juicy limes, quesadillas and mulitas de al pastor is the ONLY way to go. I also tasted the carne asada which was flavorful and juicy, the chorizo was GROSS. I had much better chorizo from the TJ location for sure. $2 for tacos, $4 for mulitas and quesadillas and $10 for carne asada fries that feed an army of 5 or  a few very drunk people. I think that Tacos Mexico down the street will go out of business any day now since this place came into town."}
{"text":"#350! 

This place is delicious. I'm a huge mexican food snob and I lived in mexico for a about a year, so I know everything about mexican food. EVERYTHING!!!! 

You have to try this place out at least once while you are in Las Vegas, if you don't you'll regret it for the rest of your mediocre life. Don't have a mediocre life eat at El Gordo damn it! 

Tell them Aarón sent you"}
{"text":"This place is right by the Wynn/Encore if you want to get your taco on. I absolutely love tacos and heard this is the place to get them in Vegas. It's definitely crowded but don't let that deter you, the lines moves quick. You just go up order and he'll start chopping up he meat in front of you and hand you the tacos.

To be honest I'm not sure what I got. I was a hungry raging biotch. So I told the beautiful taco maker to make me whatever he's got. I hope it wasn't chicken feet or something. I ended up with nine tacos to take back with me. I only ate three. Muchas Gracias Gordo!"}
{"text":"I am in awe of this taco spot! How they manage to get so much flavor into the meat is amazing. I can see why friends and family rave so much about the tacos. 
At first it may seem like a regular ole taco stand but the magic is all in the way they cook the meat. It's cooked as you order. Slapped on the grille as you ask for it! 
The best thing I ate, which is hard to choose cuz it was all so so good, was the pork adobada. It's just another version of al pastor. Oh my god! It so juicy and there is a flavor explosion on the tongue.
I think I ordered one of everything. Tacos, mullitas, tostadas.... by the end I was so stuffed I could barely walk .
Luckily when I walked in there wasn't much of a line but I hear wait times can be insane. Even then, totally worth it! 
Bring cash!!! Makes paying easier. 
Drinks are limited 
Everyone was so nice too, the customer service was not lacking here! 
A great place to indulge! Check it!"}
{"text":"Went to the new location . We come to Vegas every year for the BCA tournament. Once again, amazing food!!! We went on a Tuesday evening 9:30-10:00....the lines were about 10 minutes...always a happy group !!!"}
{"text":"The only reason why these delicious tacos are not getting 5 stars is because they are a bit over prices. They are, however, very good."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos in Las Vegas but be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes in line. Once you've tried these tacos, this place will become you're go-to taco spot in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Man! When I came to Vegas and saw the line out da door on a Sunday! I was like \"I gotta try this place\" So I tried it on Monday and bomb! Reasonably priced and bomb!"}
{"text":"I'm loving it!
make sure to add pineapples to the spicy pork tacos!
oh oh oh and don't forget the fries with meat!"}
{"text":"Wow, San Diego has moved up the 15 freeway.

Great food... need more seating.

To die for."}
{"text":"Oh em gee.  Beware!  $2 tacos will make you an addict!  

My ultimate favorite taco is the Tripa; extra crispy.  It's a crispy crunch when you take your first bite that ends in a nice melt in your mouth experience.  Super flavorful, tasty, and fulfilling.  It has that dense flavor that can only allow for a couple.

Mix the Tripa taco with a nice Al Pastor and Carne Asada and you're good to go.  All the tacos here pack some real flavor, and to me is considered the closest thing to really good Mexican food in all of Las Vegas. 

There is a good size indoor eating area, and a better sized outdoor eating area, and a big enough parking lot off the strip.  So it's actually easy to get up in this place and have some good ol' cheap but really awesome tacos!"}
{"text":"Went to this place cause I heard it was good. What a disappointment, tacos were horrible. First the meat has no flavor and when I got them they were cold. The guacamole was crap I couldn't believe people give this dump 5 stars. I'm from Los Angeles and I've had way better tacos at taco trucks. So if you're in Vegas don't waste your time coming here unless you like eating cold and no flavor tacos"}
{"text":"Passing through Vegas, we were looking for quick and delicious tacos. Located right of the 15 freeway, we decided to give this place a try and we were not disappointed. 

Pretty quiet around 5pm on a Friday, there was no line when we entered. Walked right up to the counter and ordered. Tried a variety of meat. They were out of carnitas, the shredded beef was suggested and it ended up being my favorite. You can ask for non spicy salsa or my favorite, spicy. Unlimited limes and radishes available on a cart inside the restaurant. 

Once you get your order, you pay in a separate line. Tacos are 2.75 and drinks are 1.75. I thought it was a bit pricey for tacos. Some lacked in the amount of meat. Drink selections are good and unlimited, enjoyed the pina colada.

Overall, we found the tacos to be flavorful and the meat cooked perfectly. Probably doesn't need two tortillas. The meat portions doesn't require it. 

Plenty of seating inside and out. Super casual location."}
{"text":"Best tacos that everything  always fresh and clean place to eat at Vegas nice and friendly people serving"}
{"text":"Awesome place to hit up after a night out on the Strip. I'm from LA where there are taco trucks around every other corner, and I gotta say that Tacos El Gordo is just as good as the best of those. I came at about 3 am so it wasn't terribly crowded, although there was still a line at all of the different stations. I only had a chance to try out an al pastor taco and an asada taco but both were delicious. I think the best part was this green salsa-sauce that they put on the asada taco....no idea what it was unfortunately. Next time I'm back in Vegas, I'll definitely try to find an opportunity to come back and try some more of their food. Definitely a gem nestled at the edge of the Strip."}
{"text":"Excellent. I am from Omaha and thoroughly enjoyed Tacos El Gordo. There are numerous options for tacos (steak/spicy pork/etc) and all are reasonably priced ($2 a taco). 

Anyways, there are 400+ reviews for this place and it's clearly highly rated. I agree with this high rating and plan on going back here every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"They show me love.  I usually get the tacos adobada, between 3-4 and it fills me up for the rest of the day.  The staff is super friendly inside and this place is alwaysss busy.  

I order the quesedilla but it's not the kind that you're probably used to.  It's like a taco with another layer of tortilla with cheese.

I think they stay open until 3am, but that's as late as I've been able to get a late meal from there.  I've experimented with pretty much everything they have to offer but I always go back to adobada tacos!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Went to Vegas for a conference and wanted to see where locals eat. This place is in a tourist area but clearly has an ethnic following. The tacos were crazy good authentic hand made corn tortillas. The meats are being cooked and sliced right in front of you. Don't be intimidated by all the Spanish speaking but try to roll with what the locals are getting. When they asked what I want on it I just said everything but not spicy and they took care of it. You don't want to mess with perfection too much. Wish I could go back there every week. We waited about a half hour to get in."}
{"text":"What can I say, be prepared to wait, and be prepared for a taco experience like no other! The place is a old school Vegas institution in a not so good of a location. But I've been coming down to this area for years to find places just like this! Yes, it's straight out of South L.A. with all the questionable characters walking around. Be aware of your surroundings, and mind your own business, and enjoy some damn good tacos! The place occupies a old Wendy's and you have three lines to which to decide to get in. There's a line for Asada and Chorizo tacos, one for pastor and variations of it, and another for beef tongue and tripa. Pick one and get in line and the lines are long! It's worth it, and when you get up there you can always ask for something from the other line. The flour and corn tortillas are hand made and pressed before your eyes! The Asada was flame grilled before your eyes and lathered with a guacamole spread and salsa! Knock you out with the first bite! The spicy pork was equally as impressive, and this all left me thinking. Why aren't our good neighbors from the south of us just mass producing such great goodness as this!! This southern gentleman left thinking when you find a taco joint like this, and there's not many, appreciate it and find your way back again!!"}
{"text":"1.  Thank you Yelpers for the recommendation.

2.  Get off the strip and come try these tacos.  They are one of a kind and well worth the effort of finding a way to get here.  Words cannot describe how good these things are!   Other pros -- the tacos are super cheap - dirt cheap - compared to anything on or near the strip.  They also take credit cards!

3.  Adobada.

4.   Learn to say Adobada -- that's what you're going to want to order!

I tried a variety of tacos.  All were great, but my favorite was the Adobada.  The line for those specific tacos is longer than the rest.  Anytime I'm in LAs Vegas, I will definitely make a trip to grab a few tacos.

I'm telling you -- go now!"}
{"text":"Went to Tacos El Gordo tonight.

Anyone whose read any previous reviews know my wife and I are from Southern California so we are constantly on the look out for great Mexican food in Vegas like why you can find in So Cal.

Tonight we went to Tacos El Gordo (E Charleston location).

First you can spot this place pretty easily as the small building is bright pink in color.  When you go inside there is a giant counter, and depending on what part of the menu you are ordering from, you stand in a different line. This is good in theory but a little bit of a hassle, as my wife was looking for Tacos Al Pastor which had no line and I went for Carne Asada which had several people waiting.  The meat is cooked and cut fresh in front of you, and the tacos are slapped together quickly.  I also ordered the carne asada fries.  Once you get your food, you go to a different counter and pay.

Pros:  VERY tasty food made fresh and for the tacos they are not terribly expensive (around 2 bucks each).  The asada fries stood out for me here tho.  Freshly fried fries topped with a moderate amount of carne asada, then topped with shredded cheese, sour cream, cilantro lime sauce and fresh guacamole.  You can order half or full and the full is massive.  They also have a full soda fountain as well as an BANG! Fountain which features my favorite Orange Bang!

Cons: very limited seating for such a busy place, the separate lines could leave your guest sitting with food getting cold while you wait and the asada fries take a bit to come out.   Higher price on some items, as the carne asada fries are $12 which in CA you would get the equivalent for about $8.50.

Overall good food in a town that considers places like Chipotle Mexican food, this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"This place is real deal taco place only. Make sure you come here after researching. Everything is in Mexican. It took me awhile to order my food. 

There's 3 separate lines depending on what you want to order. After you order, you get your food and then you pay on the right. Ladies are super nice. 

I got steak quesadilla but it's very different from Taco Bell which I'm used to. It comes with onions, salsa sauce, parsley, and cheese. It was really good. I also tried taco pork. It reminded me of char siu meat from Chinese food. But also very good. 

I really need to study some Mexican food words next time. I felt pretty lost."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that this is an amazing place with great food at a great price. If you're in the area, don't hesitate to go here. I tried a few different types and none disappointed. It's a little odd setup at first, but once you get the lines it makes sense (if I recall, there were 5 lines for different types of meats)."}
{"text":"I use to live in San Diego and loved this place. I was so excited when they opened a location in Vegas. It was a short walk from where we were staying so we ended up coming here TWICE in one trip. First was late at night after some drinks which was perfect. There wasn't much of a line and we were able to find seats right away. The second time was Sunday at noon where the place was a ZOO! I think they need to figure out a new way to ensure people know they are in the right lines and to also pay! I saw a few people that just sat down at tables after getting the food...I'm pretty sure they didn't pay? Anyway, I was able to ask the guy in my line to also get me two carne asada tacos from another line, tehehe.

This place is awesome. I'll be coming time and time again!"}
{"text":"omg so good and worth the wait in line only complaint is the freaking indoor dining sucks they have no real ac inside other then that dee-lish tacos the lady security guards are so friendly and super helpful cant wait to return"}
{"text":"Now here is a favorite spot for the late night clubbing crew....  

Tacos El Gordo runs all night long to cater to those party people who literally just got out of XS...... and are super hungry!

Be aware of the long lines!!!  It sort of goes quick but nevertheless it's still a long ol line to be waiting in...

Quick eats for after clubbing!  Which Taco would you like?

They are famous for the pastor taco!  Spicy Shaven pork on the spinner rotisserie is a crowd favorite!  But they also have tons of other stuff as well!  (gotta try their super nacho!  It is humongous!)

Here is a tip for all future visitors!  Don't just have your heart set on tacos!  From my personal experience, if you get just tacos you get smaller portions of meat!  Try the other varieties as meat portions are much much more than just simple tacos!

They've got free refills on drinks!  Including Horchatas!

You want sauces to go with your meal?  Ask for it as you are paying the cashier!  He/she's got it in a small fridge behind her!

Again, all sorts of meat options for you to choose from, and when it's real busy, they got both sides going at one time so it help speeds up the process!

To me... it's not the best tacos I've had, but the lengua was delicious!

Maybe the perfect after clubbing snack?  It's for you to find out!  Try Tacos El Gordo next time you are near!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it's better than the one in Chula Vista BUT they have Adobada fries and that's a winner to meeeee!"}
{"text":"This place is actually really nice and not so crowded as it is the furthest from the strip, the food is amazing, especially the Al Pastor and the Mulas. Everyone I know states the same no visit to vegas is complete with out a stop at Tacos el Gordo, it's funny because there are hundreds of taco places in Vegas but this truly is the king of the taqueria. The flavor is authentic as well, this is truly Tijuana style Tacos, reminds me of growing up and crossing to Tijuana to shop at Comercial Mexicana and eating Tacos at tacos el Gordo. 

     A little advice I will give you is that you can actually order any type of taco from any line just as long as you are ordering from that particular meat also, in other words while ordering asada you can order al pastor also, they will send someone for you to get it, they know their lines get long and they don't want you eating cold food. So it is something they do to help out. They also have a very large selection of soft drinks both Mexican and American Favorites."}
{"text":"While I think the food at Tacos El Gordo's was okay, the dining experience as a whole was rather forgetful.

First, what is the reason for having multiple lines for different kinds of meat? It makes zero sense to me. The lines are slow and you can forget about getting multiple meats if you come alone. Luckily, I was able to try several meats because we got in different lines. We waited over an hour at the two popular lines but there were other lines that had much less people. Why don't they make things more efficient and let people order any meat at any of the stations?

The adobada, which is the meat they're known here wasn't all that interesting to me. I don't understand why everyone is crazy about this red pork. Don't forget to ask for the slices of pineapple off the top of their spit. You can also ask for the grilled veggies and peppers with your tacos. Out of adobada, asada, cabeza, and lengua, I liked their lengua the most. It was probably one of the best lengua tacos I've had, actually. Unfortunately, I didn't think much of their sauces.

Even though the tacos weren't bad or anything, the whole waiting in line forever and having different lines for different types of meat marred the overall experience here. It was very difficult finding a table to eat at as well. Hopefully some of these issues were particular to this location. I'm hopeful that I'll have a better experience at one of their other locations."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Getting a table was hard but the tacos were really good. If you like street tacos but want someplace more established then this is a great place to go. I'm sure they can super packed on the weekends. The carnie Asada fries were pretty good but I've had better"}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place, but I'm glad I got to try the super delicious foods they serve. Go there hungry, not semi-full like I was. 

There were a lot of people on a Saturday. They have their own parking lot and a lot of cars can park. 


First time here, just FYI, there were 3 different lines you can stand in depending on what you want to order. If you don't know which line is which, at the front of each line, there is a see-through menu listing which lines can order which foods. Also, if you wanna order drinks that's in the pay line on the other side of the food lines. (I didn't know that so I thought I would mention it and save you from looking like a fool LOL). The longest line is always their popular Adobada Fries. It was a 45 minute wait for just ordering in that line. Other lines are pretty quick. 

The Adobada fries are very delicious. Lots of flavor, a bit heavy with the sauce and fries were kinda salty for me, but other than that I was great. The 3 of us ordered 1/2 fries since we ordered something else too. I ordered Chicken Mulas. It was recommended by my friend and it was really good. The meat is so flavorful and yummy!!! With my mulas, I also asked for grilled onions, yummss, which they gave to me on the side. 

They have a lot of tables and seats. A lot of people sit in the front, where people enter, but here's also a side area where it's a bit empty.

If I do come back, I would definitely come hungry!"}
{"text":"This place was okay I would rated 3 and 1/2 stars just because the meat tasted good. However the place alone is not nice when you walk in you feel like you have walked into an oven it's very hot and their cooking smoke is everywhere. I don't understand how people can sit and eat in those circumstance I have a toddler and I would not put her through that or myself. Now to the menu I order two quesadillas and they only have beef no chicken what's that about, and to top it off they are the oddest quesadilla instead of the quesadilla being folded it looked like a tostada except with a small flower tortilla and a tiny toasted tortilla on top. Their tacos were super small I normally eat two regular size corn tortillas but I had to get 8 just to get full since their tortillas were the size of my toddlers hand  . The prices are ok but they get you by ordering more because their food product it's small. The service was ok I wasn't wowed by it but it was fine."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is a local institution. This place is awesome. They have street tacos for $2 each.

You stand in different meat lines and order the meat how you want: in tacos, in mulas, over fries, ect. There are many street taco places in Las Vegas but this place has it down to a science.

I recommend the adobada aka spicy pork, the lengua, and the tripas aka tripe. Mulas are like small quesadillas. You can't go wrong with street tacos though. 

My suggestion is to get the grilled green onions to eat with a side of salsa."}
{"text":"I really didn't think their would be much of a difference between the two locations, but the Charleston location trumps the LV BLVD location bad.

Down to the payment station, this shop just doesn't do the El Gordo name justice.

I do like the area of this one more, but the food was just not the same in my opinion.

I ordered the usually Carne Asada fries and the Adobada tacos.

Maybe I came on a bad day, but the steak wasn't cooked how I like and still being a bit pink.

Having carne asada fries means the steak is grilled in my opinion.

I don't mind a little pink in my steak, but this was disappointing. 

Also the sauces or salsas aren't made easily attainable so don't forget to ask."}
{"text":"holly shit I found them on yelp, and its the same mother fuckers from TJ! No joke! Some one actually loved the tacos El Gordo in TJ enough to venture up with them in Vegas. Well they taste almost the same except for the price of course, but who cares, I had the Al pastor/adobada and it was spot on, great tacos! Also had the AL pastor fries and they were damn good too! If you have been to the one in TJ you are going to love the one/s in Vegas. Best Al pastor tacos I've had this side of the boarder."}
{"text":"Asada with everything comes with cilantro, onion, salsa, and guacamole. Guac was good. Tortillas are hand made and delicious. Adobada was good too but the line was at least 30 minutes long due to their inefficient ordering system. 

Adobada and al pastor line were separate from the 2 other lines. After u order your food they give it to you and u have to stand in ANOTHER line to pay for the food. It's stupid. Oh and the tacos are over 2.00 each. 

I'm glad I tried it but I won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"delicious is all i got to say! just had these about 2 days ago & cannot get them out of my mind! if you are in the area & dont stop by than your loosing out!

el pastor is slow cooked & my fav!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't try Tacos El Gordo. I went there. As soon as I was about yo pick up my taco. I saw a worm on my food.I complained there was a worm on her food. I asked to speak to the manager complained to the manager. The manager was rude and obnoxious. She told me not to worry because it was only a fruit worm. She didn't even apologize I suggest no one goes to eat there. I didn't even get an apology, refund nor anything. I give it a one"}
{"text":"Been to the one in San Diego and loved it, so I had to try this one while in vegas. I had the spicy pork tacos and they were just alright. Wish the meat had more flavor."}
{"text":"We came in about 145am. No line no wait. SCORE!!! We got in the wrong line initially, but we went down to the steak line & placed our orders. The workers were weird in a friendly kind of way. Better than the 1st location I checked out. (Service was shitty) This visit was my first time getting \"everything\" on my taco & it was really good!!! I stuck with a safe item (steak) but the next time I visit I'm gonna try some tongue or something weird! I'm a foodie I gotta step outside the box right??? I'm excited to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"FOOD WAS GOOD THE SERVICE WAS NOT!!!!!!!

Walked in & it appears to be a truck stop, not an issue, but not what I was expecting either. But anywho, we asked the cashier where to start & she told us to go down by the food. Menu isn't extensive & that's cool. Requested 3 steak tacos, 1 w/everything no onions, 2 onions & lettuce. After I repeated my order 6xs the lady says we don't have lettuce. Ok onion only. So then they make it & screw it up she asks for my order AGAIN & gets an attitude & starts talking shit under her retarded ass breath. I politely told her slow ass I repeated it 10xs it's not my fault your English or comprehension skills are lacking. I'm beyond pissed now. Then they didn't ask us was it for here or 2 go & got mad because we asked for a container.. 

FOOD- Steak was fresh & hot, condiments were freezing cold & the corn shells they made were cold & hard 2..

Checking out the downtown location cuz they suck here!!! 2 stars for steak meat & facility appeared to be clean."}
{"text":"Fantastic and friendly service.  They have the BEST tacos in town and they are very reasonably priced.  My husband and I both had a variety 4 tacos each, fries, and drinks for under $25 total.  

PS---The tacos al pastor are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"We were visit Las Vegas and checking out places to eat...Tacos El Gordo does not disappoint! Simple menu but several mix ups available. Definitely bookmarking this place!"}
{"text":"You cannot do Vegas without Tacos El Gordo. I don't know why it was so good to me, but it was my first time and I loved every bit of it. 

My girlfriend and I were on our own food tour and wanted to hit up some other spots before our trip back to LA. We each ordered 3 adobado tacos with a pineapple on top and a side of chilis and onions. Everything put together made the masterpiece. At $2 a piece, it was one of the best meals I ever had. It was so good, we went back for 3 more tacos a piece. The green sauce too--reminds me of the good days when my family and I drove all the way to Tijuana just for some good tacos. 

It's a quick eat--lines go by quickly and there is ample seating. Next time, I'm going to do myself a favor and get at least 10 tacos and fries with that. I dream about Tacos El Gordo every night..."}
{"text":"They moved this lil spot off the strip but it's still packed! It's a must try if you come to Vegas Asada & alpastor are both"}
{"text":"Whenever I want tacos, I CRAVE this place! Their el pastor is soooooooo good!! My favorite taco place EVER!"}
{"text":"I LOVE TACOS! Have been coming here for years, even before they moved to a bigger location. Lines are usually always long, I would suggest coming with friends or family so that you can split up in the lines and get different kinds of meats! I would suggest to only get tacos and nothing else. My favorites consist of the saudero, cabeza, and abodaba!
Also, we usually have the boys go and bring the girls tacos as we get ready for nightclubs!"}
{"text":"Best drunk food on the strip. Only struggle is that if you're on the other side, it's going to be a trek to get here.

Parking is super easy because there's a lot. Also, very close to the Wynn/Encore, so if you're staying there, why haven't you come here for tacos yet?

Line moves quickly so long as you don't goof up and wait in the wrong line. Each line has specific types of meat you can order. After you get your food, shimmy on over to the cashier to pay.

Tried both the lengua/carne asada/carne asada fries. All delicious. No complaints."}
{"text":"After spending a small fortune for our room, we looked forward to having a less expensive dinner. Came on a Friday night and all 5 of the lines were coming our of the doors. We left. I didn't want tacos THAT badly. We hit up the Indian kabob place a few doors down instead, but I was determined to come back and try these tacos. Saturday around noon we returned, and while the lines were sill long, they weren't as bad as they were the night before. 

TIP: There are five lines total, the first one is Adobada and Al Pastor (for non Latin people, these are pork options). The second line is for Asada (marinated chopped beef), Mulas, Sopes, and Chorizo (sausage). The next two lines are duplicates of the first two lines. The fifth line is along the side and serves the more exotic meats, Cabeza, Lengua, Sesos (it doesn't specify on the menu, but this is brain, and yes, it can be delicious if made correctly), Buche, Tripa (this is the small intestine), and Suadero (thinly cut beef belly or leg meat). I believe the Vampiro (made with tortillas that are grilled to the point of being dried out) can be ordered in any of the lines, but make sure you order in the correct meat line.

Even for lunch, it was still too crowded to eat there, so we took our tacos to go and ate them in the car... but, OH MY GAWD... these tacos were GOOD! The freshly made tortillas are what I think really make these tacos so delicious. Combined with the flavorful meat (a recent reviewer wrote they were full of fat, I don't know what he experienced, because ours were GREAT - not one fatty or gristle bite), salsa that isn't too spicy, and perfectly made guacamole they add on top, these are hard to beat, taste wise! We ordered all asada tacos for the Mister and me because were were not going to stand in TWO long lines! Because of the salsa, the tortillas do tend to get a bit soggy before you can finish one and get to the next, so if you're eating 3 or 4 of them like we were, your 3rd or 4th tacos will likely be ready to fall apart - this could be a problem if you like to take your time and savor your food, like I do; not so much if you just wolf it down, like the Mister. Even a little soggy, these are damn good tacos! So much so, that we came back again that Monday before we left Vegas to grab some more. This time the Mister got sesos and lengua (which he raved about) and I stuck to more asada. We tried the horchata and it was amazingly good! Not too sweet or thick like some places, it was a perfect balance of flavors. 

TIP: Because there is such limited seating, they have the rule that you must already have your order and paid for it before you sit at a table. It's a good rule, to keep things fair and so that people who are ready to eat can sit and enjoy their food while those still in line don't need to waste space; but like most rules, there are always people who don't know how to follow it - so good luck on going to what looks like an empty table only for some douche to say, \"Oh these seats are taken.\" Me, I would have sat anyway, the Mister is far nicer than I am, though, and found us seats a couple tables down. Not before the broads in line who were the \"seats taken\" heard me saying, \"If their asses aren't in the seats then they're not taken.\" 

Still, we were able to enjoy another round of delicious tacos and left Vegas happy! Definitely will be a regular spot whenever we hit up this town!!!"}
{"text":"I recently took a road trip to Ensenada, Mexico with five other \"Amigos\" for a bachelor party solely for either a good donkey show or the best street taco stands that we can find.  And by good fortune we  pinpointed the best Adobada Tacos during our taco stand-hopping.  Sooo much that we pigged out at this particular station 3 times during our short visit.  

Fast forward to the other day the now, newly-wed guy (i don't know what they call them but he's married now and fucked for life) told me he discovered a place that has the most closest and most authentic Adobada Tacos similar to that stand in Encenada.  Heck yea!

So after a long night of work I cruised down Charleston just east of the strip and from that adventure alone i felt like i was back in Ensenada.  Grimy and full of blehhh with taco shop at every corner.  

Once I've entered I was greeted by the first guy behind the counter, \"What's up my friend!?\" His attitude was so enthusiastic that I felt welcome in a surrounding that i wouldn't normally ventured alone in. I'm from an Asian decent and the only Spanish my amigo friends taught me are insults that you can only say to your.. friends. 

1st counter-dood basically gave me the low down of how to order.  It's a bit confusing, but you'll first have to grab a red tray and choose your taco guy depending on what kind of meat you want.  There's actually 4 different taco guy you can order from, but seriously, you only want to talk to the first guy because he has what you're looking for. Adobada, son!  

Adobada is pork that is slowly roasted with a red chili sauce, spices, and vinegar.  Kind of remind me of Char Siu (Chinese BBQ Pork) but without the sweetness.  

You have a choice of corn (double) or flour tortilla.  He'll edge off a few slice or pork and dice them up for you on a flat, table fryer thingy and ask if you want everything on it (onions, cilantro, and avocado sauce).

I order 4 of those as well as a Chorizo Taco, and Beef Quesadilla loaded. All on corn tortilla except the Quesadilla on flour. 

Payment would be best after you received your food, so you can get drinks and napkins.  They also have a side bar with radish and limes to accompany your tacos.  And lastly the 4th taco guy (usually a female) have grilled green onions and peppers to go along with your meal as well.  A squeeze of fresh lime over the taco and you've pretty much got the closest thing to Mexico's street taco's minus the hot sauce.

The Chorizo was surprising not oily like i've had before.  I would consider this authentic too.  Also the beef quesadilla was not bad either!  I love the cheese in the quesadilla!

I'm not claiming any expertise, but this is really good stuff.  My only other achievements are Roberto's, Amigo Tacos, and a few highly overrated, upper scale Mexican restaurant around town.  None worth mentioning.

{"text":"I've been going to their location in Chula Vista religiously for a few years, so it was only right that I try this location. I'm pleased to say that this location is just as good as the one down south. After all, consistency is key!

What I need to emphasize is that this location gets BUSY. They open at 10am with a line already, and by 11:30am, the line is out the door. It seems like there's a perpetual line! Let me clarify-- there is a line outside that you wait in just to get inside to wait into another line to order your food. If you can deal with this, you truly will be awarded.

My favorite meat to get here is hands down the Adobada. There's just something about charred, spicy pork that is just downright delicious. Their tacos come loaded with onions, cilantro, salsa and an avocado/sour cream sauce. You really can't go wrong, and I'm always good for 5-6 tacos.

If you're courageous, I'd also recommend their fries. The fries are topped with your choice of meat, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. They keep it super simple, which I appreciate. They have two sizes, with the large size being a very generous portion. My only gripe is that sometimes you don't get as much meat as you think you should (after all, it is $13), but that's never stopped me."}

I usually come here alone after work because my other half is sick of it.   Yes, i come here that much.  I wish I can work here or at least own a pair of their t-shirt.  I'd gladly rock it and show my love and support for Taco El Gordos everywhere i go for free.

{"text":"45 minutes in line just to order our food!!!  Are you kidding me???

I remember having my first taco from Tacos El Gordo.  This was close to 20 years ago, TEG was just a small taco stand, and the location was in TJ (right next to Caliente Sports Book & Senor Frogs to be exact).  As a teen or in my early 20's, we use to hit up Caliente, place some bets, and finish the night off eating tacos that cost roughly $.50 each.  Around the early 2000's, TEG started to invade the 619. They didn't have a restaurant in the US at the time, but catered a lot of events and parties. Heck..I even had TEG cater one of my daughter's birthday parties back in the day.  Their food was phenomenal, the service was impeccable, and the price was by the hour.  There was a huge demand for TEG's street tacos in the 619.  The demand was so big that they eventually opened a few restaurants in Southside San Diego.  Tacos El Gordo the restaurant was born and the rest is history.

The original TEG in SD (ie. Chula Vista) is very similar to this location.  The prices are about the same, the two separate lines (one for asada, one for al pastor) are the same, the taste/quality is the same, and the wait is the same. Actually, SD's location is a little faster, but just a little. The GP and I decided to give this TEG a try. We waited about 45 minutes to place our orders, which is way too long.  The gurlpren went directly to the al pastor line and I went straight for the asada line. One item that this location has that the SD location doesn't have is Carne Asada Fries. So, I opted for Carne Asada Fries with two sides of Asada Tacos.  I admit, their street tacos are as good as it gets. For $10, they really hook up their Carne Asada Fries.  And for $2 each, the Asada Tacos were also hooked up. Taste wise...TEG in the NLV is pretty close to the TEG in the 619.  TEG's Carne Asada Fries is pretty good, but the not the best that I have had.  I still killed it, though.  However, they still rock a pretty damn good street taco.  And if it wasn't for the long lines, I would have probably given them 4 or more stars. Overall, I am a fan of TEG's food.  I'm just not a fan of the lines.  Gracias very much!!!"}
{"text":"This place has some yummy tacos!! Lines can be long but well worth the wait! I had the al pastor and lengua tacos both were really good! The only bad thing is there isn't to much seating but people come and go quick so you won't be standing for long. If I came back to Vegas this will be my go to place! Beats the over priced and overrated restaurants off the strip any day!"}
{"text":"I was not prepared for the assault on my senses when I walked into this place!  This place was crazy busy and apparently everyone was hungry.  I felt people were seriously throwing elbows.  The smells were overwhelming too, in a good way and it was freaking loud.   3 different lines, one for each meat.  I heard the guy in front of me order two kinds of meat from the adobada guy but when I tried he said NO!  Must be my face.

Per the suggestion of Yelpers, I went with the adobada tacos (aka spicy pork) and a carne asada muala.  The muala was pretty good but the entire time I was eating it, I kept wishing I had ordered it with adobada.  Not that the carne asada was bad, it's just that the pork was unbelievably good!  I agree with Misti Y. that the peppers and onions added absolutely nothing to the meal. Skip them and fill up on the delicious spinning wheel o' pork.  This place is not convenient to much of anything but was definitely worth the haul."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! We were in vegas and craving tacos and wanted authentic. And this was the place. We got there before they opened and waited inside till they were ready. We ate there for breakfast and dinner that day. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"So this mythical taco place is a word of mouth recommendation that I decided to visit on my last trip to Vegas. It's drive past the strip into a run down area of Vegas but it's worth to try this authentic spot.

The place is a transplant from Tijuana and they do it just like they do in Mexico. The place was packed when we arrived! You squeeze in and get in line by what kind of meat you want: asada, pollo, al pastor, lengua, sesos, etc. Then when you get to the front you let the cook know whether you want tacos, sopas, carne fries, quesadilla, etc. He prepares your meal on the spot using fresh ingredients including hand made tortillas and gives you your completed order so you can pay at the register. The meat is well cooked and the tortillas are bomb!

Plus, through all the lines of people and sweltering temperatures behind the grill, everyone who works here does it with a smile. Great customer service! This is going to be a tradition when I go to Vegas now."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with choosing these guys. Delicious! 5 stars without a doubt. I love ordering the asada fries those are so good here."}
{"text":"This location is soo much better than the one on Vegas Blvd! It's less crowded and you can actually find a table. I will defiantly be going to this location from now on. Oh yea, and still BOMB AF best tacos ever! Vampiro everything!!! Don't waste your stomach on basic tacos, get the Vampiro/Mulas!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I ever tried (al pastor) just make sure to be patient with your food because this place is always full. I just wish you guys will add tortas to the menu but i love this place"}
{"text":"Went over labor day weekend to Vegas.  So let me get to the meat of this.  If its crowded which it was for us, don't expect to find a place to sit and eat your meal.  It is lacking tables or areas to enjoy your tacos.  So you stand in specific lines and those lines only serve those items otherwise you have to stand in line again.  The organization of it all doesn't allow you to get a variety of tacos.  Different if you are not used to it.  We settled for carne asada tacos and wanted to get the spicy pork but again didn't want to begin all over again.  When we got outside there were people whose family members were still in line who had grabbed any table and just waited.  Meanwhile we were looking to find a ledge, a chair, and finally settled for a curb near the restaurant.  There were cockaroaches near the curb that we were sitting at and well, again...no tables which lowered my rating for the restaurant.  Otherwise the food is very good.  Authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great tacos, no complain about the food, just the people at the cashier are king of grumpy"}
{"text":"Place is a madhouse. Crazy packed. Got some carne asada tacos and spicy pork tacos to go with carne asada fries. The fries were a pleasant surprise. Tacos are very good. The salsas need a little work. The meat in the tacos have a nice smokey flavor. Came here late at night to avoid crazy lines during the day."}
{"text":"Why did I only find out about this place on my last day!!  This place is legit and conveninetly located right outside the Wynn!!!  They are definitely doing tacos justice, served with care and attention to detail.  It looks like a place that was picked up right out of Tijuana so don't expect a classy place, but it doesn't matter because your their for the food.  Their pork tacos are phenomenal, moist and juicy, and I'm pretty sure the only place I've seen serve tacos from a rotating gyro-like spit, which are cut freshly as you order.  Also, don't forget to get the roasted peppers."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype you wait in the line to order your food then you wait in line to pay for it then you sit down at tables like a high school cafeteria the lighting is horrible and you can't even get a chicken burrito I came here  because everyone talks about this place but I'll take the Roberto's chicken taco over this food any day the week"}
{"text":"The food is great and the people are helpful and friendly. If you like street tacos, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"MMM Everything here is pretty much great as i've tasted almost everything on the menu but what stands out to ME is the Carne Asada Fries. I've tried the carne asada fries at every mexican restaurant there is in Las Vegas, and Tacos El Gordo's Carne Asada Fries have to be at the top. If you haven't tried them, i suggest trying them here and compare. It's inexpensive, a big portion and it tastes amazing.

Will always come back."}
{"text":"My review is based on my experience with their service and food. 

Came on a Saturday and there's a line out the door, which is fine I understand it has a lot of popularity. They have this system where they have about 4 lines. Each consisted of the different types of meats depending on what you wanted. You got your most popular which is asada, al pastor and others which include cabeza, tripas, Lengua, etc. 
don't really understand this I think it creates a lot of confusion and with not let you get the food you really want. Example, if I want asada and al pastor I have to get in line twice!  So aside from waiting 45 minutes in line to even get inside of the establishment, I have to wait another 30 minutes before I even order my asada tacos, then move over to the next line to get my al pastor which would be at least another 15 minutes. 

Why not create another system where it is easy to order and get all of the tacos you desire instead of waiting an hour and half to get your food? 

Anyways, would I come again to order sub par tacos and wait a long time? No. Too much hype"}
{"text":"If you like authentic Tijuana street tacos then this is your place.  Hot grilled mini tortillas, your choice of meat, a little red onion, some guacamole, and a splash of salsa.  Simply delicious!"}

What are you waiting for.... go there now and enjoy a great ... authentic Mexican meal."}
{"text":"I live locally and upon hearing everyone who lives downtown say that Tacos El Gordo is the best, authentic, cheap Mexican available in Las Vegas, I dragged my girlfriend and we stopped in one random Thursday night.  The wait time was long (maybe 45+ minutes) and it is almost cafeteria style in the sense that you walk up with your tray and order your tacos and then pay a cashier before you walk out.  Tacos were better than decent & very fresh, but the Carne Asade fries were heavenly.  Totally cheap, very delicious and when I was the only non-Hispanic standing in line....surely a sign of great Mexican food!  I will go back and drag others to experience this little local gem."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! I know I shouldn't be eating this food since I'm getting ready for a fight but... I had to try it! Ill pay for it in the gym! A must eat spot for all my Latinos! Reminds of me the tacos in Mexicali! I definately recommend this place! Best tacos in Vegas HANDS DOWN!!!"}
{"text":"As a taco master back in la, I can confidently judge tacos.

I was hungry and wanted a quick fix so I popped by this joint.  It was interesting how different meats had different lines. I settled on El lengua taco and cabeza and carne asada fries. I was disappointed by the flavors. Everything tasted smokey, as if it needed a grill change.

Also, it's quite pricey for the tacos compared to la tacos. Overall, I'll skip tacos in vegas."}
{"text":"We went here twice on our trip to Las Vegas.  We were staying at the Trump Hotel, so this place was within a very short walking distance and the price and quality of food was great!  Highly recommend the Adobado Tacos and the Adobado Nachos as well.  Extremely cheap for where it's located."}

Date Visited: April, 2015

Verdict: I did not know Tacos can taste like gold.

Be prepared to line for a long time cause this place is popular. There are separate lines for different types of meat so make sure you line up for the pork (my recommendation, but generally the longest line). The staff are extremely efficient though. Best go if you're in town.

Adobada: This spiced pork reminds me of the taste of Char Siu (BBQ Pork in Canto Cuisine). The warm juice flows from the pork itself and fuses with the cold sauce; the pork is well spiced and prepared as it complements the crisp yet soft tortilla. The only complain: WHY THE HELL IS THIS SO SMALL. I ordered 3 and still did not have enough of it. Going to get more the next time I go to Vegas.

I lost my memory here I only remember this as one of the beef. (Should be either Suadero or Cabeza) The beef is crispy and is a bit blander than the previous taco. But it serves as an excellent transition taco before the Adobada"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos ; I waited in line for a while even when they just opened. Subtracted one star due to being disorganized."}
{"text":"Wow this place is pack the line are out the door but don't discourage wait it is so worth it the best tacos is this side of town I'm from OC i heard about this place through a friend I'm so happy I came the ALPASTOR is so good with slice of pineapple. These tacos tame back to Mexico City comfort food. You will not be disappointed I promise you. So bring your appetite and munch on."}
{"text":"A Tacos el Gordo in Vegas? I thought I was dreaming. I live in San Diego and if I ever want tacos, this place is always #1 on my list. Their adobada is to die for, and the green sauce they put on it is like magic sauce, I don't even know what it is (avocado crema?) but it is amazing. Like every Tacos El Gordo, the lines are long and it takes about 20-45 minutes to get your food and pay depending on what time you go, but well worth the wait.

Meat cut and tacos made right in front of you? What else could you ask for!"}
{"text":"If you want indulge in your GORDO side, then look no further. These tacos are legit.

The set up at first was intimidating. Whose is line, whose not, what is this line even anyway? That sort of thing. Luckily, I had a guide. He lead me into the promise land of PASTOR Y ADOBADA line.

Once your in line, the hard part is over. What to order? Just get tacos with everything on it. What's the everything they put on it? There was cilantro and a bunch of other stuff and some sauce in there. Who knows what it all was but it was fresh flavor explosion. It's hard not to get double digit tacos in line. The meat is on point, juicy and flavorful. The tortillas were little warm circles of deliciousness. I also got a quesadilla where they toast one tortilla and put some Oaxaca cheese in there. Weirdest quesadilla I'd ever seen but it was damn good though. 

The challenge is to get a seat really. Luckily, they do also have \"to go\" option where they wrap up your plate of tacos with aluminium foil, like you just left a party with some food to take home to the kids. Being well lit and remarkably clean despite the throngs of people in there was amazing."}

{"text":"So my husband was told by a coworker that if we're in Vegas we must check out Tacos El Gordo so we abliged. I'm sorry to say that I was not blown away by the food. In fact I was pretty shocked to find that it's a whole in the wall type of establishment in a not so nice part of town. Anyway the tacos were similarly dissapointing because I'm a carne asada lover and I did not love this carne asada. It had the taste of a backyard bbq grill, where I can taste the charcol if that makes sense?...ugh. The buche was okay the sope was overfried....the orchata was dispensed through one of those soda machines that taste nothing like orchata. I just wasnt very satisfied with my meal at all! OH the grilled onions were decent. I also didn't like the set up, it's kinda confusing. They have something that I guess is supposed to be different stations depending on what type of meat your ordering and it's not the most convenient. So if you want steak it's one station, if you want pork it's another, and another. I wasn't sure if I was supposed form a line at each or if I just slide down to the next....it's weird."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos but there ventilation sucks it was really smoking in there but the tacos were good especially the carne asada ."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever had. Everything was good. The adobado is especially good though. Didn't have any sesos so that was disappointing."}

{"text":"Taco cravings never stop... even while on vacation, so while in sin city, I had to do a Yelp search for \"best tacos in Las Vegas\" and Tacos El Gordo was at the top of the list. Luckily for me, it was walking distance from our hotel so we moseyed on over. And doubling our luck, it wasn't even crowded (maybe we should have hit the card tables with all this good fortune, but I digress). What's weird is that there are different windows for the different types of tacos. The guy at our (pastor) window was super nice and grabbed us some asada tacos from the guy next to him. But I can't imagine standing in line multiple times for multiple tacos. The pastor tacos were deeeeeelicious, topped with a verde salsa and pineapple. The asada tacos on the other hand, were just meh in my opinion... not a lot of flavor and topped off with a huge dollop of guacamole... and this is coming from a someone who is obsessed with anything avocado. In this case, it just didn't work because it was just as bland as the rest of the taco and made a huge mess. Overall, I would come back for the pastor tacos for sure."}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended this place,  so the family and I made a stop. With the freshly made tortillas and sopes, I can see why this place is so busy.

I didn't like how they separated the meats.  I wanted to try the Azada and the pastor, but there was only one of me so no way I was waiting in two lines to try a second meat. Unfortunately,  my azada came out salty and the salsa was lacking umph. Maybe one day I'll come back to try the pastor and give it a second chance."}
{"text":"The adobada tacos are the reason to come here.  All the others are still good but not amazing in my book.  The floor plan could use some work too with the  register placement sometimes creating lines that block traffic.  It can get very busy in here but if you've never been I do recommend it.  I wish they had some fish tacos too."}
{"text":"muy mal servicio del taquero...un señor canoso viejo enojon..y muy mal humorado..con voz de enojo y de descontento te preguntava cuantos, en lo que pensabas k mas pedir te decia en tono grotesco..cuantos en total quieres no puedo estar picando de pokito...esta a un lado del otro taquero k prepara solo los de pastor..no vayan..muy mal servicio"}
{"text":"Best Mexican mini-tacos near the strip! The place was packed but the lines moved quick and we received our food fast. Prices were reasonable. If your looking for some mini-tacos while in Vegas I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this literally \"down to earth\" taco place based on recommendation from a son's friend.  Choices of body parts used are beef brain, tongue, guts, to pork stomach. Lines were long and everything was ordered in Spanish courtesy of my daughter."}
{"text":"If you fail to plan, plan to fail.  Treat this like a Black Friday event and you'll be fine. Reinforcements are a necessity...especially if you want to try a variety of things.  There are different lines for different food items.

Lines were about a 20 minute wait at 11pm on a Sunday night.  Make sure you write everyone's order down especially if they want items left out of the taco.  It's like going to a store for milk, and forgetting what you came there for.  

The closer you get to the front, the more entertaining it is.  They prep the tacos and the tortillas right in front of you.  It was a mini Vegas show! The guys move quickly so you shouldn't complain about how long it takes to get your food.  

We were a party of nine foodies.  We all agreed that the food was ok."}
{"text":"Best tacos and quesadillas in Vegas! Saturday's and Sunday's they are slammed! Horchata and Tacos, does it get any better!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy!  But the tacos are just ok. I don't mind being in a chaotic festival of tacos, if the tacos are really that good. I tried adobada, lengua and suadero. I tried them with and without the salsa verde and the red.  I got some grilled peppers and onions. But no, I'm not blown away like many raving reviews around Yelp.  The Horchata which comes from the vending machine was good."}
{"text":"I thought this place was very overrated. Huge line going outside. The food was okay. I had the carne Asada tacos and Al pastor tacos along with a Asada quesadilla that I split with my wife. The quesadilla also was just like a taco with a pinch of cheese...
I will say that for being right next to the strip, it was well priced."}
{"text":"Cheap, yum and delicious varities tacos!
I love the spicy pork where they cut from the freshly roasted rack!
easy access location by bus, abit away from the strip but if u stay at wynn or encore it's totally walkable."}
{"text":"This place was a real shit-show when we walked in, but I'm glad we powered through.  It's chaotic and busy and you're in everybody's way while you're waiting in line.  Your patience will be tested if you're an impatient mutha like me... but your patience WILL pay off.  My most important piece of advice to you is to make sure you are in the correct line for the type of food you want... there are labels at the front of each line.

These tacos are tremendous.  They are also very fairly priced, because although they're pretty small - they're also just $2.  I ordered 3 and had wished I ordered 6 (seriously, 6... they're not that big).  Worth a trip to the northern end of the strip for these, just make sure you have some time to wait."}
{"text":"Great tacos but the facility is very dirty. The restrooms are disgusting. Makes me wonder how the kitchen is???"}
{"text":"Loved it! Tacos taste like the ones I would normally order in TJ. Lines are crazy, separate lines for different meats but move pretty quickly- know what you want when you get to the front of the line. The tamarindo candy at the register is also very good!"}
{"text":"This was on our list while visiting Vegas. We were afraid it would be crazy busy, based on the Yelp reviews. When we got there, we were pleasantly surprised. Also, it was a weekday.

There are different lines for different meats. I can see how this could be kind of inconvenient if it's crowded, and especially if you're by yourself and want to taste everything. I suggest going with at least 1 other person so you don't have to wait in all the lines. We had no problem though because it was pretty empty! Once you get all your food, you pay at a separate station.

We ordered 2 carne asada tacos, 2 adobada tacos, and carne asada/adobada fries. All items were delicious. Personally, I enjoyed the adobada meat more than the carne asada. I thought it was tastier and had good flavor. And those fries were not hard to finish at all! :P If I ever come back, I would just get adobada on my fries.

Service was friendly and the place nicely kept. Since they have different lines for the different meats, I would suggest knowing what you want before entering."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about. This place is a dirty shithole, so they have captured some of the Tijuana vibe correctly.

My Tacos El Gordo experience took just about 50 minutes to get 3 soggy tacos for just under $7 dollars.

There are several lines that you need to be in to get particular items, then you need to get in
to another unorganized line to pay. Oh and those lines, enjoy watching people cut in front of you making it more frustrating. 

The food itself was average. Definitely not worth waiting for.

My freshly pressed tortillas were obliterated by the time I hit the checkout due to the amount of salsa the cook ladled on to each taco. 

Now, to the actual tacos. The asada  was overshadowed by a handful of cilantro and onions, a full ladle of salsa and some green shit they represented as quacamole that was devoid of any palatability. The al pastor was pretty much the same. The chorizo taco was not too bad other than too much salsa and it gave me a rough gut. Most of the meat from the asada taco was gristly so I ended up pitching it in the trash along with the two other worthless tacos.

I can't really say the tortillas were anything special other than they are pressed there right in front of you. I do know after all the salsa that is dumped upon the tacos, and after about 5 minutes, the tortillas are useless as ingredient-holders, and you are left with a taco mess.

Pack a fork (and possibly your firearm and ccw), pay with cash and be prepared to wait a while if you venture out on the weekend. Otherwise, there are a few options right up the road that are less expensive and chaotic and you can actually enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos you can get anywhere. Just the sight and smell alone once you get done waiting in that long line, you know you are definitely at the right place. This place beats most of the other overpriced offerings on the strip."}
{"text":"Picked up spicy pork fries and just as the tacos, they are the bomb!!! Cant beat the half order for $5 and I'm stuffed with about a quarter of the meal left.I have not had a bad experience yet as only one other person on yelp has reported. This place kicks Roberto's butt by far. I'm lovin it!"}
{"text":"Not much else to say here. Try a variety. Lunch is better than later in day. Pork to left, carne a sad a in middle, rest around to right. Longest line for carne. All wraps whether taco or tostadas are great.  If with friends split up and order from each station.  Basic tasty rustic tacos."}
{"text":"This place kills it. Came here with my whole crew last week and we loved it. 

Tacos were why we came and we didn't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ask people where to go for the best tacos in town, and most of them will have one answer. After a long overdue return visit (of sorts), I have to concur.

Tacos El Gordo is a Tijuana import by way of California that's slinging some of the best street tacos around. I visited the Strip location once a couple years ago, but in comparison to some other taquerias, it's not as convenient for me to visit either that restaurant or the one here on Charleston. Not to mention the prices here, which are equal to if not higher than the others, with sales not ever appearing (at least to my eyes or ears). But if you want delicious tacos with all the proper fixings, and price isn't too big a concern, then choose these guys.

Like some of its close competitors do (or used to), Tacos El Gordo has a system where you order first, then pay last. The meats are divided by station, with asada taking up a huge grill to itself on the left, al pastor (adobada) occupying a vertical spit to the right, and the rest of the meats enjoying a bath or sauna in the center. You may have to line up 3 times (and you probably should), so it's nice to bring friends. Luckily, they work quickly enough that I was able to handle it myself during Monday lunch rush.

I tried all of the meats in taco form, and I will list them from best to worst (per my impression):

Asada ($2.25): I used to think Taco Tijuana had the best asada, but this is on par and perhaps even better. With the pico and guac, this beef is juicy, acidic, and just so freaking good even when it gets cold after you've been waiting in lines. It might be just a touch salty, but that's nothing a slice of radish or two can't take care of.

Al pastor ($2.25) was excellent, just a touch shy of my favorite (ever / in town). The dude actually waited for the vertical spit to turn to just the right spot to cut the caramelized meat. Make sure to get the pineapple, complimentary and available upon request. They're a must-have topping, and they lend the perfect sweetness even though these relatively large slices were a bit clunky.

Buche ($2.25), flavorful, tender pork stomach (not belly) served with red sauce. This is at least as good as what I used to consider my favorite buche in town, but I felt that I was able to taste more of the pork here.

Lengua ($2.40): I confused this with the cabeza at first, but this is definitely the superior head meat. This beef tongue was flavorful despite it being one of my last bites of the meal, and the green tomatillo sauce is the perfect acidic complement. it's certainly one of the better lengua tacos around town, and although it comes at a premium, the price is not _that_ much higher.

Suadero ($2.25): beef shoulder, served with red sauce. It's pretty salty and a little dry/tough, but the marinated flavor and meatiness make this a great option. As with other salty dishes, a bite of crunchy radish (available at a cart near the fountain drinks) helps to take away the edge enough.

Tripas ($2.25): crispy fried beef intestine w/ red sauce. It's definitely overly salty/intense. While it's serviceable, it's not one of the standouts here. There are at least two local taco places that have better tripas.

Cabeza ($2.25): cow head meat with tomatillo sauce. It's tender, and while the first bite was delicious, the rest of it fell flat as I've noticed cabeza sometimes does. Perhaps it was lacking some of the fatty, cartilaginous pieces that would make this a standout.

Cesos ($2.40): cow brain, served with tomatillo sauce. Subtle flavor that I could just detect. I know it should be soft, but this one was a little on the mushy side. This texture concern and the extra cost are why I'd say it's the least desirable meat here, but it's still worth a try if you have the stomach space.

For delicious Mexican street tacos, Tacos El Gordo really should be at the top of your list. Assuming I get a taco craving and don't wanna wait for special sales, this would be my first recommendation for tacos in general, and for asada and buche in particular. Choose this location if you're in the area or otherwise really wanna avoid Strip traffic."}
{"text":"I don't get it. There shouldn't be a great chain taco place in a well-touristed location such as the Strip, but here it is.

Tacos El Gordo has been one of my bookmarks for a long time, yet somehow it wasn't until I was literally half a mile away that I decided it was worth the trip. I'm really glad I made that oh-so dreadful drive...

Even though I've been to similar places, it took me a while to order. I wasn't sure why everybody was piled up on one side of the ordering area. And then there was the empty ordering station on the right edge, which threw me off further. Eventually, I did find my way to the open al pastor station and the open assorted cuts station, and I got my tacos.

After paying (cash only, $2+tax per taco), snapping photos, and finding a seat (outside the off-peak yet still packed restaurant in this awesome tent with two heavy-duty fans and real tables), I dug in and enjoyed delicious bite after delicious bite. And yes, I can review meat by meat because I asked the guy in the kitchen to point out which was which. And I may have eaten some of these before.

- Sesos: braaaaains. You, too, can be a zombie! This is pretty creamy. Makes sense, because it's cow brains. (Not sure I can compare the flavor to anything, just try if it you haven't and aren't squeamish. And no, i don't have mad cow disease yet.)
- Cabeza: tender head meat. From a cow. You can taste salt but it's not salty. Came with a green salsa, same one as on the cesos taco, and diced onions and cilantro, same mix as they provide on all tacos.
- Al pastor (adobada): I've had the unfortunate experience of overcooked, dry, salty pork at other places. Not here. I actually saw the meat bubbling on the vertical spit, and it tasted delicious. They actually have a medium spiciness red salsa under the almost neon green, sweet sauce.

(Funny story with that al pastor. There weren't pineapples, so I asked if it came with them. Al pastor guy goes to the fridge and unwraps the foil from a large piece of pineapple, then sticks the pineapple on top of the vertical spit, and carves off a nice hunk from it. Just throws it on the taco, which I didn't mind since I can portion control with my incisors. A minute later, as I'm ordering at the adjacent station, the pineapple somehow comes flying into the boiling tray of meats and splashes liquid all over the sneeze guard. Dude didn't know where it went and looked around for a while until he finally saw it. Boiling tray station employee grabbed it for him and returned it.

Anyway, back to the rundown.)

- Tripas: pretty salty, not as intestinal as you might expect, crunchy from being fried, comes with that red salsa from above. I'd get it again, probably.
- Suadero: beef shoulder. Best purely savory thing that I tried here. It's beef, and you can feel the meat fibers, but it's still quite tender.
- Buche: chewy, visible stomach lining. Little salty and perhaps acidic, which isn't that surprising since it's, well, a pig stomach. Don't confuse it with pork belly, because that's something else entirely.

Huge credit to Tacos El Gordo for offering a quality, cheap product, especially on the Strip. I'd definitely come back here or check out their other Las Vegas location the next time that I'm thinkin' tacos (probably for cabeza, al pastor, suadero, and the lengua that I skipped out on). I'd also try the San Diego locations too if somehow I managed to check out all the other popular spots first."}
{"text":"This place will be crowded.  There will be lines.  You may have to eat outside.  Just like other reviews say, make sure you wait in the correct line, we were ordering only pastor tacos so the shortest line happened to be the one we wanted.  I know i can order several street tacos so we ordered a total of 12 pastor tacos on corn tortillas and 2 drinks which came out to about under $25.  When you wait in line you order your food, hey make you your tacos fresh and you go to the next register to pay.  The restaurant is small, crowded and people will be holding tables for their friends/family but when we went outside to the outdoor overflow seating, there was no one there, it was still cold but not too bad, we were able to bear the cold, fill our bellies with pastor goodness and go on with our day.  As for the tacos themselves, very good!  Pork was marinated well, had enough flavor and spice and when topped with some lime juice and washed down with an horchata, so good!  Tacos El Gordo, your tacos are legit."}
{"text":"Such good pastor tacos! That's what you should get here be cause it's delicious! My boyfriend and I went and it was ridiculously busy but thats what i like to see because it lets me know I chose a right spot! Anyways we got like 10 tacos and a quesadilla (we love to eat) and it was to die for."}
{"text":"They have very yummy food! Flavorful and definitely authentic. A couple of cons, the set up is unorganized, not much sitting room.
I loved the sope! It had melted cheese...cheese! And my goodness it was just a perfect mixture of flavor."}
{"text":"Omg these tacos are so delicious!! I tried the carne al pastor tacos yesterday and they literally melted in my mouth. Best tacos in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Good prices with great food!! Felt like I was in Mexico lol in a good way. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Living in Arizona for several years, I have been to a fair amount of taco shops. But I have never been to one like this. The moment my boyfriend and I walked in the door we knew we were in for something unique.

We open the door and the first thing to hit us is the smoke. Immediately following was the smell. When you walk inside it's like you are walking into the grill itself. If they have a ventilation system you'd never know it. So be prepared, you will smell like meat when you leave.

The first thing you need to figure out is which line to stand in. If you want more than one kind of taco be prepared to stand in two lines because you can't stand in the carne asada line and order the al pastor tacos. I recommend you divide and conquer. I waited for the asada and my boyfriend went for the al pastor. But mind you, these lines are long and slow so even if you split up you'll both be waiting a while. 

Luckily, the wait is worth it. After we acquired our tacos, we paid, and went outside to find a table. Fortunately, someone was getting up to leave so we snagged a spot. (oh yeah, the tables are as hard to get as the tacos) We quickly devoured everything. The tortillas are fresh, the meat is seasoned and prepared perfectly and the salsa is a great complement. Seriously some of the best tacos I've ever had. 

Next time I find myself in Vegas this will be at the top of my to-do list."}
{"text":"OK. this is the most delish taco pace in Vegas. I came for a convention and decided to try out some food a little off the strip, and this place was perfect for lunch. We ordered 10tacos for two people (we were hungry!!), The ordering was fast and easy. The tacos were made to order and right in front of you. The place is clean and spacious. Tacos tasted homemade and rich in spices.. we finished lunch with mango ice cream from their cooler and went on our way. VERY satisfied bellies !!! :) will for sure be coming back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great south of the border tacos. Also go next door to the souvenir store and buy your cold beer to go with your tacos. They just got their alcohol license today. Heaven sent."}
{"text":"BOOOMB ASS TACOS!!!!! Great flavor, haven't had some good real mexican tacos like these on a long time!"}
{"text":"I visit every chance I'm in Vegas. Its that good! But be sure to get there super early."}
{"text":"This place is legit like eating out of Tijuana.. I loved the food but the lines can get disorganized and I enjoyed the al pastor tacos!"}
{"text":"Drunk munchies after EBC is what lead me to this wonderful establishment.  The best pigouts will always be after beach club when you don't care about how your body looks like anymore haha  With that being said, the lengua fries have definitely won my heart here.  Actually, lengua anything here is good with me.  People always get grossed out when I tell them I like lengua because it's basically tongue, but IT IS SO BOMB.  JUST TRY IT!"}
{"text":"I would give them 4 stars but the tacos were so darn good that it deserves a 5.  Customer service doesn't really exist here so don't expect any.  We got a cashier that had attitude and was straight rude too. So unnecessary. I wanted to throw my food at her but of course I couldn't let those delicious tacos go to waste.  The place is open late, so it's perfect if you are craving for a good late snack.

Came a little prepared because friends sort of gave me a heads up about this place and how it works.  So I felt like a had a slight advantage as far as understanding the process.  Yet, I still arrived and was still a bit confused.  Noticed 3 separate lines. Two in which I aready knew was for ordering al pastor meat, and the other was for carne asada meat.  Apparently, the third line was to pay.  Duh! But why not put them all together? It's not a crazy idea right?  Other successful restaurants do that.  Anyway, ordered the al pastor with corn and flour tortilla and boy were they delicious.  By far, the tortilla ranks the top over the corn tortilla in taste.  I tried a little of the carne asada meat from my boyfriend's plate and it was too dry and bland for me.  I think it just needed some sauce, and dressings like the cilantro and onions.  

The prices were about $2 each which was fair.  Not overly priced.  When we were eating I noticed a fourth line for lingua and other stuff.  That's crazy.  Way tooo many ridiculous and unnecessary lines.  If it's their way of being organized.  It's more disorganized than organized.  But I have to ignore all that, because the tacos will have you coming back."}
{"text":"Can I just say I love this place and be done with it? 
I guess I could but.. 
Never in the history of ever have I seen a person be sad while eating tacos from my man el Gordo. Why? Because you just can't be sad. It's impossible. The food is so good you'll forget anything sad exists."}
{"text":"Alright. 

Basic Fares. Lines long but move fast.

They have you line up first, get what you want then pay. Rather have the process in reverse because food gets colds.

Nothing magical."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high ($2 for a taco) but it's true authentic Mexican food! I've been craving these ever since my trip to Mexico a while back, and I'm so happy to see this joint come to this side of town!

There are lines for different meats. My mom likes carne asada and my cousin and I love adobada. We decided to try the mulas too because my friend recommended it, even adding the carne asada fries for the hell of it! However, I am going to complain about the price again because for a small carne asada fries, we forked over $5, where you could go to Roberto's 5 minutes away and pay the same price for 2x the size. 

The flavors were so authentic, the service was decent, and even with the long lines, the food was worth the wait. Great place for some late night cravings. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"One of the absolute most authentic Tijuana style Mexican food places out there. All of their items are awesome. Stopped by the one in the strip north of the Wynn to get a quick bite before heading out to the airport to catch a plane back home. Perfect meal to satisfy your stomach prior to a 5+ hour plane ride. Their food is not greasy at all like most places. They make everything right in front of you - all made to order items which makes it very fresh. My wife and I had the tacos - tripas (beef tripe), asadas (steak), el pastor (pork cut right in front of you) and the lengua (beef tongue). All were great. I also ordered a beef quesadilla which was a nice dish as well.  They can get quite busy at times and the line builds up pretty quickly however they do move the lines fairly fast. They have a good system going. Clean eating area making it very comfortable to dine in. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Asada (steak), lengua (cow tongue), adobada (spicy pork)...OMG! I don't even know what to say about this place besides \"you have to go\". It's GOOD!!! The meat is tender and flavorful, all 3 that I tried. The guy that made my tacos put on a little show with flipping the tortillas in the air and catching them. Plus he was cute. :-) And, on the spicy pork tacos, he sliced some pineapple which totally took it up another level. The salsas and sauces are spicy & tasty, and everything is so fresh! Please know, this is a hole in the wall, but aren't those the best after all?"}
{"text":"Before you die, order four tacos de adobado con piña. and get extra cilantro sauce. Hands down my favorite tacos ever. The one downside to this place is there aren't many veggie options, so I go here with my carnivore friends only."}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos in town.  My favorites are the carne asada tacos and the adobada tacos.  Their carne asada fries are worth a try too.  The adobada taco meat is carved right off the slab and onto your taco.  If you are only going to order one kind of taco, GET THIS ONE.  The workers here are quick and efficient.  I would suggest getting 4-5 tacos to fill you up.  They are open until 2 am on the weekdays and 4 am on the weekends, which is a nice plus!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place if I want delicious, flavorful, and decently priced tacos!  I used to frequent the Tacos El Gordo at their Charleston location, but lately I've been going to the Craig/Losee location because the Craig/Losee location is now closer to my work.  This location compared to the Charleston one is a lot bigger with two large dining areas with tables to enjoy your tacos at.  To get your tacos, you line up at the counter at three separate lines and tell the worker what tacos you want and how many.  Be sure to pay attention to the signs above each line because the separate lines serve different/certain tacos.  After you have obtained your tacos, you take it to the cashier to pay and then you can finally enjoy these delicious tacos!  
 
Usually 4 tacos is enough to fill me up, if I'm feeling particularly hungry I get 4 tacos for myself and the spicy adobada fries to share with my friends too.  For taco choices I highly recommend the spicy adobada tacos (spicy pork) and the carne asada (steak) tacos.  These are always solid and every person I've gone with here has enjoyed them as well.  If you are feeling a little bit more adventurous, I recommend the cabeza (beef head) tacos or the lengua (beef tongue) tacos, both flavorful as well.  4 tacos plus a drink is about $11.  You should definitely come here and enjoy some amazing tacos; I couldn't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Why have I never been here before?!?! Tacos are bomb!!! Went here for late night eats after life is beautiful. Highly recommend the Al Pastor tacos. The carne asada fries were under whelming but the asada itself was really good. Would suggest getting the fries well done if you do order them."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to come here and it was really nice. Enjoyed my food and big big portions. Food didn't take too long to come out and enjoyed the rock music actually got to the place when it wasn't busy shocking"}
{"text":"Any visitor to Las Vegas needs to hit this spot if they ever claimed to enjoy tacos. The bomb spot gotta have them carne-fries you will wonder why they are not like McDonald's or subway and all over the country!!"}
{"text":"You have to try the spicy pork taco. So many great flavors. Savory pork, creamy cilantro sauce, citrus, some heat, and a whole lot of love"}
{"text":"After eating at this place, I can safely say I am lesser of a man than I was before and I will never be the man I was meant to be. The bad service made me question my value in life and for a brief moment I felt as if I was an utterly useless piece of shit. Tomorrow I will wake up to the sun and feel no warmth. 

P.s. don't order the quesadilla. Its a taco with a piece of chip on top. I can take a shit and put a chip on top and call it a burrito and it would be the top order on the menu"}
{"text":"First time at this location and disappointed with my carne Asada tacos; they didn't have that typical delish taste?"}
{"text":"Great little taco shop to visit in Vegas!! Very reasonable prices and some of the best tacos I've ever had, great for lunch, dinner, or even after a late night out! All the corn tortillas are hand made and are delicious. 

Just a word of advice, different stations let you order tacos with different meats but the adobada is definitely one of the best on the menu. The adobada is on a spit that rotates so that the outside part that gets cut up has a nice char to it. Then it's topped with onions, cilantro, on top of a couple corn tortillas! Order your food, get your food, then go to the cashier and pay. 

This is definitely one of the places I go to at least once every time I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Most authentic taqueria ever. From the fresh tortillas being constantly made to the Asada and pastor meat being cut right in front of you. This is a must if you are in the Vegas area. Get away from the strip for an hour to have the best meal you'll eat while in Vegas. Tacos El Gordo is a must."}
{"text":"I have eaten at 3 of their locations, and the food is exceptionally consistent and Extremely Delicious!

The Carne Asada is the Bomb and my Favorite is the Adobada Tacos fully Loaded with everything.  I get 3-5 depending on how hungry I am.

The most Authentic Street Tacos in Las Vegas, in fact they are better than any I have had in Mexico!

I Love Tacos El Gordo!  I visit them 2-3 times a month!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around !  Never had a problem with service.  Servers are sweet and efficient. Nice and clean place. Love it !!!"}
{"text":"Was playing poker at Encore and was recommended this place by another player. Walked over and was very happy with authentic street taco experience. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Consider this place DISCOVERED (i.e., busy)!! I came here because of the reviews and I love tacos. When I arrived the line was 20 feet out the door (Monday at noon). I decided to wait it out because I was psyched for tacos de asada. 10 minutes later I hadn't moved. But, I was free today and the folks around me in line were fun. An hour and 10 minutes later, I got my food. All I can say is, it was worth the wait! The tacos de asada were delicious!! They grill the carne asada right there over charcoal. I've never seen kitchen staff working so fast and having so much fun. I love an open kitchen and it helped pass the time. First time I've ever seen someone throw the ingredients for a taco in the air and catch them.. For EACH TACO!  Just FYI (in case you don't speak Spanish), there are two lines... one if you are ordering tacos de asada and another line for everything else. The line for everything else seemed to move faster. If I can make time, I might go back and try the adobada.  Great find, I just wish it wasn't quite so \"discovered\"."}

We ordered way too much - carne asada tacos, adobada tacos, carne asada fries, and adobada fries. I liked the adobada tacos the best. The adobada was much better than the carne asada. The fries were just average as well. It was mostly smothered in cheese, sour cream, and avocado sauce. 

Lines were long but moved quickly. They have separate lines for different meats and items so you have to stand in multiple lines if you want to order various things. You can ask for grilled onions and peppers on the side."}
{"text":"Wow...what an experience.  

Came by on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite busy.  We grabbed a table and I went to line up for food.  And very confused by the 3 lines.  I ended up asking the person behind me and he explained the line ups were for different items.  Unfortunately I was sent to get items from two different lines.  I ended up waiting 15 minutes in each line.  I ordered the steak tacos (carne asada) and there were great especially with the guac.  

The food was good but there was no one to assist you on ordering or to explain what each item was.  It was my fault for not reading the previous reviews in more detail and reviewing their website prior to attendance...just thought there would be some assistance."}
{"text":"I have been to the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, so when we came out to Vegas I had to try it out. We were not let down! At all.. The lines are long but the cooks are fast and get the orders out fast. Everything is fresh and the place is very clean for a busy restaurant . I enjoy all the meats and Carne asada Mulas are on point ...Enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"Tacos are gross, no air conditioning. Horrible service, it's like a mosh pit in there. Skip this one and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Literally the best real Mexican I've ever had!!! I had the spicy pork. The shells were grilled. Cilantro was fresh. The avocado sauce was amazing. They had a fresh veggie bar and slices of lime for that extra taste. I can't speak highly enough of this place. You'd never know it was the place to check out if you were a tourist!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is not bad, but there are other places in town, in my experience, that are better for authentic street tacos (e.g., Tacos Y Tacos and Tacos Tijuana - both on S. Pecos).

I went there for lunch around 12pm on a week day and it was extremely busy. It's basically located in a gas station/truck stop. That seems good to me though. It seems more authentic. I ordered the tacos el pastor. However, the tacos were pretty bland to be honest. The flavor was really lacking. I don't know what it was, maybe they had an off day, but I feel other street taco places have bolder seasoning in the meat and sauces. Also, the accoutrements - salsa, pickled jalapeños, onions, cilantro and things seemed old and were all soggy, dried up and/or wrinkled. Not good when you have a busy lunch crowd.

They have a pretty large dining space, so you can probably always get a seat but I was not knocked off my feet by this place. But in a pinch, it's better than a lot of other places in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome food
Some of the best tacos I've ever had! The adobada is phenomenal.  This place is a must visit in vegas!"}
{"text":"I love Tacos El Gordo, its fresh and simple mexican food.    For ordering stand in the line according to the meat you want, you want pork , stand in the line in front of the huge spinning pork meat on a spic.  Steak stand in the steak line, look for the signs.  When its not busy it doesn't matter, but when this place is rocking, the lines are 5-7 people deep, standing in the wrong line cause issues.  

I have had the steak and pork tacos, both are great.   If you are near the Wynn, try this place."}
{"text":"Omg. If I could give this place 100 stars, I would!! This place does it right!! Real authentic Mexican food! Homemade tortillas right in front of you. There's a line to order, get your food & move on & pay with the cashier. It gets packed! But for a good reason...a really good one!! Food is BOMB!!!!!!!!! Definitely coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Usually a long line on the weekends in the evening but they move through it quickly. The employees are always friendly and smiling and the food is consistently good. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I was quite full, but I had to eat more.  I can only echo the other positive reviews of this place.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Line was looooooooong. Tacos were good, but worth the wait and the upcharge?  Not so sure. I'm spoiled having access to the best cheap tacos in LA, but if you're in Vegas and want some authentic al pastor tacos this will do. Just be prepared for the hour wait, the heat of the Vegas strip, and the dollar more per taco you'll pay for the experience."}
{"text":"Driving down this road really puts you in the mood for tacos for some reason.  So I checked Yelp and found this place.  Stopped in and ate the best El Pastor taco of my life!  Muy Excellante!  The Asada was also great."}
{"text":"BEST. TACOS. EVER.

There used to be located on the strip by the Wynn but that one closed down :( anyways I came here around 3am on a Saturday night, or well actually Sunday early morning and the place was still pretty packed!! That's how you know the tacos are amazing. 

Anyways, onto the tacos. I got an asada, adobada & lengua. They were all DELICIOUS. And I need to say that I am not a fan of lengua. For some reason, it does not taste good to me. But the times I've tried lengua, which isn't that much. The 2 times I've actually really enjoyed lengua was from this place. SO GOOD. 

They make all of their tortillas from scratch too!!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the ones in San Diego. Pork and beef tacos delight will entice your appetite and fill your belly. It gets busy so plan accordingly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome food quick service. Quality is great I would come back if in vegas. I hope they open some in LA. 4 tacos hit the spot and the Asad fries loook awesome"}
{"text":"Have visited this concept twice.
First time I was not very impressed while the second time I got food poisoning.
Never again!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! If you live anywhere near Las Vegas and you haven't tried them you need to add it to your to do list. Their tacos are amazing and waiting in the 5-10 minute lines is never a problem. Ive been here dozens of times and you should too!

P.S: If you're ordering tacos, I suggest you try them on flour tortillas, they're really good!"}
{"text":"Thanks to my fellow tellers and my love for tacos, I had to come here! I came during the luck hour so it wasn't so busy. However I still became a little confused about te ordering window for what meat you want. I was going by the menu and not by the tiny little clear sign under the menu that reads what kind of meat that person is making. I love how they had two sides to place making it easier and faster to order.

I got the carne asada tacos with everything. I loves them. Reminded me of the tacos I use to eat in TJ. My bf on the other hand didn't care for them. He felt they were bland. I will agree that the meat was bland but who needs seasoning when you have salsa?!

I wish they had more locations so I wouldn't have to travel to the strip just for some great tacos. I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Perfect straight from LVS, right upon open. Limited menu variety (tacos, duh!).  But the meats we tried were flavorful. Especially enjoyed the pork. 

BYOB, but they frown upon glass bottles. Easily walkable from Wynn."}
{"text":"This place was suggested to me by one of the hotel staff.  Boy was it delicious and very affordable!  I had lenga, al pastor and sudaro tacos.  Meat was tender and very tasty!  Service was fast and prices affordable!  If your in Vegas you have to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"This place was listed as a must visit. The tacos were good, and I also ordered a Mula adovada (the spicy-sweet pork)which is recommended by most people. The Mula was so greasy that I turned it on its side and had about 2 teaspoons of grease fall off. I still ate it- because when in Rome..."}
{"text":"kinda shocked they're not open 24 hours. But I also kinda understand that they are in one of the most sketch parts of the strip ( or at least the start of it). Def. one the best taco joint on the strip. I really enjoyed the amount of options they had available when you order. They also give you plenty of condiments to customize your taco. 

+ pluses..... great tacos and variety of them and also the included condiments.

- this is where it begins to get real sketch on the strip, don't let it fool you that its right next to WYnn and Encore, right north of here is super sketchy. Also there maybe long lines (i realize this isn't really anything they can do about). 

Always tasty and always an interesting experience at Tacos El Gordo. YMMV"}
{"text":"Tacos were Delicious! I think between all of us we tried all of the tacos and everyone was happy with their meal. Low cost made it even better. This was  our first meal in Vegas and we will be back."}
{"text":"Really great tacos. Really fresh and flavorful.  Long lines... 

Can someone please get the staff at the stations a pot holder to put on their hand so that the hot tortillas don't burn through their rubber gloves? Looks like a work injury waiting to happen. I see these folks have to constantly toss the tortilla when they feel it with meat in order to not burn their hands."}
{"text":"Wow! Definitely the best tacos I've EVER had. No complaints on that side. The service however is suuuuper slow. It's a pain you have to go to a different line for a different type of taco, this wastes a bunch of time."}
{"text":"The best tacos/meat on the strip.  Fast food and friendly staff.  Always packed though but that says enough.  Spicy pork fries are amazing."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever had. When there's whole Mexican families eating here at 2am, you know it's good. Tip: it's easier if you show up with someone that knows Spanish, to translate and/or order off the menu. I tried to order what the guy in front of me got and ended up with something completely different. Oops. Still delicious, though! (Also important to mention: I was not in an intoxicated state wherein I would anything and everything.) Also, you can google \"how to order at Tacos El Gordo\" and that helps a bit."}
{"text":"Well I have been to mexico myself, and tijuana but the flavor of this place is not as good as tijuana tacos,  and it was hella expensive for a taco joint.

The meat was okay, they seem a bit stingy, and the tacos were almost 3 bucks a piece.  The sauce was not as good as TJ guac, and the hot sauce was a little bit bland.

I guess being sober I just didn't enjoy this place too much, but if you have not tried a authenthic mexican taco this is somewhat close, but much more pricey, and not as good as expected."}
{"text":"I'd come back to Vegas just to have an el pastor taco from here. This seriously ruined LA taco places for me."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place, she said go to this location and there will be no lines, she was right! We went a little crazy, got some carne asada fries, carne asada tacos, buche, lengua, al pastor tacos, throw in a little orange bang and we're good to go.

It was all delicious, I especially liked the lengua tacos and carne asada fries, so good. This location is way off the strip, but worth it since there was no wait at all."}
{"text":"Delish tacos! Asada, lengua, al pastor were all great! I would definitely get the tacos every time I come to Vegas. The quesadilla and sope were ok."}
{"text":"No doubt, best tacos on the planet! I first had tacos el gordo at the san diego location and was blown away! Being from LA, i have had a lot of amazing tacos, but nothing comes close to this spot. So when we were in vegas, it was a no brainer eating here every day!

Everything is good, but the al pastor is the king! So sweet, so tender and ohhhh so god damn amazing! Don't forget the pineapples!"}
{"text":"Bomb as always, long lines but worth the wait. Get the pastor tacos or Asasa fries, great staff and food sucks Cali don't have more locations"}
{"text":"Great street tacos, location could be bigger for the volume of business. Not a lot of seating takes forever in Line to order but overall great price for what you get. And very popular in the area why not give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very yummy tacos. We got the spicy pork (delicious) and the asada tacos (good, but not great) and the asada fries, which were so good! I would go back again!"}
{"text":"The spicy pork tacos are amazing!!!!!!! This is a must try place in Vegas. Regardless, if the rest of you meals are at 4 star restaurants this place is worth the trip. I only stay at the Encore so its near by but, even if you are staying at Mandalay Bay its worth the trip. I will eat every time I go to Vegas, which always happens at least one time a year."}
{"text":"compare to El Gordo in Chula Vista, this place only deserve 1 star, but their lengua fries are really good so I'll pump up to 2 stars. 

This place is only for tourists!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? The food is on point! The customer service is even better!

My review is purely based on the Al Pastor meat. I love it so much I haven't tried the other meats. I've had the tacos and the mulitas. 

A description of this taco...the Al Pastor is perfectly cooked on a rotating.....uuhm, stick thing! You can watch it cooking as you wait! The meat is so succulent and perfectly marinated. The perfect meat is then topped with onion and cilantro as well as this delicious, spicy, avocado sauce. This is all you need in a taco. They don't skimp on any of the ingredients! If you're feeling extra cheesy, I would recommend a mulita or two!

The place isn't very organized, they have one line for the Al Pastor meat and a few other lines for the other meats. Of course, the Al Pastor line is always the longest. I've gone where the line pretty much goes around the entire restaurant!

I would truly recommend bringing your appetite here! By far my favorite taco place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was the highlight of my Vegas trip. 
This place is clutch. 
Every night after a  night of drinking I would cab it to this spot, have a feast..Then walk to my hotel for about 45min. No hangovers...And I'm hangover prone...clutch I tell you.

I'm going to describe the food with one word \"phenomenal\"!!!!. 
Best Al pastor tacos I ever tasted, always loaded with plenty of pineapple slices.

Love, Love, Love this place."}
{"text":"Very busy. Open all night. Extremely cheap. Authentic as all get our. The beef tongue was out of this world delicious. Walking distance on the strip. Awesome"}
{"text":"O M G. I did not think Las Vegas would be able to produce good Mexican food let alone a simple taco but I was completely wrong. I walked into this place and saw that big trompo spinning with juicy al pastor and my eyes started twinkling. I ordered three al pastor all the way, two suadero and one tripa and I loved them all. My friend got the carne asada fries which were so good and not to mention we were a group of four guys and could not finish up a half order of these. We all came with the impression that these tacos were gonna be meh but once done we all agreed that these are some of the best we have ever tried. Possibly the highlight of our trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for the adobada tacos! They are by far my favorite thing to get here. the line looks long but it moved pretty fast for me. There are separate lines once you get inside for the different options. There are two lines open for just adobada. ai enjoyed the lengua tacos. Also ordered a half order of the lengua fries. Was not impressed by the fries at all but at least they put a lot of meat on it so that was a plus. I got a small dollop of guac but my fiance got a huge amount for his. Our food was not proportioned the same. Location is super convenient if you're in the north strip area."}
{"text":"I love this place , I don't speak  spanish. But they are real paint with me. The best tacos ever."}
{"text":"Pretty bad ass. I'm a fan of street tacos and rarely find a restaurant taco that I don't regret eating. And by regret I mean, I feel like I've wasted precious stomach space and should have gotten some dollar tacos from some cart on the street. These tacos were worth it. Well, the carne asada anyways. My only thing is that the tacos weren't as punchy as I like in terms of flavor, not a huge deal, but a five star deal breaker."}
{"text":"I grew up in a very Mexican neighborhood. My neighbors across the street ran one of the best taco trucks in the area!! So I know GOOD tacos. 

Lemme just say that tonight was a religious experience!! 

I don't even like asada all that much (too basic), but theirs is delicious!! People talking about how the asada is bland or whatever...wth is wrong with you?!? This was the best asada taco I've ever had!!

I might also add that I do not like the back part of the lengua. I'm all about that tip (). Their lengua was so tender and flavorful that I couldn't tell the difference!

Buche and tripa are my 2nd and 3rd favorite taco meat so of course I'm going to say that TeG's is amazing. 

Thanks for reading my review! I hope by now you're on your way to taco heaven!!"}
{"text":"This place really satisfies a true taco craving. Not the Baja tacos or Tex mex but tradition street food tacos.

Would definitely recommend al pastor with pineapple"}
{"text":"Mmm mmm mmmmm. I'm not sure why there aren't any reviews raving about their vegan option, I even checked the original locations yelp reviews and within the 1,000 plus reviews there was only one from a guy trying to say there weren't any vegan options... but my fellow vegans you're in luck! Azteca (cactus) tacos are sooooo bomb. They come with grilled cactus (obviously), onion, cilantro, salsa, and avocado. I would've posted a picture, but was too hungry."}
{"text":"I'm usually very picky about my tacos, but holy shit these guys an gals throw down here!!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are so good!! Tortillas aren't that thick, meat is juicy! The Asada fries were extremely tasty! My go to place when I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I am so sad I could not give them five stars. The best authentic Mexican food this aide of the border.  Flavors burst into your taste buds as you try to remember what tacos you ever tasted better then these. NEVER. EVER. Teajuana bases flavor.  El Gordo has the cooking down to a fine science.  Like most Mexican restaurants they need a gringo to fix the traffic jam of customers trying to spend their money.  Walking into this Maze of people you think of a Chinese fire drill. Walk in four feet and it looks like the 405 and the 710 freeway meet.with a little more planning this place could triple their income. Poor design.  Not customer friendly.  Each item, different line. Booooo!  I would love to complain to someone that would make a difference. Make the right move for your Mexican audience.  They will come."}
{"text":"This place, is SO BOMB. I have never had Mexican food this good! It's a little confusing to order if it's your first time there because they have separate lines to order from depending if you want to order fries or tacos, toastadas, etc. Basically it's one line for the \"main course\" stuff - tacos, tostadas, etc. The other line is for fries and side orders (I think). We had the Carne Asada Tacos and the Campechana Fries. They were AMAZING. I am craving them both right meow! Take me back to Vegas for the Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This place is constantly busy with good reason. I tried the Adobada Spicy Pork tacos the first time - 2 each for me and my girlfriend - and the next day we went back and got 5 each. The pork is spicy and delicious, cooked and charred on a vertical spit. The red and green sauces along with a handful of shredded vegetables make these so good. 

Next time I'm in Vegas (who knows when that'll be), this is going to be the first meal I have."}
{"text":"My brother and I were hungry after eating a light dinner and it came to my attention that one of three Tacos El Gordo's in Vegas was located right down the road from our hotel. It's across the street from Encore and it gets a little sketchy but totally worth it! I came Wednesday over winter break, a little before midnight, and I was very surprised that there was minimal waiting. They have different lines so be prepared to split your group up to try all the meats. And don't be conservative with the amount of food you order here because the tacos are on the smaller side and you won't want to wait again in the line!

The guys that make your tacos are so quick and they cut the meat on the spot when you order. El Pastor is always my favorite and don't forget to order it with the pineapples and Carne Asada would come up us as a close second. My least favorite was the Chorizo because it was a little overdone and dry. I got a chance to try a couple Mulas but it does take awhile for them to make. I was too lazy to wait in the line again so next time, I'm going to try their Carne Asada fries. After you're done ordering, you go to the counter by the exit to pay. Tacos are a little over $2 bucks each, which isn't bad considering it's on the strip.

P.S. Don't forget to ask for roasted peppers and grilled veggies, free of charge!"}
{"text":"You know a taco place is good when it's packed with mostly Hispanics at 3am on a Saturday night.
They make your food fast and in front of you.

They only serve street tacos (2 big bites and you're done) and there's about 10 to choose from.

Cost is about $2 each.

So expensive, yet so good!

Adobada is probably the best (spicy pork)."}
{"text":"So gooooood! Best tacos in Las Vegas! Everyone who works here is very nice! Always clean , if there is a long line don't leave , the lines go really quick."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews prior to arriving in Vegas I knew I just had to try this place.  Spicy pork tacos cut right from a giant hunk of meat that stares you in the face?!??!?! Uhhhh, yes please!

Went here around 9:30pm on a Thursday night and it was effing packed.  I knew it was a good sign when I saw a ton of Mexicans and a security guard packing a real gun.  Tacos are serious business!

I ordered 3 tacos.  I got the Adobada (spicy pork), lengua (tongue) and carne asada tacos.  All 3 tacos were very good, though I was probably the most disappointed with the adobada.  It wasn't that it wasn't good, but there just wasn't a lot of meat in the taco.  The meat that was in there was good, but that particular taco looked a little sad.  I did enjoy the free guac topping on the carne asada taco.  The lengua was cooked very well done and I thoroughly enjoyed that taco as well.  

All in all, I'd give this place a solid 4.5 stars.  If there was more adobada in my taco I would definitely give this place 5 stars.  It could've just been bad luck with that particular taco.  

If you want good tacos, definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"GOOD GOD. Al pastor fries and al pastor tacos. Perfect."}
{"text":"BEST place for tacos in Vegas!!!!! Every trip to Vegas is a mandatory stop here! (Delicious) and perfect for your pockets!!! AKA extra gambling money! =D"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. This is my first stop for food when in Vegas. Long lines but moves quickly. Seating could be an issue but worth the wait. The quesadillas are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The lines are long, but well worth the wait. We were recommended to go here by a friend and he did not steer us wrong."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo was exactly what I needed on the last day of my trip. I was craving some affordable authentic Mexican food, and thought I'd have the place pretty much to myself on a Sunday morning around 11am. Not so much. 
They were very busy and I found out after a while that there were also separate lines for different meat. Oops. I ordered the spicy pork tacos, lingua, and asada tacos. I loved that they had fresh guacamole on top and also verde salsa. The tacos were fresh and good, but I felt that they were missing something. Maybe the roja salsa? Also, I love it with the creamy jalapeño sauce, and they didn't have that either. So I wasn't quite getting the spice level or sauce that I wanted, but they still hit the spot when I needed it. 
Also, you are supposed to order, get your food, pay, then eat. It's sorta a weird system and I wasn't aware of that when I stopped in and had to tell them what I ordered at the end."}
{"text":"If you want the closes to authentic Mexican food, then this is the best place to come too. Try everything on the menu, especially the spicy pork."}
{"text":"Great tacos.  Great carne asada fries.  Great adobada fries.  Probably the best taco shop I've been to since moving to Las Vegas.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We have friends who came all the way from Phoenix and asked to eat here.  Its one of the best authentic Mexican style food in Vegas.  I get hungry just looking at your picture"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars, had no idea how busy this place was. Had stopped by during a layover in the city and expected to have time to go check out another landmark, but I must have been in line for at least 40 minutes because it was such so packed. (Line out the building and around the corner patio area). Once you move up in the line you get to watch the cooks moving quickly almost in a symphony orquestrating some savory and mouth watering tacos. So on top of the long line, another hassle is that with the way the store is set up you have to pick what type of meat you will want for your tacos and then commit to that because you would have to get back in another line to get other meat. So, definitely come here! Just be ready to stand for a while in line unless you come during some random hours."}
{"text":"Best TACOS Ever!!  Located on The Strip after the Encore/Wynn and Ross Store.  This place is super packed and each line is for a different type of meat.  ALL KINDS OF MEAT!  Cabeza, Lengua, Carnitas, Carne Asada and some others I cannot remember.  

We were here the night after Thanksgiving and it was super packed.  Hubby and I split up and just stood in line.  We didnt know that each line was a different meat so thank goodness I wasn't in the Lengua line.... had it (not from here) and dont want to try it again. 

The tacos are small so if you are hungry get 3 or 4.  The people in front of me had about 5 people in their family and ordered about 30!!!  I kid you not!  So you know it was gonna be good!

Will totally come back here again! 
Not a lot of seating so find a curb or eat standing... its worth it!"}
{"text":"After a night out at the strip, we craved tacos. Having heard a lot about this place, we decide to try it. It was extremely busy at 3 in the morning but we waited patiently. The people at the register were really nice. 

We got mulitas de asada and de adobo. The asada was TOO salty. The adobo was perfect. We went to go ask if we could switch the asada mulita that we had for another one, and they denied our request. We were stuck with an extra mulita that we paid for, and no one had even touched and we had to throw it away cuz of how salty it was. 

The ladies who were cleaning tables also made us feel rushed. I understand that they are busy, but it would be nice if we were able to enjoy our food without feeling rushed."}
{"text":"Wow, what a find!!!! This place is awesome!!! Authentic street tacos and so tasty!! It is worth standing in line to order your food.  Watching the cooks is truly amazing. We have been here every time we head to Vegas, and we will continue to do that going forward.  I can't wait until our next visit!!!"}
{"text":"I said to myself, \"Alejandro... do not write this review for a week or you will be completely biased.\" I wanted to give this place a two... which would be totally unfair! 

THE TACOS ARE DELICIOUS and so was the quesadilla (though very overpriced... hey el gordito... si me cobras 4 dolars por una quesadilla hay que darme algo mas que un taco con queso!!) 

But alex why were you tan enojado? Because this place is not worth the lines that were there. They have three lines where you order different types of tacos... what if i want carne asada and al pastor? better bring two people. The tacos are good, but they are no better than this taco place near where i live in Utah and mine cost half... thats right Billy Mays here getting you tacos for half the price and half the wait. 

Having said that paragraph of complaint... if there isn't a wait i highly recommend this place, but the 45 minute wait to get a few tacos, i personally think it isnt worth it. 

THE VERDICT: are they busy? go somewhere else. oh okay they arent busy, just get tacos dont buy quesadillas. Carne asada and al pastor are both pretty good and... this place is not the end all be all of tacos. But it is definitely worth trying for some delicious pina con al pastor!!"}
{"text":"Amazing and life changing. The best tacos I've ever eaten in my life. When in Vegas go there and you won't regret it. Al pastor is the way to go. Please come to salt lake"}
{"text":"Thank you Tacos el Gordo for bringing good TJ tacos to Vegas! I was so sad that I moved from San Diego to here. I miss the authentic Mexican food that can be enjoyed so conveniently near home. However, this is exactly what real TJ style tacos are about. The meat cut right in front of you, fresh ingredients, and homemade tortillas. The flavors are amazing, and that's something that can't be beaten. I wish the tortillas were a little bigger, but they pack them so well, it's almost unnoticeable. Great service too. SO AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Here's a head's up for anyone visiting this place: it's not really busy because it's popular. It's just not being run properly. KAIZEN! The manager of this place needs to be visited by Toyota to learn how to run their outfit efficiently. They need a person to take orders and ring people up. They need an POS system and electronic ordering screens going to people making the food in the back, who then prepare and organize the food for pick-up. What's going on here is a horribly inefficient, infuriating joke. You have to make a night out just to eat at this place, and believe me, it's not worth it. Wouldn't be worth it if every Food Network celebrity chef was working in the kitchen. If I were a local, I'd never be back, but hey, this is working for them now, milk it for all its worth, I guess. Nice gimmick, if it is what I think it is."}
{"text":"I don't get it. If you've actually had tacos in Mexico these don't compare. This is more of a Tex-Méx or American Mexican food. I'd recommend to get the tacos plain with only cilantro and onion. Don't put the guacamole or pico de gallo. It drowns out the flavor. I guess if you're not used to eating Mexican food then you will like this. 

This place gets crowded so if you do come be prepared for the wait."}
{"text":"Most of the times that we would go here late at night, there is a long line. However, it is definitely worth the wait, considering that there are not that many good taco places to eat around in Vegas. The prices are reasonable, and the staff here are friendly as well. You could not find parking at some point, but there are always people coming in and out of the restaurant pretty quick. Always ask for pineapple on your tacos!-even when they are low on one side, they would always grab me some from another line. Also, their nopales (sauteed cactus) are BOMB! Definitely try them if you have not tried it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting we waited for a really long time on top of the fact that they didn't have any AC working! We got the carne asada tacos they were not the best it tasted burnt and had a lot of the fat and they took so long and it wasn't even warm. Waste of money in my opinion was hoping for it to taste like king taco or better"}
{"text":"I like this place. The people working here were all so friendly and very inviting. The food was well priced for Vegas.  and the carne asade was REAL carne asada juicy and delicious! The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 was because I ordered the carne asada fries and they were a little dry. But someone else might hive the tacos a 5! Worth a try. :)"}
{"text":"OMG! 

This place is delicious! It is always packed I ate there about three times in a week. The SPICY PORK (adobada) Tacos are the best! fallowed by Chorizo. 

The Staff is super fast, super friendly and over all amazing! 

A must go indeed!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place of all time. Tacos El pastor are amazing A must have in my opinion. I've been known to come here twice in one day. Looking forward to coming back in august."}
{"text":"This is the real deal!!!

When you go in, you will be hard pressed to find a Gringo eating here. 

Just read my fellow reviewers reviews, and you'll see that the variety and quality are unsurpassed.

Always Latino families, and if you don't speak Spanish or have any idea what to order, your fellow Latino diners will gladly give you suggestions and help you order. 

My only suggestion; Have one of your companions grab a table, while you put in the order. 

This place beats any other place in town for authenticity. 

Don't miss out!!!"}
{"text":"Omg hands down the best lengua tacos... Just the way they make them in TJ. It was heaven in my mouth. Lengua very tender & flavorful. Pastor could have been cooked a little longer for some crisp.  My husband gets his cooked well done bcz it's to raw for his liking. Now that's the way to go & it's super yummy."}
{"text":"Is this love? 

Ever since I first stepped into Tacos El Gordo, I couldn't stop thinking of the adobado taco. As soon as I laid eyes on that twirling mountain of spicy pork slowly being marinated by the roasting pineapple up top, I knew this was the one. It was love at first sight. 

I was confused upon walking in though. As an Asian who struggled through Spanish 101, I felt foreign here. Everything seemed so fast-paced and busy. I stood back on the sidelines to evaluate and plan how I was going to tackle my first taco order. 

I stood there, staring at the menu for a few minutes in confusion. Apparently, the counter is divided into sections which serve the particular meat desired. Luckily, English got me through just fine. People behind the counter are friendly and very quick to construct your taco. I wasn't really familiar with any of the meats on the menu, so I just pointed at things that looked good.

\"I want two of that one.\"
\"Can I get two of that?\"

Apparently, my point and get method served me well. I ended up with two adobado tacos (spicy pork)  and two carne asda tacos. $2 a taco. Not bad.

These tacos were some of the best things I've eaten in a long time. They were so good, in fact,  that I went back up for more. Authentic tacos made with love; my favorite kind. 

Tacos El Gordo, you will see me back very soon. This time, I'll know what I'm doing."}
{"text":"Delicious and Cheap
Pros
Cheap and delicious tacos

Cons
A little far from the Strip

At $2 per taco, this is well worth it. The Adobaba tacos were nice and spicy, with a tasty aiolle. I walked from the Strip so it took awhile to get there, but I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"Tacos are good and close to Mexican tasting tacos but a little after I start burping them, maybe their oil needs to be cleaned out more often? Happens in any Tacos El Gordo location, prefer to go to Taco y Taco."}
{"text":"If you like grease, check it out! They serve grease in all forms at this fine establishment -- glistening on the surface of shreds and slabs of quivering meats, whipped into a slime and drizzled atop grilled-flesh-covered french fries, plastered on walls and windows and employees' faces...you can even get your grease as a sort of lacquer coating on grilled onions and jalapenos! They serve ALL FOUR grease food groups here!

If you're an unhealthful, grease-lapping fatass, you'll dig it. But if you're a fitness-obsessed health nut who happens to be drunk and stumbling down the street at 3am, you'll like it too... shamefully enough.

The best thing here is the people watching. It's ALWAYS packed with an amazing assortment of Mexican families, couples, kids, chunties and cholos. Even at 3am, there are familias with little kids sitting around eating and laughing and bullshitting! 

Since I find the food so abhorrent, I prefer to do my watching from the street, looking through the giant plate-glass windows at the hordes of obese people shoving greasy strips of meat into their greasy pieholes. It's like watching the Mexican version of Caligula, without all the Penthouse Pets.

On the plus side, the staff is VERY friendly, even to drunken gueras like me. But even that won't really get me to come back here...unless I happen to be stumblingly drunk and starving in the immediate vicinity. And I live right down the block....

D'OH!"}
{"text":"I was here a few months back. Suadero is an alternate for carne asada. I waited a half hour to order. One of the few places to make me wait and yes l will come back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! It was as if my grandma and aunts were back there cooking for me ( and I know they weren't because they are in my hometown not cooking for me) I had six tacos de lengua (cow tongue, dont turn your face all wrinkled either cuz that stuff is good, try to expand your palate you simp). Anyhoo, I will be going back there again."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY!!! This ain't no Taco Bell and I thank everyone and their mother for that. If you want real mexican food than you owe it to yourself to go here."}
{"text":"Holy Shit, I don't really like Mexican Food other than this small street cart I tried in Playa Del Carmen, but this place is the F*&* Bomb!  Best Tacos in Vegas, you must also try the green onions, it's delicious!!!!

Only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the way they have the lines setup.  There are three lines, the left is for beef, right is for their spicy pork and the middle is everything else.  So, after waiting in one line then grabbing your food, you have to get into another line to order something else.  By that time, my tacos were a little cold.  

**Tip**
If you pretend your ignorant and order everything in one line, you might be able to get away with it.  :)"}
{"text":"Why do some people not know of this place? Went to get tacos here four days straight when I visited Las Vegas with the boyfriend. Hands down to the best tacos I have had in my life. Adobado and Al Pastor will become your favorite words after visiting this place. Grilled green onions and pepper are a must. Fast service and it is always fun watching them create the tacos in front of your eyes."}
{"text":"Great food under $3. But I'll warn you once you've had one you'll want to try them all. The staff is very nice and helpful. The only problem was the gentleman in the entrance, he thinks he's being funny but he's really being rude. Overall it was one of the best restaurants in Vegas as far as Mexican food."}
{"text":"OMG best street tacos in Vegas ever.  They are just like the ones in LA, but better.  

Only got the tacos there but they were amazing.  
Adobado: Had right amount of spice and the creamy sauce complimented the meat.  
Carne Asada: Juicy steak comes with guac and pico
Lengua: Wow...so juicy and tender
Tripa: OMG...deep fried intestines...Greatness in my mouth..lol
Buche: (stomach) it was ok...i just had to try it.
Cabeza: (head)..wasnt bad..had to try it also
Sesos: (brain)...had to try this as well...it wasnt bad...but the texture was weird.

The place was busy when we got there, but the line went by quick. There are a few tables in the inside and a bunch on the outside.

Oh almost forgot free refills on drinks, so of course got Orange Bang!!!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical going in - I had heard a lot of hype - but it lived up to the expectations. 

It can be a little intimidating when you first walk in. Don't be discouraged. You stand in line for the type of meat you want (why would anyone not be in the pastor line?) and order directly from the person who will be making it for you. Tacos are all you really need, but I just learned that they make asada fries too, so they're on my list. 

It gets pretty packed at night, so be prepared to either take it to go or have someone wrangle a table for you while you get their food. Venmo is your friend. 

All in all, this place rocks."}
{"text":"Open late. Check. 

Very inexpensive. Check. 

Very tasty food. Check. 

Within waking distance from the strip. Check. 

Why else can you ask for??"}
{"text":"I had not realized that I have not reviewed Tacos El Gordo. I've been to both locations, and I must say that I prefer this one. There aren't any drunken tourists. Although if you have been out on the Strip and are craving some delicious tacos, it is centrally located. Bonus, the prices are the same.

I only come here for one thing, the tacos al pastor. Everything else, except the tacos de asada are good, but for me it's al pastor all the way. I can eat five of them without any problems, they are so good. I have friends from Tijuana that say that these taste exactly the same as El Gordo in TJ. Get some cebollitas and chiles asados to go along with your order. Drizzle a little lime juice over them, and you have yourself a full feel for under 10 bucks. I've read some reviews that say this area is shady at night, hardly. You'll be ok. 

Nuff said, for an authentic taste of al pastor tacos, check out El Gordo."}
{"text":"I am rarely on the Strip so I usually get tacos at their E. Charleston location. Nonetheless, on the remote chance that I have been drinking on the Strip, this is the place to come to soak up the alcohol. The only downside is that there will be a hundred more drunken people (likely more drunk than you btw). 

Each time I come here I find that they've taken over more space, pretty damn impressive.  I come here and order one thing only, the tacos al pastor. They are the bomb, seriously. Order six, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! They don't really have this on the menu but you can ask for 1/2 lengua and 1/2 adobada fries!! It's soooo good! The meat is well seasoned and the fries are perfectly cooked. This is a must whenever we go to vegas because it is the perfect junk/latenight food. They did move off the strip so you do have to drive further to get here, but this means more parking and shorter lines so I can't complain. You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not a meat eater and if you are vegetarian, your only options are French fries or a quesadilla. I came because my husband wanted pastor tacos. And he said they were the best ever! He would definitely rate this place high. 

You walk in to a room full of people waiting in lines. There are 3 different lines depending on what kind of meat you want. So you stand in one line and hope they can sneak some meat from the line next to you if you want another type of meat. They are  fast enough but you do sometimes have to wait for people to make up their darn minds. 

My only gripe is that they don't have a salsa bar. So if you forgot to ask for salsa before you left the line, you are screwed because no one will let you back in. Overall an authentic taco place for real Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is one of my favorite places to get authentic Mexican tacos. My favorite are the al pastor and the tripas! To bad they are only in Nevada or else this would be my place to go every weekend. If you go to Vegas you gotta stop by."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I always come here best tacos hands down. It gets 5 stars all day"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times when I'm at Vegas and by far is a hidden gem.  The quality of the food is just so yummy in my tummy.  There's no actual lines but everyone seems to follow the imaginary line which is great.  When I go; I always order Taco's (carne asada)  and definitely the price and the food is great.  The place is always clean.  I'll definitely be making my way back here every time we visit Las Vegas and recommend friends to go as well."}
{"text":"** Tasty and authentic tacos, but always a really long wait at almost any time of the day. Very hard to order many different varieties if you are alone, proteins are hit or miss. 

I first found out about Tacos El Gordo from my friend in San Diego who once posted a picture on her instagram of these tacos and I screenshotted it because they looked so good. So when I saw that they had a chain here, I was determined to check it out. 

I came for dinner with three other friends on New Years Eve, and the line was pretty long and going well beyond the door. Inside was really crowded as well. We decided to split up and each order a few tacos from each line, since the way it works is that you have lines for individual proteins, and have to wait in that line just to order that kind of taco (ex: line for pork tacos).

After awhile, we only ordered from a few of the lines because the line for the steak was just ridiculous. As a matter of fact, my friend told me that the person he was once standing in line next to was still waiting as we finished dinner and left. 

I remember I ordered the spicy pork, but my friend ordered a ton of weird meats that I don't quite remember because they were first of all in Spanish and my friend isn't really a foodie so didn't really pay attention to these things. The spicy pork tacos were heavenly... everything just tastes so good with the fresh tortillas, salsa, guac, and meat. 

HOWEVER, I do have to say that a lot of these meats were pretty whack, at least in my opinion. There was one that was white and looked like intestine, kind of tasted like tripe that you eat in pho.. but in a taco. Another was weird and crispy, giving it a dry feeling and kind of gave me the impression thats how people prepare insects (no I've never eaten bugs before).  

If only we were able to get to meats like the carne asada (I really wanted to try the fries but never had the chance) I think this place would have be perfect. Everything about the tacos are good, the challenge is just choosing the best proteins when you have limited time cuz you need to turn up later."}
{"text":"BEST CARNE ASADA FRIES!!!! I just melted like the amazing cheese they had when I bit into them. My carne was perfectly cooked and tasty and I don't think I could ask for a better plate. I'll be back ritually, that is a gaurentee. AND THE HALF PLATE IS ONLY LIKE 6.49!!!! WITH EVERYTHING ON IT! yes, please!"}
{"text":"I always come here for my tacos pastor if I'm in need while in the area. waiting is never a long issue, and my food is always fresh! would recommend to anyone. They also have REALLY good carne."}
{"text":"Is it weird that my favorite taqueria is in Las Vegas?  This place is awesome, and when I say awesome I mean life changingly awesome.  

The meats here are delicious and watching the cooks work their stations here is nothing short of impressive.  They are so freakin' fast! The food is really why you are here, and it doesn't disappoint.

The lengua is tasty, moist, and super tender. The al pastor is well seasoned and not too dry. The cabeza is delicious as well, give it a try. 

The carne asada is really where it's at though. Unlike most taquerias, they actually grill the carne asada here. It has char!  It's not just steak on a hot top here.  It makes a huge difference.  Want to kick up the carne asada? Get the carne asada fries.  The fries are crisp and are the perfect complement to the savory goodness of the carne asada. Don't forget the real guacamole on top as well!

Oh yeah, did I mention the sauces? I have no idea what a lot of them are, but man, do they make the meats sing!!!  

Everything is good here, even the marinated veggies that come on the side of the plate.  
I am glad that this place is so far away from home, because if it wasn't, I'd have to buy bigger clothes!"}
{"text":"best tacos in town!definitivo! baja california style! like that"}
{"text":"Great food, the meat on tacos and fries was amazing very moist and flavorful. We will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"12 am on Sunday night still a 30+ min wait. WORTH.

Basically their main selling point is the al pastor is on a middle eastern style  shwarma  roasting rack.

They cut it when you ask and its soft as can be."}
{"text":"The tacos here are ok... not anything like the So-Cal Tacos El Gordo awesomeness. I love the ones in So-Cal, the flavor and taste is consistently bar none. But for some reason the Las Vegas location missed the mark. The flavor was off, meat had a lot of gristle, and some of the tortillas tasted a little stale. Don't get me wrong the tacos here are not terrible, just not anything close to what I've come to expect from Tacos El Gordo. Maybe it was an \"off\" day."}
{"text":"When they offer tripe,  brain or tongue tacos,  you know the place is authentic. But go for the spicy pork  adobada tacos. Came for two,  ate four.  The carne asada with prickly pear (Taco Azteca con nopal asada)  was also very good."}
{"text":"Just like in San Diego! I am a regular when ever I visit National City and it's great to know that we have one in town... I just wish it wasn't on the other side of town! The place is setup almost exactly like the one in National City. The owner is real nice an we even had a chat with her while we were there.

If you've never been here before, Tacos El Gordo is basically like a taco stand and has TJ (Tijuana) style tacos-- small tacos but full of goony goodness!

My favorite is the adobada taco with an horchata and sometimes I'll have a carne asada taco as well. I usually don't venture outside of that because, well, everything else is made from things I prefer not to eat like intestine, \"cabeza\"... Uhm, yea, I love my choices lol.

Word to the weaklings to the spicy stuff, such as myself, always ask for no spicy sauce or \"NO CHILI POR FAVOR\" :) Their spicy stuff is pretty spicy for myself, I usually get the salsa verde on the side.

We'll be back, not sure how often since it's way on the other side of town :("}
{"text":"This Tacos El Gordo is HUGE compared to the ones in San Diego, with plenty of seating in the restaurant! 
As always, the tacos are excellent and the adobada tacos are a must try (5/5 stars) and as always, line up for the different meats for faster service!"}
{"text":"Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am! 
The real deal! 
If you don't like these, you don't like tacos. 
Period!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos! Best price! Try their Adobado tacos! They are addictively good! Ask for Pineapple on them! Yum! You'll want to have at least three tacos! Mix and match! They make them right in front of you and the place is always busy! The real deal authentic, if that's what your looking for!"}
{"text":"Best tacos al pastor ever! Asada tacos are delicious,  friendly service and waited very little in line. Highly recommend this place.  Will definitely be back before going back to California."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good things about this place for soooo many months and years. So while we were in Vegas last week, we thought..what the heck, let's check it out before the 4 hour drive home. First bad move: we went at lunch time(12pm) and the line was out the door! Second bad move: their lines are confusing af!!! One line for al pastor another line if you want asada, etc..you catch my drift. Third bad move: THERE IS NO SEATING! people are like vultures for seating so we ate in our car. So small in their you're better off eating outside or in your vehicle than rubbing shoulders with a bunch of strangers. 

The BEST Move? THE TACOS, SOPES, AND CARNE ASADA FRIES WERE AMAZING!!!!!! I will return."}
{"text":"Tried the tacos de adobada.  They were amazing!!!  Meat was moist and the sauces were perfection!!  Just the right amount of spice without burning me.  Seriously this is the best food I've had on the strip and way more affordable than the crappy food in the food court at my hotel"}
{"text":"Pretty much the rolls Royce of Mexican food in Vegas always good and always packed with satisfied and addicted customers"}
{"text":"The food is good.  The dining experience is very annoying.  You have to stand in different lines for different meats.Stupid. It is very crowded. Often there is no place to sit.  You have to stand until another customer leaves.  When you hot bunk like that the table has the remains of the previous persons meal on the table.  It is noisy as well."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is the only authentic Mexican food shop I would recommend in Vegas. The meat is sliced right in front of you and you can get all the extras (like pineapple) for free.
Each line is for a different type of meat. Make sure to read the signs! I hate being in restaurants where I don't understand the menu/how to order/what to order. Tacos El Gordo is exactly that, so bring a friend that knows what they're doing! The tacos are small-- 10 tacos for a guy is a good start."}
{"text":"Oh tacos el gordo, you've done it again. And you're open till 4 am!! Perfect for anyone passing through at any time of the day. This location was surprisingly big with 2 sections for seating. You walk in and go left to find a similar set up as other locations. 4 different lines for the various kinds of tacos. The one closest to you when you walk in is where you want to go. The first meat to order is adobada, or spicy pork. Ask for everything, which will include onions and a green creamy sauce. Also, ask for pineapple as they will not give it unless you ask. Next, make your way down the line and order some cabeza (beef head) and lengua (tongue). They might sound exotic for those who are not use to eating a variety of meats, but they are the most excellent. If you're not a risk taker, today is the day to start. Ask for everything and they'll give you a green verde sauce as well as some onions. Each taco will cost you around $2.20 to $2.40. A little pricey for such a small taco, but oh so worth it. If you're on a budget, just get a couple and grab some free limes and whole radishes. Eat enough and it'll fill you up. This location pretty much rivals the others with 2 exceptions. The tortillas are freshly made, but the ones we got were a little soggier. Second, the adobada was a little on the crunchier side this time. Nothing completely horrible, but none the less a little different. Come here whenever you're in town. It's the place to get your taco fix!"}
{"text":"1....2.....3...... The number of Tacos El Gordo shops in Vegas continue to grow and that should be a sign on how successful their shop is. The shop is on the far north end of the strip, it's in an awkward location that either forces you to work hard for your meal (it's a loooooong walk from most of the casinos) or forces you to drive. The lot is pretty big and parking has never been an issue for me. The line during the day is either non-existent or extremely short. Come here at night when all the post-clubbing munchers come in and you'll have a line out the door. 
There are multiple lines based on what type of meat you're ordering. The 4 lines facing you at the main entrance are where you'll probably want to be at (unless you plan on ordering tongue or intestines- the line for that is on the other side). 
AL PASTOR. AL PASTOR. AL PASTOR. It's the line at the far right. Start there, order 3 tacos and if you're still hungry order more AL PASTOR. The meat is so soft and flavored perfectly. If you're feeling to try something else, go for the asada. 
The tongue and intestines were both extremely soft and juicy. I loved the tongue, didn't like the intestines. 
Grab your plate and head to the register by the door. They have drinks behind the counter if you want some."}
{"text":"A lot of people love the al pastor tacos, I think they are good... but too greasy for my liking.  I really like the carne Asada taco and the vampiro.  Vampiro is a crunchy tortilla Mexican white cheese, meat, toppings, cheese and crunchy tortilla."}
{"text":"I went through 3 different emotions from the moment I placed my order to when I received my order. First I saw the prices. $2 tacos, $4 burritos, $10 for combos. Yay, cheap food!!  So I ordered one beef taco for $2 and one beef burrito for $4. Next I saw the portion. The burrito wasn't a \"burrito\" I am used to eating. So I was a little confused. And I thought the portion was so small. Once again, not what I am used to. So sadness came over me. I sat down to eat my meal. OMG, these people know how to make tasty Mexican food! Pure joy and happiness began to take over any past emotions. The food was very tasty. And it turned out the portion wasn't small at all. I got full on just those two orders. The point is, this place is awesome! Sooo good! 4 stars instead of 5 because they don't give you utensils when dining in. I literally sat down and had to get up again to find the forks. And it was so crowded in there, getting the fork wasn't easy. I saw that most people were eating with their hands. But they should offer utensils during when the customer is up at the register paying for their meal. I don't mind eating with my hand but when I've been sightseeing all day, I know I do not want to touch my food with my dirty hands. Hence why they need to automatically offer utensils rather than assuming the customer will locate the utensils and take one."}
{"text":"What can  I say about these tacos...... besides that they are the bomb. I am not too fond of the tacos de Asada. All the rest are to die for. It is always busy so I guess I'm not the only one that likes them."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is very authentic and the service is as friendly as it can get. Note it is not a fancy place, but that makes the experience even better. Also even though it is tacos, it might not be the cheapest one, as you might average $20 per adult and some assume that tacos should be much cheaper. These are totally worth it! 
The place is kept as clean as possible many employees are on it but hey they have a production line that goes around the corner cooking all kinds of delicacies, so of course it won't be spotless 24/7. But the place is clean and reliable. 
Plus it is right on the strip and on Friday and Saturday there can be a line but it moves pretty quickly plus it is entertaining to see trays full of tacos for.those who seat outdoors. I'll go to tacos el Gordo every single chance I get!"}
{"text":"The grilled pineapple is a delicious addition to the adobada taco!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place! I always go when i visit Vegas. I will never stop going. It does get packed sometimes but it is,worth it."}
{"text":"Why come here? Because they spit roast and carve their pork tacos to order

strolled thru lunchtime last saturday and the line was going out the front door, so many ppl gotta make sure your standing in the right line, I came here for the Adobada (pork) and luckily I stood in the right line, the middle, the left is for Carne Asada and the far right is for everything else, Brains, Guts, and Quesadillas etc....

ordered 3 of the pork tacos at $2 a piece, everything includes cilantro, onions, and two house made sauces, hot sauce and crema, extra fixings you gotta hit the side bar yourself if you want radish and any other sauces

the tacos were all the hype, freshly grilled, crusted edges, juices running into the tortilla which by the way were heated simultaneously under the spit and picked up when your order is carved, to top it off, you get a slice of the that pineapple roasting on the top of mt. meat, all good, btw if you want roasted onions and peppers I think you gotta ask for it

inside/outside seating, open 10am to 5am daily, parking is hit or miss (on the strip), park in the lot around the corner

a must try if your into cheap eats, especially in Vegas"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Well worth the trip downtown from the strip.

Adobado and Chorizo tacos were great.  The process is a little confusing (different \"stations\" for different tacos), but everyone was very helpful and friendly - even for us gringos.

I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"If I keep eating the delicious tacos at Tacos El Gordo, I'll become even more gordo myself.  

Tacos El Gordo are the most authentic tacos this side of Tijuana, wait a sec ..."}
{"text":"Since the one in The Strip is always crowded, we decided to come here instead. There are more tables and the food is as great, Tacos El Gordo will never dissapoint ;)"}
{"text":"Best authentic taco restaurant ever! My husband brought me there cuz he said he tried it and it was the best he's ever had, so i had to try it for myself of course"}
{"text":"If you're a visitor to the West Coast - you should try these tacos! They make everything fresh and right in front of you - from the meat to the tortilla. 

The weird thing is there are 3 different lines for the 3 cuts of meat they serve. So if possible, go with a few friends and split up into designated lines. 

They also have horchata soda fountains, which I have never seen before. It wasn't that great, I've had better horchata. It tasted like half-carbonated cinnamon water lol.

The tacos were yummy and an affordable place to eat!"}
{"text":"I live in California and I was told that this place was good. Actually is great. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow... Freakin wow... These are hands down THE best tacos I've ever had. 

They have this huge rack of meat cooking and when they scrape off pieces for your taco I could see all the juices ooze out of it in slow motion! It was soo beautiful, gracefull, even magical... The way the natural juices glimmered and sparkled from the ceiling lights. It was love at first sight, I had dreams about that for nights to come.

The tacos are best enjoyed with some lime and salsa (green and red) with some of the thicker guacamole they have. Be warned that it will get messy as the tacos deliciousness will drip all over the place.

Honestly I would return to Vegas just for these tacos alone! Trick the nightclubs, the shows, the strip clubs, it's all about these tacos right here..."}
{"text":"Great TJ style tacos! First you order them , then they hand them to you on the spot , then if you want other meats you get in another line to get them , once all the tacos you want are in your tray , then you go pay, hopefully you find a seat otherwise you might as well eat them outside. But they are worth it ! I had tripa, lengua , and al pastor.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This one is def busy, it's a lot more spacious and the cooks here are FAST! The customer service is good, and the place is usually always clean! They have to because the amount of people who come here to eat!

The food is delicious! They probably have some of the best carne asada fries, the only reason they aren't 5 stars are because the prices went up like crazy! Before you could get a full order of fries for 10$ not they're 14$!!! WTF!? I mean, even the small ones are 7 and change! They used to be 5$!! Supply and demand though, so I get it. The tacos are 2.50$, which me being a cheap beaner, is a little too much. 

Other than the prices rising, everything else is a win. I always take extra forks, which is probably why the prices went up... sorry!

LOL!"}
{"text":"- Flavorful tacos. Everything is being prepared fresh 
- There always seems to be a line-up, but the staff usually works very quickly. They used to have outdoor stands to eat, but they have dissembled them after their renovation. This means that there are less seats for customers.
- Tacos are around $2.50. I also highly suggest trying their fries, which are loaded with meat and cheese! ($7 for a half order and $12 for a full order) 
- Basically a lime and radish buffet
- Don't forget to ask for a grilled chili on the side too!"}
{"text":"At first, the tacos look a little plain and small for the price but once I tasted them I realized that they are SOOO worth it!"}
{"text":"After a long weekend at EDC, these tacos hit the spot. There was a bit of a wait but to be honest if there's a line that means it's good food. I'm from San Diego and this location tasted just like home. Definitely hitting this place up whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"GO HERE!!!!

Based on countless Yelp reviews, I was mentally preparing myself for a long line.

Not so much.

Walked right in, ordered, ate tacos and out of there in less than 15 minutes.

I know that won't always be the case, but it sure was nice for my first visit.

Do yourself a favor and go bag some BOMB tacos!"}
{"text":"The one star reviews and \"meat\" quality reviews are absolutely ridiculous. They'r tacos a STREET FOOD staple in Mexico. If it's street food guess what your not paying for high end cuts of meat, this is not a filet mignon taco, It's carne asada, asada means charbroiled if you didn't know that we'll that explains the \"crispy\" meat as mediocre people called it. The different lines for each meat? well each different cook is assigned a meat station due to the high volume of customers that LAS VEGAS STRIP brings. Moronic reviews obviously come from those that don't know what a taco stand is... It is not a 5 star dining experience, nor a food digest experience. If you are so uppity go somewhere else where your gonna get your bunghole hair braided and the constant \"how is everything guys?\" Experience.
Tacos el Gordo is kind enough to come all the way from Tijuana Mexico to give you Anglos a small taste of a what a real taco should be. 

Now bow. Suck it up or go stand in line at a buffet to eat food that's lamp heated and cloned."}
{"text":"go to spot for cheap and quick meal outside of the strip. fyi a lil ghettoer than the one on the strip though in case you're uncomfortable with ghetto."}
{"text":"Best adobada tacos I've had in Vegas.The workers are friendly,the place is clean & open late.Their radishes are huge by the way lol"}
{"text":"First time here and I got 2 al pastor 2 asada and 2 chorizo tacos. 
They were tasty. 

The only thing I didn't like much was how the ordering and the checking out was setup. You order at different Windows and then have to walk towards the exit door to pay and then you find a place to sit. It's a bit confusing. 

But nonetheless, the tacos are great tasting."}
{"text":"I once waited in line an hour for tacos. Thought I would never come back. I did. A lot. Those al pastor tacos are sooooo good. Have to ask for the pineapples on them. 5/5 would wait in line an hour again."}
{"text":"Really great prices and great quality of taco's, it gets really crowds but it's only cause ppl love the place"}
{"text":"Their carne asada fries holds top one ranking on my bud so far and really feel better specially for late night. Only thing disappointing me was they ain't carry burrito, but tha's why shall go at 12 am lol."}
{"text":"They used to have a spot on the strip but even then this location in the hood of Vegas was and is better. Definitely worth the travel this place sports the best tacos in all of Vegas and some of the best al pastor north of ANY border. The rest of the menu boasts a larger variety of deliciousness than most taquerias and you should try all of them. But without a doubt you should always leave room for at least a couple of tacos al pastor. Screw the strip, if you're hungry make the effort to go to this gem in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"best authentic Mexican tacos around! don't walk, run here!!! get the adobada (spicy pork) and Carne asada with everything on it, you won't be disappointed, especially for $2.10 per taco. if your thinking about $12 for fries, it's totally worth it and that's the only thing you're gonna eat (you'll be full) gooooo~!*"}
{"text":"What in the hell was that?!?!  A quesadilla with meat that was a size of a half dollar.  The meat was seasoned OK.  I guess since I'm from the Bay Area, I'm use to eating excellent Mexican food.  Long lines for a Titos tacos 2.0 with carne asada fries included.  If you want to eat excellent Tacos and Burritos, go to 24th street in the Mission, San Francisco."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food - it's phenominal.  But dont plan on sitting down unless you've brought someone to stake out a table while others wait in the line(s) corresponding to the tacos you want.  

(It's annoying they allow this obnoxious practice: the tables could turn over several times in the amount of time it takes to get throught the steak line.)"}
{"text":"BEST TACO PLACE in town! Seriously! 
I love love tacos and Tacos el Gordo always satisfies my taco cravings! 
The Charleston location is my favorite one, I feel like the service and the tacos and different from the other one. It can be a little pricey, however I would rather pay extra for something that's good than something that is alright. Even though there's always lines, the service is pretty fast. The only thing is the struggle finding a place to sit and eat. Last time I was there we just sat on the tables they have outside."}
{"text":"Was greeted by a very nice young lady . Very clean restaurant. All the Condiments were fully stocked and fresh. Tacos were the bomb beans salsas outstanding."}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing! Will definitely go back! Best Tacos ever!! Would recommend staying with the Pastor Adobado con todo!  The way they prepare it! Pricing is great! That salsa they add not to mention homemade tortillas!! *foodgasm*"}
{"text":"The asada tacos are so good! The best I've had in Vegas. Just order them the way they come. Only $2 each, and the service was super quick even though they were really busy."}
{"text":"Adobada tacos how I love thee, let me count the ways...with onions and salsa and corn tortillas hot off being cut from the rotisserie - so tasty and filling. And - what - adobada FRIES are a thing, prepared the same way with the pork and salsa and onions on a bed of fried potato goodness. Now decisions, decisions...either way you won't go wrong with either."}
{"text":"Service was so slow ! All the workers were so rude and giving us attitude when we asked to order a drink. I'd rather go to Roberto's !"}
{"text":"Recomiendo ampliamente este negocio, riquisimos tacos de carne asada, cabeza, chorizo, nopales azados para los vegetarianos, no olviden probar las mulitas con cualquier carne, tienen cebollitas azadas. la atencion es rapida pero va mucha gente a comer y hay que hacer fila, para cobrar es un poco tardado, un poco compliacada la organizacion porque tiene varias lineas para pedir los tacos, un una pides azada, en otra la comida al pastor, en otra la comida preparada al vapor, pero no te preocupes, llegando con el taquero el te puede pedir algunos taquitos de la otra linea, cuando regrese a Vegas seguro pasare por alli, todos son muy amigables."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas to eat. The food is fresh and yummy the staff is friendly and they have the lines organized"}
{"text":"This place is trying to duplicate a Tijuana Taco Stand with the same ordering system. Epic fail. The lines are long & slow, the Taqueros can't keep up with the lines, and the quality (compared to what you get in Tijuana) is marginal. The location on Charleston is a bit better than the one on the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Hands Down the Best Tacos in Vegas!
Perhaps even the best tacos in the west. There are other locations, like the one in San Diego, but there is something special about this place. The taste is very authentic, from the hand made tortillas, to the meat, to the fresh salsa and guacamole. If you love going to Tijuana for tacos, but hate the crossing the border for two hours plus... then this is the place to go. Just like TJ, but no need to wait to come back. 

Only issue is the line / crowd control... there are two lines, one for asada, one for everything else... and the line for asada is usually about 20 - 30 minute wait to order, while the other is very small usually under 10 minutes... but you don't know about the two lines until you've waited in them for a while. But there is a PRO TIP here... offer the guy in the alpastor line a nice 3 dollar tip and ask him to order a few asada tacos for you... works every time ! (Of course this only works in spanish... but it works).

besides the huge lines, this place is the best... even after waiting 20 minutes... I still give it five stars, cause there is nothing like it... best place to eat in Vegas : )"}
{"text":"BEST TACO SPOT EVER!!! I'm not even exaggerating everything here is good mulas, tacos, asada fries!!"}
{"text":"They were so crowded you would expect the tacos to be the best you've ever had. Instead they were just mediocre. Perhaps it's because the place is so busy it's hard to put out a high-quality product with such quick turnover. But even if the quality improved a lot, you still just have a pretty good taco. Don't waste your time seeking out this restaurant."}
{"text":"Quesadilla was super small (size of a taco)
My stepdad loves eating and this is the first time I heard him say food wasn't good.
My sister ordered 2 asada tacos and didn't even finish them.

Poor quality
Over priced 

Doesn't own to the hype"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love the tacos. I had the spice pork taco and the steak taco. The pork taco is to die for. I will be back again"}
{"text":"Clean, speedy, CHEAP and yummy! Only thing there is no option for chicken tacos. The service was great and accommodating. This was a refreshing option from all the touristy places off the strip. Will return!"}
{"text":"These are the best damn tacos in Las Vegas! I'm serious. All of the tortillas are homemade right in front of you and are used almost immediately on the taco orders. I came here every time I walked by. For 2$ a taco, you just cant beat the taste and freshness of \"The Fat Taco\". I just wish that I could find a similar restaurant near my house.....I live in San Diego, I know they exist. The only bummer about El Gordo is how far on the end of the strip it sits. It's almost directly across the street from Circus Circus, you know, the ghetto part of the strip. I've grown up about 45 minutes away from Mexico my entire life and only here did I see all of the nitty gritty taco ingredients. Cabeza, Lengua, Cheek, etc. But by far the best on their menu is the Adobada. Do yourself a favor and come get a damn good taco!"}
{"text":"It was so delicious I had 2 tacos de asada 1 mulita de asada and 1 taco de pastor.. hands down pastor won it was so dam good .. free refills. Crowded af, 5lines to order"}
{"text":"Dont even think twice. We visit this place on every vegas trip. Abadaba - pork taco is food from heaven and i dont even like tacos."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexicana. Food is wonderful. The atmosphere is awesome. Be patient. Very inexpensive. Whales to regular folks all elbow to elbow and digging in on some grub."}
{"text":"food: lengua, cabeza, tripa, and al pastor. the beef tacos were good. beefy and tender. the tripa one was great. slightly crunchy from the smaller bits. al pastor was decent. it has a good sauce. the meat was tender but not as flavorful. ***3/5

service: it can be a confusing way to order. you can only order certain things in certain lines, which is great, once you figure it out. then if you want to order more stuff, you have to line up again. that was annoying. it get its waves. there will be times where theres not that many people. it just so happens when i need to be in line, there is a lot of people in line. you ahve to fight your way through for a table. ***3/5

value: it's expensive for tacos. i found the flavor lacking. i wouldnt mind paying more for good tacos. after all the hub bub in line and everything, it's not worthwhile. ***2/5"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gordo.

When I see a spit full of deliciously spiced and marinated pig slowly rotating and being carved by a dude with a machete, I get in line. Immediately. 

Here at Tacos El Gordo, there are lines for their different meats: carne asada on the left, lengua and others in the middle, and al pastor on the right. Let's cut to the chase: get in the line on your right. The al pastor/adobada is PHENOMENAL and worthy of an ALL-CAPS adjective. Perfectly seasoned, tender with just a bit of char on the exterior, it's served on a warm, freshly made tortilla. Don't forget to ask for grilled jalapenos, onions, and pineapple on the side. 

The lines are long, but they move quickly. After you have your tray full of tacos (or fries, mulas, sopas, quesadillas, or tostadas), go to the cashier and pay. You also buy your drinks here. It's your typical taco shop ambiance, casual and divey, yet clean and friendly. On our initial visit, my wife and I were wandering around trying to find  seats when one of the workers cleared out a space near the cash register just for us. Excellent service!

Ignore the reviewers complaining about the $2 per taco price tag. Each taco is generously filled with al pastor that is much better than what you'll find at your typical restaurant or truck. In fact, I'd bet that these same reviewers would gladly pay $2 for 2 tacos with less meat (and of lower quality) because it sounds like a better deal. It only takes one taste of Tacos El Gordo's al pastor to know you're getting your money's worth and then some. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went to the original LV location in early 2013 and really enjoyed the Tacos Al Pastor. I've seen the sign at the Cheyenne and Losee intersection for at least a year and was happy to hear via Yelp that they were officially opened up in my neck of the woods.

So I went in tonight after work and there is a lot of space in there compared to the other location.  Thank God for reading the Yelp reviews or I would of been intimidated in trying to order my food. I found the comments about three lines for different meats very helpful because there were so many people waiting in various locations.  It took about 20 minutes for me to get up to the window to order my Adobada Fries. You may want to bring a spanish speaking friend or your phone so that you can google what the heck you are ordering. I was going to wing it but since I had so much time in line, I decided to use my phone to figure out what Campechana was and I'm glad I did. I almost ordered seafood fries consisting of what may have been oysters, baby octopus, mussels, shrimp and/or squid!

The restaurant was really clean and there were lots of employees who were working their arses off. The meat cutters were chopping meat like they were cutting up crack in the movie New Jack City. I hope they make their menuboard more \"gringo\" friendly.lol 
I really appreciated the person who stood at the door at the LV Blvd location to help you place your order. 

The food was really good. I wish I would of known to ask for no guacamole or sour cream. I just scooped if off and drowned the rest in extra sauce.  I honestly won't go out of my way to come back here with Roberto's on every corner.  The food is definitely good though and you get your moneys worth as it is very filling."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, great price, and friendly service. What more can you ask from a taco shop? I got adventurous and tried the cabesa taco and I loved it. The meat is always very fresh and they cut it off of skewers as you order it. 

My favorite meat here is the lengua. Try it and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars. 5 of the tacos weren't priced Vegas Strip prices. The quality and taste of the tacos are still top notch. 

Eating tacos here in Vegas or eating them in San Diego or TJ, they're all yummy. 

Ordering tip...you can't order everything in one line. There are 3 different lines when ordering. 2 right when you walk in and 1 to the right."}
{"text":"hoy pase una mala experiencia en ese lugar el servicio de los taquilleros 
pésimo muy malo 
y sobre todo la parecía la dueña una guera chaparra coja  muy mal encarada

{"text":"Isn't it Always true about the hole in the wall places ..they always serve the best food..best tacos I ever had.. Don't miss the lengua, spicy pork ( order both corn and flour ) , the free side of onion and pepper (its hot)is great...2 people 6 tacos and a drink for $20. Unbelievable !"}
{"text":"These tacos are sooooo good. They rival anything I've had in Cali or Arizona. FYI Arizona sucks when it comes to mexican food."}
{"text":"Bomb food, if they get your order correct (and that's a huge IF). Shit service!!! Fuck this place."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. The spicy pork fries always fill me up with just a half order, so if you'd rather not get messy with the tacos go for the fries. Oh, and don't forget to get the green peppers and onions!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego so when I heard there was one in Las Vegas I knew I had to go! I tried the Carne Asada tacos and Adobado tacos. The carne asada tacos were loaded and were pretty great. The Adobado tacos were amazing! 

A couple things to keep in mind are that seating sucks. We had to eat outside and tried sitting on the floor and apparently that's not allowed. We also asked for pineapple to go with our Adobado tacos and we were were only given a few for ten tacos."}
{"text":"The tacos were delish.  The way to order was too long.  People were everywhere so I was starting to get a headache from just trying to focus and wait patiently in line."}
{"text":"I will keep it short and sweet. This place is worth a visit every time you're in this town. 

Hands down best carne asada I've ever had and there signature al pastor is also the best I've ever had. 

If I were a rich man and I wanted tacos or really good Mexican I'd fly my jet here just to get tacos!! 

Lit AF!!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly!!!! Some of the best tacos, mulas, and carne asada fries I've ever had.  Reminds me of my home town in Mexicali.  The tortillas are made fresh right in front of your face. The guacamole and salsa is super fresh, I tried Carne asada, al pastor, and tripa tacos. Freakin amazing!  This is a must go if you hit the strip.  The people are not super friendly but they are helpful, but I can't blame them when they have a line out the door! I rarely give 5 stars but these people earned it just for taste alone. 
ENJOY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We even took an uber here. I've had it once in Texas and that one was good. I thought this location was not good at all. It's just outside the strip by a little and it's so getto. From the servers to the people dining there and even the taxi that we took back. The plaza is super getto, mind you we went around 11pm... which isn't even late in Vegas time. 

The beef was dry. Asked for pineapple and the ppl give you looks. Would never go back"}
{"text":"I have to say they do have some really good tacos, I have had tacos many places so I base my review on all the taco places I have ate at so I really can't give it more than 3 stars, I had the El Pastor which was just ok but Taco Azteca was really good."}
{"text":"Wow!!! We had heard this was a must place to eat..so we ventured down. We knew going into it that the lines are long and it takes a bit to get the food so we knew exactly what to expect..we waited 57 minutes in line...but I must say it was by far delicious!!! In fact if the line wouldn't have been so long we would've ordered more tacos!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! It can't get fresher! They make tortillas in front of you! They carve the pork for your taco, and the best thing is that it is $2!!!"}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO GO HERE. I drive from riverside for these tacos. I've never ever ever had a better taco. Better than king taco, probably better than your mom's tacos. The al pastor is heavenly and don't even get me started on the lengua or cabeza taco. Everything is fresh and delicious. Don't trust me? All the lines of people waiting for tacos from open until close. 

If you haven't gone here, just do it. Once you start you won't stop"}
{"text":"This place is f**king disgusting, yet it's PACKED every single night. Rubbery carne asada on a corn tortilla..Yeah, I don't see what the hype is about..."}
{"text":"It is probably the best cheap \"drunk food\" around at peak nighttime hours however not sure if the lines are worth it. My food was cold and the tacos are messy I think because of the speed at which they are working at. I will give them that, they are FAST and making handmade tortillas on the spot."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  When I get to the club, I'm thinking about what time I'm leaving for Taco's El Gordo to beat the rush.  Oh Chainsmokers on at 1:30? I'm out of there by 2:30 and making the 5 minute walk (From Wynn/Encore) for some TACOS!

The al pastor tacos and abodabo fries are all I ever get here.  Its deliciously flavored and they make it right in front of you!  They slice and dice and throw everything together right there for you to see!  The tacos come on double corn torilla with their signature green sauce.  The abodabo fries has abodabo on top of skinny fries and lathered with sour cream, guacamole and the green sauce.  NOM NOM NOMZ.  Skinny fries should be the only fries allowed!  

So you order at one of the stations that are labelled with the kind of meat they serve and after you get your food, you head to back to the front to pay for everything.  There are a lot of tables but there are also usually a lot of people but it moves pretty quickly.  They have a nice salsa bar with all kinds of condiments to make your meal all that more enjoyable.

There are two abodabo  lines so if you're in a really long line, look around as the other one is typically a lot shorter."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get tacos in Vegas!

I've tried lengua, tripa, adobada, asada, and suadero. Never disappointed.

However, the star of the menu is the Campechana fries. For less than $5 you can get an order of fries topped with both asada and adobada and all the fixings!

Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a shot since it had been recommend by mutual friends and well it has 4.5 stars on yelp. Right away by the look of the place and line we always see we decided to finally try it.  Bad decision! The lines  to order are so unorganized and confusing to a new visitor. I had to stand in one line for one kind of meat and then go to another line for my second choice of meat. Once i finally got my food i had to go stand in another line and well there is few sitting places to sit inside so we had to go outside and eat standing up...by then out food was cold Oh and we also ordered a quesadillas and well it looked like a big taco with cheese..."}
{"text":"Went here with the wife from a lot of people talking about it and was highly disappointed we got carne asada fries and some spicy pork tacos, the tacos were decent at best but the carne asada was the worst tasting ever it tasted like it was blasted with gas or something I cant place it but theres no way it could always taste like that and have such good reviews absolutely horrible we will never be back"}
{"text":"after moving away from san diego, i always miss tacos el gordo for their amazing sopes. i do not care for the tacos or whatever else they seem to make. it is their SOPES people. all my friends order sopes too, cuz they know what's up! its awesome to know vegas has two locations now!

get their carne asada sopes.

i repeat, CARNE ASADA SOPES!!!!!!!!!!!!

if u dont love it, meals on me. :)"}
{"text":"Bomb la bomb da da da bomb! Best tacos in the valley!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, on the strip for like $3 a pop. They're not drowned in cheese and you will go back for thirds and fourths. This is NOT like typical American tacos, and it can be a little disorienting when you first get there. There are different stations, so don't just stand in the long line (which is usually there for the el pastor). This place takes cash only."}
{"text":"Wow. Asada tacos on point. Grilled green onions and spicy jalapeños on top of a fresh tortilla filled with delicious Asada and salsa and guacamole and white onions.... squeeze a lime on top... wow best tacos in Vegas no doubt"}
{"text":"Can't believe Vegas has some of the best tacos I've ever tasted, and I'm from Texas. Recommend to try this place out if your from out of town"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo, you've ruined all other tacos for me. It's all about the handmade corn tortillas...its crack. It's better then other places I've been to with handmade tortillas. Plus the way they fix up the tacos....its magnificent. I. Need. More. Tacos. El. Gordo."}
{"text":"Los tacos están buenos. Este lugar tiene mucha gente y una larga línea pero no es tanto la espera a las 3am. En el día también vi la línea pero pasa rápido. Entiendo porque el alboroto. La carne está buena. Le hace falta arroz y frijoles. Y tal vez moverse a otro lugar más grande. Hay gente que no respeta la línea y se mete por la salida. La mujer security solo le gusta el alboroto con los gringos porque al latino le hace el feo."}
{"text":"Lines were moving quick. Tacos are delicious!!!! Even though the place fills up quick, there always seems to be tables available to sit and eat. Tacos al pastor are definitely a must!!!!"}
{"text":"The authentic food here is outstanding!   It's a little confusing to order if it is your first time but it is worth it.  If you order the Asada fries be prepared to wait...but they are awesome."}
{"text":"I tend to eat from here more that I'd like to because my sweetie LOVES this place, so I bump up the stars for him. This is a street tacos joint so don't expect anything more. What you can expect is long lines and the smell of tacos to linger on your hands and clothes forever. A 30min wait in line is pretty standard. There are also 3 separate lines, depending on what you're getting.
The tacos are pretty good, especially if you're drunk. My favorite are probably the tongue and el pastor. El pastor fries is pretty good too. Hella messy but good. 
Expect to feel guilty after eating here too."}
{"text":"People go nuts for this place, me? Eeehhh....
The tacos are pretty good but not amazing. The wait to order is usually insane. Last time I was there, there were 4 separate lines and the lines stretched outside (should be an indication of amazingness but no), needles to say we waited for like 40 min to order. I don't think they're 40 min wait good... The lines are usually crazy and chaotic so be prepared. 
They do have a nice variety of meats for a fast food type of joint. They have options like chicken, steak, beef shoulder, tongue, brain and spicy pork. The spicy pork is the best! Those are 4*."}
{"text":"Chaos everywhere. This restaurant has 3 lines for different meats so if you want another meat you usually have to hop over or you can ask the guy in your line if he can fetch the meat for you from the other two lines. It's packed, it's cramped, it's steamy/smelly, and it's really really good. The carne asada is good, the campechana fries are good, the al pastor is flavorful, the lengua is fresh. It's all good."}
{"text":"Came here cuz of the fantastic reviews on Yelp. I was sorely disappointed. There is no AC and its super hot and sweaty in here, that already diminished the dining experience. The meat slowly spins over a small fire and looks fantastic when the guy cuts it fresh on to your taco for you. Thats about where all the frills end, the meat tastes just OK. The sauce is refreshing and a nice complement, but overall everything was just.... meh. I'm glad I only had to wait 5 minutes or so in line."}
{"text":"Came here last year and they were located in a weird spot on the strip now they are a little drive away but they have a restaurant where you can sit down and is organized. We ordered 12 tacos of different variety and loved every one. Salsa could be improved but can't complain because the meat is on point and stuffed in tortilla. My one complaint standing in multiple lines to order different kinds of tacos."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I have eaten anywhere. My mouth waters when someone says Tacos El Gordo... because it's that good *___*

There are 3 different lines depending on which type of meat you want so many sure you line up correctly. My favorites are the Al Pastor and Carne Asada, but EVERYTHING IS GOOD ~

You can definitely taste the quality of the meat and how much time they put making it....

Definitely try this place, because it will knock your socks off.


Now I'm craving tacos after writing this review..."}
{"text":"Fresh meat grilling right in front of you is a good sign things will be fresh and hot. 
The tortillas are hand made on site! 
Prices for tacos are ~$2.25. For $11 +tax you can get four tacos and a fountain drink. A deal for Vegas! 
The line of people waiting goes by fast. 
Highly recommend this place for a quick lunch, good dinner or late night meal to soak up that alcohol."}
{"text":"I like the taco adobada and carne asada.  That's probably the only thing I would get.  I did try the fries as recommended by some yelpers but I do not recommend the fries.  It felt overwhelming with all the guacs, cheese, sour cream.  Stick with the tacos.  I also tried a small piece of tripe which my friend had.  Would not recommend as it has an organ taste.  I like tripes that come with the Vietnamese beef noodle soup (Pho) and dim sum but just not here because of the organ taste.  Orange bang and pina cola whipped drinks are good.  Try them."}
{"text":"10 stars if I could! I've had Asada and  Lengua...but these are by far the best tacos EVER!! Everything made fresh from the corn tortillas rolled and put on the grill and made for your tacos fresh. Location is outside the strip area but well worth the drive. Awesome prices."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best tacos I have ever had! Specifically, the spicy pork tacos!! My boyfriend and I came after a recommendation by our Airbnb host so we had high hopes. We were not disappointed! We liked it so much, we made it our last meal before we flew back! Such a must! Will definitely return if we're ever in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever ate in my whole life. It's a must going here when ever we come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love tacos. Especially from this place. Mulas are the best. The tortillas are fresh made and the al pastor is authentic. Marinated meat roasting in front of you. They have a huge selection of different meats. Tripas happens to be my favorite. The nopales are delicious with salsa and guacamole on them. Must try this place if you in Vegas. They-have a few locations the one by  freemont street isn't as crowded as the one on the strip.  They also have a few location in the San Diego area. Go eat tacos!!"}
{"text":"First timer? It'll get a little confusing ... There are separate lines for the different types of meat and for the fries. Pick the line for which meat you want most (it'll be a problem if you want different types of meat unless someone in your party is already waiting in that line). Tell them what you want for that meat (taco, mulas, quesadilla, etc). Grab your order and go to the register to the right and pay for what you ordered.

Thankfully I came with two people who had already been here and showed us the ropes! I ordered the adobada (spicy pork) quesadilla ($4). I'm pretty sure what I got was not a quesadilla. Not sure if the guy knew what he was doing? It was a taco with a small piece of crispy circular tortilla on top.. not pressed together or anything just thrown on top. We asked him what that was and he had to tell us it was the quesadilla. Very confused.. The flavors were good though. Ask for grilled onions (they give you green onions) and chili. 

Parking can be somewhat of a behind depending on when you come. Many of the parking spots in front of the other tenants have parking just for their store. We came during random hours at 2:30pm and the place was still pretty crowded."}
{"text":"Omg words can even describe how good this place is !!!!!!!!!!!!! I was in a food coma after because I ate so many tacos.
Def recommend if your looking for authentic Mexican food !!!"}
{"text":"Loveeeeeed the abodaba (spicy pork) tacos!! I highly recommend. The line is also shorter for this meat too.

The beef line was longer and my friends had to wait long after the others, who ordered other meats instead, had finished eating. Perhaps it was just that weekend we were there (EDC folk were in town)!

I would come again when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Their service is awful. So disappointed. 
I order 10 taco and try to get green onion but I was waiting 5 min to order it. 
No ones help. Don't go there."}
{"text":"Imagine tacos blessed by the gods and glazed with magical flavor crystals that explode in your mouth. That's what you get here.

I've had friends from Mexico visit here and have said these tacos are the best they've ever had.

Mandatory stop when you come to Vegas. It's worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"Ignore the low reviews; they don't know what they're talking about. Anyone who could compare this to Taco Bell is either loco or was born without taste buds. This is literally better than anything I ate at Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal, and for a fraction of the cost (and, tbh, ambiance).

Now I'm not that knowledgeable about Mexican food, and it's not one of my top 5 favorite cuisines. That said, this is the one of the few places I ever actively want to go for Mexican. In fact, I hardly eat tacos anywhere else anymore, just to save up my taco stomach for whenever we come to Vegas. (My other favorites we go to far less frequently, as they're in Santa Barbara and New Paltz, NY.) I also appreciate that this is one of the few more authentic places that offer flour tortillas to gringas like me.

My favorite tacos here are the lengua (tongue), cabeza (face/cheek), buche (pork), and al pastor with raw onions and no cilantro. I can't rank them in finer detail than that -- my favorite is whichever one is currently in my mouth (phrasing)! They each come with a different sauce they put on for you, and all of them are distinct and delicious.

I also like the queso asada with salsa and guacamole, though the asada is a bit too salty for my tastes (the salsa and guac balances out the salt a bit). I usually don't get this.

The vampiro is not for me because it's made with corn tortillas, but lucky for me the queso asada has all the same fillings. Normally I like brain (give me a Midwestern brain sandwich or Indian lamb brain curry any day) but the sesos taste kinda off to me here.

Fries (campechana fries $13; lengua fries - full order $15, half order $7.50) aren't anything special, but are huge and great for sharing.

I haven't tried the quesadillas ($4.50 with any meat except lengua or $4.75 with lengua), sopes ($4.50 with any meat except lengua or $4.75 with lengua), tostadas ($2.25 with any meat except lengua or $2.40 with lengua), or mulas ($4.50 with any meat except lengua or $4.75 with lengua).

My husband likes that you can get pretty much whole raw radishes at the condiment bar.

Drinks are the self-serve fountain variety, mostly Coke brand. I'm not a huge fan of horchata but it's of note that they have lots of flavors you don't see everywhere.

Others have explained the multi-line system so I won't go into detail, only to echo that when it's busy (in other words all the time), having to get in line multiple times to order different food and then pay for it causes your food to end up lukewarm by the time you get to eat it. My trick is to order only 2 tacos at a time, from only 1 window at a time, get into the pay line, sit and eat, and then get back up and go to the next window you wanted and repeat the process. Then simply lather, rinse, and repeat until full (5-6 trips for the two of us, but we're total pigs - YMMV). Keep in mind though that the traditional-sized tortillas used here are on the small side - no Taco Bell size tortillas here that fill you up with the carby part, and they don't put 2-3 tortillas per taco like they do at taco trucks.

Ordering them a few at a time gets you way too many napkins. We try to be considerate and stack up the clean ones and put them back so we don't waste too many.

The only downsides are the crazy multi-line ordering system, and they don't have tortas or corn smut."}
{"text":"Not my type of Mexican food but if you enjoy the home cooked flavor then I would say you may want to try this place out. Rating is based on service and experience."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall next to the Encore, there is limited parking, but most people walk to this location.  It's very busy and you need to be experienced to get what you want. It's like the Seinfeld Soup Nazi.  You have to know what line to get into for which type of food.  One line for asada, one for spicy pork and a line for the rest.  So, if you want one of each, you need to get into three lines. 

I had 4 spicy pork tacos. The meat is on the spindle like gyro meat.  It's got good flavor and they give you a lot of meat on two small street taco tortillas. They also have some homemade sauces and garnishes that make them really good.  I think they make the tortillas on the premise because I see them making them, but I can't be sure the ones I ate were from that same process.  I can't see them making every tortilla because they sell a bunch.  There is some seating indoors and a lot of table outdoors under a canopy.  I don't think I would make a special trip to eat these. I would wait in line if I happened to be the area."}
{"text":"I can't. I just can't. This place sucks. I see lots of people love it but meat is dry with no flavor.  Being raised in southern cali, I can't support everyone in vegas taste. I was looking forward to eating this food thinking reviews were accurate. Nope, not today, not tomorrow,  not ever again."}
{"text":"I used to not be a fan of Mexican food but living in Vegas it's hard not to. 

My friends and I came in craving tacos, and boy we went to the right place. Ordering was a bit confusing though because you order different things from different \"stations.\" The grilled stuff, like carne asada, you should order on the far left and the adobada line is where the giant pork leg is being shaved off, and anything else is on the other side adjacent to it. I was very lost the first time I went there. 

I got lengua, carne asada and pork adobada tacos for $2 each. They include (or you can ask for) the grilled green onions and chili's, which are freakin' awesome! The service was fast and very friendly. They help out those who are obviously having a hard time ordering (like moi). I know they have other stuff on the menu aside from tacos, but I don't pay much attention since their tacos are the main attraction. I guess I'll try their carne asada fries next time.

This place is open late, until 5am on Fri & Sat. That's why after clubbing, my friends and I go straight to this place and get our late night (early morning?) grub on."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious!  Literally are authentic!  The food is fresh! The guacamole is delicious!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Food was delicious. You have got to try the carne asada fries. Just a warning, it is always packed, and it's very fast paced. Go in knowing what you want. Also,  they have different lines for different meat. Tortilla's are made fresh right in front of you."}
{"text":"A definite stop when I'm in Vegas. I've been here on my last 3 trips to Vegas and I've never been disappointed. The meat is extremely juicy and tasty and the toppings are delicious!

What we've tried:

- Carne asada fries: Delicious! The carne asada here is insanely tender so these fries are a lot more satisfying than the carne asada fries back home.
- Carne asada tacos: I love that these tacos come with guac and pico de gallo! 
- Lengua tacos: My favorite!!! The lengua is the best meat here! So tender!
- Spicy pork tacos: I like the creamy sauce that compliments the meat. And of course, the meat is tastyyyy. Yum!

Overall, I really love the fact that the sauces are all different for each type of meat that I've tried.

Free refills on drinks which includes horchata :) Mmmm."}
{"text":"Great tacos I had the spicy pork with pineapples went very well together. Prices are amazing for taste and flavor"}
{"text":"Yooo believe the hype man!! Heard about this place being good and this and that, so me and my cousins went to go try it and OMG! This is definitely a must when your at the strip for the weekend. Especially after a night of drinking these tacos are really that good. TRUST ME"}
{"text":"this place is over hyped! seriously these tacos are NASTY!! took a trip to vegas last weekend, and damn no flavor on the tacos, not even with the salsa i cant believe people really like these tacos!! maybe they show up here all drunk and cant even distinguish the flavor!! never going back!!! if i could i would give it ZERO stars!! these are real mexican tacos! oh yeah and next morning got the stomach flu!"}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to tj tacos.  And so conveniently placed on the vegas strip"}
{"text":"Most authentic tacos outside of Mexico. 
Nevertheless, #SrGORDO please fix your ordering system. Long lines ruin the experience."}
{"text":"Meh! It was ok... The tortillas were good the meat was mediocre. Nothing to special in my opinion"}
{"text":"The line for this place is ridiculous & it is hard to find seating.

Price for tacos isn't bad but it adds up very quickly.

The food is pretty good though... They usually give you 2 corn tortillas per taco but I think it tastes better with just 1.

Not having 2 tortillas makes it hard not to rip the tortilla.

I would rather go to Robertos because of the long wait"}
{"text":"So freaking good and inexpensive too! Best tacos in vegas!!! ...you know it's gonna be good when the menu is in Spanish with smaller English translation underneath.  :) SO YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Can I just say wow? The abodaba is delicious. Everything on the menu is good. The lines are ridiculous but worth the wait. Table space is limited because its so delicious. The staff are really friendly. They see a lot of drunk messes but they're still really nice.The lengua and cabeza are super tender. The taco just melts in your mouth.  I come here every trip. It would be the true sin if you come to sin city and not come to this place."}
{"text":"Could not come to Vegas without making a pit stop here! Kids loved it, and so did I! It brings back memories of my childhood trips to Mexico and visiting the corner taco stands!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints ! I have eaten AT the other locations and every one is delicious.  Service is really fast, but make sure u are in the right line for the type of meat u want."}
{"text":"The lines are super long, but it's worth the wait. I had adobada fries, an al pastor taco and like 1/4 of an al pastor mula. The food was great! The fries were not like any I've had before! The guacamole is super creamy! Delish! I didn't like that the lines are separated by meat type. It restricts you to really only getting one type of meat/food instead of a variety. We also had to eat in our car since the place was so packed and there wasn't a place to sit. If you come, prepare for a long wait."}
{"text":"Tacos are tasty. Nothing exaggerating good. Lines are always crazy long here. Having to order from multiple lines for diff meat types not a plus. Have to say this place is really clean. Better than other tacos el gordo on charleston. Bigger place with more seating. After night out good spot for that late taco hunger crave."}
{"text":"The line set-up is a bit confusing but the food was delicious! They handled the busy lunch crowd with ease."}
{"text":"This place is overrated! They are your average tacos. Being from LA the quality of these tacos is nowhere compared to our taco places in LA. Nice selection of tacos and no torta/burrito. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Omg love their tacos  Best tacos ever. So authentic so legit taste amazing no wonder the line is always so long. If you're looking for legit Mexican tacos this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Speechless. Tacos melt in your mouf and keep you waiting in line for seconds and thirds!! Get Sum!"}
{"text":"Awful. The line is ridiculous and the tacos are awful. It seems very dirty and the wait is endless. My wife and I decided to try them since everyone is constantly talking about how delicious they are but we were so disappointed. There is no where to sit, so packed, the line is literally out the door and overpriced for tiny tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos el gordo. Estilo tijuana. No se equivocaron el lugar aparte de ser un caos total. Ya que ay 3 diferentes lineas para ordenar solo lo que dice el cartel y si quieres un taco diferente al que estas en linea ay que hacer otros 30 minutos para ordenar algo diferente. Se trajeron todo de tijuana incluyendo lo sucio del local. La manera de no saber hacer bien las cosas. Como no saber organizar el servicio al cliente. Aparte los tacos son comunes y corrientes. Tambien el servicio. Si vienes de fuera y quieres pasar Medio dia para ordenar. Y media Hora para comer algo que no vale la pena. Te recomiendo tacos el gordo en las vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Tacos El Gordo but this one really let me down. They were extremely stingy with everything, especially the meats. The Tacos El Gordo's in SD are way better, I'm not sure why the quality control is so lacking here. I ordered 12 tacos and meats in each taco were sparse and the sauces/guac were super unevenly distributed (some tacos were drenched while others barely had anything on them). I'm paying over 2 dollars for each taco and I'm from LA where you can get amazing $1 tacos with more substance. Thoroughly unimpressed since I went out of my way to come here and loved the other stores I've been to. Also I asked for some chiles and was literally given one single chile, despite the fact that I bought 12 tacos. I asked for more (I was very polite) and the worker gave me insane attitude and gave me the smallest burnt chile. I will never come back to this location, it's a waste of money."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada tacos and they were good except that the meat was over cooked. I wish the avacado was chunky rather than puréed. For $2 each taco, I would recommend it. It was very packed in there and no where to sit so I had to eat standing up. You have to order your food at the window where they cook the food and you pay at the register."}
{"text":"Hands down, best tacos ever!!  This place gets really busy and it can get very confusing if you don't know what you're doing.  There are 4 stations, 3 of them serve different kinds of meat, and the last station closest to the cashier is where you can ask for grilled veggies such as green onion/peppers. 

1. Pick your meat
2. Find the line
3. Get a tray & tell 'em what you want!
(if you want a different meat, go to the next line and repeat)
Simple as that :) 

After ordering tacos, be sure to hit up the last station (usually a lady is working it) and ask for grilled veggies, it's free and goes great with the tacos! 
The cashier holds the salsa hostage in her mini fridge, so let her know how many red and/or green salsa you want after paying. 

I've probably had almost every meat on the menu, but my favorite will always be adobada, it's spicy pork marinated in pineapple.  You can also ask for pineapple on top of your adobada taco.  

Campechana fries is a mix of carne asada & adobada.  It's not on the menu, but you can order half orders of their fries for $5!  For a half order, it's still HUGE!  

I usually get 2 tacos ($2/taco) for myself and a half order of campechana fries to share.  Happy belly and happy wallet!"}
{"text":"My colleagues recommended this place so I had to stop by to check it out!

This place is a dream for taco lovers but for firt time people, navigating the restaurant and ordering the food can be a bit confusing as you will noticed 3 different queues and they can be very long.

So after scanning through the menu posted overhead, the first question to ask is what do you want to get because it's important to be in the right queue (one is stricly campechana and pork, another is beef, chorizo, mulas, sopes and the third is cabeza, tripa, lengua),  as the lines can be long or stay on one and ordered whatever you want from that one.

After getting all of your food, take it to the cashiers which are located on the other corner of the restaurant and pay for the food and the drinks there. The cashier will give you the cups for the drinks.

I got the taco de asada and the cabeza and just loved them - so delicious! The complimentary grilled onion and japapeno they offered also paired well with the tacos and who can complain about the added radishes and lime! Great meal at the amazing price - I look forward to returning for more next time!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! These tacos are seriously so dam good. From the tortilla, to the perfectly seasoned meats, the flavorful salsa that has that kick!  Bomb.com every time we're in town this is a must have.  Regardless of the wait time we are having these tacos."}
{"text":"I'm throwing out a lot of 5 star reviews lately, but I think they are deserving.  The tacos were legit, spicy pork was the best. 

Order from the station that is serving what you want, there are several stations and there is some overlap of what you can get from each one.  The guy who greeted us who was working behind the counter was really helpful.  He was also patient, b/c it took us a while to figure things out and to order.  Lucky for us there was no line (we also lucked out with parking).

We ate here sober fyi, I can only imagine that this place would be even better if you were drunk.

I really like the tortillas and the sauce and you can ask for grilled green onions and peppers for free.

Also if you want to be fancy and also enjoy your taco more, ask for some pineapple on top.  It is such a tasty bonus!

The dining area was clean and they did a great job wiping down tables, taking trays etc.  They had a good system going.  They also had a bathroom and the sink was outside the bathroom which was helpful.  After eating, I had to wash my hands and was glad I didn't have to wait in line for the bathroom just to do that.

The tacos are also affordable and provide a good value.  You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is maybe a 5 minute walk from the Wynn/Encore.  Safe to say I always stagger on over after spending the night at XS.

There are multiple lines once you get in, there are signs that will say what meat is being prepared in what line.  I typically go get in the Lengua taco line because its always the shortest.  The al pastor or abodabo tacos are also amazing.  The abodabo fries are SO BOMB.  They have some delicious avocado/sour cream sauce all over.  The lengua tacos and carne asada tacos are also very good.  

They have an awesome salsa bar with plenty of limes, salsa, pickled carrots etc.  The soda machine has some awesome selections like pina and horchota!

You order at the food prep line and get to watch the guys make your food fresh!  Sometimes you'll wait on the side for the fries.  But all the food is made fresh!  You can see all the meat cooking its delicious grease and the al pastor rotating on its spiket. After you get your food, you walk to the front of the store to pay at the cashier.

Seating can look intimidating because there are always so many people but people turn in and out pretty quickly.  They have a couple employees that are hovering around to clean your table immediately after which definitely helps keep things moving.

Definitely come here!"}
{"text":"The Bomb, Bomb, Bomb Diggity!  This place has the absolute best tacos I have ever had.  I'm from Chicago and I thought we had some pretty awesome Mexican food there.  After trying Los Gordos in Las Vegas, the tacos here in Chicago just don't measure up.  Freshly made tortillas are amazing.  The adobada is to die for.  Carne Asada is good.  If you're looking to try something different, try the Cabeza (so tender and delicious) or the Suadero (slow cooked Beef shoulder).  They give you grilled green onions and peppers with every order, which is a huge delicious plus.  I can't wait to be in Vegas again for these tacos!"}
{"text":"i just made my way back from Vegas and like the blackjack table and the pool, i had to make my way to tacos el gordo.  still the best tacos i've ever had and not very far from the strip (a block past Encore).  This place is simply a must try for anyone who even remotely likes tacos or authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best meal we have had on the strip !!!! We have heard of the great tacos best el pastor unless your in Mexico!! El pastor was the bomb!!!! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Yes my tacos craving was satisfied....but before that ...I was at the line for 40 mins. It was my first time so I dont know where to go I fall in the wrong line but good thing the guy said he will just give me my order,which was in the other side....tacos are amazing ..Carney asada fries too."}
{"text":"Being from California we've had all kinds of Mexican food so with all the great reviews we were expecting this to be up there with some of the best. Between the four of us we had a mixture of different items. Everyone agreed the carne asada was pretty plain even with all the toppings. The al pastor was down right though! Perfect flavor and moist. A cilantro sauce on top was really good. All in all the place is good but a little expensive for just tacos."}
{"text":"Ever since the location next to Wynn closed down, this location is always PACKED. Yes, loyal taco fans, Tacos El Gordo is an absolute MUST HAVE if you're in town. It isn't too far from the strip so if you have a car, please do bother to take the drive down here. If not, you are definitely missing out!

Warning: you will leave smelling like tacos so don't come in after a fresh shower... Also your fingers will have the taco scent lingering for like the next 7 hours. 

The menu is priced at $2 or $2.50 per taco depending on what you order. You grab a tray, go, and order. On a normal hungry day, I can eat about 7-8 tacos. 

I highly recommend ordering the adobada (aka \"spicy pork\" -- not really that spicy at all, actually) and ask for pineapples on the side. I eat it with the pineapple and it is sooooo good! I do this by ripping pieces of pineapple and just dropping it on the taco lol. I've noticed if they see you add something to the tip jar, most of the time they'll add the pineapple & extras without you even asking ;)

In addition to that, the classic asada (steak) is always spot on! I've explored all the other tacos such as the lengua but it didn't tickle my fancy. Every time I come here, I now only get the adobada and asada. 

The fries are also HUGE. We have shared the fries between 4 people while also eating some tacos. I also enjoy the quesadillas they make here!

I have been to Tacos el Gordo so many times.. And every single time I leave stuffed and satisfied. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best. Tacos. Ever. Fresh tortillas. The only negative is the long wait, but it is well worth it! Never thought I'd find tacos this good in the U.S."}
{"text":"One of those places that deceive you on the outside and is amazing on the inside. A definite go to place for the taco lover!"}
{"text":"The line was INSANELY long at 11:30pm on a Saturday. I only had time to get the adobado tacos (since we were rushing to get into Encore for the rest of the night), and boy was I amazed. Just from the first bite, I knew I should have gotten more... My friends all couldn't resist taking a bite out of my tacos and they were all so pleasantly surprised. Thus we were all disappointed that I had not gotten more. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to come back before the end of our Vegas trip. But you bet I'll come back here again next time!"}
{"text":"$65 spent at Bacchanal buffet did not compare to the $2 al pastor taco I had here during my Vegas trip. I had these delivered at 1am to my hotel so they were kind of soggy but still soo good!! Hands down one of the best tacos I've had to date!"}
{"text":"Amazing carne asada tacos. ordered 4 to get full. $2 each, not bad. 

Pork is good too.

tortillas are freshly made by hand there.

Friendly cashier lady.

On my Vegas trips I rather eat here than anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Happy Drinko De Mayo, which means \"drink the mayonnaise.\" ? :|

I found myself having dinner out last night and spending this day fox-holed in a bunker because I'm in a town where there's a large... element of celebration whose highlights are at 11:00, our version of L.A. Lite after the Lakers win the Championship.

So, I wasn't able to go to Taco El Gordo, but it certainly was foremost on my mind. I felt like I was cheating on my date by dreaming of the accommodating, doting and comforting restaurant I made hot monkey dinner with weeks ago. 

Admittedly, the first time I went PAST?? Gordo was with trepidation. The place where the now legend resides is a place where a couple of businesses ago, I got to go out with the first (of 4, so far) Vegas bartenders I had gone out with. The location tanked after construction halted on Echel-outofluck. (Construction workers also gott busted for drinking during lunch). So businesses got a rep of not lasting long near the intersection.

Nearby, if you can't stay in business selling espresso & cwof-fee in lingerie, that's tough times depression. Even the jewel of Baker, Ca. The Mad Greek couldn't survive at this very location. (They did better at a couple of off strip locations).

But this last time I was near, there were lines OUT the door. And this was not one line but 6 wide in the building. And there wasn't 1 pissed off person in the place, we were all salivating over the smells of the grill like zombies surrounding a chess competition (BRAAIINS). 

The tacos looked great, but honestly, I've had those before at other places. When I find a special restaurant, I want the big sampler for variety. There wasn't really one, so I decided to get the largest thing on the menu, the carne asada fries. And normally the few times I eat meat, I get chicken. But since the beef wasn't ground, I got that. As delicious as the spicy pork looked being sliced off the gorgeous hunk of rotating abodada, pork always celebrates a little too much and pisses off my stomach's downstairs neighbors.

And then, AND THEN, as if that weren't enough, I got something to drink and not only found horchataaaaaah, which I love, but also a long lost friend beckoned from the past that I had not seen in decades: ORANGE BANG, the bastard cousin of the Orange Whip, also on the endangered list. Give to World Wildlife Fund generously to save or stun, tag and monitor the mating habits of these beautiful beasts.

So I got carne asada fries. As much as I would love yelp to have a MotherF'er button I know it would get abused, but here it's quite applicable. The benches outside were rightfully packed, so I plopped unceremoniously on the astroturf putting green they had nearby. I positioned myself as to where I could see the most women standing in limos hollering WOOOO as I could see. 

There I was sitting, looking at my dinner, actually star struck. I think pictures of food are helpful on yelp, but the actual process of taking pics of your food is odd and strange. Take pics of your food like no one's watching? And yet there I was taking pics, reciting \"this is my carne asada fries. There are many others like it, but this one is mine to devour until I am picking bits of it out of my eyebrows.\"

I took before and aftermath pics of the carnage of disheveled paper and styro goods. I was full 2/3's of the way, so I sat for awhile and then resumed until I finished every rigoddamn delicious fry and bit of veg there was. 

There are 4 other mexican food places I love in all of Vegas. But this one had the best first impression of them all! Enjoy it now before a corporation buys them out and homogenizes them!

I didn't feel competent enough to tackle the Campechana, largely because I didn't see anyone else get it, out of all those people? But someday I will get down on that. Someday.."}
{"text":"Every time I travel to Vegas, this place is top of my list to eat at.  Great tacos (made to order), great prices ($2 each - get 3!  no get 4, no get 5!) fabulous selection  (brains, stomach, tripe, you name it!).  What's not to LOVE LOVE LOVE."}
{"text":"So delicious! Authentic tacos and the BEST el pastor tacos I've ever had.  Slower during the week but can get crowded on the weekends. The lines can be long but I am telling you it is worth the wait and drive. 

Wish there was one in the Henderson/Paradise area!! Although it is probably for the best that there isn't because I would have tacos everyday!! !"}
{"text":"After Baker to Vegas this weekend, my husband and I hit this place up for a good and cheap dinner.  We were covered in dust and looked like desert rats, but the mixture of clientele at Tacos El Gordo was less than judgmental and I felt quite welcome.

The restaurant (on a Saturday night around 8ish) was brightly lit and chaotic with patrons.  The long lines meant a long wait, especially for adobada, which is much, much better than the carne asada, which is good but not great.  

The homemade tortillas are about the size of your palm.  A taco with everything comes with meat, onions, cilantro, lime, salsa and a smooth avocado sauce that wasn't exactly guacamole.  I also had a quesadilla, which is the same thing as a taco but with good white cheese stuck to the tortilla and a fried tortilla on top.  

Order your tacos first, then go pay at the cashier to get your cups for drinks.  There's a soda machine and an horchata machine, the kind with the happy face logo that says \"Ole!\"

The fries with meat (carne asada, adobada, or a mixture of the two which is called campechana, I think) is a three-pound box filled with everything your cardiologist doesn't want you to eat.  Cheese, fries, crema, meat.  You can share this among four people and you will probably still not finish it.

Tacos are two dollars each.  A meal with a drink will be about $10-12 dollars, which is a lot for a taco joint.

However, the people watching is first-rate.  Besides Mexican families and the occasional adventurous Midwesterner, customers include hotel workers, drunken frat boys, and honest-to-goodness prostitutes.  At the table next to ours, there was a lively and profanity-spangled discussion in Spanish about the true definition of a chilango.  On the patio, a group of young men in their early-twenties with matching vests and threaded eyebrows fortified themselves before a night of what would no doubt be the liberal distribution of rohypnol.  All of these people and more you will find at the Las Vegas Strip Tacos El Gordo.  All united in taco solidarity.  This is a good place."}
{"text":"Everyone wants to know, is it worth it? That's the big question here. You see that long line up and you're thinking, do I want to stand in that just for some tacos? Well, ask yourself a few questions. Do you have to be somewhere? Do you mind standing in whatever weather it is at that moment? Do you have patience? Are you drunk, hungry, and just don't care but wanting to get down on some greasy yet yummy food? Do you come from a place that has plenty of mean street tacos available?

I've come to known Tacos El Gordo from their San Diego, Cali locations. From Tijuana, Mexico, to California, and now Nevada. These guys are definitely making a name for themselves across the border. We rolled up on a Friday evening, probably around 7:30-8pm. That was our mistake. It's as if we were waiting in line for the new roller coaster at an amusement park. My buddy who went to the store next door around 6pm said there was practically no line around that time. About an hour ish later, the hungry mob decided to pounce on the scene for dinner. We should've came earlier...

The ratchet crew of 9 homies were hungry and wanted some good ol' tacos. Good thing was that we had some rooms at Encore, which is literally right across the street. For those of you staying in Encore, Wynn, even Palazzo, or Venetian, this place is a short walk. For you inebriated post-club folks who just partied at one of Steve Wynn's venues, Tacos El Gordo is within stumbling/crawling distance. On Fridays and Saturdays, they close up shop around 4am. Keep that in mind just in case you get carried away, falling in love in the club and time is just whizzing by. Other nights, I believe they close their doors around 2am.

The lineup situation is a little weird. It's not difficult to figure out, but is it efficient? When you get passed the front glass doors, look for the signs above each station. Depending on the kind of meat/cuts, that is what will be available at that particular station. For example, the far left station had pork cuts. To the right were the beef options. There's another station around the corner too. If you want pork, then figure out what form you want it in and how many of it you want. Send someone else to another line to get the beef. You can cross order from the same station. Sorry, there's no chicken or vegetarian options here. It's all pork or beef. If you're getting quite the number of items, make sure to grab an orange tray. Sometimes there's plenty of it and sometimes their rare as $h!t to find. If you're by yourself and you want everything on the darn menu, you're practically screwed and will have a joyful time lining up in every single line they got. So don't come solo when it's busy!

After you finally get all the food you want, you walk to the other side of the glass doors to pay. There you can order any non-alcoholic drinks. Practically only fountain drinks and some of the known aqua frescas stuff. For horchata lovers like myself, it's available and it's all self-served, refills A-OKAY all day. Being that it was a full house and I decided to get into two separate lines for food plus paying and getting my drink. I think the entire process took well over an hour by the time I was able to finally consume my tacos. As much as I love tacos, it's quite a long time for just tacos. Sure, the food here is enjoyable. However, if you have to wait that long for everything, besides trying to find a table and if you're rolling deep or kind of drunk, it can get old real fast. 

The carne was probably my favorite while the boys loved the pork options. I waited extra in the around the corner line for some suadero and that was kind of a letdown. Besides tacos, you can get quesadillas, fries, sopes, mulas, and tostadas with the same available meat options. If you have the patience or if there's no line, then definitely give this infamous taco spot a shot. There's no hurt in trying it out. It's double the price of the street tacos I'm use to in LA, but it's definitely cheaper than many of the dining options in the fancy hotels that are located nearby. Personally, I'll only cruise through when the lines aren't so long or when I'm hammered and don't have any concept of time."}
{"text":"Too salty. Was looking forward to eating at this place but I did not like it. Carne asada was overcooked and way too salty, I couldn't finish my food. Tacos al pastor were not good either. Hubby said the food was just ok. The service was good."}
{"text":"I love places that just do a few things and do them very well. Tacos El Gordo only does beef and pork for their proteins and fries for their side, no fish or chicken and no rice & beans. Rather than trying to offer everything under the sun, they do what they do and are truly masters of their craft. 

They have highly skilled personnel at multiple stations, each carving or slicing a different beef or pork variation. The person tending each station is a master of their craft. They are the best authentic taco joint in Vegas."}
{"text":"Bomb Pastor. Everytime I'm in Vegas I gotta stop here. My top 2 Taco Spots right next to King Taco on 3rd Street in East LA. I always order Tacos de Pastor with grilled onions on the side. Beware of the confusing lines. I try taking people here and the lines are always the downfall, also the \"paying after you get your food process\" but why in a rush guy?"}
{"text":"Food: I absolutely love street tacos and I have no idea what El Gordo's doing but what ever they're doing don't stop the goodness! It really doesn't get better than this. Taco's El Gordo definitely sets the bar high. I've tasted tacos close to the border of Mexico in San Diego and all over Los Anegeles but none can compare to the flavors of El Gordo. 

Drinks: You have your selection of Soda's and tea's but also you have Mexican soda's and lets not leave out the horchata. 

Atmosphere: It's High school cafeteria style. You stand in line order what you want and then you go and pay at the cashier. Simple as that. This location has tables inside and out. The outdoor patio makes you feel like you're really in Tijuana Mexico. 

Tips: Keep in mind what line you stand in, they have different lines for different tacos with different cuts of meat. Also this place is located on the strip so expect Late night diners that I call \"drunkeats\"."}
{"text":"We loved this place when we could go to it on the Strip....drove all the way out yesterday at 2 PM to get tacos....could literally NOT get in the door. Gave up and ate at Pepe's Tacos but will be trying Gordo's again."}
{"text":"Food was good but the process of getting it was a cluster.. especially if you had never been there before and did not know what to do.  Read all the signs so you don't stand in th wrong line for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Have you have been B-Slapped by a taco?  No?  Then you haven't got down at Tacos El Gordo.  There is no way in hell a So Calian would ever roll east on Charleston, look at that tiny beat down location, and say \"oh yeah, I've got to stop here.\"  Not gunna happen.

Thanks to Yelp, we got the inside scoop.  There's only one mission you should have - open the door, walk in 5 steps to the inverted meat cone of spicy pork, and ask for quatro tacos while you point to the hanging pineapple being devoured by crimson death delight.  You will require nothing else.

Almost no one spoke English, which was friggin awesome.  I knew, right away, I was in the right place.  Ask to try the meat, and as their machete carves slivers of pig that had been dipped in love, rolled through crack, and gently slapped on the a$$, you'll find yourself slurping back an eighteen inch string of drool.  Go ahead, and try it.  You'll be licking the little Styrofoam saucer, looking like you've never set foot in a Mexican restaurant before.  Tongue hits juicy goodness, eyes open wide, and you look to your bro on the left and silently mouth \"WTF?!\"

Those tacos are just stupid.  Who ever created that spicy pork taco should be dubbed King of Anything the Looks Like a Taco."}
{"text":"Great place, Really enjoyed the food hear the place is packed but the Waite is well 
worth it. the food is so authentic and good for sure the best tacos in Vegas!  i am defiantly coming back and bringing the fam."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB!! So glad they have one here, even tho I'm not from LV I'm glad I have a bomb mexican joint to go to! The one and only dish that I salivate over is the al pastor MULA!!! It's a bit expensive here vs in Mexico, (duh).. But I don't care! So frikkn good! The melted cheese, the flavor of the al pastor and of everything else is so good! The line for the al pastor line says it all since it's the longer one and never gets short! The place itself is in the old side of Vegas but so worth the drive to the outskirts. Definitely visiting this place everytime I come to LV!"}
{"text":"Busy just like any other day. The guy cutting the carne asada was just chopping away with meat flying in every direction it was sloppy. The guy at the al pastor side was serving the meat beyond undercooked and gross. It's almost like he didn't know how to tell if meat was cooked or not. Definitely not a good visit this time around"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a restaurant where there's lines for every protein they serve: Carne Asada, Adobada, and Lengua I think??

YAY:
- meats are grilled perfectly
- friendly staff
- the security guard looked delicious
- they go on the road less traveled: adobada fries and lengua fries! Or Campechana fries (half-and-half asada and adobada)

OH HELL NO:
- no salsa station (you have to ask the guy behind the grill for cute little cups of salsas)
- drive-thru was closed at night
- it's not open 24/7
- where was the line for \"Latin Boy Meat?\" I would've been the first one in line!!

Definitely recommended if you get tired of Roberto's and also if you wanna try something different from the usual Carne Asada fries."}
{"text":"A co worker told me about this spot before I came to Vegas. We love tacos so of course we had to try them! It's a small place in a shopping area next to the Riviera. We ordered the asada and adobada tacos. The asada tacos were ok, tortillas were freshly made right in front of you but, the meat didn't have too much flavor. The adobada tacos were so yummy! Full of flavor! I would definitely recommend the adobada tacos! Be prepared to wait bc the lines are long!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Amazing quick food. Nice people. Additionally it was a treat to eat at a great place in Las Vegas and not pay ridiculous prices."}
{"text":"I was so hyped when everyone told me you have to try the best tacos ever since this place is from TJ, first and foremost I've lived in Houston and now in LA where there are a abundance of taco stands everywhere and nowhere does this place compare to some of the places I've had in LA specifically avenue 26 taco in Lincoln heights, this place was packed, you line up for the specific type of meat you want which was pretty cool seeing them cook and make it infront of you

Was craving a quesadilla and let me tell you, this isn't what I thought it was, maybe this is more authentic but basically it's a fried taco shell with cheese and meat where the shell was burnt and barely any cheese, it was totally gross and not what I wanted, we got 5 other taco meats and lengua was by fair the best, the rest was nothing special compared to you run around taco trunks and it's $2.25 for each taco which is kind of pricy compared to the $1.50 tacos I get in LA. Oh yea and they didn't have AC when it was friggin 110 outside.....common on now, I can tell this used to be a Wendy's or some fast food stand so I know there must have been ac before....skip the lines and hype and go somewhere else cause this place was a disappointment...."}
{"text":"Visited Tacos El Gordo last Saturday at 11 AM. The place was already packed and the security guard lady was already giving people directions on how to order their tacos (unheard of if you go to the Tijuana location). The lines were not very clear and the menu was hard to see because of the décor hanging from the ceiling.

I had my usual, tacos de carne asada. They looked and tasted legit! So the wait was worth it. Corn tortillas were handmade, salsa and guacamole on point and asada cooking over fire. I truly enjoyed my tacos and wished I had order 6 instead of just 4. I was very disappointed that they didn't have Mexican Coca-Cola or Fanta. They only have canned sodas and a fountain drink machine. Tacos were $2.25 each and the fountain drink was $2.00 (cheapest meal on the strip I tell you).

***

Decided to come back on Sunday before heading back home. Well, they say they open at 9 AM, but in reality they didn't start serving people until 9:30 Am ( I waited about 45 minutes outside...the smell of the asada I tell you). When we finally got to order I ordered 5 asada tacos, well I noticed that the guacamole was missing, so I asked where is the guac? The taco man replied \"we don't have any until the evening.\" I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that they did not have an essential ingredient on their tacos yet again they still charged me full price. 

After a mixed experience, here is a rundown of my review and suggestions for the owner:

- Food: Come over in the evening for tacos. I will never come at opening time, they were not ready to serve their clients. The wait is worth it later in the day when the tacos will be served with all the ingredients. Owner: Make sure you got EVERYTHING ready for your customers at opening time.

- Service: The women who work behind the cash register and the cleaning ladies, they were pretty cold, no smile, no \"how you doing?\" The taquero, no smile, but hey, thanks for making me some delish tacos.

- Location: Not enough area to sit inside/outside. I understand that it gets super crowded inside, therefore, have something like a long bar table area outside. I don't mind eating tacos standing up, but at least have a surface where I can put my plate and drink while I eat.

The way they separate the ordering areas by meat...please get rid of this. It causes confusion and unnecessary extra long lines for one type of taco. Instead, open at least three stations that serve all type of tacos, mulitas, etc. Also, don't have the security lady directing people where to go. I witnessed her running people out of the place by telling them that the line for asada was too long. Instead, have her do her job of making sure people don't steal tacos or get into a fight only. Also, clear the menu view...we get it, we love Mexico, but having \"banderitas\" hanging all over the place? obstructing the menu? not cool.

Overall, I will return next time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but I felt I had to so that no one else will waste their time and money here. 

Quite possibly the worst taco place I have ever eaten. First of all, you have to stand in a specific line depending on what kind of meat you want. So if I stand in the Carne Asada line for ten minutes then have to stand in the Adobada line for another ten minutes, my Carne tacos are now twenty minutes cold. God forbid if I want lengua. That's thirty minutes. Then I have to stand in line to pay. Wtf. Who the hell thought of this stupid idea?

Now for the food. Eew. The cook put the non-marinaded Carne Asada on the grill with wood charcoal as the heating source. Not even salted or seasoned. And who cooks Carne Asada over a wood burning grill? This meat had more smoke flavor then a bbq joint. And I love wood smoked  bbq. I have never in my life had street tacos with this flavor. So gross we couldn't finish our food. 

The Adobada (their version of Pastor) was flavorless as well. They don't even have a salsa bar. I asked for red salsa on the side and the lady, who was standing less than two feet from the container of red salsa said I had to ask the guy making the Adobada tacos. I stood there for a few minutes as he was too busy and decided F this place. 

It is completely mind boggling how many people like this place, but it was gross. These people obviously never had King Taco before like back home in Southern California. Put a King Taco across the street from this place and you will see people switching over."}
{"text":"Los mejores tacos que he comido en USA. Definitivamente la carne  adobada no sabe a adobada ni al pastor. Mejor pedir vampiros o sopes, yo los pedí de asada y estaban muy ricos. La carne es realmente asada (con carbon)."}
{"text":"Los tacos de Adobada, parece que son al pastor por que los tienen en un trompo, pero no saben a Pastor ni a Adobada. Los vampiros y los sopes me encantaron! La carne asada en verdad es asada al carbón."}
{"text":"\"DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH\" - That's what I have in mind when I first tried this place...

and I KNEW I was RIGHT! (when my mouth was already filled with Carne Asada Fries)

First timer? Don't be intimidated. If you don't know how to speak Spanish, I'm sure you won't even bother worrying about it since their menu is listed at the top and all you need to do is utter your best Latin impression lol

In my opinion, they got the best carne asada fries in the form of \"Adobada Fries\" found on their menu. They got the best authentic selection of Mexican food. You know its Mexican when El Gordos' parking has a small number of vacant spot than what Del Taco has on the other side lol.

Their $2.00 plate is good too! I haven't tried their Quesadillas yet but I will after this review. I will update you how that turn out for me."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, Quesadillas etc...

A must stop if going downtown (from the strip)."}
{"text":"Best tacos al pastor.  The only problem with this place is the strange organization. There is one line for al pastor.   One line for other types of tacos.  And another line for others.   Then a different line to pay.  So if you want a taco al pastor, and a carne asada taco, a taco de buche, and pay, you have 4 lines and by the time you pay, your food is cold.   Thus, I order only al pastor and avoid the other lines."}
{"text":"Just picked up three tacos (\"with everything\"):
1) Adobada with pineapple - YUM!!
2) Chorizo - YUM!!
3) Asada - won't get again. Flavor wasn't there, and the meat was gristly. Blech.

The tacos didn't travel well, so I wouldn't get them to go.

If I'm hungry and in the neighborhood, I'd stop in. Wouldn't drive across town for these, though."}
{"text":"These tacos are amazingly good. Best food in Vegas. My only gripes are that it's hard to find a table on the weekend and they separate the super long lines according to the different meats they have! So if you want different tacos good luck!!"}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting some \"above average customer service\" because it's a super cheap option on the Vegas strip! Tacos are about $2.25 each and they're as authentic as it gets. Free parking (private lot), it's walking distance to and from Encore. Do yourself a favor and look at the pictures on Yelp (including the menu) and decide what you want ahead of time, and know which line to go into because:

A) they don't slow down for anyone 
B) they can't hear you most of the time because it's loud in there (behind the counter AND in the seating area) 
C) It goes fast, even if the lines are out the door.

The only thing is the line - which will likely determine if it's worth it to go. If the line is SUPER LONG, out the door, and it's hella hot outside, I'm going to skip it just because they have limited indoor seating (and hell to the no I'm not sitting outside to eat). Just saying!"}
{"text":"Great tacos in the heart of LV. There can be a long wait, but can you blame them for being popular?"}
{"text":"The tripas was to die for. It was so crunchy. We liked the carne asada, al pastor, and cabeza. They give a pretty big amount and each taco was 2.25. The carne asada fries was packed with meat, about $11 I think and it comes with guacamole. The only thing is, In order to get your taco, you have to wait in specific lines for each meat. By the time you're done ordering, your other tacos get cold while you're waiting in line to get more tacos."}
{"text":"What's not to like about legit Mexican tacos?  We've been to the Tacos El Gordo locations in Tijuana, MX and San Diego, CA, and this location is no different in quality and taste.

Ordered the asada, pastor, and cabeza tacos.  You can't go wrong with any of these.

Only negative part was the price.  It's more than double compared to TJ, but hey, you're in Vegas, right?"}
{"text":"Located in a sketchy place a little north of the Wynn, these authentic tacos are satisfying whether it's lunch, dinner, or after the club at 4am. We came on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was literally packed with Spanish speakers so that's always a very promising sign. Due to the crowds, it can be confusing as to how to place your order. But there are different lines for each type of meat. (Adobada- spicy pork was in a line by itself all the way on the left). Have a friend stand in each line and order in bunches.

As a group, we got carne asada fries, adobada, chorizo, and asada tacos. I think the asada was just ok on the tacos and the fries, and next time definitely get the adobada tacos. The spicy pork has so much flavor and the right amount of heat and watching them slice off each piece gave the reassurance of its quality. Chorizo also had a ton of flavor. I would definitely place Chorizo and Adobada above Asada.

Also, they had this fountain drink that was some whipped Orange Cream soda that was delicious. Nuff said, tacos don't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Oh my GOD! By far the best Tacos I have ever had !!! We had several including the beef brain. You have to get over the idea that it's brain and try it. Absolutely sublime !!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I think this place is overrated, but I can see why a lot of people would love this place:  90% of the people dining here are drunk and/or have never had authentic mexican fare before.  

I ordered their horchata, adobada taco, asada taco, lengua taco, and carne asada fries.  All of them came out promptly!  The asada taco was really dry, lengua was okay, and the adobada was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Carne asada fries were super greasy and mostly had fat pieces in there.  Horchata was sweet and is made from syrup - so it's not homemade, but I enjoyed their free refills!  Their salsas were watered down, so that was also a fail.

Overall rating is OK for the experience, but not the food.  If you aren't from California, I think you will LOOOOVE this place. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We came here during lunch time. Very busy. Smelled so good! We got a bunch of carne asada tacos and horchata. We decided to eat outside because it was nice out. I forgot to get sauce so I went back in and I kinda looked like a lost puppy. this employee came up to me (I wish I got his name) asked if I needed anything and I was like \"can I have some sauce?\" So he told me to ask the guy at the window. I walked over to the window and within 2 seconds I turned around and he goes \"here ya go!\" with a handful of sauces. Mind you it was really busy in there. To me I notice the little things and this made me think wow they really care about their customers. Excellent customer service. Now to the food. I really really liked the tortilla they use. It was different. The meat was delicious and so was this sauce I believe it was salsa or something. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"The food is just amazing here, very authentic and amazing. It was a bit hectic as they only want you to order certain tacos in certain lines. I recommend you only come here with another person so you are able to decide a conqueror. I had the Asada tacos because those are amazing and the wife ordered el pastor and she thought they were awesome. I liked that they had an area with limes because that will make every taco so amazing. We arrived around 11 am and the line was long took about 25 minuets to order, when we left the lines were out the door probably a 45 minute wait, but so worth it. If you are in Vegas and want to eat some amazing tacos you really need to make some time for these. The wife and I highly recommend them! Enjoy!!!!


Ps they also have Asada fries that looked amazing."}
{"text":"Yelped this place before coming here and it seems like an authentic Mexican taco shop. Came here during the summer, it was hot and thankfully the line was not long, waited about 30-45 min outside then went in and had to wait for another 20-30min (at least in the asada line). They have their lines divided, starting from left to right: adobado/pastor meat, asada was the next line (they longest waiting line), then all other meat: tripa, tongue. After getting your food, you have to walk to the cashier table near the exit to pay for your food and then sit down. This place is very busy and gets really pack so seats are minimal for big groups. My group and I was lucky to find enough seats for 10ppl. Service was ok, food was flavorful and tasty. Also they had fountain drinks available and I thought their horchata was freshly made thinking that this is from Tijuana Mexico, but it was not so this was the only disappointment. In addition, their quesadilla is NOT like the American quesadilla so don't expect it that way- its more like a large taco. Overall, this was a great experience and good was great with lots of meat! I would come here again. 

Tip: have someone in your party to find seat while the others order your food"}
{"text":"Carne asada is cooked well. My only complaint is the spice level of the salsa they put on and the $13 cost of carne asada fries. But I guess this is Vegas right."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo changed my life.

Ah, I'm just kidding (kind of). But I went here late on a Sunday night because I had taken my good friend from out of town to Double Down Saloon and afterward we were both having those late night, been out too long drinking pains. He said directly to me: \"Take me somewhere that has crazy good, original Mexican food.\"

I immediately thought of Tacos El Gordo and it's perfect because it is about a 5 minute drive from my house. When we got there it wasn't too busy so  we were able to go straight up and order. Note that when you order you go to different people because they are all slicing different kinds of meat.

I went for the adobada, of course because I've seen all the great reviews of it. It was so good I ordered two, but then I went back and got another. The sauce on it has such a great taste and yes, you can get pineapples on it, but I do not like pineapples - so none for me!

My friend branched out, got an adobada taco, carne asada taco, and an adobada quesadilla. He gave me a taste of the quesadilla and it was just as good as the tacos.

I definitely will be back to try the other tacos. It's such an easy concept and for some reason I really like places that specialize in just a few things these days. It means they can really hone in on making something really delicious, rather than doing a bunch of mediocre stuff. It's just tacos here (and a few other things), but the TACOS are what you go for. I'm talking just real good tacos."}
{"text":"If you want authentic tacos, this is the place to go. Both places (the other on E. Charleston) are delicious! I'm such a taco snob and this is the only place I go to, no matter how far I have to drive. I kind of wish they had burritos but as long as they keep making these awesome tacos it's all good! The only tacos better than these are the ones I get in Tijuana. 5 hours away..."}
{"text":"I don't care if you have to stand in a line for a half hour, and there's nowhere to sit, and it's really hot and loud. This place deserves five stars for the food alone. 

We stood in the asada line for about a half hour before we got to place our order - 4 asada tacos, 1 sopes, 1 mulas. Almost everything is made fresh right in front of your eyes - the corn tortillas are scraped from a bowl of their dough, placed one at a time in the tortilla shaper and then put right on the flat grill; the raw beef is torn into smaller pieces, grilled fresh and chopped quickly. It's the freshness that makes everything you eat so delicious - the meat is succulent and tender, the toppings are complex and pack a great punch next to the creamy textured tortillas, and the cheese on the sopes and mulas tastes a bit indulgent. 

I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Bomb ass tacos and/or whatever it is you want inside your corn or flour tortillas, as well as anything else you could think of and a few things you never imagined. To say it's authentic would be misleading because I'm not exactly sure what authentic is or where you would consider the authenticity would be coming from but if you have an idea of what authentic taco or burrito stands it shops are supposed to be like than this is probably the closest thing that you could ever imagine."}
{"text":"YUM! I loved it here. 

I ordered the carne asada, lengua and tripas tacos.  Everything was so delicious. I also ordered one tostada and it was REAAAAAAAAAALLLY good because they put so much meat on that too. adn teh tostada was so crunchy and yummo

Tripe was REALLY good. I get mine extra crispy, which they fry it up and makes it taste 10 times better. ALSO the onions are so good... esp the green onion!

It was $2 per taco, but it really does fill you up because they pack on the meat! THey even put avocado/guac on top which is sooooooooooooo delish. 

One other downside is you can't put on your own onions,etc... they only have the beets & lime self serve."}
{"text":"Yummy... with awesome guac (I'll be back just for the gauc alone)  Made tableside and just they way you want it.  The rest of the food was good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I'm very hard to please when it comes to street tacos being that I'm Mexican but Tacos El Gordo is as real as it gets the only downside is the price. 2$ for a taco that is as small as my palm is a little ridiculous. Although they are a little pricey they are worth it. It's a very fast paced environment inside the restaurant for such a small space but ehhh we can manage."}
{"text":"This one by far is the best taco place in Las Vegas.. It's off the strip but worth the dive .. They have another location on the strip but it's not the same at all .. Take a drive to this location and u will love it here"}
{"text":"I go to Vegas a several times a year and this is one stop that I ALWAYS make. 
Its just past Encore and in the middle of a little strip mall. Nevertheless a jewel 

My favorite is the Quesadilla con Chorizo, i usually get two of those and sometimes if Im really hungry Adobado taco or Carnitas taco. 

The kitchen is so clean!!! Not that I thought it wouldn't be however for as busy as it always is and the number of orders that they crank out it is impressively clean. 

I am looking forward to the new expansion, so I don't have to stand in line as long. 

Not that I mind waiting, its worth it."}

{"text":"This is the Northern branch of TEG de Tijuana, B.C.  I caught the Strip bus up from my convention at The Sands for lunch, and was glad I came!  TEG is just past the edge of  'Turisto Vegas' and firmly planted in the 'Residents' Vega's (all the surrounding store-fronts seem to Hispanic, or Korean, or Lebanese- oriented.)
 If you love tacos, then this place is for you.  A little confusing at first, there were snaking lines of Mexicans and Haole all queued up inside the door, for different ordering stations, where incredibly speedy preparers hammer out the variety meats for the tacos and tostadas. After you pick up your order, you take your tray, pay the cashier lady at the front door, and then take your tray outside to a canvas & mylar tent, and grab a seat on a picnic-style bench.  I skipped the more authentic organ-based lines (tripas, cabezas, sesas, etc.) and  just went for an assortment of tacos in my comfort zone: carne asada; lengua; chorizo; adobada.   All were hot, a little greasy, and served on these great little thick, 4\" diameter Masa tortillas, with lime wedges, and nice crunchy radishes.  Delicioso!   I'd probably give the place  5 ***** -- if they could only serve a nice, cold beer ( I settled for an icy can of Coke, which was a good choice for the chiles!)  Skip the flan, which is the standard Industrial article, a thick gluey disc that is squirted into those little plastic cups. 
 After eating, it is a short walk back South to the Wynn Hotel complex, where you can enjoy wandering around the waterfall park complex, and watching all the rich folks do their thang before heading back to the heart of the Strip."}
{"text":"Amazing taco. Al pastor here is so good. A must try. There are no bad tacos here. Late night drunk adventures should end up here with at least 5 tacos in your plate."}
{"text":"We stopped by 11/30/14 and the location appeared to be closed.Wanting to get our adobada taco and mulita fix, we headed to the other location on E. Charlestown Blvd. This location is way smaller and a bit of a longer wait."}
{"text":"They are liars and are not open till 4 on Sunday's. I took a long Uber only to find out they were closer. I am extremely disappointed in this establishment."}
{"text":"Was in town for a week for business. Had a very large per diem and out of all the meals I had that week this was by far the best meal I had. Got 3 tacos adobada and an horchata for $6 and by far the best meal I had this whole trip. Definitely get some local food in ya and check this spot out even if you are the only white guy in the establishment."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but I'm giving it 2 stars because of the set up which makes this place not worth going. The lines are extremely long. So you will stand there for an hour plus waiting. There are 3 different stations that you can line up for which serve different meats. The problem is that once you are lined up for one station there is no way you can go to the next station unless you get in line for that one which is another long wait. So if you are coming in groups each person can be split into different stations. Another thing these tacos are good but they are very greasy i couldnt eat as many because of the grease. Another thing is that those poor workers are so overworked. I feel sorry for them. They need more people, you see them in hypermode. I think unfair working conditions.  Not going back."}
{"text":"We tried several types of these street tacos and the El Pastor is one of the best tacos I've ever eaten and I've had a lot of tacos.  We went mid-day and there wasn't a line...at first.  I suggest that you order everything you want in case a line develops later.  Do yourself a favor and eat here!  Go now.  You know you want tacos."}
{"text":"So I came here because everyone is always saying how amazing they are and what not. First off... LIE!!! Their meat is flavorless and they lie about making tortillas from scratch. They served me freakin tortillas from el super WTH !! The guys there are forever the rudest human beings on the face of the planet. Especially the one serving the tasteless carne asada. If they don't like their job please go out and find another. Never again.... they don't know the definition of a real taco... trust me.... I know a good taco when I see one."}
{"text":"It's was pretty good! Lots of flavor. My SIS and BNL say it was too salty. I think it was pretty tasteful and sooo good. I love taco!! 
There 3 different type of beef. The only thing is i wasn't sure if i got all my order beef meat that i order wouldn't know which one is what. 

**While i was waiting in line, (i plan to order a lot and try all kind of meat) i wrote down my order how many i want on my phone and just show it to them. So that sure help a lot."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews below and have to disagree with the majority of the negative reviews. Bottom line you MUST be patient upon ordering. There are different lines for different meats. Once you've ordered your food and they give it to you, you walk over to the cashier to pay for it. Simple! I've eaten at many Mexican restaurants and bottom line the only reason i didn't give them a 5 star is because the asado tacos were not that tasty. All the other meats were good and tasty. I would still go to this establishment but honestly not for the asada."}
{"text":"Came here on a trip to Las Vegas.

Family was hungry, so we decided to try this taco place. I'm not sure what the hype is...

First of all, it's ABSOLUTELY STUPID to order first and pay after. You get your food, you have to wait in ANOTHER line AGAIN to pay. They count the food on the plate and give you the total. By the time you pay, the food is already COLD.

Who in their right mind thinks ordering, then paying while your food gets cold is a good idea?!

Not to mention that there's too many lines and it's just.. ugh, completely ridiculous and this place needs some serious organization. 

Food was alright. It was good, but nothing to go crazy for, really. 

Not sure if I'll stop by again in the future."}
{"text":"As a local here in Vegas, this is the place to be when your cravings Mexican foods during late night or after clubbing all night! 

Been here many times but never have the chance to write a review but they lived up to there hype! Tacos are a must have here!"}
{"text":"This place was packed with people. It was so crowded, it was hard to find a place to sit down. Their ordering and payment process is one of the most inefficient I've ever seen, which needlessly exacerbates the crowded conditions. Depending on what you order, you may have to stand in 4 separate lines. The food is really cheap and initially tasted acceptable for the most part. My main problem with this place is that I got really sick after eating the food. Better know how to speak Spanish here because staff can't really speak English."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my long drive home and had delicious carne asada tacos along with a mules. If you're in Las Vegas, I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good and the lines are really long...

Seriously, we waited in line outside the restaurant for about 45 minutes, when we got inside we waited in more lines depending on what kind of taco you want. We tried the Asada and the pork. The ingredients are fresh and everything is homemade. Seemed like a authentic Mexican taco shop. I would like to see them offer some chips and guac as I like to eat chips with my tacos. They really need a better system for ordering as well, so you don't have to wait in so many lines inside.

Overall, I thought that it was very good, but not worth the hour wait."}
{"text":"This place is legit. It's a chain but somehow seems mom and pop. The sopes are bomb. I love my Monterrey sopes, the sopes here stole my heart. Service is quick, food is hot and price is ok."}
{"text":"Little bit pricey, but authentic. Nothing like tacos el pastor cut from fresh off the trompo with some slices of pineapple. And the environment is awesome. 

This is the only place I go for tacos. 

Don't get the fries...don't get anything. Its call Tacos El Gordo because they sell great tacos."}
{"text":"The wait to order tacos is about a 30 to 40 minutes. You get your tacos within 10 minutes. Expect a long line and a lot of traffic. There isn't a lot of seating so you literally have to wait until people are done eating and try to fight for seat. They do have inside and outside seating. I really liked the pork but not the beef. My husband got the lingua but he didn't like it. He did like the fried intestines. We love spicy food, the sauce that comes with the taco isn't that spicy. So if you like spicy food bring your own hot sauce. I would definitely go back but only for the pork."}
{"text":"Drove past there on 1/1/15, this location looks closed down.  Al pastor (pork) tacos were good."}
{"text":"Came here after the Sugar Bowl game last month because my friends wanted to try this place and they absolutely loved it. I on the other hand can't say I cared for it. I'm not saying it's terrible but it just wasn't for my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas, but it looks like a lot of other people love it so they're obviously doing something right. 
 Right off the bat I wasn't crazy about waiting in different lines for different tacos and then waiting again to pay so by the time I sit down my tacos aren't hot anymore. Other than that it's ok..."}
{"text":"What can I say about this places food it was totally awesome! Everything made to order, The spicy pork on the vertical spit being cut for each taco had my mouth watering. Service was generally quick considering the 3 separate lines for the Pork, Carne Asada, and the one that does the rest (Lengua, tripe, Etc). Open late and around the way from my work. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas! If your ever on the strip and your hungry for tacos then go here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"EGG-cellent inebriated location for those late night munchies. 

I had Tacos El Gordo in San Diego...and they were absolutely delicious...and I was sober. One can only imagine how much more I would have enjoyed them if I werent sober.

So remember this...

It has been a long and fun night of fist pumping to insane EDM music...your drunk because for some reason your liver thinks its a god in vegas...you dont want to travel far becuase your lazy...and you dont want to overpay because your cheap. So where do you go?

TACOS EL GORDO is your solution!

-TACOS EL GORDOs is probably the best tacos in Vegas
-TACOS EL GORDOs is as authentic as it gets
-large variety of proteins to choose from
-closes late!
-located at the end of the strip
-taste absolutely amazing...especially when drunk
-cheap!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^"}
{"text":"Not worth line low quality meat separate lines for diff tacos !!! Don't eat waited outside 30 mins another hr inside"}
{"text":"First time. Had the pork tacos and they were out of this world!!!  Sooo much flavor !!!  We would go back again! In fact they were so tasty my husband went back and got a second round!
A local place. Scratch tortillas and pork on a rotisserie spinning around with so much juicy flavor !"}
{"text":"Best tacos, soles, grilled peppers n onions around.  Fastest service north of the border"}
{"text":"Possibly the best spicy pork taco out there. Go late and enjoy the quiet . Lunch is a zoo and well managed but I prefer the quiet."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best tacos I've ever had! The Adobada and the Asada tacos are delicious are so juicy and flavorful. The carne asada fries are delicious too and I highly suggest trying those. I also tried the Horchata drink and it waa good and had the right amount of cinnamon flavor. These tacos are a must try for fellow taco lovers."}
{"text":"When you're drunk off your ass from XS nightclub at Encore and the line for taxis is like a mile long, you want to walk over a block here to Tacos El Gordo. Big restaurants with plenty of seating and $2 tacos! Yup, not ALL food joints in Vegas will burn a hole in your wallet. 

My foodie friend took me here after XS last weekend along with a group of my girlfriends. He took good care of us and ordered here about 20 Taco De Adobada. It was delicious! And I was sober by then so I can vouch it's also good without the intoxication. :) It had a green sauce and plenty of meat. Worth every $2 my friend paid.  You really just have to come here and try it out. Though there were a lot of club goers at the time we went, the line moved ridiculously fast because service was quick. We sat outside in the patio. Tables inside are along the walls of the restaurant. 

The only thing is, don't expect to get a taxi from here. It's impossible!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Tacos El Gordo--and it was just as good (although more inebriated) than the first. 

Came after spending the night with Lil'John at Surrender. We got the pork shoulder, carne asada, tripe, and tongue. The pork shoulder was my favorite--some bits crispy and some bits very juicy and flavorful. I think we inhaled those tacos within minute (granted, they're sized to be about two large bites). 

Great way to end a great night out, or in the words of Lil'John, YEEAAAYYYUUHHH."}
{"text":"This place is BUSY!!!! Smells amazing in there, but I'm super picky about my carne asada. It was way to chewy for me, my husband and I barely picked at the carne asada fries because they meat was soo fatty. Ugh! Grosses me out just typing about it. On the bright side, the adobada (pork) tacos were pretty delicious, so it wasn't a wasted trip."}
{"text":"These tacos were good, but still not as good as a Cali taco truck.  There just wasn't enough flavor in the meat and even though I squeezed on lime, there was no punch! 

I tried the abodabo, asada, and al pastor.  The al pastor tasted the best and adding a hot pepper with each bite helped bring some character to the taco."}
{"text":"this place IS YOUR JACKPOT in Vegas therefore you must try it, no exceptions!!
Huge bonus is that it opens late and the price is inexpensive. The food quality is top notch-hard-to-find Mexican food. They cook the meat on the spot so you'll get to enjoy the most fresh delicious juicy taco. There really isn't any con about this place, but if I were to pick one thing, since it is SO popular... the line will test your patience. Seriously, this place gets never ending customers any time of the day! 
What are you doing reading this review?? Go try it now!! :) 
I highly recommend the spicy pork taco . YUMMMMM"}
{"text":"I tried this spot when my cousin was in town. I must say the tacos are amazing. Unfortunately the lines are a killer for my taste. We spent the better part of an hour in line waiting to place our order. The place is jam packed which speaks highly but by the time I reached the front of the line I was sick to my stomach with the smell."}
{"text":"It wasn't that great the meat need more flavor and the lines are ridiculous ...why should we stand in two different lines if you want two different types of meats .. Then a third line to Pay?!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to go to Tacos El Gordo for quite some time now. I have seen in other reviews that the lines are long, but worth the wait.
I went on a Tuesday at 2:00PM for lunch.
I walked in and there was only 2 other people in front of us in line.... Yay!
I got the adobada tacos and asada tacos with everything.
They were really good!!! The adobada were my favorite!!!
I will definitely be back.!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived in Vegas so I can eat this everyday! Lol but every time I visit this is for sure a place I have to go to! Such great tacos with their sauce and fast service!"}
{"text":"A tad overrated.

Is it delicious? Yes. Is it muy autentico? Good question. I've been to Mexico a few times and the food that the locals eat away from touristy areas seemed more gringo-ish than this. 

I will say that once you wait in line for 15 minutes and then pay way too much for street tacos, you are treated to spicy pork deliciousness. However, I think $2 each for small tacos and long lines with little seating is too much for me to give Tacos El Gordo 5 stars. 

I took a buddy who I thought would like it and he wasn't impressed at all. Same complaints as me. Too long of a line, fighting for a seat, too expensive for what it is. But damn, those spicy pork tacos are good.

Tip-if you are really hungry, order the fries and two tacos=tons of food for $14."}
{"text":"Every taco is great, but the best is the adobada. It is incredibly good-would eat it every day if I could. The lack of chicken tacos and rice and bean sides keeps it at 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"Fresh, interesting, and big portions but lacking flavours in my opinion. needs more salt or seasoning. I should have ask for some hot sauce or something to give it more flavour."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS, cheap, DELICIOUS, big portion (quesadilla/fries)  DELICIOUS! Need I say more? The adobado (pork) is BOMB! Get those adobado fries"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS, cheap, DELICIOUS, big portion (quesadilla/fries), DELICIOUS, hand made tortillas, DELICIOUS! Need I say more? The adobado (pork) is BOMB! Get those adobado fries"}
{"text":"Great place for street tacos. Loaded fries are delicious as well. Very busy most of the time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good street tacos, this is the place. Tacos are about $2.50, and they use a good amount of meat. My favorite are the cabeza and the adobada. They salsas are also delicious and complete the flavor. Service is so so, you can't really expect much. The one drawback is that there are different lines to get tacos with different meat. So there are times that one line is much longer than the other, or people in front of you are ordering a million tacos and you have to wait. Because there are different lines, if people in your party are getting different meat, someone might get all their tacos way faster than everyone else, or a line is so long that you other tacos get cold before you can even order a different kind of taco. But other than that, it's still worth the wait. This location also has plenty of seats available, compared the the one on the strip."}
{"text":"Holè Molè those were the best tacos I've ever had! Not a bad deal for $7!!! Quick, and delicious. I'll be back. Don't mind the long lines. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The adobada is outstanding and the fresh made flour and corn tortillas are the reason for the 2 stars.  This place sux otherwise.  The guacamole while fresh is flavorless and bland, I mean can you add some onions, garlic, or tomatoes for the love of god.  The carne asada is a bit salty and also somewhat lacking in texture but not bad.  Really the only thing I would come back for is the Adobada(Pork on a spit)."}
{"text":"Looooooved their tacos! Looks like a hole in the wall joint, but those are the best places!  I tried all of them and would eat all of them again! Lol. A bit pricey for the tacos, but it's worth it! Lol. Limited seating, always packed, u know its good!!"}
{"text":"Just like the other tacos el gordo I've been to, this place was amazing. Tasted truly like authentic Mexican tacos and I will always come back any chance I get....nuff said!"}
{"text":"If you have ever been to a tacos el gordo, you can understand how delicious their tacos are. I can say I have been to every single one of their locations and I love each and every one of them. They are consistent in taste and price and I can't get enough. A must-go!"}
{"text":"This place is starting to slip a bit.  Last few times I ate here everything was great.  This time food was super salty and alot greasier than I remember from previous visits.  Food was still edible.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've had. Awesome place, especially for a late night meal. Went with a friend on a Tuesday night. Long lines, though. Hopped on the deuce from the strip, and went for some al pastor tacos. $2.25 for each. Great price, and great taste!"}
{"text":"So good very authentic Tj food.. They don't let you sit down until you have your food which is good thing because there is no saved seating.... And there is always a table regardless...  And there is no longer patio seating...The hours on weekend are earlier they open at 9:00am... Loved it it's a must every time we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"The tacos here are great, I love it. Just beware there's 4 lines for different type of tacos/food. I'm very selective on my horchata, but this place had it on point. I'm a big fan of tacos, so this was super delicious. Price was cheap and food was awesome."}
{"text":"Lengua and adobado tacos are good. Ask for easy sauce on lengua because it is spicy. The buche(stomach) tacos is salty and I'm not a fan of the intestine tacos but the fiancé liked it. Adobado taco sauce is really really good. The tortillas were good. I hate how crowded it was and how it was hard to find seats but if you team up just manage your time and look for the different meat lines. Next time I need to get the carne asada."}
{"text":"Had 3 carne asada tacos with everything on them. 

The line at 9 pm on a Monday night was surprisingly crazy busy. Lots of peeps but that makes it more fun. Just make sure you get it in right line for what you want. 

The corn tortillas were being made by hand as I was waiting in line. That's awesome!!!

The carne asada was on point. With the cilantro and guacamole... absolutely delicious. 

Will definitely make this a go to spot anything I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Overrated. My impression (I've tried it years ago, and again today), is that it is saltier and more oily than other average places. Perhaps some people like that."}
{"text":"Excellente!! Everyone ordered different varieties and combinations of tacos. Several meat choices you cant get anywhere else. Felt like I was back in the heart of Mexico with the flavors. It was amazing. 

Will come back. Super fresh. Wish there was more seating."}
{"text":"Five stars because this place never disappoints and everything on the menu is delicious! It's as close to authentic Mexican tacos as any place around here could be.

Tacos El Gordo is my fave taco spot in San Diego, so imagine my delight when I found out they came to Vegas! Most menu items are on the same level as the original spot, so big kudos there!

Asada, Al Pastor, Adobada, Cabeza, Lengua never fails. Tacos, Fries, Mulas, Vampiros are all delicious!! Don't forget your grilled veggies, salsas, and tasty beverages!

This spot is significantly less crowded and better maintained than the Charleston location. I think varying customer service, long lines, and difficult parking situations during peak hours are normal for a humble yet busy taco shop, and this place is no different from the rest in that sense.. but I find they are polite and accommodating more often than not. If you come with the right expectations, you should leave with all that matters, a very happy tummy!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best taco place in Las Vegas. I've lived here for 8 years and I've never found a place as good as this. Roberto's is all right if you're looking for convenience cause there's one on every corner but if you're something top notch it's this, especially their Tacos de Adobada. 

The only cons are that on certain nights the lines can be super long. I went last Thursday and the line was absurd. My brother and I had to wait 30 minutes and I am not exaggerating. But anyway, it usually shouldn't be like this. If you're looking for quality tacos, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Oh my... Late night taco run in Vegas?!! Yep! That's me :) Don't  let the long line discourage you, it moves quick. The el pastor taco is amaZing here! Something about the green sauce adds that perfect taste to each bite. Also, don't forget to add the grilled onions and jalapeños to your tacos."}
{"text":"We were driving south on the strip and I saw Tacos El Gordo. We had just been to the one in Chula Vista a couple weeks prior and we loved it. I was expecting a long line but we got right to the front immediately. It was around 5 PM last Tuesday. 

Honestly I don't mess around here with any of the other meats other than the adobada. The guy was slicing off the pork right off the spit. And I always ask for the pineapple slices in my taco. 

I gave the Chula Vista location five stars. If I could I would give the Las Vegas location six stars. I truly feel it is the perfect taco with the right balance of meat to sauce to toritilla. I love the green sauce and it really goes well with the marinated pork along with the onions, cilantro and pineapple. 

The best! My wife and I got out of there for less than $20. Obviously the ambience is nothing but who cares, the tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Same...yet different. The family and I stopped by TEG right before the dinner rush. I order 2 tacos de adobada con pina and one asada. The service is just as fast and friendly as the other 2 locations. We paid for our food and sat down in time to watch the whole place fill up. 

Our food was good, the pork was spiced perfectly and I would say the salsas had a little more kick than usual, but still had great flavor. The asada was tender but lacking in flavor the salsas part way made up for it. My kids devoured their asada tacos, meat and tortilla only. So they were edible but not as tasty as usual. 

Now when I mentioned we saw the place fill up it wasn't just people, smoke was so this in that place it gave me a headache. And we were seated by the door! I'm not sure if someone turned the vents off or they need better ones but it kinda ruined my meal. 

My favorite TEG? No. Not at all. Will it do? Sure! I'll be seen eating there."}
{"text":"I CRAVE tacos from Tacos El Gordo! I first heard about TEG from a family member who knows my love for the mexican street taco. Her exact words were \"this place is legit!\" and that it is!!! They are straight out  of Tijuana, Mexico. Walking in you will see 4 different lines, the longest is usually for the carne asada, but you can't forget the adobada!! I usually stick to those two since I'm not too much of a risk taker when it comes to tripa(cow intestine), lengua(tongue), or sesos(brains). The tacos all come with different toppings the asada taco has guacamole, salsa, onions, and cilantro. The cabeza comes with salsa, onions, and cilantro. The adobada matches PERFECTLY with a little pinapple! I'll also get the carne asada fries, a half portion for half the price, and thay are GREAT they have TONS of carne, shredded cheese, sour cream, avocado ranch, and guacamole. Way worth $5 bucks!!! The only reason I am taking a star is because they dont have tons of seats and they are SUPER busy =("}
{"text":"I love, love, love al pastor, when it is done right, and this place does it to perfection! They slow roast the pork on a spit with a pineapple that sits on top and drips its juice onto the meat while it's cooking. Then they shave off pieces of the pastor and put it into your taco. What more could you want! I will add that it's in a ghetto part of Vegas and there's a methadone clinic right down the road. So if your cool with being in the sketchy area, it's a great dive restaurant to hit up for delicious eats."}
{"text":"My husband and I carne asada fries and carne asada tacos.  They were the best fries/tacos we had so far.  They have other different items and the line went by quick.
We were there late after midnight, it was a little crowed.  The only downfall is ordering your food in one area and having to walk against people in line to pay for the food :/..."}
{"text":"This place is hands down 5 star street taco joint right next to the encore!!! The el pastor is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"The food is only good if you are drunk. Don't come unless you like half ass street tacos. The workers are also trash."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. My hubby told me it would be and if was. 

I wanted to be adventurous, so I tried three different tacos - beef tongue, beef and Al Pastor. They were are beautifully dressed with all the right sauces. But I have to say that the Al Pastor was by far the best. Next visit, I'll probably just get three of them!

We also shared a half order of the Carne Asada Fries because even a half order is HUGE. The fries are nothing special and I have to say that the toppings weren't the most flavorful I've had. But how can you ever go wrong with loaded fries?? We scarfed them down just the same!"}
{"text":"Three lines: (1) adobada, (2) tortas, sopes, etc, (3) other tacos. This means you gotta come with multiple people and spread yourselves across the lines you want. 

(Note: Green onions and peppers are served through the tortas line only)

Line was up to the door but not past the door, which translated to about a 30 minute wait for the adobada and a 40 minute wait for my other tacos. After getting the food, there is then yet ANOTHER line to pay, which is annoying because it's by the door that keeps getting opened and blows cool air over your food (at least in winter) and therefore renders your food cool by the time you pay and eat. 

Parking lot just outside and had no trouble with parking at 11am on a public holiday Monday. 

I ordered adobada, cabeza, and lengua tacos, and a tripa vampiro. The vampiro is two crispy tortillas with cheese, so the whole thing is comparable to the size of two tacos. Personally, I prefer straight up tacos because I'm not as big of a fan of crispy shells and didn't think the cheese added much flavor. Much purer appreciation of meat from the tacos.

Won't repeat what others have already emphasized about the food - it's delicious and authentic. Highly recommend, but also recommend that you go when they open to avoid lines. Ignore any review that tries to compare it to Taco Bell because they obviously have no idea what they are talking about. 

And FWIW, my group may well have been the only non-Spanish speaking group there that morning. Rare in a place like Vegas and speaks to the quality of the food here. GO."}
{"text":"I don't think I ever had a bad experience at any Tacos El Gordo. I always get their el pastor tacos and mulas. 


The Restaurants are always clean, busy, and good! Been to the San Diego & vegas locations and they all tasted the same!


If you don't know, now u know. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Really good authentic tacos..I have tried every kind of meat and they are all great. Good price.   Im never dissapointed when I come here."}
{"text":"Best damn tacos in Vegas.. The area is pretty sketch but it's well worth it for some bomb delicious El pastor tacos and the great thing is they slice the meat right in front of you! Nothing like super fresh tacos and home made tortillas"}
{"text":"Bottom line.. Quite possibility the best tacos in Las Vegas.
However if your from Los Angeles, and visit Taco trucks, you might just be disappointed.  
2 dollars a Taco is kinda expensive.  This is their main flaw and why I don't visit this place that offen."}
{"text":"During my trip in Vegas, I looked up places to way while there. Everyone suggested this place. We drove by it late Friday night and the line was about 100 people out the door, no joke. So we decided to go Sat around 4 hoping the line wouldn't be that bad. Well, there was a line, but not as long. From the moment we arrived to the moment we sat (if you're lucky to get a table) was 1 hr and 15 mins. Was it worth the wait, kind of. The tacos are traditional street tacos which is great, the price is right at about $2.75 a taco, but by the time you get your food, pay and eat, your food is cold. Tacos still tasted good, but if they were piping hot, that would of been better. HEADS UP, they have designated lines for specific tacos, so if you want different cuts of meat, you will have to have two people stand in different lines or get into both lines at different times. The layout and way they have the lines set up is what causes the wait to be so long. They do make the tacos fresh when you order, but they do get cold quickly. Was it worth trying, yes, but maybe once only."}
{"text":"These tacos are so good they should probably be illegal, but lucky for all of us they're not. This is the third Tacos El Gordo I've been too and it's definitely the most spacious. There's clearly nothing too fancy about this place, you get your tacos of choice, pay at the cash registers and find a seat of your choice. Pretty straight forward and quick. 

The tacos though are out of this world! My favorites are the al pastor and buche. The meat is hot and carved right in front of you as you order and the toppings are plentiful and delicious. They also provide complementary radishes and limes for your eating pleasure.

I'm so glad they opened this North Las Vegas location. I'll definitely be back again before I know it."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place essentially from everyone who lives in Vegas and thought after a few Memorial Day drinks this sounded like the go to spot! 

I opted for the abodada, carne asada and buche tacos. So good! The abodada was my favorite by far. The texture was great and it had a spicy kick to it. I was in somewhat of a tie between the other two, but overall both were so good! I love that the toppings come on the tacos and there's plenty of fresh limes available. 

You can't beat the prices either, only $2-3 per taco. I'm almost glad this isn't closer to me since I'd probably gain about ten pounds over a two week span.

If you haven't been here yet, go! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas. Adobada is very good. The carne asada has a smoky flavor from the mesquite charcoal grilling. Faster lines than the strip location, shady location, nice employees."}
{"text":"New location. Shady area. Same great tacos as the other locations. This one has a larger eating area. Best tacos in Las Vegas. I really miss this place."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Why oh why did i wait so long?! Listen, this place is a hell of a value. Even at $2 a pop, ordering 5 tacos and adding the free grilled green onions and jalapeños will only run you $10. Plenty of food for me!

The al pastor was delicious. The servers were nice. The service itself was attentive. The only knock on this place was the carne asada tacos. Mine were a bit grissly and fatty. 

I'll give it 4 stars, as I'll be back pretty soon, but I wouldn't give it 5 based on the carne asada..."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is easily the best place to get tacos in Vegas. In a place that doesn't look that special, what they have cooking in the kitchen is where it's at. It's just a great atmosphere. 

People go here in droves just to get the adobada taco with its freshly made corn tortillas, topped with cilantro and diced onions, and doused with their special sauce. At about $2 a taco, prices can add up. I sure can't get enough of these things, though. 

And be sure to take plenty of napkins, because these hand-eaten hunks of deliciousness can get pretty messy. But you will definitely not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Man, I love tacos. One day I decided that in order to find the best tacos in Las Vegas, I needed to eat at every highly-reviewed taco place in town. I started off at Los Tacos on Sahara, as it's closer to my side of town and consistently the best place to get delicious food. I love it there, but we're not talking about that right now...

I finally made my way to Tacos El Gordo after hearing increasingly good reviews about this place. I'd love to tell you not to listen to the hype, but LISTEN TO THE HYPE! THIS PLACE IS GOOD!

First of all, you should know this place is called Tacos El Gordo for a reason: it's pretty much just tacos. Don't come in here expecting a Taco Bell-like menu of made-up \"Mexican\" meals... nonsense! It's just tacos here, and great ones, at that! (It's not really \"just tacos\"... they have like three other things on the menu, but that's just because they're based on a taco-like construction)

I come here and always order the same thing: \"Hola, me puede dar cuatro tacos de asada?\" Yes, I ask for four carne asada tacos, and I always have to talk myself out of getting 5 or 6 or 14. The tacos are amazing here. Plus, you can watch the lady make fresh tortillas right in front of you! It's awesome! It really just ups the ante here!

Again, the food here is good, quick, and cheap ($2/taco). And it's extra cool because you can grab your food, then go up and pay for it after. It was confusing at first, but it works. 

My only gripe with this place? It's right next to the classic Los Tacos. I feel that Los Tacos has better carne asada, and their menu is a lot more varied, but it's in a different category. Los Tacos is a lot more bare-bones deliciousness, where Los Tacos. It isn't really a weakness as much as it highlights how basic this place is."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos!! Better than the ones I used to eat while living in Tijuana!!  Adobada with pineapple was delicious with lots of flavor!"}
{"text":"Still awesome- was back in March '17, and they've remodeled, but not a whole lot is changed. Again, while the hotel restaurants are mostly good, they're also soulless and full of stuff you can get in any city in the US. 

El Gordo is just so good, and more deserving of patronage in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food is so good! but they have a TERRIBLE LINE SYSTEM!!! 

One of the best taco spots I have been to and I come from the land of taco spots.

The parking lot and area is pretty sketchy. Not one of Vegas prettiest places Inside looks exactly like King Taco but instead of spinning rotisserie chicken, they have spinning Adobada. 

Again the ordering line system is terrible. They have 3 different lines for different cuts of meat. So if you want multiple types of meat, you have to stand in different long ass lines. And some people literally order 10 tacos at a time. I feel bad for the Adobada carver who has to cut those orders! After you order, you go to the register and pay. I really wonder how many people get there food and just bounce without paying. 

Taco De Asada - $2 - Steak was seasoned perfectly and loaded with fresh veggies and guac. 

Taco De Adobada - $2 - Pork had a very light kick, not spicy, and loaded with the same veggies and guac. 

Tostada De Asada - $2 - Bascily the same as the taco but you get a crispy tortilla instead of a soft one. Next time I am going to just ask for the crispy shell on the side and get a taco.

Campechana Fries, half - $6 - Half carne and half Adobada, you get the best of both worlds! Fries were soft thin fries and loaded with cheese meat and guac. One of the best Mexican fries I have ever had. 

Grilled Peppers - Free and freaking legit. Grilled soft and tender and so good!

They hide the salsa at the register so make sure you ask for a bunch when you pay. Seems like they keep that under lock and key

Honestly one of the best meals I had in Vegas. So good and so cheap. Now I want to try the SD location."}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos were the best!!! Fresh corn tortilla made right in from of you, and the toppings were just perfect."}
{"text":"Came here by recommendation. Over-rated!!! 
Came  here to eat tacos before heading back home to AZ. There was a long line for starters so took roughly 40  min to get the food and start eating. The MAJOR down side to this place is once u get inside the building(because the line does stretch to the outside), there are about 6 lines inside for each type if meat u want to eat. So if u want tacos de Asada and carnitas, there are 2 separate lines for that, not to mention, once u get ur food on one line, you'll have to wait approx another 10 min Or so to get ur other tacos from the other line. Then, there is another line to pay once u get ur food. The food by this time is already getting cold so you won't enjoy eating it fresh and also not to mention good luck finding somewhere to sit and eat. Best practice would be to come with several people obviously so they can all get in different lines and get your order from them. Overall, the Asada taco was a bit dry, but the Al Pastor was great. I won't be coming back to this place because it is not worth the long waiting especially if you want to get different kinds of tacos from different lines major major downside to this place."}
{"text":"Wow! Some of the best Mexican style tacos that you can find. Straight out of Tijuana this Mexican gem serves all types of tacos from a variety of meats and delicacies (such as lengua, tripa, & cabeza). My favorite tacos are the adobada or asada! Sooooo good. 

If you don't speak Spanish this place can be overwhelming but don't worry everyone is friendly and happy to help. My suggestion if you like cheese and meat, order the \"Mula Asada.\" You will NOT regret it, it's melted cheese with flour or corn tortilla and your choice of meat! Yum!

They also have a fountain drink machine with traditional  juices from Mexico, free refills!

Recommend this place 100%, sooooooooooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious, just make sure you get in the correct line for what you want to order"}
{"text":"Our second time here, we came for our anniversary in July 2016, a friend told us to try. It was bomb a lil Mexico in Vegas the lines were extreme but went quickly. Tacos are amazingly good we were satisfied and came back feb 2017 with our kids and they also enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Tostados asada was good..didn't get the lengua since it was my first time didn't know how to order. It's super crunchy, some burnt edges, but still good. I wished they gave more sauce or have bottles readily available for people. I wasn't aware until I saw folks asking for it. I didn't want to stand in line again for sauce. I'm sure you can go up and ask for them.

The asada tacos were not bad, just dry and really in need of sauce. The bbq pork was not my favorite. It comes in two corn tortillas because of the wetness and grease. 

I'd like to try the chorizo or quesidilla  next time as it looked good. 

There's limes and radishes (whole and sliced) for you to choose from. 

5 tacos and tostados were $12 not bad...would come back. I want to try the lengua but wished the line was shorter..."}
{"text":"For a Friday at 6pm, the line was surprisingly short. My parents were so excited to try this place because I always rave about the ones in San Diego. We had most of our group scout out tables while my mom and I ordered for everyone, but it was too hot and crowded to sit inside. Besides, who wants to sit around a bunch of drunk, half naked kids coming back from the day clubs? The service is friendly and fast. We pretty much ordered once around the menu, except for the fries, paid at the counter across the establishment, and ate out of the back of the car. For two people- 6 tacos, 2 mulas, and 2 drinks it was $28, pricey for a taco joint, but it is Vegas. Everything was good and maybe I'm biased, but the quality is much better in San Diego. Avoid this place when you see the line wrapped outside, just come back another time."}
{"text":"I love this place! This is my second time in Vegas and my first food stop had to be this joint. Yummy taco asadora (spicy pork). I love how they dip their freshly made corn tortilla in the meat juices before making the taco; added so much flavour! The free grilled onion and jalapeño peppers we got was awesome. Don't let the first bite of the peppers deceive you, they get hotter and hotter. Love love the tacos de lengua (beef tongue). The meat was so soft and succulent. My friend didn't even realize that it was tongue she kept on stuffing into her mouth. She may be used to that;)"}
{"text":"Good tacos, 3rd on my list of Vegas taco joints. Los Tacos and Abuela's Tacos are better."}
{"text":"Usually I like this place but it can get SO SO Busy

When it's that busy do NOT bother coming here

Honestly they can't keep up with the demand and the pace that thy serve underwhelming food that is either over cooked or undercooked. The hot sauce was also watered down. Cause they couldn't make enough. Literally had no flavor

Also there is a lady who walks around checking if you paid and asks for your receipt! So disrespectful."}
{"text":"tostadas here are probably the best in the city. Closest to Mexico I have had. Tacos are good too."}
{"text":"I tried this location and also the one on the strip. 

The one on the strip is packed constantly. At this one, we got here at around 11/11:30-ish and there was barely any line.

You get into a designated line based on the type of meat that you want.

I got two asada tacos and one chorizo taco with everything!

BOMB AF.

Both locations are really, really good. Consistency is key, my friends!"}
{"text":"The tacos are good but they definitely run the LV Strip taco scene because there just isn't much competition around. 

Tips: 
+Don't waste your time and money ordering Asada! They don't season their meat as well as they should and the taco ends up tasting bland. 

+Make sure you stand in the proper line for the tacos you want. Each line has a sign above it indicating which tacos they make. If you're with multiple people, split up and order your tacos because the food gets cold quick.

+The al pastor is a must, it's pretty much their best tasting meat option.

+If you're here as a group, have someone save your group a table because this place is always busy and by the time you get your food and sit down, your tacos are cold.


I definitely think they need to change the way they order food here. They go by this whole \"honor system\" where you order your tacos and then you stand in line to pay for your tacos. The lady at the cash register counts your tacos and items and then gives you a grand total. Imagine if I ate a few in line? I'm sure they lose out on a lot of $$ here. 

And what is up with their Quesadilla?? I thought I was going to get two hand made tortillas with a fresh piece of melted cheese in between and of course my meat in the middle. Instead I received this twist on a quesadilla which turned out to be ONE tortilla, meat and cheese and a tortilla chip on top. The round tortilla chip was almost about the size of the hand made tortilla (meaning it was tiny). Common man, how can you mess up on a quesadilla??! 

Overall, please be patient when coming here and don't be alarmed when you see a line out the door for tacos. Order the al pastor and you won't be too disappointed."}
{"text":"Taco meat was delicous! Tried the Carne asada, al pastor, chorizo, and buche. Service was quick and easy. Deducted a star because of the lack of salsa/condiment choices."}
{"text":"Al pastor with their salsa and pineapple chunks are so good! We usually stop by here at least twice when in Vegas."}
{"text":"The adobaba tacos are THE BEST tacos ever, PERIOD. Add pineapple or not depending on your mood. I always ask for the \"burnt/crispy\" bits when they slide it. Makes it just that much better. 1 lime chunk squeeze and HEAVEN is in your mouth.  These are the must haves. The asada is great as well. Not the BEST ever ever but still amazing. Again with the lime squeeze. Everything else is great as well. But really is all about the Adobada.  This is a weekly stop and a \"must have\" spot and excuse to take any \"company\" too. Just voted the \"best taco\" in the USA by Yelpers.  Now I gotta go eat some."}
{"text":"Well My husband wanted to try this place since a friend told him these were the best tacos in town.  uh huh.... 

So he tried the buche, and tripas (eewww really???!!!) tacos and I had the Carne Asada and al Pastor Tacos. ... 

Carne asada tacos were nothing to go crazy for... meh. 
Al Pastor tacos, were amazing!  the meat was soft and with all the fixin's (salsa, guacamole...etc) it was like heaven.  :-) 

My husband LOVED the buche and the other stuff he ate, again disgusting! but hell he loved it so I guess this place gets only 4 stars for me.... The Asada tacos were not mind blowing like we were told.  :-)"}
{"text":"Tacos were awesome! I came in during the week and it was so empty. I had my doubts at first. The adobadas tacos are definitely the way to go! asada and chorizo were just meh in my opinion. The asada I had was flavorless and burnt and the chorizo just lacked in flavor. But the adobadas... delicious, moist and bursting with flavor. We stopped by once more on a Sunday, before we left Vegas to load on up tacos for the road trip back home. Sunday was packed wall to wall with people. We split up so we can each wait in a line for tacos... there are 3 separate lines you fall in depending on what kind of meat you'd like in your taco. Managed to get in and out in about 20 minutes. Gordo tacos for the drive home was an awesome idea!"}
{"text":"Late Entry:

12/1/15, had tacos for lunch cheap and fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Heard tacos were only $2 here, which was quite a steal so walked over there to check it out! Had the carne asada, tripe, & spicy pork taco and they were delicious!!! Tacos were of decent size but it was loaded and each taco had their own sauce.  I thought the spicy pork was the best one and the tripe came second best! Spicy pork had a nice flavor to it and the tripe as well but the crunch to it was what made it bomb! They also give you a plate full of  grilled chile peppers and onions! Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"My God!!! I think this place is heaven! Their tacos are bomb.com We ordered the following:

- Tacos de Asada 
- Tacos de Adobada 
- Tacos de al Pastor 
- Tacos de Suadero (brisket)
- Vampiros (double stack tostadas, grilled cheese w/alpastor)

Everything was well seasoned, and the grilled chiles and cebollitas were cooked perfect. The only thing that lacked was the salsa, it was not spicy enough. But then again I love my salsa super HOT! But that's ok... It was still pretty damn good! I know when we come back to Vegas during Thanksgiving week we will be hitting this place a few times during our stay. 

I really loved their Vampiros! The tostada was nice and toasty and the meat and fried cheese on it was on point too. 

Highly recommend this place if u don't live in the San Diego area... These tacos are true to the Tijuana style tacos, BEST!!! And going to their website it says they started in Tijuana before heading to San Diego and Las Vegas. So there u go! Authentic! Tijuana has the best tacos hands down! And they live up to their roots! 

See you soon Gordo!!! We got nothing but love for you baby! muah!"}
{"text":"BEST TACO EVER! 

Adobada Pork!

Ask for extra salsa. 
Ask for the plate of veggies.

EVEN BETTER WHEN DRUNK!

Right next to the Wynn. They had live music at around 2am...!


So SooooooOOOOooo GOOOOD!

-Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and managed to beat the massive line that formed for al pastor tacos behind me. No line for the other kinds of tacos. I had 2 al pastor, 1 cabeza (head beef), and 1 lengua (beef tongue). All the meats were excellent. The cook making the al pastor tacos oiled up the tortillas so they didn't stick to the paper whereas the one making the cabeza and lengua did not, making it hard to peel the taco off the paper it comes in.

Quite frankly I'd give it five stars if it was tad cheaper and the tortilla didn't stick to the paper wrapper. Plenty of strip mall parking. When I was there I was one of maybe 3 non-hispanics among 50+ people. Everyone was real nice."}
{"text":"Small diner.  Muy delicioso.  Mostly tacos.  Lengue, carne asada fries, adobado... everything bueno.

Tacos El Gordo has to be where real Las Vegans come for authentic Tijuana tacos.

It's in the strip mall on a corner just north of Encore/Wynn.  But do *not* try to walk here, even from those hotels.  Too much on a typical Vegas weather day, and the traffic signal at that T-intersection is a joke.  NOT pedestrian friendly.

Yes, es stupido mucho.  Si, laugh at my decisione no bueno.

Staggering in, barely avoiding heat stroke... well at least the soft drink machine was working.  What timing.  One of the ice dispensers was broken.

Still, the soda was fine, and the food was relatively worth the scorching trek.

There are only two sizes for Carne Asada fries:  large and massively large.  Either one is more than enough for a couple of average appetites.

Tacos are on the small side, but they're filling and full of great flavour.  The tortillas are doused in oil, quite heavy.

Watching the guy use a macheté, slicing at the rotating hulk of Adobado pork, is kind of fun.

It's also rather sweet seeing families having a meal at Tacos El Gordo, little boys play-fighting their brothers.

Speaking Spanish (which I don't ;/ waah ) is an advantage.  They seem to hook you up with extra good stuff, if you can hold a convo with them.

Not much else to say, except...
Tacos El Gordo = excellente!"}
{"text":"This eatery is located off interstate 15 freeway. This eatery is located within a small location and a gas station nearby. The location itself is bright pink from the outside so it is not hard to miss.


Upon entering, the line to order was not long, but the employees did not acknowledge you as their customers entered the establishment. Furthermore, upon deciding on the type of tacos one desired, one is to get in one of the three lines which do vary depending on the type of meat you would like on your tacos.

While getting in line, I looked around and noticed there was napkins on the floor with employees near by, but doing other tasks rather than picking them up. 


Upon ordering some adobada tacos, they were slices once off the meat product, but not re-sliced into smaller portions. I asked the employee to slice it into smaller pieces and he mentioned, there was not enough time for that as others behind me were waiting. I thought automatically, where is the customer service? 


The adobada pieces were long strips instead of thin smaller pieces of meat thus, making the food easier to digest.  Most places cut the meat into smaller portions so the meat is digestible.  I ordered two adobada tacos and one carne asada. 


They have a carrot station set up with chilles too and limes, but no salsa. If one desires salsa, they have to ask for it at the cashier counter.  
The salsa is free. 


After ordering your food, you head to the paying area with a cashier.  They accept credit cards including American Express. 


The place overall looked like a cafeteria style set up. The tables were not very clean and the eating area around the eatery was not clean. 

I don't consider this place to be a location to go out of your way for as I did from north Las Vegas, but at least I gave them a chance. 


Their prices are $2.00 per taco. Most of their tacos are $2.00 each with some $2.25."}
{"text":"WOW.  Didn't think tacos can taste any better than the ones I get in Chicago.  I was wrong!  Ok, maybe Carne Asada is better in Chicago, but all other tacos were excellent!

We had the Tripa(excellent!), Lengua, and the Pork??  Damn!  the Pork was tasty!  Chorizo was also better than i've ever had!  They also make their own tortilla.

The only small thing that's weird is that they have separate lines for the Pork, Carne Asada, and the rest...  Does this system work better for huge lines?  Maybe...."}
{"text":"The best lengua sopes I've had in town.  Very tender, melts in your mouth and flavorful.  You have to get to see for yourself!  Ideal for a late night cravings with friends.  I hear they normally have lines out the door, but I got lucky on a week day and was able to order & get my food in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Authentic soft tacos - really liked the carne asada and adobada.  Tasted really good then and two days later as well.

Lines were LONG; they went out the door slightly, and a security guard let you in as the lines moved.  This was on a Sunday afternoon.

It was confusing that there were two lines for adobada surrounding one line for carne asada, and it seemed that there were two flavors on the sign.  We went to order adobada and I cannot remember what wording was below it on the sign, and it turned out they were the same type.

We tried it one year ago, and all I got were clumps of fat in my soft tacos that turned me off.  There was hardly any solid meat in the carne asada.

However, this time it was a different, positive experience.  Definitely want to come back every time we are in Vegas.  It's just that now we know how to strategize and stand in two lines to order."}
{"text":"Crazy experience with loud music and long lines but pretty good street tacos and good service.
Make sure to get in the right line (read the signs above each line to know what your ordering options will be.)"}
{"text":"On our last day in Vegas, we were able to make it the famed Tacos El Gordo! I didn't believe my boyfriend when he said that the line would be two hours long - why would it be? It wasn't until we got there that I saw what he meant. There was a woman at the door directing everyone where to go since there are certain lines for each kind of meat. We waited in line for about 45 minutes and were able to snag some el pastor and lengua tacos before having to uber to our flight. The meat was amazing and the toppings were great too. Only reason why its four stars and not five is it was VERY hyped for how long we were waiting."}
{"text":"I live in a Spanish neighborhood, in Queens, and eat tacos from a stand run by old Latino ladies. 

These are the best god damn fCuking tacos I've ever had in my life. 

I want to go back to Vegas--yes for the gambling, yes for the shopping, but really, it's so I can have the lengua taco again."}
{"text":"Ugh, so good! We go spicy pork, beef head, chorizo, and steak. It was so good, my boyfriend and I got another order. We were here on a Monday afternoon so there wasn't really a line which was awesome :)"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo blew me away with their attentive staff, impossibly clean bathroom (lots of graffiti, but clean), low prices ($2 tacos), and expectation surpassing food. I had three tacos. 

Steak taco was the least good. Topped with guac and salsa, interestingly the steak was somehow very smokey tasting despite them grilling it before my eyes. Had the flavor you'd get if you threw a steak into a barbeque with wood chips. The flavor was good, but seemed out of place in a taco.

Spicy pork suffers from false advertising. Not at all spicy. The pork inhabits a vertical spinning spit usually seen at your favorite Gyro spot. It's basically a take on Chinese Char Siu (Roast Pork). They've even colored it red and have a pineapple at the top of the spit which they give a squeeze to every once in a while to keep the sweet glaze going. Quite interesting, although not as juicy as I'd like since they seem to have kept mostly lean pieces.  A shame.

The chorizo is their masterpiece. you order it and they cut a link loose and burst the insides out of the casing onto the grill followed by some sauce. I'm at a loss for words, but not appetite. 

If you want your mind blown, the only word you need to know when entering Tacos El Gordo is Chorizo."}
{"text":"All I can say is BOMB !!!!! Literary drove from pasadena to try these tacos. My husband, best friend and I were impressed. The sauce with the guacamole is so good. Asada tacos and Al Pastor highly recommend them."}
{"text":"So not worth the wait or the hype. It's confusing AF, you can only order certain items from certain windows.  Ultimately to get a pastor taco and a Carne asada taco means waiting in 2 separate lines, so something is getting cold. I couldn't bare to wait in 2 lines it took over 15 mins to get to the front of the pastor line. I got 4 tacos and 1 being vampiro style. It was okay, they are very stingy with the meat you'd figure after such a long wait you'd at least get a decent filled taco...ah dios mios.Viva King Taco en Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Muthatruckin' fantastic tacos! It is a counter service restaurant and very humble diner feel place but if you are in Vegas and like Mexican food than this is it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo came highly recommended by some locals I know in Las Vegas.  I was excited to see that they do al pastor like I'm used to seeing in Mexico - the way I love it!  Ordering was a bit confusing at first.  There is an ordering window and a payment window.  It's not clear if you're supposed to pay first or order first, so I'll let you know that you order first.  And, the window you order from is determined by what you're ordering.  I went to the pastor window and ordered, then went to the asada window to order a couple more.  Both sets of tacos were packaged separately on paper plates covered in foil.  We paid at the counter, and took our tacos to go.  We had a short drive, but when I unwrapped the tacos, the pastor tacos were nice and warm, but the asada tacos were cold!  Like completely cold.  Also, the toppings differ depending on the type of meat you get.  It's not your typical onion/cilantro combo.

Since trying this location, I did try out a Tacos El Gordo in California that was AMAZING, so maybe I tried them on an off day.  I'll try again and update if needed."}
{"text":"Tried a few different varietys of the tacos. All of them were excellent. Highly recommend you make time to swing by here if your in town."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal y'all.  If you're like me and want a couple of tacos or maybe even a burrito to end your night then there is no better place in Vegas than El Gordo.  My mouth is literally watering as I type..."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas. Do yourself a favor. When the taqueros ask you, \" con todo?\", say YES!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in San Diego or Las Vegas I have to make a stop here! They have the most delicious tacos I've ever had in my life. It is not easy getting your tacos here as the lines are absolutely insane. We stood in line today for 1 hour just to order....but well worth it! 

If you come you should: get the Adabada tacos. They are the only ones I've ever gotten and they are amazing! Each taco is $2.00. Best $2.00 ever spent. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are just looking for confirmation that this should be your taco destination, then read no further, this is the best taco you will find in vegas.  

Go to Tacos El Gordo expecting some of the best taco shack tacos you will ever eat.  Also expect a growling stomach and a watery mouth while you wait in line for quite a while.

If you are an adventurous eater, go for the tongue, tripe, or beef brain tacos.  They are delicious and unique.  But if you are looking for something a bit more standard, ask for some spicy pork or some steak tacos.  Everything is great.  Short of the LA taco scene I doubt you will find another taco place like this in an 800 mile radius."}
{"text":"$2 spicy pork tacos. You want these. Tasty snack and best deal on the strip. Yummy Mexican sodas to boot, what's not to love."}
{"text":"Okay, so when I checked in here, I claimed that these were the best al pastor tacos, ever... well, unfortunately I have to take that back. 

I was here 4 years ago, and the tacos were sooooooo freaking good, all I could think about when I came back to the Vegas strip was getting these damn tacos. 

Cut to, this weekend when I was here, in line for these tacos and so excited, ready to post pics so I just had to check in, blah, blah. Sadly, after I took the pics and took a bite, I was like ew, these are totally no bueno. What happened to the quality of the meat?! And the guacamole sauce, like what the hell is that?!! It was so incredibly gross and extremely disappointing. 

I'm so sad and so bummed. Adios, Tacos El Gordo, no mas for me."}
{"text":"Very busy, crowded but worth the wait. The BBQ pork taco is delicious. Carne Asada fries was good as well. Would definitely come back again when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Their Carne Asada is the bomb! Love coming to this place, espcially late night. Very affortable compared to other prices on the strip. The only downside is the space because of it being too popular. Coming here any time after midnight should not be a problem but if not you might have to eat in the car!"}
{"text":"Most authentic tacos in Las Vegas! It's usually busy so you can't stress. Must try tacos \"al pastor\" they slice it in front of you and make sure to ask for some pineapple!!! Plus they have Orange Bang!!! Also, you can save a trip to a Red Box...wink! wink!"}

I assumed the strip location would be crowded and the quality diluted (only an assumption) so we drove out to this location. Paulo pretty much nailed it, you know it's gonna be good when you are the only person here not speaking Spanish. 

I don't like Mexican. I'll admit that right off the bat. But Tacos El Gordo is something entirely different. None of that heavy gross hangover feeling like other Mexican places. I have tried just about every taco and the spicy pork tacos are still my favorite. Each are about the size of your palm, and I always ask for more sauce. 

They also have something I can't seem to find anywhere else....ORANGE ORGASM BANG BANG BANG RA TA TA. It's not really called that but they should. It comes out of a circulating fountain, foams at the top and brings all the boys to the yard."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! The steak and spicy pork are the bomb! Tried the Mexican candies, similar to the Chinese candied fruits. Really sweet but good. Restaurant is kept real clean even the tables outside. The bathroom is spotless!"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain.... the best tacos you can ask for.... there is no bad choice for me except the seso brain tacos.... very delicious and yummy.... must try place in Vegas and a short cab ride from everywhere on the strip.... fast quick and easy"}
{"text":"Love the freshly grilled and seasoned meats.  Adobada and asada are excellent - especially with the creamy green sauce!! Tiny tacos pack a punch of flavor."}
{"text":"Yeah. This place is legit. When you're the only person in there who doesn't speak Spanish, you know you've come to the right place.

Tacos, tacos, tacos. That's pretty much what they do. And it really doesn't get much better than this. I just needed a quick snack, so I went with a lengua and a tripa. I'm not entirely sure if I ended up with tripe, but it was delicious all the same.

I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time. I noticed that a strip location has opened up recently, but I knew I had to check out the OG location first. Reading other reviews is definitely making me want to return for some more Taco Gordation."}
{"text":"I almost always go to the adobada line. Why? Because here I can order a few adobada tacos (with everything) and an order of adobada fries (also with everything). I recommend getting the fries ONLY when it's not super busy or if you don't mind waiting 15+ minutes. A large order of fries can easily feed two regular-sized adults, so you might want to opt for a small if you're going solo. You can wait for your tacos here (also ask for some grilled green onions and peppers to eat with your tacos!!) and then move to the opposite side of the kitchen to pick up the fries, which takes some time to prepare as they keep getting bombarded with an endless stream of orders. The fries are definitely worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"What the best thing to do after a night out of fun in LA? Get tacos. And thankfully, the selection we have is endless - late night taco joints or infinite number of great taco trucks. But what do you do when you're in Vegas? Sure they have great restaurants open 24/7 but what if you absolutely need your nightly dose of tacos...

you come here.

Amazing. So good you'll want to order some to-go after you finished you're meal and suggest to your friends to come back the next morning (well that's at least what I did). 
Whatever you get, it's gonna be a party in your mouth. 

Personal faves - Adobada and Carne Asada tacos and tostadas. The tostadas are a little different here, not what you're used to if you're an El Taurino fan. But the flavors are so intense and rich it is the perfect meal intoxicated or sober. Ask for the side of peppers and green onions as well! And don't forget that orange bang!

Cheap, delicious, open late - what more can you ask for? Yes, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas but this one was too good to not share."}
{"text":"I waited in line over an hour to order our tacos  plus trying to get a table was very stressful, that aside we had the adobada pastore tacos and they were really outstanding. I don't know if I'll go back,  the line and chaos is a bit much to handle, but the tacos are really very good."}
{"text":"We loved the tacos..ate at 2am and the place was still crowded...worth the wait.."}
{"text":"Do you want to taco about good tacos?!? This place is pretty amazing the wait gets fairly long on occasion but who can really complain, the tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"I make it here every time I go to Vegas. Prices are reasonable, and the tacos are authentic. They have different lines for the different type of meats so make sure that you get in the right line. I saw someone get in the wrong line and had to move and start over again. The people making the tacos were pleasant to deal with. The location and condition of the building is not the greatest. In fact, it's really run down, and they don't have air conditioning, but if you can live with that, the tacos are delicious."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. Awesome tacos.

Ordering is broken into three lines, with respective meats listed. If there's a line, yeah, it's gonna take awhile. Be prepared for that.

Basic taqueria, though. You've got the delicious tacos, a few other items to choose from, and a beverage fountain. Seating is open, a few booths and tables."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Tacos and Quesadilla are TINY! Don't recommend at all. Better go to Del Taco!"}
{"text":"Dude! This pace is the bomb!! We would always come here whenever we at vegas. Line could be really long but the wait is always worth it. Tables aren't enough as a whole lot of people come and eat. People can be rude as can be but at the end we all gonna be eating some really delicious tacos!! I really like their Cabeza and Lengua. Very nice staff and friendly. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We have taken our family from Chicago, North Dakota, LA, Florida and everywhere in between here and all have fallen in love. They sometimes start with just one small taco, but we always have to go back for more... never once have we had someone too picky to love it. Our 2 and 7 year olds chow down too. They will make a cheese quesadilla for the kids, too, but we haven't had to do this yet. 
Tip: There are different lines depending on what you're going to order, so pay attention before you get in line."}
{"text":"Ok I gave this place a try again and definitely liked it more the second time around. My friends love this place so I had to go again. I probably had a bad first experience because they didn't have the fries. But this time they did and we got it with adobado (probably spelling it wrong but am too lazy to look it up right now haha) and it was so good! My friend and I killed the fries. We came after ebc so we were hungry and ready to eat! Definitely disappointed that they don't have orange bang anymore and still think the line structure of this place isn't the smartest but I would come back again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Maybe I am spoiled with the Mexican cuisine in Salt Lake City, but I just don't think this place lived up to the hype. Over 700 ratings averaging 4.5 stars, I thought it had to be mind blowing.. but not exactly. We had the spicy pork tacos and carne asada tacos. The guac was very bland. The service was really bad, too. We ordered and stood there forever, finally getting our carne asada tacos. They must have completely forgotten about the pork tacos, but after reminding them we eventually got them. It wasn't even crowded, either. It was a bummer to discover the horchata was out of service, too. I wouldn't go back here--but that's because I can get better authentic Mexican in my hometown. I guess I can see how those who don't have access to these type of places would love it. It's definitely authentic.. just not that great."}
{"text":"This is the worst place! Tacos ok, but not worth the stupid ordering system! 4 different lines for the different meats and then another line to pay. By the time you're able to sit your food is cold and tortillas are soggy! I've never seen a restaurant line this dysfunctional! Never again!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town !!' si estas buscando tacos este es uno de los mejores places en vegas.  
Sabrosos. !! Yummi"}
{"text":"I LOVE Tacos El Gordo! It's the best and one of my number one recommendations for people who visit Las Vegas. There's always a line out the door for this place. 

The carne asada taco was one of my favorites. Lots of flavor and the guacamole was a plus. The al pastor was slightly spicy. Not horrible, but my dad said he would start sweating if he ate more than one (he can't handle spice whatsoever without sweating a ton). 

The carne asada fries were good, but id rather just order more tacos. :) Go to Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"Have all those that I need under one roof, vegetables and meat both together, and it's only 6 dollar ++. Other than that, don't have other to say"}
{"text":"Good al pastor tacos. The guacamole needs more work though. Only thing I disliked were the cashiers who were acting like teenage girls trying to flirt with my husband ... while I was sitting a couple seats away."}
{"text":"Best cheap eats in LV.  I'm from Canada and $2 for an unbelieveably tasty taco, well that's like stealing.
Adobada - my favourite.  Great as they present it or with slices of pineapple ( gotta ask for it )
Tripe - Excellent.  Not hat I expected but really good.
Tongue - also Very Good.
Brain - tasty but not my favourite
Atmosphere - lots of locals and hispanics, always a good sign"}
{"text":"Wow! These are quite possibility the best tacos I have EVER had in Vegas. Get the Al Pastor, it is out of this world."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about their adobada but I think their cabeza is by far the best meat !! Two cabeza tacos and a small order of any meat fries will surely send you straight back to your hotel room with a big smile and a little faint. Gordos is a nice 10 minute walk from encore beach club so stuffing your face here after starving yourself is the best way to end the afternoon"}
{"text":"Legit, no frills, delicious tacos.  All for $2 each.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Surprisingly impressed! Asada was good, Adobado was better, Shoulder was the best. Great flavors. Worth a quick stop for sure."}
{"text":"I could have sworn that I reviewed this heavenly taco joint.  With that said, i must first retract my title for Los Tacos as the best tacos place in Vegas because has El Gordo has stolen it and tucked it away in a far far place.

3 items that will have you mesmerized forever.....Spicy Pork, Beef Tongue, and Beef Head.

The pork is amazingly juicy packed with flavor and sauces that'll make you go up and order 5 more.

The beef tongue is super tender and soft and melts like butter.

The beef head is naturally delicious with a strong beefy taste to it so beware if you're sensitive to smells.  The meat is extra soft as well.

I usually always get tacos of the 3 but venturing out is definitely worth it.  Tostadas and Mulas are not bad options and if you've been here 2312932 times and always order tacos, these are the ones to try."}
{"text":"This is the place late night stop on the Strip. The prices are low 2 dollars per taco and 4 dollars for the specialty items such as the mulas (amazing) and the vampiro. I highly recommend the spicy pork which the cut off of the skewer right in front of you as you order.

I asked the person preparing the food what makes these tacos authentic? his answer \"no sour cream and The Sauce\"  and he was right about the sauce it took the taco to a whole other level.

You must try it #foodcrew"}
{"text":"In addition to my favorite adobada tacos (originating from SD), I've also discovered the adobada fries! It's $5 for a small box and (I think) $10 for a large. You could easily share the large with 3-4 people, even though you may not want to because it's so good! Fries, adobada, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. YUM!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing its just the seating sucks ass vegas best mexican on strip ... just worst seating the food is a 5 * ...seating 0 stars"}
{"text":"The asada taco is very good, but adobada taco is an eye-opening flavor explosion.  We went for a two-taco snack, finished, and got back in line for more.  Every order is freshly made, including the tortilla for the asada tacos.  The whole operation is very efficient, but the wait is still somewhat long due to sheer volume.  Worth it.  So worth it."}
{"text":"Man, I missed Tijuana and their taco stands all over.  Then I walked in to this place and I was transported there.  I loved it. As authentic as it comes."}
{"text":"Unconceivable that a company employee would treat any officer in such a disgrace matter. I will not support a company that allows this behavior.  Will not be eating in any of your establishments."}
{"text":"Note:  The asada line is the LONGEST by far.  After I got in, I probably waited 10-15mins for my Pork tacos, whereas my cousin was there for at least an hour waiting for his steak tacos.

A must-do for your Vegas list, this place is an experience in itself!  North of the Encore/Wynn.

There is a friendly black female security guard who explains the \"system\" to you.  There are several lines depending on what meat you want.  The more exotic meats are quicker, so FYI.  The meat is shave, grilled on the flat-top grill, & tortillas are made right in front of you.  Then after you get your order, you walk up to the cashier to pay. 

I've been to a taco place with a \"system\" like this, but not nearly half as busy as El Gordos.  So needless to say, this place needs a new system!

Asada was tastier than the Pork, but a tad on the salty side.  Guac was delicious!

Minus * because I asked for 1 Spicy + 1 Al Pastor and was given 2 Spicy, not difference between the 2 tacos.  Still good tho..."}
{"text":"Al pastor is amazingly incredible. It is very juicy and i would drive 50 miles to eat it again. Good job guys"}
{"text":"Oh my god Dios mio!!!  The spicy pork tacos are to die for!!  Carne asada one was so so.  If you're white don't be scared to go here.  It's all Latinos but it's so legit.  Like in Mexico.  With their bright lights and loud Mexican music and hospitality.  This place was so poppin line took forever but we'll worth the wait."}
{"text":"This taco spot is legit especially in the heart of Las Vegas.  I can't believe I never seen this place, maybe because I'm always stuck at Palazzo gambling.  I do recommend there Spicy pork tacos.  They even have hardcore security guards on busy days to keep the business running.  They were nice though.  There are separate lines for what type of meat you want.  And I know the Spicy pork line is always the longest.  Tacos are 2 bucks and carne asada fries are 10 bucks.  I had 4 tacos and I was satisfied."}
{"text":"While at work in the casino some random hotel guest walked up to me and asked me if I knew what time Tacos El Gordo opens in the morning.. I guess I just look like the kinda gal who would know. And who loves Mexican food with all her heart. 

Anyway two words: ADOBADA. FRIES.

If I could eat these every day for the rest of my life and not get fat(..ter) I DEFINITELY WOULD.

They freshly shave the grilled spicy pork off of the rotating stack and sprinkle it onto perfectly crispy french fries topped with fresh FRESH guacamole, cheese, and sour cream. Equally delicious whether sober or highly intoxicated. The small size is more than enough for one person. 

Oh and they close at 3 AM and will not let you in after that time. :( make sure you get there before then so you don't have to resort to Denny's."}
{"text":"This taco place is good, but I don't understand the massive hype. Sure, it's fun to watch a guy carve pork off a spit directly onto your taco al pastor. Sure, it's fun to watch a guy chop beef and scoop it onto your carne asada taco. However, that doesn't warrant a five star rating.

Let me be clear, the tacos are delicious. Probably the best tacos in Vegas. Is it the best priced Mexican fast food in Vegas? Not even close. Just because something is $2 doesn't mean it's a good deal. I'd have to buy 5-6 tacos here to become full, whereas one burrito at Roberto's or Fausto's will fill me up at half the price. I rate as much with my wallet as I do with my taste buds. If your restaurant looks like a hole in the wall and has a hole in the wall service system, then I'd better get hole in the wall pricing too."}
{"text":"Way too salty! Coulda been the meat or salsa..Was expecting better from all these reviews..."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is like King Taco in California. The hype is real and this place is not to be missed if you're ever visiting Las Vegas. I decided to come here after working a night shift, thinking that it wouldn't be busy at 10PM. Wrong. This place was super busy. Before coming, beware of long lines and bring at least two other people with you. Meats and orders are separated into three sections. If you're by yourself, you're gonna spend a lot of time waiting in line and cold tacos before you get to eat them. I waited almost 30 minutes before ordering and also got them to-go, which added about 20 minutes. After taking almost 1 hour to get home, I thought to myself \"These better be the best tacos ever\"...and they were!

FOOD: 
Tacos El Gordo offer steak, chorizo, beef (head too), pork (spicy too), and lengua. No chicken. You can get these meats in a taco, mula, quesadilla, tostada, or with fries. I've only had mula's from one place ever so I was soooooo happy to see that Tacos El Gordo makes them. I ordered one carne asada taco and one chorizo mula. I wanted to try the pork and spicy pork but I didn't want to get into two other lines..next time! When chefs ask you \"everything\", this includes cilantro, onions, red sauce, and guac. 

QUALITY:
The meats are flavorful and delicious. Their tortillas are also made fresh to order. You'll see the tortilla lady and you already know when you see the tortilla lady. Although I waited nearly 1 hr to devour my taco and mula, it was worth the wait. 

SERVICE:
Waiting in line is the only downside. I wish they could come up with a better system. Currently, you have to stand in three different lines to order and then pay for your order at another counter. 

ENVIRONMENT:
This place is crowded and it deserves to be since great food is being made. There's outside seating area but be prepared to not find a table. 

Overall, I really wish there was a spot closer I home (southwest) because I would come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"This location is convenient for those on or near the strip. Compared to their other location, this one has two lines for each meat category so the lines go by faster. As I mentioned in my review for the other location, coming here should be a team effort - a few to order the tacos and one to hold down the table. Everyone who stops in Vegas needs to come here!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place, they hand make their taco shells in front of you, and asada fries are the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend if you're in Las Vegas On strip to check them out."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas hands down!!! I always get the pork-adobada Fries  amazing!!!! Let's not forget about the amazing green sauce 

Currently the only place in town I have been able to find Orange Bang ( basically a Creamsicle flavored juice). What is Orange Bang is heaven on earth!!! This place is not fancy at all, but well worth the drive..."}
{"text":"I would wait hours for these tacos! I've had them both in CA and Vegas and I've never been let down. They are to DIE FOR!!! and their pricing is probably the best part of it all! The al pastor tacos with the salsa they throw on top are absolute fire, and the tripas, omg!  I can eat like 8 in one sitting. #noshame."}
{"text":"Brains!!! 

That's what sealed the deal for me as soon as we walked up and I saw the menu. I Immediately ordered six and I wasn't disappointed one bit. 

As with most other taco places I've been to, they had a salsa bar with all the fixings. I usually go to for limes, onions, and cilantro. So, I topped my brain tacos and dug in. They were rich, creamy, and delicious.

As for the place itself, it was clean, the staff was friendly, and packed with people! All a good sign in my book. I'm happy we made the decision to stop. If you're ever in Vegas, you should too!"}
{"text":"excellent tacos.  small place with what sounds like independent contractors selling the food.
only shortcoming, no chicken, no fish, no shrimp.
Pork and 4 kinds of beef.  But mighty good."}
{"text":"Es comida típica mejicana pero creo se encuentra en otros lugares sin hacer tanta fila es buena pero no para,esperar tanto"}
{"text":"I came about a year ago and second time earlier this year and it was AMAZING! I ate there at least twice during my stay. Today 12/08/14 they are no longer there. This is a much shorter visit than other times so I am very bummed out I won't be able to enjoy those amazing tacos. :("}
{"text":"Legit Mexican at a crazy cheap price.  Yum."}
{"text":"A lil overhyped if you ask me I would give 3.5 just cause of the wait but ill round up. The food is good but not worth the insane wait. However, it IS a great addition to cheaper alternative food options in vegas besides china town. Both the adobada and carne asada are good. The adobada line is much shorter and had died down even while we were waiting for carne asada. We coulda stood in the adobada line 3 times in the time it took to even get a carne asada taco. My suggestion if you dont have time you can totally skip the carne asada and just get adobada.

I got a carne asada Mula, which is like a quesadilla cept its not sealed in? You can also think of it as a taco sandwich if one taco is an open-faced sandwich with one slice of bread then the mula is like having two slices of bread and more cheese in between.

 Right now they have two lines for carne asada and two lines for adobada. Due to the popularity of carne asada, they should totally just have 3 lines for that and 1 line for adobada."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas on Easter Sunday and stopped by Tacos el Gordo to eat some tacos because we wanted Mexiacan food. First of all we tried a taco of every meat on their menu and all of them were REALLY  DELICIOUS!!! I would of gave them five stars but the only reason I decided to give them four was because the place was full of customers and I understand maybe because it was a holiday , but the place was packed and they have three different lanes for you to order your tacos depending on the meat you want, so we started  at the line to order carne asada and after we received the tacos then we had to go stand at the line to order lengua, so by the time I got those tacos, my other tacos were already cold and there was only ONE guy serving them and poor guy he was trying his best to be fast and keep the line moving. Another thing is that they need more tables and chairs they only had maybe 10 small tables inside so we had to eat our tacos outside in our car because they don't have tables outside either. Like I said before, the tacos are great and maybe next time I come back it's not a holiday and the service would be faster."}
{"text":"Good food but very long time to wait in line"}
{"text":"so good and worth it just gets a little full but for the most part its speedy although crowded it was better and cheaper than hotel food and close enough to walk"}
{"text":"I'm an uber driver and i drive people to the location on the strip near the wynn.  I happen to run across this location and i just had to try it to see what all the fuss is about.  The tacos were amazing and the cooks were fast.  The only thing i wish is that they would explain or have in english what's in all the menu items.  I do recommend trying this place out and will be back again"}
{"text":"I love Tacos El Gordo, whether I'm sober or drunk. I would say it's actually one of my favorite tacos ever. I especially like this location cause it's right on the Strip by Wynn / Encore. I usually get the cabeza, asada, al pastor, and lengua. Lots and lots of lengua. The meats are all super tender. I hardly use any condiments or toppings. Just some onions, cilantro, lime, and a tad of salsa. The tortilla is good too. Doesn't break like some others do.

The only downside is that there are different lines for different meats, so the best thing to do is divide and conquer. Lines are long, but they move fast. Prices are very reasonable too. $2 - $2.50 max for a taco. I get 3-4 and I'm full, but some of my friends get 8-10!"}
{"text":"The closest to the authentic tacos from mexico there great but the price is kinda high love their adobada fries!"}
{"text":"Great Authentic Mexican corn tacos adobada spicy pork are the best. $2 each, how many can you eat.  Separate lines for different meats cooked in front of you."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had and I'm from LA. Love their beef tongue taco. It's just a little time consuming to get your orders."}
{"text":"BS +++

Apparently one of the GO TO spots in Vegas after hours or during lunch to experience real Mexican  food (not Tex Mex).  This place is in the heart of Eastern Vegas but close to Downtown.  It's a spot I wouldn't think would serve bomb tacos.  But boy was I wrong.   At 1:40am we stroll in with 20 minutes left before closing.  I would think the cooks would be pissed but damn were they all smiles and happy.  There were still people strolling in.  Let me just say the taco meat is amazing. It's on a slow spinning cooker and the guy slicing the meat is precise.  The ratio of meat to veggies is on point.  The food was just right and it was worth the 12 minute drive - speeding through the highway.  I loved how clean and organize this place is.  It's also very clean and the staff are super nice.  I recommend this hands down as one of the true spots of Vegas.  If you are a foodie.  A true to life foodie - you have to experience this restaurant.  The options are amazing (tacos with various meats) and other Mexican staples that will make your panties fall past 12am or during lunch.  This place is famous and I say if you ever go to Vegas go visit one of their three locations.  I highly recommend trying their sodas.  So many great flavors!

{"text":"It just doesn't get much better than this...

SERVICE: 5
AMBIENCE: 2 (but, who cares when the foods this good)
FLAVOR: 5

TIP: \"Try new things...\" 
(*Don't JUST get the Carne Asada! I mean, don't skip it, it's great! But there are several even more flavorful options). 
- ADOBADA: I haven't ever had better... that pineapple flavor mixed with salsa roja, and the cilantro cream on top. WOW! You can even do Adobada Fries... and you should. You definitely should.
- SUADERO: a slow cooked, wonderfully marinated roast beef that melts in your mouth. Unbelievable!
- LENGUA: literally my favorite taco. Yes, it's tongue. And you need some tongue action in your mouth. Trust me. There's not a more tender flavorful cut of beef you'll find.

TIP: \"Enjoy the freebies...\"
- PINEAPPLE: When you order the Adobada, ask for that side of extra pineapple
- PEPPERS: Don't miss the player of Spicy Grilled Peppers and Green Onions.
- RADISHES: Go to the condiment table and grab a baggie of sliced radishes along with some of that fresh squeezed lime juice on them. Perfect complement to a heavy greasy meal.

IN SHORT: Brave the lines... Try new things... Enjoy the freebies... and Tacos El Gordo just might blow your mind!"}

{"text":"BEST TACOS IN NEVADA!! HANDS DOWN!! There's nothing else I need to say. Try them yourself and you will not be disappointed! So good and the service is so friendly and amazing! I will definitely return and will we bringing everyone with me!

I've tried multiple tacos across town, even Taco Y Taco, and Tacos El Gordo BEATS THEM ALL! The price isn't so bad at $2.00 per taco because you get tremendous quality. Their tacos are all ON POINT and makes Taco Y Taco's foods seem pricey at $2.25 per taco and too salty. Highly recommend their Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and Lengua!!"}
{"text":"No frills Mexican street food at its very best! I'm a huge taco whore! Especially street tacos! The tacos I had here were the culinary highlight of my trip to Vegas when it came to \"cheap eats\". The tortillas are house made and everything is made to order. THIS PLACE IS NOT FANCY! This is a true \"mom and pop\" taqueria! No frills awesomeness! Best tacos I've had in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb!!! And the workers are usually nice when I come here. The only bad thing is, it's really hard to come here during lunch time or after club hours because that's when it's the busiest. 
Came here yesterday for a quick lunch, which turned into a rushed one. I was in line for the al pastor for about 30 minutes, & I only had an hour to eat. So I had to rush with eating just so I would have enough time to drive back to work. 

Overall, their food and horchata are delicious! So it's worth it if you're not in much hurry"}
{"text":"Adobado and Asada were the bomb!! Came here on a busy Thursday afternoon but still were able to get our food within 15 minutes even with the carne asada fries. The adobado meat was great but not a big fan of the sauce - wish they could combine the topping of the asada on the adobado meat. The carne asada fries were huge and we got small size - so much meat and they're not those small pieces but they were huge pieces. IT has the same adobado sauce on it with sprinkle of unmelted cheese - too much sauce and not a fan of unmelted cheese on fries. But I would definitely come back for the tacos.

Overall
Taste: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Price: 4/5 - not the cheapest
Parking: 3/5 - lot can be limited"}
{"text":"couple bucks for a great taco on the strip.  they don't have carnitas or chicken but asada is great!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious, though the ordering confused me upon walking in. Each line is specific to what kind of meat you want and it seems like it fluxes to be long for one meat then the other. The service was quick and friendly. The issue we came across was there was no seating but I won't blame a place for being popular. Loved it overall"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo!!! I grew up eating here in San Diego and TJ I am so excited they're in Vegas my absolute favorite place to have tacos in Vegas! You don't know what good tacos are till you've tried this place brings back awesome memories of home! The style of ordering is certainly not for everyone it's unique to \"Tijuana style\" if your new to the experience open your mind and remember the food is on point that's what matters most! I love taking friends to experience tacos in a more authentic way! My favorite is the Asada I do tacos and Mulas, even the fries are great and done right without beans!  The Al Pastor is awesome, I even get tripas once in while everything I've ever tried is amazing!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is a bit of a zoo, even at 2 am. I took the time to skim the Yelp reviews before walking in which helped. I knew about the individual lines for the various kinds of tacos and i knew there would be a language barrier if I didn't speak Spanish. So be it, I can point and smile and I came out with actually more tacos than I wanted...but oh well. The drink station is not very well thought out or placed, you get your cups after you pay . And the cashiers were nice and friendly and the horchata wasn't that bad.  

But it's a taco place..and the tacos...really aint all that. Lengua....not impressed, as it was actually kinda cold when I got to try it...I ended up not eating all of it. Al pastor...was nothing special either. But I really looked forward to the Adobada...and it was the only taco that saved me from going home hungry. If I go back it's the only thing I'll buy again. 

That being said Taco y Taco's adobaba blows El Gordo out of the water...it's not even close. 

Recommendation: If you're stuck on the strip and don't want to pay strip prices it will shut your stomach up. But if it's not late and you can drive a bit, there are much better choices available."}
{"text":"These tacos are the most authentic I've ever tasted in the United states. The pastor tacos are the best! They should find a bigger location because it's always packed."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST GO if you're in VEGAS.  These are probably the most authentic Mexican tacos I have had in the SW US.  They're consistently good every time I go there.  

I always get the al pastor (did you know that \"adobada\" and \"al pastor\" are the same thing?? I just found out not too long ago) tacos and a couple carne asada tacos too. The tortillas are made fresh and you can taste it with every bite.  They're just the right texture and firmness.  And always warm.  The meat is top notch, so much flavor and they put a good amount in each taco.  Top it off with some lemon, red sauce, and a little bit of radish on the side- & kapoweeeeeee.... you've got yourself a BAMF taco.  

There has never not been a line so expect to wait a bit for that goodness.. but so worth the wait.  Their menu is straightforward and simple so the line goes by pretty quickly.

So much appreciation for the people cooking the food and serving it because they work so hard and you can tell!  They're lightning fast with their hands and whip out tacos in minutes.  It's not easy and it's probably super hot back there so PROPS.

will ALWAYS come back !!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos I have ever had, the al pastor is in fact one of the best things I have tasted in my entire life. 

As you wait in the huge line you will see a beautiful spit of seasoned pork rotating gently around a vertical grill. The meat is glistening and popping with spices and fat. The artist serving you your taco toasts the tortillas on a flat bed under the al pastor to soak up all the juicy drippings, before shaving a giant portion of heavenly pork into your taco. If you are wise, you will ask for all the toppings, so that you get a healthy dose of both the green and red salsa, and fresh veggies. Top with lime juice  and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This has become our favorite destination for street tacos and today's visit did not disappoint.  We each ordered our usual - one soda plus a pair each of the adobada (spicy pork) tacos topped with crema, cilantro, pineapple and onion. I requested a complimentary side order of grilled peppers and scallions, but ended up only eating the scallions.  Fresh, tasty and just the right size for a light snack or lunch."}
{"text":"Compared to a year ago when it operated out of this same location, business was underwhelming most likely because there has not been much, if any, advertising. In attempting to correct previous problems with people not knowing which line to stand in to order, there is now a single line which caused a back-up even though there were relatively few people in front of us. My wife and I shared a quartet of adobada street tacos, but the norm this day seemed to be 6 per person. Our tacos were good though not as filled as in the past, but that may be an anomaly attributable to new staff. We also shared a horchata that was heavy on Mexican cinnamon - that's good."}
{"text":"Delicious! Talk about authentic. Lines are always long but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place was a clusterf@*k when we checked it out at 1:00 am on a Saturday night/Sunday morning.  I guess we sort of beat the post-clubbing crowd, but even then there wasn't any type of organization to the lines. I found this spot on Yelp because I was looking for a late night eatery that won't cost me an arm and a leg in Vegas.  Yes, Tacos El Gordo fit the \"affordable\" bill, but I just wish they had signs for each line that was semi-forming inside the restaurant.  The tacos were certainly legit -- they had the typical carne asada and steak, but also served innards like stomach and tripe and brains and tongue.  The servers were friendly and fairly quick.  I enjoyed the tongue taco the most.  I'll probably be back but not during their peak hours, which is anytime between midnight and 4:00 am."}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos de tripa perfectly done. Crispy. ALpastor delish!Asada tacos also very good. Must try."}
{"text":"Are you hungry? 
Is it 1AM?
Do you have $4?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, drive to Tacos El Gordo immediately.

The first thing you'll see is a massive rotating tower of succulent pork.

Next to the pork is a friendly gentleman wielding a sword-sized knife.

They carve the meat into fresh tortillas while you order. 

All the ingredients seem fresh and unprocessed.

If you're looking to get as fat as possible, get a half-order of \"campenchana fries.\"

If you're staying fit, just get a couple of tacos. I estimate them at around 250 calories each, and you'll feel extremely satisfied for $4.

Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they don't really have a signature vegan/vegetarian selection to write home about. 

Several of my friends are vegan/vegetarian, and that means I can't go here as often as I'd like, because there aren't any truly delicious options for them.

But I'm an omnivore and Tacos El Gordo is still the best taco joint I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the great customer service. We had tacos asada and whipped fruit drinks. 
The tacos were delicious.  Fresh tomatoes,  onions, avocados,  salsa and meat seasoned to perfection. 
We went in and had to ask for help placing an order.  Slightly confusing at first. There were 5 ordering stations. Each station had a cook preparing your food to order. The drinks are unlimited and tasty. The whipped drinks were tasty.
The seating is outside under a covered canopy. There were two attendants under the canopy."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bomb. It's exactly the same tacos that you would find if you were living in Guadalajara. I think I spent $14 for 4 tacos and a drink though, so i could be a bit pricey."}
{"text":"It's good but overpriced & overrated, depends which location you are at sometimes it's really not worth the wait."}
{"text":"In my experiance the Las Vegas strip and inexpensive street food has never gone hand in hand. That's was  until my hotel recommended Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is located on the no so nice end of the strip, near Circus Circus and the Riviera. Don't expect anything that you might typical find at your average sit down Mexican restaurant. Here you'll find street food, tacos, tostadas, etc. Couple that with a very nice covered outdoor seating area and somewhat limited indoor seating giving you the best of both worlds, street food with a place to sit down and eat. Here will find a very basic menu of inexpensive fare.

I can highly recommend the spicy pork and steak tacos, the pork being something special which is sliced off a rotating spit as you order. Tacos while small come over stuffed and sloppy with meat, cilantro, onions, guacamole and sour cream. For sure nothing comes out of a can. If you feel adventurous among other things you have a choice of tripe or beef brain tacos. Just keep in mind the menu is very basic, all items in Spanish with most having English translation. Taco's run $2 each. 

Service is very friendly and helpful if you have a question. Lines can be long, but move quickly. Here you'll find locals, not tourists. Long lines of locals are always a good sign, and it holds true here. The place is very clean.

Bottom line, Tacos El Gordo is the perfect spot for lunch or late night after boozing in a local casino, open until 3:00AM. One of my go to stops in Vegas. These dudes bang out seriously good chow!"}
{"text":"Who wants to get food poisoning during your vegas vaycay place is bomb  just do not get the alpastor meat made me sick all night!"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. Go get a couple mulas at the far left ordering station. So so tasty. So tasty."}
{"text":"Best Mexican style tacos in Vegas. Expect to wait in line for a good second though since it is very popular but the wait is worth it!!! 
Al pastor tacos and fries are the best as well as the mulas! These are tacos in quesadilla form!"}
{"text":"Tacos here are delicious. I completely understand the hype and why folks are so down for this place. If it was a little more convenient, I'd go there more often. Here's what I tried: tripa, cabeza, lengua, adobada, and buche!"}
{"text":"literally the most deliciious mexican food in vegas. i've been to the ones toward SD area and Riverside twd the border, and this one is exactly the same. 

those carne asada fries got crack in them, cause im totally addicted and for 5 bucks, you get a wad of carne asada fries, guac, and salsa. 

tacos are made to order, and its super quick. i got my food in like 2 minutes and got 5 tacos. sometimes you gotta live mas ayy?? it can get crowded at times, but even if its a large wait, its worth it. 

the bull head in the back doe...ridiculous! hands down best mexican restaurant in vegas."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had.  The avocado sauce is amazing!! Fresh homemade tortillas and piping hot meat make for a good taco!  Gets pretty crowded but this time I got to walk straight in and order from the line I wanted.  Always an absolute must when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I hail from Southern California so good tacos are plentiful. There is usually a line out the door here,but now I know why, it is a very disorganized system of ordering. Instead of 1area to order,you go to 4 different stations and then to the cashier to pay, so confusing and time consuming. We tried the carne asada,cabeza,lengua,tripa, carne asada fries and quesadilla. The tacos are typical,no special sauce or flavor. The fries was sort of a disaster-the cheese don't melt onto the fries(maybe not hot enough?),they use thin fries, the meat was ok but a little dry.  The interior of the place was not also well airconditioned,it was super hot, outside it was also hot. We tried it out of curiosity but once you know it's hype and disorganization, rather than the quality of food,it feels like a gimmick and is quite disappointing"}
{"text":"Make sure you read the three signs over the service counter before ordering.  It's like a scene from Seinfeld about the Soup Nazi!  You must be in the correct line to order that particular food item.  The helpful cook noticed me eyeing the lightly seared hot peppers in the next line.  He gratefully reached over and snagged a few of them with my order.  Please note:  After ordering, you have to go to the check out person pay on the way out.  The tacos were great and the hot peppers lit me up!  I will stop by here again when in town again."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some Mexican food.  Had the tacos and they were tasty.  Cheap and quick.  Just the way I like it."}
{"text":"this is my favorite place in Vegas, i use to go to the one on the strip but i drove out to this one because that other one closed and its worth the drive...

great food great place!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food at it's finest ... in LAS VEGAS?!?!?!?!

I grew up eating Mexican food (I was the token Asian in my neighborhood), so I spent many days eating all the good stuff from my friends' abuelitas.  Menudo, pozole, chilequilas - I might as well consider myself half Mexican!

I had to yelp a Mexican food place in Vegas, and this one was the first to pop up.  It's just past the main strip in between Caesar's Palace and Circus Circus, and the place reeks of Taqueria (in a good way).  It's not dirty, and the employees are incredibly friendly and helpful.  Btw, no burritos here.  Tacos are mostly two dollars each and you can try the standard meats like carne asada and chicken or you could get down to the nitty gritty and go for the lengua (tongue), suadero (fatty pork shoulder), and cabeza (brain).  What's also beautifully prepared is their spicy pork on a spit.  The process ensures a tasty crisp meat contrasting the tenderness of the pork.

Everything (with the exception of the tortillas) is prepared fresh.  Tons of cilantro, diced onions, and salsa verde (or salsa roja) top off the tacos, and, man are they delicious.  My brothers were looking forward to the buffets of Las Vegas, but when I took them here on our first night, the kept suggesting we come back here.

Great food."}
{"text":"Came back hear again.  The tortilla sizes seemed smaller or same size as other taco restaurants like these =(, however, they still piled on the meats =).  Had the lengua taco, which was ok, and the adobada tacos, which were great like last time.  Next thing to try, adobada fries..."}
{"text":"I love this place but to recommend it to someone I have to be completely honest. The cashier ladies are a bit rude. Worse if you bring up their health code violations, they deny them. The adobada can go either way sometimes good or bad not consistent. The door is hard to open and every time you do you get a gust of wind. Lines are sometimes long but as a popular stop you just expect to wait."}
{"text":"Because Brandon Flowers told me this was his favorite Mexican restaurant I came to check this place out
I do not eat beef, or any red meat, onion or peppers 
But I do however eat poultry and fish. I went here with another neighbor
We enjoyed it. Fast service 
I was able to order a chimichanga the way I like and a chicken quesadilla without the onions 

Parking was easy, it wasn't loud and it's centrally located
I recommend"}
{"text":"Easiest 5 star I have ever given!

If you are a first timer study the boards ahead of time, each station / person has a different meat selection, you want steak it's at one station, pork, it's at another, study those giant menu boards before you walk up!

A must stop when in Vegas and looking for a quick snack...hit Red Rock and hike for a hour or two then get back to the strip and order 4 tacos, it balances out (ha)!

I have only tried the steak and pork so I can only vouch for those, next trip I will branch out and try the others.....except the veggie taco that is!"}
{"text":"This shit fire mane. Dank ass tostadas ! 1st time here and I already wanna go back. Be back tomorrow if anything LoL"}
{"text":"Are you f*kn serious the Spicy Pork tacos are absurd the best taco I have ever had.  Waited in line for 30 minutes but that was the Strip location on Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Delicious is the only words for this place. It does get busy during the weekend and nights, but it is well worth the tiny wait. prices are a bit on the high side for tacos, but the food is satisfying in the best way."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this since my brother always raves about the one in San Diego. We ordered 4 pastor tacos, 13 asada tacos, and  asada fries. We spent over $60. My brother in law was up at the counter with the trays when we paid.  A minute later he walks over to ask for napkins and she told him to bring our food to her because we needed to pay. He told her we already paid and she argued with him. He walked back to the table and she followed him. She saw all of our food and us at the table. He followed her back to the counter and she told him he owed $61 and wouldn't give him any napkins until we paid. He again told her we paid. She asked for the receipt so she could see what we paid for. The amount of napkins she gave us depended on how much food we bought. WTH?!?  Over some thin napkins that you have to use 3 of from the tacos junk falling all over your hands. The tacos were just ok. I've had better. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a must go when we come to Las Vegas, Nevada!!! If you want quality and genuine Mexican Food (tacos, mulas, quesadillas, sopes, tostadas and fries with whatever kind of meat you want) then you'll have to stop by Tacos El Gordo. They came  from Tijuana, Baja California and and can also be found in San Diego and Chula Vista, California. Having been to all of their locations now, I can say the spot in Las Vegas, Nevada on Charleston Blvd is the best! Check out the pics."}
{"text":"Small bites, good food ... Bring friends and conquer each station.  Street taco in Vegas achievement unlocked."}
{"text":"There are 2 different lines: carne asada on one line and everything else on the other line. Carne asada line was hella long; it took us an hour to get the food :/

- Fresh, make on the spot tortillas 
- Tacos are slapped with hella guac!!!
- Everything was good except for tripas (it was burned, hard to chew and swallow) 
- These tacos gave me strength to drink again"}
{"text":"Long lines but worth the wait. After a few days away from SD, started missing my Tacos!!!! Same Vibe like the Spots in San Diego!! I was talking to one of the guys working there and he said he moved from SD to help open the place. LV needed some real tacos!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! an inexpensive alternative to the overpriced food in Vegas.. For $2 a taco you can have authentic mexican tacos in Las Vegas..

My favorites here are adobada (al pastor) and the beef lengua

al pastor which is mexican rotissiere style meat with some onions and just a tinge of guacamole cut straight off the pig...  

lengua is amazing as well... just perfectly soft and each bite is phenomenal

this place is open 24/7 and a great pitstop to make post xs to the hotel"}
{"text":"3 stars . why ? The flavor is amazing even down to the tortilla ! One of the most authentic not authentic but pretty damn close. The asada? A smoked flavor you're sure hard to find any where else. Highly recommend it for people who are visiting our of the western side of the United States. Why the 3 ? What kind of service or way is it to serve tacos PER person . doesn't make sense ? If Sally is in front of you and she wants 3 tacos al pastor. The cook will make it for her but not take ANY other orders until he finishes Sally. So say you want 4 tacos al pastor. Well he could easily make 7 all together so you and Sally can walk away happily. You know like the rest of the world. But oh no not at tacos Gordo. The slow service and constant reviews you read about coming early because it gets busy isn't because it gets busy. Its because of Einstein in the back who came up with the revolutionary idea it making one by one by one by one and have each and every person waiting. That they stick with the same service is just plain well idiotic for a lack of a better word. Of you're coming here pack a basket and a sandwich and prepare to wait as the person taking your order is also COOKING it.

P.s. don't get the green puke that's thrown in top of it. Don't understand where the authentic comes from with the green slime thrown on top"}
{"text":"I'm obsessive when it comes to tacos, and i gotta say, I'm a HUGE fan of tacos el gordo. They are great, they have the authentic taste and feel of any great taqueria in Mexico. I particularly crave about tacos al pastor, and these are amazing, whether you order a plain pastor taco or you try the pastor \"mulita\" (which is a pastor taco in a flower tortilla with a bunch of melted cheese) these tacos are outstanding. Also try the campechana fries, an order of french fries topped with cheese, guacamole, sour cream and a bunch of asada and pastor meet, its heavenly. The place is very good but it sometimes gets very crowded, so chances are in a saturday night you might have trouble finding a table, but its definitely worth it. Also, on weekend nights, you might find a guy outside selling home made donuts, do yourself a favor and try them, they are very good."}
{"text":"In one word: Delicious ... describes food here!
Very simple system. Line up to order food. Choose the meat. Decide whether to add sour cream, avocado, cheese ... then go to another line to the cashier, to order drink, then pay. 
All of this in a mad crazy crowd of people! 
Of course I am talking about at night time crowd, after hours, when thousands of people are looking to grab a bite after night clubbing ...

I don't particularly like the pork tacos. The meat has kind of sweet taste from the pineapple.
Therefore, I choose the beef steak tacos. 
I really prefer the flour tortillas, but they only serve corn tortillas. 
Usually I order 3 tacos. Almost always wanted to order more after eating them, but I don't have the patience to wait in line again! After all the tacos are fulfilling. Kinda addicting. It's almost a habit to eat here on the weekend nights!
Definitely love them!"}
{"text":"I drove from the Strip location here after realizing they moved to this address. I got there around 9pm and there were no tables to sit and the lines took up the whole business. Needless to say, it was like the darn tacos were free! I saw a ton of people dressed up and I wondered if this was a pre and op clubbing spot to get grub at? Personally I wouldn't want to show up at the club smelling like onions but apparently tonight were the Latin Grammys. Here I though going to El Gordo was a new prom tradition but I hear it gets crowned at night regardless of the day. I can totally see that given the tacos are delish. Let's start with the Adobada or Al Pastor as I know them by are one of the most popular kind of tacos in Mexico. Right away you will see this huge trompo roasting with delish meat sliced right into a warm tortilla a \"Taquero\" artisan can prepare for you. I specially love how El Gordo serves them with a signature avocado crema sauce besides the all trimmings of onions, cilantro, salsa and if you're lucky and there's still some left, a slice of roasted pineapple usually dripping juices onto the meat at the top of the trompo. 

There will be another line for different kinds of tacos. My favorite believe it or not are the beef tongue. The meat is not chewy and nasty as people would imagine. It's meat that's as soft as American BBQ brisket, falling apart tender. Try suadero, those are soft chopped meat and usually the 2nd most popular taco consumed in MX. 

Finally, the 3rd lane is reserved for specialties to include sopes and chorizo. I don't particularly enjoy chorizo, I like 
longaniza and this chorizo is a bit over condimented. Everything else deserves a 5 star. The tacos are on point!!!"}
{"text":"Get tacos here. Al pastor, chorizo, whatever. It's all great. It's pretty no frills, but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends to order tacos and was hoping to get out quick. We love Tacos El Gordo and always make it a priority to get some when we're in Vegas. The deduction of 2 stars here is for the poor on-phone customer service and the wait. We had a large party and were hoping that we would have been able to make an order on the phone to come by and pick up. Unfortunately, after calling this location 5 times, we were never able to get a definite answer. 3 of those phone calls were picked up and hung up. So a few of us decided to just gather everyone's order and go. We chose this location because it is off the strip and we had hoped it would have had shorter lines so we can get in and out quick. But when we got there around 6:30 PM, the lines were extremely long and we were there for roughly about 45 minutes just to order and go. Granted we were ordering 70+ tacos and some extra, we still felt like the lines took quite a while for us to get just to the front. I personally don't know how much longer or shorter we would have waited if we were on the location at The Strip. But I have never had issues with waiting in lines for this long at that location. If anything, I always get in, order, sit down and eat, and get out in maybe even 20 minutes. Anyway, the waiting experience here threw us off. But the tacos were still great! Very tasty and a lot of flavor. Love the sauces. I personally enjoy the buche and lengua tacos! Still great to eat even after getting back from the club at 5 AM. I definitely recommend Tacos El Gordo. But just be wary of the location and wait times."}
{"text":"Super disorganized with a long wait to order... You are frustrated until you take your first bite, then you just don't care and decide to do it to yourself all over again. The food is just that good!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is good.  And popular...possibly too popular for its own good.  Not unlike their other locations, showing up here means waiting in line since every one also wants to get their gordo on.  I came by before 12 noon on a weekday, and it was still 25 minutes before I had my food.  Can't blame them for being successful, but it is something to be aware of if you're in a hurry.

Other than the long wait, the food here is consistent with their other locations.  I still enjoy their al pastor, lengua, and cabeza tacos a lot.  I'm sure that whatever your favorites are at their other locations, you'll be just as happy with them here.  This location is super clean, but also small.  From memory there may only be 12 tables, so you may have to eat outside or in your car.  Other than that, if you've been to Tacos El Gordo before, this location will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is a fine option. I wouldn't seek it out, however admiring I am of the ethic of a place that expands from Tijuana. 

I had lengua, cabeza, adobada and asada. Nothing jumped out as being anything better than good Mexican fast food. The asada was particularly uninspired. I suspect that that the meat is cut into small pieces before being marinaded and cooked. This method sacrifices juiciness and flavor.

Of the remaining three, lengua was probably the best. It'd be nice to counter the fattiness with something more bracing. 

In any event, Tacos El Gordo was fine. I'd go back. It's just nowhere near the level you'd expect from the median review, and nowhere near the best I've had in NY, CA, or even Chicago."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I am looking for when I want tacos. I'm so glad I found it. Don't be afraid to eat the cabeza, if you had barbacoa before somewhere else this is what it is really supposed to taste like. I can't say enough about this place. I may be biased since I am stuck in the land of unauthentic mexican food but this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Best tacos period! Sometimes I crave it so much that I book my vegas trip. Doing so I make sure i stay at the Encore instead of Wynn so it's that much more convenient to get to a couple of times a day. I mean, here in LA there are tons of good taco places but.. This is something else! Tacos are plain  the only thing is it can get super packed at times so takes a few minutes in the line to get to order but well worth the wait each and every time!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas.  I've visited this place in Mexico and San Diego (it's a small chain), and this place is just as good.  The al pastor is their best.  The buche is too wet for my liking.  Make sure they have handmade tortillas or it's not the same.  The tacos are small and expensive, as I can eat 5-6.  With drink, that'll come out to around $15.  Get a plate of free scallions and jalapenos, you just need to ask.  

Very confusing ordering process for a first timer, as there are separate lines for the al pastor and other meats.  This location is very busy which ensures a quick turnover of their food, keeping things fresh and safe.

The quality of the food qualifies for a 5 rating, but factoring in the price nets this place a 4."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, unfortunately the restaur at was out of basic meat am choices and the check out pay was unorganized. The restaurant needs direction in regards to the management process. Also they didn't have chorizo on a sat night !"}
{"text":"Two white girls walk into a taco bar...

Okay, so I'm not white, but pretty darn close, especially when I walk into a place like this. I've never wanted to know how to speak Spanish so badly in my life...yet my bilingual skills are no bueno. 

So anyways, how did we end up here for lunch with our four kids? I'll tell you how. I walked by this place multiple times, to and from our hotel. I stopped one night and looked at the menu. I was tempted to go inside and order, but I didn't. Anytime of day that I walked by there, there was always people there. It could be 11AM or 11PM, always a line. That's another good indicator of good food. 

Finally, on our last day in Vegas, we decided to eat at this spot. Looking at the menu, I had decided that I wanted the al pastor tacos, my friend went with it and wanted the same. The kids got quesadillas and french fries. While trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, I realized that you have to stand in the the right line for the type of meat you want. I was able to order the quesadillas and french fries with the guy once I got there. 

It's pretty good food, I enjoyed the tacos I had. My kids were satisfied with their food too. I mean, you can't really complain, $30 for six people's lunches...one of the better deals on the strip. I'd visit here again, these tacos sure beat Jack In the Box tacos after you've partied a little too hard, haha."}
{"text":"In reading the reviews a guy wrote exaclty what I was going to right. 

THE BEST TACO PLACE IN VEGAS. THE ONLY PLACE BETTER IS GOING TO MEXICO!!!!

I discovered this place on Saturday and I have been there 3 times already (it's only Tuesday). I drove from my job at Town Square to the one behind Encore just to have lunch. Took 3 co-workers with me and they all agree.

You can bring your own beer. They dont sell beer. Security will simply hand you a brown bag for your drink!

The only thing missing is a big pot of home made beans."}

You can walk in with a beer or drink. Security will simly give you a brown bag.

Toursist and locals all eat here it seems like because it's lawys busy.

{"text":"By far the best taco place I have been to. We went during a busy lunch time and it was a little hard to find parking but it was all worth it. The asada was perfect! I wish they had different salsas but overall it was good. Don't be intimidated by the long lines, they move pretty fast."}

 I love the carne asada fries!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas!!! The line is worth the wait. I have too come every time I visit Vegas. 
The guys on the grill work hard. Carne Asada is grilled perfectly and season well(but not overly salted)"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos al pastor. Definitely the best I've and in awhile, and I travel to Mexico often. Straight outta Tijuana too! Stop here because it is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"I came to Vegas for a trip and stopped by to try there famous tacos out! Trust me lines are crazy here. If you speak Spanish you'll have a way of getting in easier than other just because the workers only speak Spanish to the security guards. So, going back to what I was saying before its nothing special."}
{"text":"The place was small. I was honestly too drunk to remember how it taste like but I remember telling my friend that the pineapple on the tacos adobadda  were delicious and I want to come back.


TIP: ask for pineapple"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos at a good price, but expect to wait.

I went at lunch time and had 3 tacos: al pastor, carne asada, and lengua.  All were good, but al pastor was the best, IMO.  There was a big line, but the well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas period!!! 

There's enough parking and room to sit.  It's pretty simple to order but beware that there are two lines.  One is specifically for AL Pastor tacos and the other is for other meats for those who like: buche,  tripas etc.  Make sure to request some grilled onions and jalapeños, you can't leave without them.  These people work very hard for what they do.  Yeah they're just tacos but meh!!!  These are authentic Mexican tacos.  The tortillas are not the usual white corn tortillas.  The green sauce that they put on the AL Pastor tacos is SOOOOO bomb!!! 

They're always busy, so expect to be in line for a couple of minutes.  

Oh and don't forget to leave them a well earned tip!! 

CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"It was really good and very reasonable prices. Fast serving even though long lines.
Tacos are so good and I liked the pickles too."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place, first stop when I come into town, and last stop before we depart.  

Damn good guacamole salsa! Perfect tacos, love them all, especially de Buche! Adobada fries are a must have. Perfect place to re-fuel after a long exhausting day at the tables. Bring your caguama to keep the party going after you indulge in some of the best tacos you will ever have."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go when you're hungry in the middle of the night, or if you're hungry from drinking & clubbing! Up the street from DTF & best thing about it: open 24hours! You can't beat that! I would have this any day over whatever else is open midnight or later!"}
{"text":"Was told by all the locals to stop by here for amazing, authentic street tacos. I don't know why I was expecting to be blown away (coming from Texas, home of the famous Tex Mex), but it just tasted like any other street taco you can find in Dallas. There sure was quite a wait, so be prepared to have all your afternoon plans cancelled or delayed because there is no way you'll get in and out of there in less than an hour."}
{"text":"When you are in Vegas and craving legit Mexican food you have to check this place out. Being from San Diego i am used to good street tacos and Mexican food so when i saw they had some locations down in San Diego i was happy to check it out. The line was out the door both times i went, but they are worth the wait! When you walk in they have different lines depending upon what type of meat you want to order. 

They have Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Pollo Asada, Adobada, Suadero, Cabeza, and Lengua. They offer tacos, fries, tortas, and tostadas. It took a while to figure out what i wanted to get, but i ended up going with the fries. I got the al pastor fries and they were topped with cheese, salsa, a guacamole creme sauce and onions and cilantro. You can get the fries in either a regular or large size. The first time i came i got the regular size and it was do dang good i cam back and got the large size! Both times i went the fries were just so tasty and the salsa wasn't spicy and added a very good flavor to it! 

The best part is there is a liquor store next door so you can get some food and go grab some beer or something to drink and head back to your hotel room to enjoy in peace! Awesome place to go and extremely affordable compared to other places around!"}
{"text":"Lo mejor amazing!!! line was sooo long but worth waiting !! Don't let the line stop you !!! I tried the carne asada tacos and carne asada fries que Rico !!!wow!!!!! Definitely will be going back wish that they had this in Arizona!!! I went back while being the weekend n Vegas twice !!! Was a MUST !!!!"}
{"text":"Experience:
Tacos el Gordo. Everyone in Vegas knows about tacos el Gordo. It's not your typical restaurant. For someone who is not used to real Mexican taco ordering process, it can be a little confusing. 
There are lines for each type of meat/food items. You order from the person who is prepping the food fresh off the grill. After you have ordered, you take your food to the cashier after pumping your tray amongst everyone else who is eagerly waiting for their food. The restaurant is always always packed because of its popularity . I call it the Mexican DMV. 

Food:
The food is delicious! My favorite is the tacos al pastor which derives from the Middle East when migrants moved to Mexico. (Not a lot of people know this) the carne asada is really good. The food is always made fresh.

Technology optimization:
The restaurant could use help with their technology and accepting payment options like Apple Pay and not charging for the payment method. The cash register is the same one that you can find at the public library. It's 2016 in America, let's move along Gordo!

Overall:
Bring all your friends here! Highly recommend it and you can never go wrong with the food here! Yum!"}
{"text":"Holy great good god this is the best pastor I've ever tasted. Don't even bother with the asada. I recommend getting a quesadilla with pastor, the cheese is grilled and primo. I wanna die."}
{"text":"This location does not detract from the second location near San Diego. I want to eventually make it to the one in Tijuana. This one is off the strip, but the lines still aren't any shorter! I'd say it is worth the wait! This place has the best tacos! I also definitely recommend the vampiro (it's pretty much a fried taco-shell sandwich with cheese, meat, and the fillings). The carne asada (beef) comes with guacamole, but the al pastor (spicy pork) comes with a different topping. The carne asada fries are also a good move to split among friends -- huge portions! If you're craving Mexican, this is the spot to hit up! The world needs more tacos like Tacos El Gordo!"}
{"text":"A altas horas de la madrugada comer estos tacos te da para seguir la fiesta! muy ricos pero mucha fila."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times, every few months or so. It's fairly small, and depending on what time you decide to go, it might be SUPER packed! The first few times I went, the lines were long and everyone was waiting for a table but luckily we got one as soon as a few people left. I started going around 3-4 PM on Saturdays and there isn't a line and many tables are open so that's a plus! 

There are three different lines, each depending on which meat you want so it might get tricky especially if some people have never been there. The cashier is on the side so once you get your food, you pay, then you can sit anywhere you like. They also have a little condiment bar for limes and radishes!

The best tacos in town - hands down. I only eat al pastor but it is extremely juicy and always made to perfection. I love their tortillas and the sauce they put on top of it."}
{"text":"A delightful hole-in-the-wall that I had bookmarked before embarking on our epic Vegas trip. And quite honestly, probably the best tacos I've ever had. I went with the asada and pastor (spicy pork). The lowest cost meal we had in Vegas (by far), and maybe the freshest and tastiest as well!"}
{"text":"My coworker recommended this spot to me.  On a friday night it is busy but man this spot is LEGIT.  Order the lengua, carne asada, and adobada tacos.  I can live here as they also offer carne asada fries.  It is a huge box, and man it can feed an army of 4 starving Californians.  I would come here again and again.  Super fast, good, authentic, and FUN. Drink when in Vegas but don't drive."}
{"text":"Best thing to eat in LV
Worth the wait - busy place though 
A must stop for LV now 
I'm from La and we have great tacos and this place is legit"}
{"text":"The food is yummy, but the line...... then the seating...... no thanks! If you want good mexican come here, but be ready to wait in a literal crowd."}
{"text":"BOMB.COM! This place is absolutely amazing and so worth the wait even at $2 a taco. Everything is on point. I will say I was disappointed with the quesadilla, but only because it's tiny and seems more like a taco; nonetheless, it was delicious. My favorite item was the Vampire on a tostada instead of a tortilla. In general, the tacos (pollo, carne asada, pastor), mulas, vampires, and quesadillas are excellent! The only item I wasn't too happy with was the taco de buche. I've had better and it's greasy. Some of you may not be pleased with the wait and having to battle for a seat. You'd be missing out if that's what is turns you away from this gem of a place. Overall I will take this over a buffet any day. Muy bueno ;)"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal when it comes to authentic Mexican tacos. Other than Vegas, I think their only other location is in TJ, so that's how you know it's legit. I will always try my best to come here during every Vegas trip. This location is also way better than the Charleston one because the lines aren't as long (still pretty long though, but not nearly as bad), there is plenty more seating and space, and most importantly, the tables are away from the line so you aren't eating surrounded by hungry people waiting in line! My only knock is the set up because you basically have to wait in different lines for different meats which is a bit of a challenge, but as long as you have enough people in your party, each person can wait in separate lines. The carne asada line is always the longest so be prepared to wait for that one.

Each taco is about $2 which really isn't all that bad and they have all kinds of meats. I usually stick with the carne asada because I've tried the cabeza and that was a little too fatty for my taste. I always also get a mulita while I'm here because I have yet to find a place that makes one that tastes just as good! It's $4 and I usually get full off of one of those and two tacos. I definitely recommend it. Also be sure to ask for extra cebollas on the side! It goes great with everything here."}
{"text":"Tacos were top notch. Had the carne asada and el pastor...great flavor!  Reasonable prices for the Strip.

Side note -- I left my backpack there and panicked once I got to the hotel. I called and the cashier had it--with my son's ipad and stuff.  When I got there she cheerily returned it saying \"I remember you!\"

Thank you for the great eats and honest service!!!"}
{"text":"Since moving to LA, I've learn what authentic and good tacos are and Tacos El Gordo is one. Made to order and right in front of you. Though they seem little every taco is packed with meat. We got greedy and ordered too much. And the fries - warning - it's a whole lot of food.

Cheap, authentic and filling. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Hot d*mn! Best carne asasa fries I have ever had in my life. Wow wow wow! Ooooh and I love the different choice of meat. They were all delicious! Highly recommended for food orgasm!"}
{"text":"Personally these are my favorite tacos. They are fairly small but that it the actual size that  tacos shops in Mexico will serve them as. There is a different line depending on what you would like to order, so make sure to look up at the signs so you dont end up in the wrong line. There are many different tacos options, such as carne asada, lengua, adobada, chicken, also quesadillas and fries with your choice of meat plus cheese.

Drink choices vary as well. You can do your regular fountain drinks, drinks in bottles, or Mexican drinks such as Horchata, Jamaica, and Tamarindo."}
{"text":"Came here around 530pm and wasn't expecting a huge line. It can get so busy that you wait outside the store. No worries as security let's you in accordingly. There are different lines for the meats so one person gets the adobada (2) which is flavorful and you should get this. It didn't knock my socks off but still good. Carne also not as delicious and sorta dry but still ok. We got two but I could have split 1 since we split small size of carne asada fries. Fries are crunchy so be sure to get. Half order is still lots of food for two but for any bigger group, get the large."}
{"text":"Best Tacos EVER! That green sauce is magic in my mouth."}
{"text":"There is much more on the menu we haven't tried. We tried the Asada and the pastor, but LA is still the best!"}
{"text":"I had better 

This meat was eeeeh not  such of fan

I give it a 1 only because I liked the tortillas

The quesadillas sucked ass never will I ever go again 

There's nothing good about this place

 Maybe just the name"}
{"text":"This place was worth the 11 minute walk from the Fashion Show Mall, right pass the Encore/Wynn hotel at the very north end part of the main Vegas strip. I sought out this place based on its glowing reviews so I had to try it. We got there around 3pm on a Sunday afternoon and there was a line but it moved pretty fast. I decided to try the Asada Taco, Abodada Taco and a small order of the Abodada fries. They were all packed with flavor. I was happy I made the trip. They have about maybe 15-20 tables and maybe 2 were available when we were ready to sit and chow down. They are busy and it makes sense why since they offer good tasting fast food for a great cost. Service was also very friendly. I'm a happy customer. :)"}
{"text":"Al Pastor. Enough said. :D
Yelp won't let me post unless I have more to say...
Tacos is life."}
{"text":"Yes, I drive all the way from Long Beach to Vegas for tacos!  Why? Because my LV buddy and I have an on-going competition to find the BEST tacos on the cheap.  Win for Vegas!  I used to be loyal to Pepe's across town, but El Gordo is my new fave.  SO YUMMY!!

Carne asada tacos: A+++
Tacos el pastor: A+++
Service: Fast and friendly.  I love it when they speak Spanish to my friends and then switch to English for me.  Hey, hablo espanol tambien!

If you're converting from Los Tacos across the parking lot, the tacos at El Gordo might look a little small in comparison.  But don't be fooled!  They have five times the flavor and are super cheap so you can buy 13 if you want.  I get my tacos with EVERYTHING and they're delicious, but you can ask for no onions if you're a wimp (like two of my friends).  The tortillas are fresh and sooooooooo yummy.

We'll be driving back to LV for more tacos for sure!"}
{"text":"YUMMY tacos with fresh made tortillas.
I always try to stop by tacos el gordo every time I'm in Vegas. The price is decent, and everything is made fresh.. including the tortillas! 
Downside and what I wish they would fix, is the wait! 
They had a security guard stand at the door to control the amount of customers to go inside because the line was long.. basically, there are different lines for different type of meats you are going to order. The al pastor line seemed the quickest because the guard kept letting people who wanted that meat inside first. Whereas the carne asada and chorizo line was the longest and barely moved. But as I got to the front of the line, I realized that the customers that said they were getting the al pastor meat and were let in first were actually jumping lines once inside, therefore making the other line longer. 
Another downside to this is, because there are different lines for different meats, the tacos for quicker line will get cold while you (even if you split up with your buddies and wait in different lines) wait for the other tacos..
Would i go back for the tacos.. yeah.. 
do I want them to fix the line system.. heck yeah!
*tip: ask for foil to cover the tacos you've ordered..they will look messier when you eat them, but will maintain some heat while you wait for the tacos in the slower longer line."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IVE EVER HAD!

Every time I come here they are always so busy. I can see why, the quality of the meat is so good! I tried their carne asada fries and they were the best I've ever had. You also must try the carne asada tacos too! 

Prices are a little high but it's definitely worth it. :)"}
{"text":"I ate their Tacos Al Pastor and their Lengua and it is really good.  A bit of a line on a Tuesday night but very tolerable."}
{"text":"They have really yummy awesome tacos and carne asada and/or adobada fries here! All are made fresh cooked right in front of you. This location is on the south east corner of Losee and Cheyenne by the I-15 S. 

There are 3 lines to choose from and are specifically depend on what you order. The right lane is usually if you order any of their pork meat and the left lane is for carne asada. I'm usually on the lane for their pork meat.

Lines tend to be long depending on the night. The workers here serve quick. 

I usually order the capechana fries which is a combination of both carne asada and adobada meat and on top of that with cheese and sauce. I also get their adobada tacos.

When you're done ordering you pay at the cashier and that is where you could pick up your drinks or any salsa. 

There is plenty of room to sit. There is 2 dining rooms full of tables and chairs."}
{"text":"The best Tacos in Las Vegas!!! specially Alpastor the best!!..is really worth the big lines.."}
{"text":"My lengua was not fully cooked and honestly gross. The ordering is very weird and annoying. I'm not one to complain a lot, but the food is not worth the hassle of ordering and paying at a seperate part. Especially cold food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican anything I have ever put it my mouth! Don't be intimidated by the line just shut up stand there and wait for it!"}
{"text":"Vegas is chock-full of authentic Mexican joints, from taco carts to sit-downs, and of course, Tex-Mex. I was told about this place about a year ago, but I didn't actually visit until I was being carted around by a Latina friend and we ended up here about a week ago.

I've been back twice since  the Al Pastor is to-die-for. This huge slab of meat, get this - crowned with a pineapple -, is on a vertical spit being continuously roasted and sliced from. The result is juicy, flavorful, and seared perfection. The cilantro sauce is a great compliment, although you can opt out of you want to taste the meat more clearly.

8 tacos and 2 drinks ran us under $20, which is a steal in my opinion. I ate 5 and she had 3. We were both sufficiently stuffed. The carne asada didn't wow me as much, but I think it may have just been overshadowed by the Al Pastor 

Do yourself a favor and check this place out next time you're in the area. Just be prepared to wait if you come around lunch, and especially dinner time."}
{"text":"Being a taco connoisseur I had to make my way here while in town. Very popular restaurant frequented by tourist. Had the asada, cabeza, buche and adobada tacos. Everything was average and the tortillas were too thick and took away from the taste of the meat and salsa. If you are nearby by all means hit this spot but no need to go out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"Bomb as tacos as I expected similar to the tacos u find south of the border, the only thing would be nice if the tortillas were a lil bigger and if it wasnt that expensive.  Other than that its tha bomb"}
{"text":"The place was not that busy, you have to order your tacos wait for them (the taqueros put the sides on the tacos as their wish) tacos looked over served because of the amount of onions and cilantro and the sauce, I think you should be able to decide how much and if you want any at all, a salsa bar would be awesome since some meats don't par with some meats and viceversa, overall the food was good just not the right way to serve them"}
{"text":"I had this bookmarked for the longest. Always wanted to come here, but never stopped by on my other trips. Walking back from Circus Circus and saw it so had to stop in. It wasn't very busy so that was good. Kinda confusing with the ordering system and paying. Why not just have a cashier to take the order and just have them make it, Why make it so difficult? Order your food and collect them and the walk all the way to cashier. Lucky it wasn't busy when we went.

We got 2 al pastor tacos, 2 lengua tacos, small carne asada fries & 2 horchatas. I thought everything was okay. Didn't blow me away.

I'm glad I tried it. Maybe will come back to try it again, but won't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"BOMB ALWAYS! Sometimes they need to slow down and add there special sauce on my tacos properly, but never anything negative to say about tacos El Gordo"}
{"text":"The tacos and tostadas were great! Everything was fresh and made to order. Be sure you're ready to order when you walk up to the counter, and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Not at old location on the strip.  Now about 3 miles away on Charleston, towards downtown. This one more crowded than the strip location."}
{"text":"Lines are ridiculously long! Waited for and hour in the \"Asada Line\" (totally not exaggerating) & honestly it wasn't even worth the wait. The meat had chunks of fat and was very oily. I asked for just salsa with no onion or cilantro and the salsa had chunks of onion and cilantro because everything is mixed up. I was expecting something totally different."}
{"text":"This place is like a street taco truck, but indoors. The line situation is time-consuming and inefficient, but once you get up there, they're very quick. We sat outside so no wait for a table. 

Lengua, tripa, and sesos tacos were great! Filled with meat and toppings. I even took a bite of the pork belly taco and enjoyed it (don't like pork). Skip the flan though."}
{"text":"La verdad cuando empezaron estaban muy ricos pero ahora dejan mucho q desear han bajado mucho la calidad de los tacos  no creo q regresare"}
{"text":"Nice surprise on our last visit to Vegas on finding a traditional taco place.  Don't be put off by a large crowd.  The line goes fast as it's an eat and run type of place.  

They do put quite a bit of salsa which took away from the meat of choice. I would ask for a side if that's an option."}
{"text":"A must have every time we go to Las Vegas. Tacos are regular street taco size kind of pricey but the taste has the Tijuana taste that I crave from my childhood. 

They have separate lines for the different groups of tacos, so we always stand in 2 lines at once to get our tacos we like chorizo, carne asada in one line and tripas, buche, and lengua in another. They also have al pastor and other options these are just our favs."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out. Not all that.
Asada tacos are too salty. Not good for my cholesterol.
Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A go-to on every LV trip. Simply the best I've ever had outside of California. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Some of the best street tacos I have ever had. The spicy pork tacos are amazing. They are small but only 2.25. Could easily eat 5 of them and be mostly full."}
{"text":"I'm so depressed, I just spent 9 bucks on 4 small tiny tacos, I miss my el toro meat market from Santa ana. 

These tacos are tiny and expensive I wont be coming back here, rip off. I'm still hungry!!!!!"}
{"text":"This ain't no el Gordos tacos

This is flakitos tacos 

Or tiny tacos 

They should change the name to tiny expensive flakito tacos"}
{"text":"I've had tacos from TJ and these come pretty much right up with them. You can tell the tortillas are made legit hand pressed tortillas and all their meats are amazing! Tacos de lengua were definitely my favorite! The only complaint I would have is that they have different lines for different meats so you can order them all at one location, which makes it very difficult if you want to try one of everything. But anything you try is good so take your pick and choose wisely which line you stand in."}
{"text":"The flavor and authenticity of the carne asada tacos were spot on! And you can't go wrong for the price, but this place loses stars bc my tortilla was cold and a tad hard. I'm sure if it was warm and fresh off the grill this rating would have easily been 5 stars."}
{"text":"They are okay but sometimes the tortilla cools down fast makes it seem like it has been sitting out ."}
{"text":"If there were one thing I could eat for the rest of my life, it would be adobada damn tacos at this place! Fast service, marinated to perfection, fresh toppings, can't complain."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had. The steak tortillas were amazing. Both the steak and tortillas are made fresh right of the grill. Steak tortillas are $2 each. They come with diced tomatoes, onions, guacamole, and cilantro. The chefs are extremely fast and efficient. The employees were very nice and welcoming. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat on the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Bar none best pastor in Las Vegas! Authentic and delicious! I am a taco cotnnesiour! If you haven't eaten here yet...give it a shot! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco restaurants!! It's as authentic as it gets... I ordered myself 4 tacos and they all tasted so good!! You pretty much can't go wrong with anything there. But if you don't know what to order, try the steak and the al pastor!! Yummmm."}
{"text":"Sooooo good, authentic delicious tacos every time. Just they way you were supposed to eat meat."}
{"text":"The tacos are soo tasty and good. I have to come eat here every time I come visit Vegas."}
{"text":"We waited almost an hour in line!!!

Carne Asada Fries!!! WOW Would def get them again!

Wish we coulda tried pork tacos!

Will go back when it's not so busy, next time I'm in Vegas!

Thank you for an amazing Vegas must! Keep up the hard and excellent work!"}
{"text":"Everything here is so cheap, well at least on the strip. 
It was crowded at 8pm, but the line moved quickly. I enjoyed every bite, there's not a moment I'm not chewing on meat. 10/10 would come back again."}
{"text":"Okay I've heard about this from so many people that I finally had to try it. Unfortunately the location on the strip is closed now but they have this location near downtown. Interesting way to order, just go down the line until you hit the register with a tray full of food. Seriously great tacos and I'll make sure to always make the drive or taxi for this meal when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"First of all...this is what a taco is supposed to be like! LOVE tj style tacos! It was so yummy! However, since I grew up in San Diego, I do feel that the Tacos El Gordo in Diego is better, but for out of California?! This place is pretty spot on, satisfied my need for tacos...

Spend your money here...it will taste better then some buffets (ahem Planet Hollywoods suck)

My fave is the Carne asada and the hubbys was the pork."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was packed to the brim.  Chose to stand in the Adobada line since it was the shortest and seemed to be moving the fastest.  Would have preferred to try the Asada but wasn't worth the wait.  After about 15-20 minutes of waiting in a line in a hot and crowded room, we get to the front and I ask the guy what else I can get in the line and he said he would recommend the beef shoulder.  We ended up getting 4 Adobada tacos and 4 beef shoulder tacos.  I was extremely skeptical because I just didn't think it was worth the wait and being from LA, I've had what I considered great tacos before.  Well, this place topped them all by a large margin.  I would recommend both tacos that we got.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and cut fresh, and the Adobada was cooking on the vertical spit.  The Adobada was perfectly cooked with a smoky flavor that I don't think is reproducible.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and tender and would take too much time to do.  There is a wait but it is well worth it.  This place is the blueprint for how a taco joint should be run.  Quality food, preparation, and selection.  Effing amazing!"}
{"text":"New location, same great tacos.

I got some carne asada tacos, cheese quesedillas with corn tortillas, and beef shoulder tacos.

The carne asada tacos had a nice grilled flavor while being tender, and were topped with fresh tomatoes, onions, and chunky avocado. The cheese in the quesedilla were grilled directly on the griddle and had a nice nutty flavor to them. The beef shoulder tacos were really moist with fresh cilantro, onions, and topped with a red sauce. The green sauce I got on the side actually had a little bite to it. Everything tasted excellent.

I'll definitely be coming back here since it is closer to my part of town, and while they are a new location they are still serving great tasting food."}
{"text":"Okay so I went to Vegas for my friends' birthdays and you know the drill in Vegas. But this, this was the highlight of my trip! Best freaking tacos I have ever tried and I am from Southern California!!!!!!!!
WARNING: YOU WILL GET FOODGASM FROM THEIR ADOBADA TACOS. It might be the best $2 you have ever spent if you love tacos. Order more than what you THINK you want. You won't regret it. 
I only got 3 adobada's and they were closing so I couldn't get to order more D:  
Their tortillas made from scratch is nothing like you have tasted before. SO FRESH!!! 
I want to go to Vegas just for these tacos!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was sober but was in a blackout when I saw how many choices of tacos there were. Crushed them in record kobayashi time"}
{"text":"We heard about how good the food is here. We didn't mind the 45 minute wait, but when we order Carne asada fries and Carne asada tacos, I expect Carne Asada on the fries, we thought it was in the middle of all the sauce and cheese but NO MEAT. We're from out of town and we picked up our food and brought it back to our hotel and had to put our Carne asada taco meat on our fries to get the full experience. Really good food, can't complain about that. Just wish they would check the order before giving it out."}
{"text":"Here for the 2nd time! Long line @ 4pm. Cooks messed up on the order and I had to wait an extra 10 min or so to get my order right. The carne asada wasn't as good as San Diego. But in comparison to all the tacos I have tasted lately.... still so delicious. 
The lemon / radish bar super clean. Staff polite. The restaurant was clean. Everything was amazing. I had 6 carne asada and my wife had 5 de pastor. I give it a 5 taco rating."}
{"text":"it's ok, it not great, no seasoning in the meat, this place is very busy i have no idea why, it can't be the food. but if your drunk and hungry and don't care you'll fit right in."}
{"text":"The lines are always long and unorganized! I actually liked the way the lines worked before where it was just one long line. The line with asada is always long but other are shorter. The portions for fries are pretty large. 1 can easily get stuffed off a half order. However, they couldn't add pico de gallo on the fries which was disappointing. The meat is good and authentic but they don't have pollo."}
{"text":"The best AL Pastor EVER.  Long lines but worth the wait.  Carne asada is really good too."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that Tacos El Gordo is EXTREMELY clean for a mexican restaurant, and I say this with all my love for mexican restaurants and mexican food. 

Now that we got that out of the way, the tacos are pretty amazing.  I had the lengua (tongue) tacos, and I must say they were probably the best tongue tacos I have had by far, and I have had quite a few lengua tacos.  The tongue was prepared to the almost-perfect texture, and as my dining companion has described it, the tongue \"was clean\" - pure tongue meat. 

And, of course, the adobada tacos were also very delicious.  The grilled pineapple highlights the flavors of the meat and becomes a pleasant surprise in the mouth.  

We also had the carne asada, which I thought was quite tasty; however, it was not spectacular.  

One thing about Tacos El Gordo is that it is a bit pricey compared to its competition.  At $2.50 a pop for the lengua taco, it is definitely on the high-end side.  

Then again, you get what you pay for!  Me gustan tacos!"}
{"text":"The best adobada tacos, perfect! Like to have the green onions \"asadas\" they were delicious. Also had a lengua taco and was very good. It can be confusing when ordering or if you want to try carne asada or chorizo, you have to get to different lines.. Also another line to pay and in the mean time the tacos can get cold.."}
{"text":"This place is crazy. Gotta be in different lines and theres people everywhere gotta say tho the tacos are pretty dang good. 

This is a must stop for any of you visiting vegas."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? I walked in here today and there was no line for any of the meats. So of course I had to get the Adobada.  If you don't try one of these make sure that you leap off the top of the stratosphere afterwards. Mind blowing good. 
The ladies at the register are always very sweet and quick and the guys behind the counter making the tacos are unbelievably fast. I've never tried anything but the tacos here but I could imagine the fries covered with this meat or any of the others would be phenomenal. Don't try the location on Las Vegas Blvd. In my opinion you're just going to get a lot of the local strip traffic and a short drive if you are in North Vegas is well worth lines of people who don't quite know what they want. 
This place is a staple of every Vegas trip I make. 
Great for after clubs too."}
{"text":"When I found out there was a Tacos El Gordo in Vegas, I just about...\"you know what...\" hahaha.  

I've already been to this location a few times now since I go to Vegas more often than I go to SD....and just like the SD one...I am NEVER disappointed.  One of the BEST taco places...EVER, and now Vegas has once again taken another great resto and placed it in a location where you can access so many other must-eats all within a few miles of each other.

As always, make sure you know what you're doin...pay attention to the lines...make sure you know which line to get into.  We're always with a group and we all want the different tacos, so we each get in a line and just order for the group...trust me, that's the best way to attack it...and the best way for everyone to get the best of all worlds.  I can't remember exactly which lines have which tacos, but you'll figure it out when you see them.  EVERY line is long, and the location makes it such that the line goes straight out the door.  My absolute favorites are the lengua, abodabo, and the al pastor and even the cabeza is pretty darn tasty.  If you want a quesadilla, you can add that to your order from any line, so don't worry about that.  Roughly $3 a taco, and i can eat about 4 and be decently full...maybe fit a quesadilla in there.  And I'm good good.  The tortillas are made in-house, which I love! You can see the lady rolling and frying the tortilla -- yes, it's that fresh. 

Seating here is a little more spacious than SD, but still quite limited.   

Not really much to say about service staff...polite and friendly enough, and you get what you need. They deal with high turnover, so don't expect them to be too patient.   

Parking...tough, it's on the strip, so if you're going during busy time...good luck.  It's near that catholic church near the strip and has a small lot, so uber, lyft, or walk.  It's walking distance from Palazzo, where I usually stay, and esp after gorging on some good food, you'll wanna walk it off anyway.   

A definite MUST!"}
{"text":"After Earl's Sandwich, this is another must-have food stop whenever I'm in Vegas. We woke up at 3PM (EDC crew where you at?!) and headed straight over here and yes, there was a line. It was crazy hot waiting to get inside but there was a little shade so it wasn't the worst I guess. 

We probably waited a good 40-45 minutes and they ran out of spicy pork by the time we ordered :( The tacos are around $2-2.50 and topped with guac and salsa and a generous portion of meat on each. Each order is made on the spot and it's pretty crazy how fast the workers make the tacos we ordered like 10 tacos and it took him less than a 1 min!

We also ordered carne asada fries (LARGE! $13) which for the price, probably isn't as worth it as ordering more tacos but it was still soooo good as drunchies the next morning hehe. 

Definitely try the beef tongue tacos they were juicier than the carne asada. We also got the chorizo tacos which were good, but not at the same level as the others. Next time, we'll be back just for the spicy pork!

But definitely, some of the best tacos/Mexican food I've ever had but prepare for a WAIT!"}
{"text":"I finally found it!!! A true authentic tacos place that is both affordable and good. I stopped by Tacos El Gordo for lunch and the place was packed, mostly spanish speaking customers, so you know you're in the right place for tacos, but still felt a little bit out of place being the only asian guy there. 

There were several lines that you can order tacos from, I guess depending on meat you want. You can choose from adobada (spicy pork), asada, tripa (tripe), lengua (tongue), chorizo, etc...Fortunately, the guy behind the counter asked what I wanted to order and basically I ordered one of each, just so I know if they're good. The taco is not that big (size of krispy kreme donut in diameter but 1/4 as thick) and only costs 2 bucks each, so it didn't break my wallet or my belly. 

Every single one of them was tasty... yum yum. The food was fresh and flavorful. My co worker complained that they put too much cilantro, but I think it's no big deal. You can take it out if you don't like it. 

One tip for those that like green onion and jalapeno, They have some grilled green onion and jalapeno available as a side dish. Delish when added to the tacos. Also, they don't have to go box, so if you want your order to go, they just wrap the plate in aluminum foil."}
{"text":"Muy Delicioso! This place can get pricey! But its worth every penny.. By far the best tacos, sopes.. etc.. i've ever had.. I wish there was one like this in California.. :( if there is please let me know!! Definitely crave and recommend this place!!! Try the Spicy Pork!!!"}
{"text":"Original tacos, dirt cheap and very tasty. I spent $14 for a great lunch. Definitely a must try in Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite tacos ever are here. If I could only one thing for the rest of my life it would be the Pastor from Tacos El Gordo. I especially love the Pastor fries."}
{"text":"Great way to satiate hunger after a night of spirits and libations."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The tacos are fantastic and if the lines not to long you've got your food in 3 minutes or less. Awesome service and an absolute steal at $2.25 per taco."}
{"text":"The line was crazy when we came here on the Thursday night before EDC weekend. You have to order different tacos at different sections of the restaurant. The first line to the left when you enter the doors is for beef tacos, the line on the right next to it we got the spicy abodaba taco, on the corner of that on the right is the lengua taco, and then the carne asada fries on right of that section.  Confusing but you'll probably see it when you enter the restaurant. We ordered half a carne asada fries and it was definitely enough for two people along with 3 lengua, 1 beef, and 1 adobada taco. The tacos ranged from $2-2.50 and the half of carne asada was only $5. We also ordered a horchata which was good too! Seatings are outdoors and we found seats pretty quick but it was so humid sitting outside. Will be back since it wasn't too expensive compared to other restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try these tacos since i heard about them. Last time i was in vegas i did not hesitate, this place gets packed so be ready to wait. I was not disappointed by the food, my fave were the asada and cabeza tacos, the pastor were alright and the tripas were too overcooked. The only thing i did not like was the system they are using to get the tacos. I wanted to try one of each so had to wait forever to eat my tacos by the time i was outta line and paid and found seatimg my tacos were cold :( 
Would still go again. Maybe with another system of ordering my tacos."}
{"text":"Nastiest tacos de cabesa an lengua. Sucks!! Good tacos de asada only. All that waiting in line for nothing"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos anytime of the day!!! If you go at 3am be prepared to wait in line. This is a hole in the wall place worth visiting."}
{"text":"I was very hyped up for this place from a friend of mine. when I got there I was disappointed that they had no alcohol. I was really wanting a good shot and a great margarita with my first tacos from this place. oh well, not the end of the world. we walk in to 3 separate lines and a cashier. so you order first than pay. terrible setup but good idea. the most popular line is blocking the door. we head over to the empty line we got two chorizo and two steak. and decide to pay so we could eat them while waiting for that al pastor. the chorizo and streak were good not great. but the al pastor is worth the wait.  awesome taste. wish those tacos were bigger"}
{"text":"Mmmm were from SB and tacos out here can't beat tacos el gordo best place to go any time of the day quality cooks and workers definitely recommend"}
{"text":"So I finally got a chance to sneak in here before this place go's off the charts with lines out the door,naturally I have been waiting for this opportunity for a while because usually when you go by this place it looks like they are giving away free cash. I have to be honest I don't get the hype with this place. Its not bad its just not all that. First thing is whats up with the multiple lines,in Los Angeles where I was born and raised and has some outstanding Mexican food,people walk in and order a variety of different meats from ONE LINE. When this place gets crowded who is actually going to wait in several lines in order to get what they like? RIDICULOUS ! I ordered 4 al pastor,I asked how much they were and the guy says its on the menu,um  well i must be going blind because al pastor was not on the menu. The tacos were average,price wise was ok,I found the meat to be dried out and tougher then taco y taco,The seating was extremely limited I was lucky there were not many people there and I was lucky to find a seat. I would have liked to have tried several varieties but i dont care if its meat from the fountain of youth im not waiting on another line for a taco,not worth it to me. Its pretty clear this is a very popular spot and if i owned it I would be thrilled,but as a customer It didnt exactly blow my hair back. Vegas is known as sin city...they should change it to over-hyped city..along with places like lotus of siam or shake shack...lots of hype little delivery. as a side note they have cabeza on the menu,firstly who wants to munch on cow head,YUCK! second I couldent get this rhyme out of my head from when I was a kid,went something like loco loco in the cabeza....lol"}
{"text":"The place is very inexpensive and the service was lively and entertaining, the one guy behind the counter could do a plate every minute it seemed.  The tacos were ok.  The meat i got was so-so; pork was better than the beef.  But I enjoyed the atmosphere which is well described in other reviews."}
{"text":"What's a trip to the West Coast without some authentic Mexican tacos? No where in New York {to my knowledge} has tacos as authentic as the ones I've had in California, notably El Chato Taco Truck and El Taurino in Los Angeles.

So naturally, during our week in Vegas, we needed to hunt down the best tacos. With glowing recommendations from friends, we trekked to Tacos El Gordo. Ordering was intimidating at first with Spanish flying across the room. Each meat was sectioned off, so if you wanted to order Carne Asada tacos, you'd have to go to a specific section, and so on. I wanted to try them all, so I went from right to left, with my al pastor {pork} taco first, a lengua {beef tongue} taco, and then finally my two carne asada {steak} tacos accompanied by my small {but still relatively large} helping of carne asada fries.

Tacos El Gordo was well worth the hype surrounding it. There was always a generous amount of meat in each taco, which was balanced out with the onions, cilantro, salsas, and of course, a warm tortilla. I wish I took some more pictures, but I was too excited about my carne asada fries, eep! Lastly, I got a guava juice pop, the perfect ending to my meal and perfect for combating the dry Vegas heat.

As one of my last meals in Sin City, Tacos El Gordo was the cherry on top of my perfect vacation. I'll be back for more al pastor tacos."}
{"text":"Took 45 minutes for me get here via the bus just to leave still hungry. Long wait for 2 dry steak tacos and a hot jarritos."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! I never knew what adobada was until I tried this place last year. I ordered the adobada taco (so good!), juicy and full of flavor. We also ordered a tripa taco and Oh ma Gaaaaah, yum! I also tried the carne asada taco, that was good as well but I prefer the adobada. We also tried the mula with carne asada and that was pretty good. It was crowded both times we came here but it's worth the wait. 

In my eyes (or should I say taste buds), Tacos El Gordo offers the BEST tacos ever. Obviously, unless you're in Mexico, this place is LEGIT.

This is a must try when in Vegas! You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I love me some street tacos, but they are not your typical street tacos. (In a good way tho) It gets really full and lines are crazy, but it's well worth it. Really noisy too, but most of the noise comes from the kitchen and it's usually the guys cutting up the stake. They're a total of five lines to order, each line is a different meat. A tip of advice: GET ALL YOUR TACOS THE FIRST TIME AROUND, THAT WAY YOU DONT HAVE TO GO BACK IN LINE FOR THE SECOND TIME.

Please note; YOU DO NEED TO HAVE YOUR ORDER IN HAND AND PAYED OFF IN ORDER TO SIT AT A TABLE!!!!!

The only issue I have is the fact that it is located way up north on the strip. It is not a walking distance from where most of the people are staying. It's one of Vegas hidden treasures"}
{"text":"Evertime i come to Vegas i always make a stop here. They have the best tacos in Las Vegas strip. Coming from sanjose where they have some of the best tacos at so many places tacos el gordo just about meets my expectations. They have a variety of meats, the flavor is so good, they are so authentic. The lines can get pretty long but they do work pretty fast. This is a must try, great for late night after bar hopping or leaving the clubs."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican food you have come to the right place!  This establishment is straight from Mexico and you can taste it in the food, deeeelicious!  This place isn't really too vegetarian friendly, but they are willing to serve up a plate of cactus or make mini-quesadillas if you ask.  We went with family and they ordered all sorts of tacos and loved every single item hey got!  If you go in a group have someone scout out a table while others wait in line, oh and expect to wait.  With food this good, this cheap, on the strip you should really expect it and be prepared ;)"}
{"text":"Love the tacos here!! They are authentic tacos they have taco meat we like to eat asada lengua pastor and more! Best place to go at the end of the night! This place also has carneasada fries and lengua fries not to mention mulitas!"}
{"text":"You must try the vampiro!!!! They are too damn delicious!! The food is yummy! My only issue is the long ass lines and the fact that they are very disorganized. They have different lines for different types of meats but no one tells you this!! So if you want different types of meats in your tacos then you have to split up your party to get in different lines, if not then you have to get your tacos from one line then get in the back of the line for the other meat. I was pretty upset that I waited in line forever and then some manager lady comes outside and let's the back of the line cut in front of us!"}
{"text":"What a awesome concept. You basically order from different stations of the kitchen. For example if you want asada go to asada station, if you want pastor go the pastor station. The food is good , fresh, and very affordable.  If you are looking for a quick lunch that is not going to hurt the pockets than I suggest this place."}
{"text":"One of the best taco places I've been to.  The lines were long but they move quickly.  There's a selection of different tacos and you get as many as you want. The lingua and the carne asada were my two favorites.  The drinks are cheap but you get unlimited refills.  The condiments bar is fully stocked with sauces and radishes."}
{"text":"I left with a horrible stomach ache. I thought his place was suppose to be good but it was hurting me the whole way home. I don't understand how they have long lines at night unless everyone is very drunk! I will not eat here ever again. And the tacos don't look like anything heir pictures"}
{"text":"I had a deep craving for tacos and this place did not disappoint! The building is hard to miss, especially at night, the building is SO BRIGHT. 

If you've never been there before, the way you order can be really confusing. There's actually separate lines depending on what kind of meats you want to order. So look at the signs to see where you want to line up! 

I had asada tacos, lengua tacos, and carne asada fries. The steak was cooked to perfection, it wasn't chewy. However, the lengua was definitely my favorite! At first I thought the lengua was going to be a little dry, but it tasted amazing. It wasn't dry at all! I love cilantro, and they gave me a lot on my tacos! 

I got a half sized carne asasa fries, and it was pretty big for it being half sized. For $7, I think it's worth it! My friend and I shared and we were so stuffed, we couldn't even finish it. I can't even imagine what a full sized looks like!

I will definitely be coming back here to get my taco fix!"}
{"text":"We wanted tacos and they delivered, I placed an order of 3 del Pastor and 2 quesadillas, they didn't skimped out on meat and cheese, food was delicious.  

Authentic Mexican tacos"}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing once a week or more. Best steak tacos north of the boarder just like TJ Mexico. Worth the"}
{"text":"I love their tacos! It's so out of my way that if it's even near where I'm going i'll stop in, hungry or not. This was the case last Monday. I had to drop my nephew off at school about 2 miles away. So I had to go by. Luckily it was 11:00 AM and it wasn't crowded. I ordered my favorite, adobada with everything. YUM! Marinated pork with a touch of heat on some hand made corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Fairly solid place when compared to the mecca (So Cal.).  We tried most of their meats, including brain tacos.  Everything was good if not great.  The ordering is a little confusing and one needs to be assertive to get the attention of an expediter.  The only thing that is sadly disappointing is the hot sauce.  They put a a couple of tablespoons on each taco, but if that doesn't suffice then you ask for more at the register.  The reality is don't bother.  It is bland and doesn't do anything for the plates being served.
Adobada was a little on sweet side.  Carne Asada had a nice grilled smell and taste.  Lengua and Cabeza were spot on.  Sesos were a first for me and were quite delicious.  
It is in a mexi part of Vegas which is good.  I would return but am still on the hunt for more Mexi-Vegas places."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE tacos el gordo! To be honest, I'm pretty sad that this location is now a good distance away from the strip. It's past or in downtown LV from what I can remember. 

The food is yummy as always. Get the adobada! The lines are long and can get confusing since they tend to curve around the tables in the middle. Remember, each line is meant for a specific meat! It's not very cool in there so it kind of sucks when it's hot as balls outside, but it's okay. I'd do it for the food. Eat and bounce! 

While I was in line, a child spilled a drink on the floor near me. While I was standing waiting for my order of fries, the lady who was cleaning the floor pushed me out of her way! I understand that you're trying to wipe up the drink but she could've tapped me and asked me to move nicely. What if I had stepped onto some liquid after she pushed me and slipped? 

TL;DR eat here if you're craving some bomb freaking tacos. Remember, adobada!"}
{"text":"Must eats in Vegas. Used to be on the strip...but had to move.  This place is a bit further out, but worth it.  Al Pastor is the best!  Best tacos in vegas...and competes with my beloved King Taco."}
{"text":"Al Pastor is the best. Had a late night taco session requiring immediate action. My neighbor from TJ said, these are the shiznit, and he was RIGHT! Not fatty, real rotisserie style meat, guacamole sauce, cebollitas y jalapeno on the grill. A+++ The only train they don't get 5 on it is because their set up sucks, and it takes like 45 min standing in line, and you stand in different lines for different meat. stand in line for specific meat, then go pay and get your cup, and finish off with your beverage. I also had the fries with asada...good fries, but the asada was like a B. All that being said, this will be added to my Vegas eatery rotation every time i visit. 4 tacos de alpastor con todo porfa...."}
{"text":"Sinceramente no entiendo porque la fama en mi opinión tacos malos pero bueno para todo hay gustos"}
{"text":"Tacos are fantastic but you may have to wait up to an hour! 

This place is right on my way home from work and I often stop here to get food to take home. The price is right but sometimes the wait is verrrryyyy long... The people who work there are always super friendly and it doesn't get more authentic than this. 

I would try to go there when it's not too busy but the asada and abodaba are FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Oh my sweet baby jesus. I have a new love in my life (sorry Ray L.), adobado street tacos from El Gordo!

I will tell you about my tastes for one second. I am a minimalist. I usually order things on the side or plain, especially with Mexican food. I do this because my tongue can't handle much heat despite the fact that I am 1/2 Mex. So, my honey and I met at The District to take our son to My Gym on V-Day, and he brought along tacos from El Gordo to surprise me. I had never had their food before this. I opened up the plate, and was thrown off because the pork looked like the sweet pork from Chinese places. You know how it is slightly reddish on the outside? Okay, mine was meat and tortilla only and his had a mix of cilantro/onion plus a few pieces of pinapple on top. To be honest here....I totally lifted my nose to the idea of fruit with my taco. When we were done there happened to be one taco left. I just couldn't let it go to waste! I took a bite with everything on it and.....IT WAS SO GOOD!

Now I wish my other tacos were like that. The lesson to my story is this:

If you don't step outside your comfort zone once in a while, you will let all the joys of life pass you by!

These delicious tacos from heaven only cost $2 each. No rice and beans available here, but I don't give a damn. Who wants to stuff yourself with fillers? The crowds are huge at lunchtime but it's only because these little yummies are a force to be reckoned with. By far, they are the best Las Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"Love tacos. Solid street tacos. Sometimes gristly. Depends on the day. Can be a long wait."}
{"text":"If I can give this place a 100/5 stars I would. This is by far the BEST tacos I've ever had in my entire life. The adobada tacos are a must. They insert a pineapple in the middle of the meat so that it is marinated, adding so much flavor to the meat. The other tacos are also delicious. I've had the Champenada fries which are also a must on my list. They have those in half orders or full orders as well. Trust me when I say these are the best tacos. I will always hit up this place when im in town. The line can get pretty long leaving you outside waiting but its well worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Went to San Diego to move my son to vegas.  He really wanted to take me to the chula vista location but ran out of town with moving stuff, so he was excited when we spotted tacos el gordo in vegas!!!

This location at first seemed suspect but as soon as you walk in and see the guys bangin out tacos n such left n right you know its a taco jackpot!!  

We ordered 12 adoboda tacos.  The meat is AMAZING!  Huge portions of meat practically pouring out of every taco shell!!  The sauce is equally delicious!!  

We would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"You guys, 

Tacos el gordo is great but not my favorite. It's a 2nd runner up for me. I still come here since it's the only  option that's open late. 

You get wayyyy better tacos at taco y taco IMO and without the wait. 
 
Minus 1* for:
Ridiculous long waits. This place is hyped up too much and gets crowded with tourists.  

Tortillas don't have a soft handmade texture and meats are not as tender as they should be.

Also, they don't even have real aguas frescas here! The horchata and Jamaica come from a fountain machine and are not good!"}
{"text":"Im so happy they re-opened this location! I was so sad when they closed it. I love that they stay open till 5am now! This place is perfect after a night of drinking and partying on the strip. It's located right down the street from the Wynn. The el pastor tacos are my favorite with everything on them. They're only 2 bucks each. This definitely isn't a place you'd wanna come if you're on a diet. But life is too short to count calories all day lol."}
{"text":"I live on the east coat and still think about those tacos! 

My friend and I got two tacos each and fries to share. The tacos were so delicious!! The best tacos I've ever had.

The fries were pricier than the tacos but they were also a lot bigger. Next time, I wouldn't get the fries because they weren't amazing and opt for another type of taco."}
{"text":"The tacos are fresh and affordable! The steak corn taco had the perfect spice and topped with freshly chopped onions and fresh guacamole. They also have a variety of cultural drinks... I had the melon! I highly recommend this place for a quick and fresh Mexican bite."}
{"text":"Authentic street style tacos, perfect place to grab a bite after a night of drinking. The Tacos Al Pastor are awesome. Definitely a must have. The Carne Asada is also a close second. Can't miss this place if you are visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We came around noon and there was a line outside the door which was expected because this place is very popular. We probably spent about 30 minutes in the like outside. Once we got in the door, they informed us there were different lines for different meats, so if you party wanted to try different kinds of tacos, you'd have to split up. My bf and I split up and we spent about 30 more minutes in line. Once you get your food, you take it to the cashier and pay. So overall it took us 60 minutes to get our food. 

We ordered carne asada and al pastor tacos. I thoroughly enjoyed them both but I think I prefer the carne asada over the al pastor tacos. We ordered 8 tacos total and our total was about $20. I'd say it's pretty averagely priced and totally worth the money! 

The tacos here are amazing but I don't know how often I would come back. It was a hassle to order."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and our 3 kids went down here last night for dinner! The line was long but the staff was very friendly and chatted with the kids and got to meet different people in line we ordered the spicy pork asked for no hot sauce for the kids, and make sure u ask for pineapple that was a  delicious add!!! Make sure you get more than one I wanted more they were so awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is from Tijuana, so the street tacos here are very authentic. We tried Los Tacos in the same shopping center before we came here. So glad we tried El Gordo, they blow Los Tacos out of the water!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever had.  Make sure you try the mulas and tacos.  try all if meats but make sure you eat the spicy pork."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time on Saturday at 5:30 pm and the place was packed!  It can be a little confusing to figure out which line to get in.  My boyfriend and I each got two Adobada tacos with pineapple and wish we had ordered more!  We wanted to try the asada, but after waiting for the ones we got we didn't feel like waiting any longer so we just ate them and left wanting more.  You really need more than two of these tacos if it's a full meal for you.  We are only giving four stars because we couldn't find anywhere to sit and had to stand up and eat our food while we were in the way of everyone wandering around.  They are very tasty and we can't wait to return for more!"}
{"text":"Woow! I cant wait to go back! Delicious tacoS ever!!!! I got tripa y suaderooo!!! Woow those were boomm!!!! I wish to be at vegAs !!!! For sure i came backkkkkk !!!! Neta! Ame este lugarr! Just love ittt! And the taquerosss sooi niceee! !"}
{"text":"My favorite spot to hit up after a day at EBC! 

When you exit the day club, head down the stairs on the right on to the strip and go north (yes, north - away from all the hotels) for a block.  This will be located in a strip mall on your right!

Here's how it works: there are different \"stations\" for different meats.  You stand in line for the meat that you want to order (asada and adobada are at different stations), you order, they make it for you on the spot, and then you take it to the cashier to pay.  

I usually order a mix of 3-4 tacos and tostadas.  The fries are tempting but I haven't tried them yet.  The asada tostada is my favorite - I like that the tostada gives it a crunch vs. the corn taco shell.  The adobada is pretty fricking good too, with the cilantro cream sauce and some diced pineapples.  YUM!  I've heard the lengua is good but I have never tried it.

BTW, if you don't make it out here in Vegas, the original (?) is in Chula Vista in San Diego.  If you're in the area, it's definitely worth the drive down to almost the border for it!"}
{"text":"I always stop in here when I'm in Vegas.  It's always busy regardless if I arrive at 11:00am or 10:00pm.  That's how I know it's good.  Ordered tacos al pastor & carne asada.  Best tacos in Vegas as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Crazy busy, if you haven't been before look for a local to help you thru the chaos. Food was good well portioned for price and fast for the most part. Be prepared always busy and very few places to sit."}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos!!!!! And I'm very picky with my tacos. 
They are always super packed so we always have to wait a while to order, but I guess that's a good thing for them lol 
My fav are Al Pastor  yuuuummmmmm"}
{"text":"This place is SUPER busy - that's your first sign. 

And even with how busy they are, they'll have your order ready quickly. 

We tried the lengua, cabeza, al pastor, asada and chorizo tacos. To be honest, you can't go wrong with any of those. 

I'll def be going back to try whatever else I can and you should too."}
{"text":"awesome, miss the old location on the strip, gotta drive a bit longer but we'll worth it"}
{"text":"Living in San Diego for over 17 years spoiled me, as there are 4 tacos elgordo locations in south east county, and a few in TJ Mexico, I remember the good old days of going to caliente betting on football games all day, hitting Chicago Club or Adalitas girlie bars then heading to tacos elgordo for some of the best tacos you will ever eat in your life. 
I love the pork that is sliced off a rotisserie 
the lengue tacos are amazing as are the asada and cabeza.
Now when the wife, daughter and I are in Vegas for our annual 6 days trip, we make sure we hit up tacos elgordo atleast 3 times.
Love it Love Love it"}
{"text":"Didn't live up to the hype. The best thing here are them 'campecha' (?) or 'champenala' (?)--hahaha whaveter--- fries! It's half asada, half adobada meats with white and green sauces. Had high hopes for this place but left a little disappointed. I wasn't even sober when i ate here, but thought the tacos were just ok. The meats were pretty dry and weren't as flavorful as all the previous reviews make them out to be. I went when it wasnt too packed and i was too trashed but man.. the separate line system still sux. Better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Taco's done right. 

Had to try this place after eating at the original Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, CA.  The quality of the tacos is magnificent and the service is quick and friendly.

The best of the best of the menu is the \"spicy pork\" taco.  The spicy pork is topped off with flavorful onions, cilantro, and the greatest spicy avocado sauce you can dream of.   The best taco's here in town can be found right here at this unassuming joint on Craig.

Craig is littered with various Mexican restaurants but you'll miss out if you don't make Tacos El Gordo your primary stop."}
{"text":"To be honest I think most times I've ate TEG I've been way too drunk... I mean it's perfect for when you have the drunk munchies and it's conveniently located on the strip..

 In my opinion (shhh don't tell Mike C & James K) I think the food here looks better than it tastes. Don't get me wrong it's pretty yummy but I don't find myself craving it.. I feel like it's just your standard taco shop food that I can get from a regular taco truck parked on the street somewhere.. Oh and be careful I didn't think those grilled peppers could be that hot but last time I had a bite and my mouth was on FIRE for a hour.. lol 

Hot Tip: don't forget to ask for some pineapple & drink the orange bang! OH And chat up the cooks and tip em.. They hook it up!!!"}
{"text":"Sopes are  good this place has good food!! A little pricey which i was willing to over look until one of the employees was running late to go home or clock n i couldnt get a st8 answer anyways he was in such a hurry he pushed my mom outta the way...i asked for a manager n got 2 young cashiers ,i told them what happend but nothing was done..we didnt even get an apology!! We didnt want a comp dinner or anything just an apology.... Anyways they left a bitter taste in my mouth so today is the first and last time i dine there!!! I guess ill stick to pepes tacos and robertos tacos!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Had the Adovada Taco - the best I've ever eaten. Found this place by accident on way to the airport. Fast and delicious!!"}
{"text":"The best street style tacos I have ever had. Holy crap was this delicious! Very very busy, be careful what line you get in as they sometimes only let you order what's on the sign. 

We had taco de lengue and al pastor. (spit roasted on a rotisserie with whole pineapple in the center with the pork cuts cooking around it. 

Wanted to try more but it was late and they were crowded plus I was stuffed! Unless you are headed to Tijuana you won't get it this good or fresh anywhere. Don't miss this!"}
{"text":"Will always be one of my favorite Mexican spots! 
Get the carne asada, the carnitas, even the tripas!! Bomb tacos, fries, etc etc! 

You can never go wrong when it comes to Tacos El Gordo. If you can make it, do it. Better than Robertos for sure. 

Just a forewarning though, it does get REALLY busy. Especially on the weekends! Drunk and hungry folks every time."}
{"text":"Love it! Most of the tacos cost $2.25 ea. They come out super quick and their portions are generous. When I came here, they didn't have pickled jalapeños in their toppings bar like i saw in photos on yelp, there were only radishes and lime slices. I do wish there were more toppings, maybe some sliced onions or salsa. But the tacos they serve here are one of the tastiest I had."}
{"text":"Great."}
{"text":"I know this is redundant, but the spicy pork tacos are out of this world.  The meat is slow cooked and shredded in front of you, while the cook behind the counter slightly fries two corn tortillas and preps the taco for the meat.  The contents are the complimented with a dressing similar to the cilantro ranch served at Cafe Rio.  There are also other vegetables and a spicy chile sauce to boost.  For $2, you absolutely cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Oh geez, where do I start.  I've heard so much hype about the tacos here and I was excited to finally make it to the Las Vegas Blvd. location to get some to go.  There was no parking so my bf dropped me off while he circled the parking lot.  As soon as I walked in, I was overwhelmed. It was like a crazy zoo with people just everywhere. It was hard to tell where to order as there were 6-8 lines.  I grabbed a tray and jumped into one of these lines. I was maybe the 15th person back so it was a bit of a wait.  When I finally got up to the window, the guy serving informed me that the meat I wanted, asada, was not available in that line and I needed to go to another line.  Actually, he kind of yelled all of this at me in Spanish and after going back and forth for a few minutes I finally understood his irritated frantic pointing to the signs taped to the glass in front of him.  Frustrated and defeated, I slowly made my way all to the way to the back of another line and waited and waited 15 more minutes.

Finally I got up to the front of the line and it was smooth sailing from here.  I ordered 3 asada, 3 chorizo, and 3 adobada.  Once I got the food, I didn't know what to do since they were on a plate on my tray and I needed them to go.  I must have looked like a lost puppy because one of the workers cleaning up the soda machine asked me if I needed help and with huge relief I said yes, I needed these to go.  So he directed me to the cashier and said she'd put them in a to go back for me after I paid.  Done and done! I got back in the car and we immediately started going to town on these bad boys. I must say, they were amazing and worth every frustrated minute of waiting in line.   Can't wait to go back and do it all over again, except this time, I know what line to get into!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! The carne asada fries are amazing and just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Sooo why the 3 stars? The process to order here is not practical for the customer. There are diffrent lines based on what kind if tacos you want. If you want carne asada AND al pastor tacos u may have to get in line again because each line is specific for the meat. The lines are also fairly long no matter what time I've gone here (2 am or 5pm)."}
{"text":"We waited exactly one hour in line and it felt like I was at the DMV. The line coils around and around so you're waiting on foot and really close to other people. This was on a Sunday morning so we thought it would be less crowded. But there was nowhere to sit either. The food was good especially the loaded fries but I don't eat much meat so I can't comment on that. It was just really loud and crowded and took forever so I'd suggest going when you're not starving."}
{"text":"Believe the hype, bring cash and above all - bring your appetite. ...being that it's off The Strip, bring patience too because this location gets busy and if you're not in a group, you'll need patience to navigate the taco lines.  By that, you'll need to know which taco you want in order to get in the correct taco line.   The chorizo and al pastor tacos are king and rule the menu.  The carne asada tacos are ok....a little bit more seasoning would be nice, but hey, they're still delicious.    

 Seating is limited and nothing special so don't expect anything fancy. Just come here hungry and ready to eat good food.  Especially if you choose the al pastor meat."}
{"text":"Simply put, the best, authentic tacos you well ever have. The spicy pork tacos takes the prize even over the steak. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good and authentic. Don't be intimidated if you don't speak Spanish. Order some brains."}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the reviews and I wasn't disappointed.  No problem with the ordering system and the service was great.  I has the abodado and al astor tacos loaded.  Love that they give you a whole plate of grilled peppers and green onions.  Total bill $8.  I paid more for one beer at the Palazzo.  Nothing fancy but a real solid value."}
{"text":"I came in with the misconception that I would need 5 things off the menu to make it a meal. I was full after two asada tacos and a sopes. 

The lines were long for 5pm, but there was advantage to that-- it gave me time to observe how other customers ordered. There are three lines depending on the type of meat you want, so if you have a party, you should split up. Grab a tray when you're in the front and ordering, and take your food to the cashier on the side. They accept cards.

I'm not sure where the sauces were, or if it's even available. They have long scallions (no forks) that you can possibly get from the middle (I'm not entirely sure, I had to ask another customer). I wasn't a fan of these--a little too slimy for me. 

As for the food ordered, the asada was good and I'd recommend the lingua sopes. I was full after 3 items. The fries counter had at least 30 people in line so I didn't try that. 

It is mesmerizing to watch the cooks do the motions of building each menu item so quickly. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Great Tasting Tacos specially the carne asada and pastor... will definitely come back when i come back to vegas next year."}
{"text":"Bomb off the strip taco stand. This place is aleays crowded."}
{"text":"Best taco I've ever had!!!! My friends and I were really hungry after we got off from plane around 12:00pm. We decided to get some taco from this place. We were surprised of how many people were waiting to get in at 1am in the rain. It's a little tricky to order at this place. Different line for different food item. The taco is small, so order A LOT! You don't wanna get back to the line and get second round, that would take forever."}
{"text":"Literally the Best Tacos ever!!! (well for me it is!)  Definitely have to stop here every time I'm in Vegas! Adobada, Lengua & Asada are my favorite!"}
{"text":"We were lucky to not have to wait in a long line as we went very late like 8pm to the place and it is a walk from Mandalay Bay.  The food is definitely 5 stars, but 4 stars because it was very confusing how to order as each different stations underneath the menu.  I do not know how they can make it better, but it was difficult to order.   We had pretty much everything on the menu.  I would recommend the adobado tacos all the way.  It was so good, we ended up spending $60 dollars for 3 people, but got a lot o food.  It was great and awesome."}
{"text":"There was a lot of confusion upon walking in.  I'm not sure if anyone ever mentioned that in a review.  Not in one that I had read anyway.  I didn't know what line to get in, how to learn Spanish in one minute, or what I wanted from all of the delicious choices.  I ended up figuring it out and I have to say, this was the best Adobada I've ever had.  Not that I've had a lot of it but this takes the cake.  

We also had the Chorizo and the Carne Asada fries.  The Chorizo was a little disappointing but after that Adobada with the Pineapple, it didn't really matter.  The service at this place is fast.  They know what they're doing at all of their prospective stations and it shows.  I have wanted to hit this place up for a long time and I finally convinced my wife on one of our Staff days at work.  The food is awesome!"}
{"text":"They are the best tacos in San Diego!!! Cheap, amazing and bomb!!"}
{"text":"After bookmarking this place for ever, I was excited to finally try it. The al pastor tacos were good with the pineapple but it was greasy, all their tacos were actually. I wasn't impressed with the lengua. I can't say enough drew me to come back here a next time. I had better at other places closer to home."}
{"text":"Tacos are totally amazing! We had tacos de Asada and a quesadilla de Asada and the meat definitely tastes like you are in Tijuana! The set up to order and pay is a little strange but it's almost authentic also. Amazing job guys!!! Your tacos are amazing... if you plan on expanding I hope you guys consider Long Beach, ca."}
{"text":"The most authentic tacos you can get here in Las Vegas! I've been to the original one in Tijuana and they go hand-in-hand in consistency. A little pricey but well worth the great food!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is with out a doubt one of the more popular taco shops in Las Vegas.

I go to the one on Losee because it's not as packed as the other ones, well if you can consider at least 20 people in front of you not as packed.

The tacos taste are what set them apart. They taste like the ones in Mexico as they are charbroiled. They also have carne asada fries, mulas, quesadillas and other items in the menu with a wide variety of other meats. 

Good tacos at reasonable prices. Just keep in mind that there will most likely be a  line just because the tacos are that good."}
{"text":"LEGENDARY. This iconic place is not a tourist trap as you might think located on the strip and flooded with bright lights. It's a super legit Mexican spot that is a weekly stop for me.

After entering I go to the far left line which leads me to Tacos al Pastor happiness. Watching the highly talented and efficient guy cutting meat off the rotisserie is worthy of tossing a couple bucks in the tip bowl, which he always acknowledges and thanks me for.

Only thing is don't come in here drunk, slow or stupid. This place means business, especially when they're busy. Kind of like the soup nazi in Seinfeld - be ready to order by the time you're at the counter. They don't have time to hold your hand and help you think through your options.

After ordering you receive your food and then have to walk over to another counter to pay and add drinks if you want. I always get an orchata with my meal."}
{"text":"It's easy to get used to a food so much that you don't want to eat it again for months but Tacos El Gordo is different. Tacos El Gordo is life changing. It is a whole new level of tacos. Tacos El Gordo makes you want to eat tacos every day and not regret it. It's a place I'd take my mom to for her birthday. I'll probably eat there for Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"First visit back on May 10, 2012.

Food looks promising when there's a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit, with a pineapple above it (to tenderize the meat).  It's almost as beautiful as one of the girls working the pole down at Sapphire, but I digress.

$2 a taco made me grimace a little, but a smile broke out after I devoured that spicy pork, with its creamy sauce... what was it, pineapple based?  Idk, but I'm coming back.

The guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming, and patiently answered my noob questions (\"what's the vampiro?\" \"the 'vam-pee-roh,'\" he corrected) despite the line forming behind me.  The lady working the register, unfortunately, seemed annoyed at my very presence.  I suspect the guy gets paid more, and is happy the business seems to be flourishing.

There's a/c inside, so you can escape the Vegas heat.  But if you enjoy the desert climate, then you can also sit on the covered patio.

The asada tacos were pretty good too; the chorizo decent.  Nothing beat the flavor of that spicy pork, so I don't bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.  Give this place a shot if you're staying on the strip, it's on the right hand side as you drive down Las Vegas Blvd, right around the time you hit Circus Circus.  Tip: learn the side streets (i.e. Paradise Rd), and avoid the terrible traffic."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had anywhere. These guys know what they're doing. I don't eat pork so i can only vouch for the non pork tacos. And those were incredible. The staff is golden. The nicest people ever. They explained how to order, what comes on the tacos, and even gave me a tortilla right off the grill to taste. The tacos were sooo cheap. And for the quality, and taste, unbeatable. I lool forward to going back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had! The tacos al pastor are so good. Lines can be quite long, but they have two locations so you can always go to the other one. Everyone is polite and it is kept very clean. Don't forget to try the Horchata water! It's the best!"}
{"text":"Went to this place at the suggestion of a friend. was going to eat on the strip but this was way better and much cheaper. I had a couple carne asada tacos and a al pastor taco.  I should have got all al pastor tacos, they were amazing!!! I would have given all 5 stars but I did not like how you have to wait in separate line for the different tacos then again to pay.  Everything else was great!!! I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great meal and not have to deal with the crowds or the prices on the strip."}
{"text":"Long lines worth the wait everthings fresh even handmade tortillas great deal $2 tacos"}
{"text":"Best tacos north of Mexico! Very authentic! Very tasty!
Papas carne asada! The best quesadillas in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! However my last visit wasn't that great. We came here an hour before they closed. They were still very busy. The thing that was complete turn off was that the pastor tacos were not being done the same. They already had the meat cut in a bowl. The meat was dry and cold this time. Portions were very small. I would not come to this location anymore."}
{"text":"My parents coming from Mexico I grew up eating tacos and let me tell you. These are not very good. They do come from Baja California and are popular in Tijuana, however it always depends how they're cooked. Meat is sometimes burnt, dry, and doesn't have flavor. Not mentioning the cost of more than $2 PER taco. For less than $5 you could get a whole meal at Pepe's Tacos in downtown. Just need to drive. My second time eating here, I got food poisoning from eating the Tacos Al Pastor. Don't recommend"}
{"text":"This is a must after you've been drinking all night. 

Great tacos. A bit confusing with the lines - but split up and get tacos for each other if you're in a large group. Al pastor and carne asada are the ones I got and they were delicious. They were also CHEAP. 

Not too far from the strip and an uber ride away you can have legit tacos. 

Protip: get in line and get yourself some tacos."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Solid 4 stars. Plan ample time to stand in the various (up to 4 lines) to get your street tacos.

After reading the reviews, we hopped in an Uber and had to try it. We arrived early and waited for the doors to open. When they did, my partner and I split up into 2 additional lines. Specific meat or tacos were specific lines only. It took us 30 mins to get our tacos from 3 lines. Once we did, we both found the food to be good and well seasoned. 

I had adobada, carne asada, lengua, and tripas. All were good but would rate the carne asada the Best flavored, followed by the adobada, then the other two. Very filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Will def go back on my next Vegas trip! Only shared a large carne asada fries with my fiance and we could barely finish it! Very yummy! The one problem I had was that the lady sweeping the floor swept the dirt/food pieces onto my feet....no \"sorry\" or anything. Kinda rude."}
{"text":"I come here almost every time  I visit Vegas! I've tried their tacos and sopes de asada and al pastor and both a freakin delicious! Their asada fries look so good, I may have to try it next time. 
I visited their location on the strip once and it was pretty bad. Yesterday we found out they closed that location and relocated. I honestly prefer this one anyways. Food taste way better here."}
{"text":"I felt like I was in heaven. This is THE place to go if you want yummy and downright authentic Mexican food because wooooooo, your tastebuds will thank you in the process whether you're just trying to conquer your hunger, cravings, or just the drunchies ('cause after all, Viva Las Vegas!). 

Lines can get long. Place can get pretty packed - dependent on when you visit, but the lines move relatively fast (and tbh, if you're not fully there sometimes life can move by so quickly if you're lucky haha)!

Now personal preference time! I love getting lengua (beef tongue) with all the fixins! If you're about that lengua life, look no further. Tacos El Gordo will hook you up with the noms, but even if you're not and you want carne asada or their other proteins, do you and you won't regret it. & If you have more dolla dolla bills to spare, get yourself an horchata. Go ahead treat yourself! Just don't be like me and get super excited in a drunken stupor and get horchata on your phone.....

Overall? I dig you, Tacos El Gordo. You're the answer to my taco prayers and even though I never got to pay your San Diego location a visit (which some say is incomparable and that SD is better....but that's all personal preference) I know I'd probably love that location as well.

Thanks for the noms, Tacos El Gordo LV. You know I'll be back for your lengua."}
{"text":"3rd time here within a year.
Best street tacos ever
10 Carne Asada 
4 Tripas
& of course Al Pastor Fries"}
{"text":"Do NOT go here if you don't speak Spanish.

Why do I hate this place? 
- The employees just ignore you if you don't speak Spanish.
- There are separate lines depending on the type of meat.  So if you want to sample different kinds of meat, you either have to wait in line multiple times or you have to coordinate waiting in line with your friends.  Good luck on getting your food at the same time.  By the time the last person gets their food, the first person's food will be cold.
- they're very slow in getting their food out.

As much as I hate this place, I will admit that they make a tasty taco (though, I've certainly had better in San Diego and other places)."}
{"text":"Went here because it was open late and had good reviews. The food was pretty disappointing. The meat is cooked right in front of you, but it was pretty low quality and had lots of fat and gristle."}
{"text":"Tacos are good!  I feel like I'm back in So cal at a taco truck.  Except this isn't quite as cheap.

Long lines, but they move quickly.  Prices are decent... $2 each, but the fries are a little high.  They add a lot of meat, but I would just get a half order instead of paying $10 for fries. 

Hours are great.. They're open super late and they have plenty of seating.  Parking can be a little tough but its not bad.

If I am in the mood to wait, I will be back."}
{"text":"Decent cheap taco spot here! Unlimited limes which is a huge plus! It is just THE SPOT for tacos on the strip. The authenticity only makes it more enjoyable. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo has some amazing tacos on the strip. Extremely authentic, quick, and cheap. This place is perfect for your lunch or late night cravings. The horchatta is also on point here. Friendly staff and fairly clean establishment given its late night/divey feel. It is definitely worth a stop here if you are looking for some inexpensive and quality Mexican food on the strip."}
{"text":"These tacos are pretty whack. Being from Cali, I should've known better than to trust Mexican food in Vegas. All y'all Yelpers let me down on this one. Maybe I came on an off day, who knows... I ordered an Al Pastor and an Adobada taco; both were bland and flavorless. At $2.25 a taco, I was expecting something a lot better. If you know good Mexican food, pass on this place."}
{"text":"I just want to start this post off by thanking the man or woman who had the genius and creativity to invent what we call tacos today. Then I would like to thank Mr. Gordo for perfecting the craft. Tacos el Gordo is HANDS and FEET DOWN and BY FAR the best tacos ever! If anyone knows something better, please don't hide it from me.

Spending 4 years in San Diego, I had the honor and privilege of experiencing these mouth watering tacos in Chula Vista. Now that they have location in Las Vegas too, it gives me another excuse of visit the sin city more often! 

The location located right next to Wynn and isn't too big. Sometimes it may be hard to get seats, but there's a big area outdoors where you can enjoy them standing up. Depending on the meat you're craving for, you lineup at different stations designated for different meats. Once you accumulated all the tacos, then you pay at the cashier. 

LENGUA tacos (cow tongue) are a must get here! The lengua pieces are bigger than normal, but it has just the perfect combination of chewiness that a lengua is supposed to have. You can get this in taco form or on top of fries as well. They give you two layers of tortilla, but I would recommend just eating one as it could get filling. Ihave never been so happy to French kiss a cow before! 

The pork adobada is another must have as they carve it right off the rotisserie and onto your tacos! You can even ask them to carve off some chunks of the pineapple to your taco to add the extra ZING! Please note, this station is labeled \"adobada & el pastor\" but they are the same thing! Don't be THAT person that asks for one adobada AND a pastor, it's embarrassing. I would know...

This place opens until 4AM and is good for lunch, dinner, midnight snack when you're a bit on the tipsy side or after club supper! You can literally walk to here from XS! 

All hail Gordo!"}
{"text":"This is simple the best Tacos on the planet! Open 24/7 and right on the strips. 
Served everything from traditional beef, spicy pork to stomach, beef tongue. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews on yelp and it seemed very promising. So we pull up and immediately I see that there is a whole giant line coming out of the front door. As we slowly inch our way into the restaurant we come into many lines.  the security guard ends up telling me and my boyfriend which line to go into. They section off the lines in different meats you are going to order. My first impression of the place is that it is extremely packed also the prices are pricey. 

For regular tacos it's like $2.50. Personally to me that's pretty expensive I'm used to cheap cheap tacos like $.50 tacos. And then we got the Carne Asada fries and and that was $13. Another thing is that it took a while to find seating. everybody was like hawks trying to get a Seat for themselves. 

As we tried the food my boyfriend said that the tacos were good. The carne fries weren't too bad either but it hurt my soul every time I was taking a bite because they were so expensive. I guess what can I expect right? It is Vegas after all. So we left full and appeased. 

Other side notes : there were two security guards in the restaurant watching over everybody, there was a lady mopping the floor's while everybody was walking around"}
{"text":"The asada fries are really good and the tacos are really good. But how can they charge $2.40 for a dang taco. Taco truck tacos are just as good and only cost $1.25."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos especially the al pastor .prices are great considering the strip.the place was packed when I got there but the line went pretty quick and will definitely come back when  back in Vegas .Everyone should go try them!!"}
{"text":"Wow, hands down the best tacos I've ever had! I've first had these tacos in San Diego, but it's just as good here! When you enter Tacos El Gordo, there are separate lines to order the type of tacos you want. I love the adobada, it's very flavorful and has a small kick of spice to it. The lengua taco is also a must try, it's very soft and melts in your mouth. The tacos are fairly small so I can easily eat 3-5 depending how hungry I am. There is plenty of seating inside, but try to come early or on a week day because it can be very busy! But it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"If you can't go to Mexico for tacos, then this place can fill the gap for a little while- closest to the flavor needed (except for the al pastor.... there is NO real tacos al pastor so far....) plus most of the types of tacos you need: carne asada, carnitas, buche, tripitas.... good place, how about another location in downtown Summelin?"}
{"text":"Line was really long so made wait time a little annoying. Very crowded place. However, the food was enjoyable. Fresh Tortillas melt in your mouth. Be clear on what you're ordering if you're not familiar with the choices it's harder to know what comes in it."}
{"text":"At the end of the strip just past the Encore (in walking distance) Great food, Clean Tables, Family atmosphere! the Best Mexican food in Town. More Authentic than any chain. PS the prices are for the locals, not tourist prices."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Better than the tacos that I from my Mexican friends. Almost every trip to Vegas I've stopped here, sometimes twice in one day.....its that good. You cant beat a $2 taco.

Nice clean place, good seating, and again hands down, one of the best tacos I've ever had. Get the pork, beef shoulder, or the tongue. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've never tried tacos at an authentic place and I loved it! I would definitely come here again if I come to Vegas again. My favorite was the beef, but I loved the beef tongue as well. Try the spicy pork too! And the $10 fries are huge. They could definitely feed 3 people."}
{"text":"Best tripas tacos!! I can eat 4/5 of them. Get the grilled jalapeños & onions, love the red sauce too! Al pastor & lengua tacos are also delish. Usually busy expect to stand in line, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!! Tripa tacos are the bomb! Lengua, Suadero are great too. Always packed.  There could be more seating. Definitely get the grilled onions & peppers."}
{"text":"Way too crowded at 11pm. Especially considering that the food was not that good. We heard alot of hype about this place, but it was not worth the wait nor the price. I'm a Southern Californian Mexican that expects a higher standard of Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas!

I've been to countless Mexican restaurants in this city, but almost everyone I know would agree that this place is by far the best.  

Tacos El Gordo is he consummate example of a little hole in the wall place that blows away restaurants who charge triple the price for the same meal.  Typically I'd never even go to this part of town (Charleston and Pecos, I think?) but this place makes it worth it.  On a good day you can smell the meat from almost a block away, and it only gets better as you get closer.  

I'm impressed by the quality of the meat and the extra large portions.  My girlfriend loves the selection.  This place has the authentic Mexican varieties like Lingua, cabesa, etc, while most places offer solely beef, pork, fish.  The carne asada fries are great (maybe a little too heavy on the guacamole, but I'm not a fan), and horchatas pour from the soda fountain!  What's not to love!

The only gripe that I can find with this place is that ordering can be a little confusing. There's not really a line..  Or are there several lines blurred into one?  I'm not sure..  But if you throw a couple bucks in the tip jar the chefs will usually walk you through everything and pay special attention to make sure you're good."}
{"text":"Went back and along with the spicy pork had some of the beef stomach tacos.  I like the pork better but the stomach was solid.  This place just hits a home run every time.
Was told by the nice cashier they are going to be opening up a location at the strip mall right next to encore.  It's on the Strip and just past Encore coming from Venetian, Bellagio, etc. heading towards Stratosphere.
Good  times."}
{"text":"The food was good, but it wasn't as good as all the hype. Not worth the line outside in the cold and overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place!!  One thing I really missed about LA is their tacos.  From guisados to the taco trucks, to the ones on the street with the ladies cooking on a cart...I miss all of it.  Tacos have been really hard to find in Vegas.  I am personally not a big fan of tex mex tacos...I want straight up street tacos with nothing but meat, cilantro and onions and the occasional sauce.

I've tried tacos at cardenas and I think they are decently good.  When I went to tacos el gordo on a Friday night, there was of course a line.  It moved fast though.  This place is unique in that they have several lines.  Lines depend on the meat you want on your tacos.  They have everything from lengua to tripe to asada to al pastor.  They didn't have carnitas though.  I lined up for their infamous spicy pork line.  When I went up to the guy, I asked for 2 spicy pork and one al pastor...he told me they were the same thing.  I thought that was weird because I thought they were different.  Anyhow, got 3 tacos and asked them for pineapples (complimentary) on the side.  

I went to another line to pay.  Finding seats can be hard on a busy night but people eat fast and you just have to keep an eye out.  I loved the tacos!!  More expensive than the dollar ones I used to get on the streets of LA but they were really tasty.  I loved the green sauce that it comes with as well.  The spicy pork is not spicy at all!  The look of it reminds of chinese roast pork because of its red exterior...but I didn't quite know how the mean taste like alone.  I just know that as a combination it was wonderful.  I can't wait to go back again!!

My friends also got the lengua and asada.  Honestly the asada was not that good.  It tasted like a hamburger to me...anyone else agree?  The lengua was really good though.  It was large chunks of tender and flavorful meat.  When I go back, I don't think I'll order anything but the al pastor though =)."}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic tacos I have ever had! People complain about the lines but I thought it made it easier when ordering. Just go with more than one person so you can stand in multiple lines. They also have flour tortillas if you don't want corn. Hubby and I couldn't decide which of the two we liked the most (they were both really good.) Carne Asada tacos were our favorite. The fountain drinks were bomb too."}
{"text":"I've been dying to get to Tacos El Gordo since I crossed the CA/NV Stateline from Los Angeles. I just learned they have a few locations around town between the Strip and North Las Vegas. My family here in Vegas, originally from Chula Vista, CA, used to frequent their taco shop on the west side of CV which is currently located on 'H' St. These street tacos are DA BOMB!

As soon as I stepped into Tacos El Gordo, I suddenly felt as if I've transported to Tijuana B.C. (Baja California). Mariachi music, smoke from the sizzling carne asada, spatulas clanging against the hot grill, handmade corn tortillas, and the carving of the shawarma al pastor meat from the vertical rotisserie. My eyes instantly turned to red hearts!

Just look at the photos. Freshly made, straight from the grill, cheese quesadillas and carne asada tacos in street size form. Yes, they are tiny but pack a great flavor! The carne asada meat is fantastic - nicely marinated and finely chopped, sprinkled with cilantro, onion, guacamole, and tomato. Additionally, I like to squeeze fresh lime onto the asada and then top it off with the dark red salsa. Then there's the complimentary grilled green onion and jalapeño. All very good!

The Horchata is great! Nice notes of cinnamon and vanilla in this rice water drink. And there are free refills. I love it!

Make sure to read the menu board and fall into the appropriate line that is responsible for making Asada, Cabeza, or Adobada/Al pastor to place your order. Yes, you may want food from a different line so bring a buddy to avoid a delay. After you receive your food, walk over to the cashier to pay. Seems a little awkward. Just glad it wasn't crazy busy so I could still enjoy the tacos while they're hot!

Quality meat packed into quality handmade tortillas, topped off with fresh vegetables and excellent salsas, at ~$2.50 per taco, all make for a fantastic Taco Tuesday (or any day for that matter)!!"}
{"text":"By far the best taco shop in Vegas!  Carne Asada four or corn shell tacos are simply the best.  The carne Asada SMALL order is $5 and feeds two ppl easily. I put pic below.  You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo hits the spot again! The fam and I had the midnight munchies for authentic Mexican street tacos and were excited we made it just before closing at 2:00am. 

I prefer this location because there are two spacious dining areas and works well if you're dining with a large party.

To order, you must wait in the appropriate line for beef, pork, or \"other\" proteins such as cabeza or lengua (beef tongue). My fam's favorite is the adobada (spicy pineapple pork) and Asada (beef). All tacos are served in freshly made corn tortillas, but you can also request flour. I also love their white cheese quesadillas in a flour tortilla. So soft, fluffy, and delicious! The tortillas here are just on point.

They also serve fries, so you can order them with any meat toppings such as Carne Asada Fries - my son's favorite.

Be sure to request all the fixin's for your tacos such as pico de gallo and guacamole. If you like grilled green onions and peppers, you can request that too as a complimentary plate.

Red or green salsa's are available behind the register, so make sure you request a few from the cashier.

Having to stand in multiple lines for various proteins is a bit of a bummer. But that's just the way TEG operates, so understand this going in. Your wait time could be a little longer than if you were at taco shop like Roberto's, so plan accordingly. It's totally worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas at least 6 times and have missed out on a simple pleasure! This place is amazing! Authentic quick Mexican food from Tijuana Mexico.  My husband and I have eaten there 3 times so far on this trip, yes I said \"so far\". Lol. I do warn that the fries are HUGE. I recommend ordering a small(half the price and size). Yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"An amazing, chaotic taco shop. Worth the wait. Only thing I could recommend for improvement is the organization of customers for ordering and paying. 

There were so many people at this taco shop which I knew meant they were going to be amazing. So amazing that people were becoming confrontational when people broke in line. Should be some order and organization there. You run up to a vacant countertop space and scream your order to the staff behind a sneeze guard in the kitchen. Then once you retrieve your food, you run over to get in line for the cashier. And this line intersects with the crowd who is pushing and shoving to place their food orders. Anyways, great food, just be prepared."}
{"text":"I am here to try out some authentic food as compared to the Americanized versions. It's around 9:30pm on a Thursday night and the place is packed. From the Spanish being spoken and menus that I have no idea what it means without some research, I'm guessing this is authentic.

I tried the following:

Adobada - spicy pork - boldest flavor on the four tacos I tried. It's on the salty side.  I didn't feel any spice while eating but tiny kick of spice in the after taste. This is probably their claim to fame. Since there is a big spool of it right by the front door outside spinning.

Carne Asada - grilled beef - guacamole dominated the initial taste. That's okay by me since I like guacamole.  As I continue, I can taste the meat. It tastes like smoked beef.

Suadero - brisket - this was very sour. Meat is softer. If eating too slow, it will stick to the wax paper. May be this is why it comes with two skins? 

Azetca - beef and cactus - this one was bland, so ask for red sauce (mild spice) or green sauce (hotter spice) when you get to the counter. There are also lime available at the self service area by the drink fountain. The combination goes well together but eating the cactus alone doesn't taste good. Again, I like the guacamole on it. The cactus is a bit slippery and has some pickle texture when you eat it.

All four tacos, I can really taste the corn skin, whatever that's called.

Some suggestions, get a fork if you want to eat the stuff that falls out of the taco. I use the fork to reload the taco and clean up after I run out of skin. You won't need a fork if you are a taco master or can just stuff the whole taco in one bite. It seems to me the game is to see how few napkins you will use. 

Try the fountain drink, it's very different from your typical fast food restaurant. They have the Bang and the Ole. The Bang has virgin Pina colada, whipped orange, etc. The Ole has this hibiscus flower drink, which was pretty tasty, but I don't know exactly what it is. I don't often see drinks made from flowers.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience and the food was differently different and fairly tasty for my taste buds."}
{"text":"Really really good tacos. The ordering process is super disorganized but they have to make thousands of tacos a day. I got 9 tacos and ate all of them. I can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for the weekend. Heard about this place from a friend so I had to try it. Had the asada mulitas and tacos al pastor. Was not disappointed with the food. However place was way overcrowded and not enough seating."}
{"text":"Good place. Average tacos. Don't really see all the hype about it."}
{"text":"I'll do it simple. 
Best tacos I've had in Vegas. 

Tasty, quick, affordable! 

My only problem would be the line that they have sometimes. But I guess that's a good thing. 

Definitely try their carne asada, beef shoulder and many more! 

Trust me. I know food!"}
{"text":"Went here while I was in Vegas for a friend's birthday weekend. We went in the afternoon and it was packed! They have late night hours and I'm sure if I was close by fter club or party, I woud be there! I love Mexican food and being in the West Coast sure gives you a different perspective of what real Mexican food should be like.  I had Tacos de lengua, carne asada and buche. All delicous.  

One thing bad, the fact that you can't order all your tacos on one line. I had to ask my friend to get me buche from the line she was in. Definitely going again if ever in LV again."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here since my mom moved to Las Vegas.  There are 3 locations in the city, but the best is this location because mostly locals go here and it's not as crowded as the other locations. The Mexican food here is outstanding and as authentic as you can get.  The tortillas are made fresh by the tortilla lady and the meats are prepared on the spot and constantly replenished because of the large volumes of patrons.  They have the BEST adobada tacos (make sure to ask to garnish your taco with the pineapple), it's just so damn good.  I haven't yet tasted an adobada taco that rivals this one.  The carne asada fries is a must try and a mix of Mexican and American staple as it's best.  I'm a creature of habit and I order the same thing when I visit my mom.  The best location for visitors is the one on the strip because it's an easy walk from the Fashion Mall or the Wynn Hotel."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Tacos el gordo in San Diego but still very good!  

Adobada Tacos are all you need here.  The perfect mixture of salsa, guac sauce, fresh tortillas, and of course, the spicy pork... delicious!  

I just remember the tacos being bigger and tasting a little better in san diego.

This was probably my favorite meal this past weekend in vegas."}
{"text":"Have you ever dreamed about tacos?  you will.  When you do, it will be Tacos el Gordos.  You will see them making tortillas from scratch, laying them on the flat grill, slicing that succulent pork into them, and catching that green sauce in them.  Then you shove them in your face and your life feels complete.  Are you dreaming?  If yes, order more.  If no, order more.  Win win.  Also try their beef tongue tacos.  I have had beef tongue at some very fine dining establishments, but never had it as tender as they do it here.  If they keep doing what they are doing, they are going to take over the taco scene everywhere."}
{"text":"The las vegas locations is TOO crowded and too smothering in there. 

Cheyene location is nice, and when they are crowded its not excessive that I have been in there.. and you can call and order ahead and they have it ready for you. Nice.."}
{"text":"Talk about Tacos!!! 
Welcome to the mother land, nothing like a Mexican subway!! Love their tacos, everything is cooked to perfection; one of my favorite taco places in Vegas!! 
It's a little crowded but hey more people too mingle with, enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 5 and there was no line.  Nothing more to say about the tacos as everything has been said already.  However just a side not that this place does not have chicken.  If you don't eat pork or beef, order the cheese quesadilla with a side of guacamole for under $3.   You might need 2 to get filled up as they are small."}
{"text":"I'm a taco snob. These are the best I've ever had. I was savoring every bite. I would go every day if I could. The carnitas were my fav but the carne was delicious as well. Be prepared to wait in line. I waited for 1hr. Totally worth it. Go with two people. One in the carne line and one in the pork line. The long line was for carne so go right to front of you only want pork. Also there's a taco security guard to watch out for at the entrance. She was pretty hard core about her line."}
{"text":"Fuimos a visitar el lugar por Yelp pero los tacos eran demasiado caros, es demasiado lo que cobran  por sus productos, en el lugar había moscas por muchas partes, la mesa estaba pegajosa, las tostadas estaban quemadas al igual que la carne. No lo recomendaría."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, Houston to be exact so I've had plenty of Mexican food in my lifetime. The spicy pork tacos had me chewing and shaking my head in silence. So good, best tacos I've ever had. Great food for a low price right on the strip, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Authentic Tijuana style tacos, fresh and interesting as it gets, go for the al pastor spicy pork tacos and buche \"pork stomach\" tacos.

i try to avoid this place at popular times due to many rookies not knowing the process and it can get frustrating.

other than that, its completely legit."}
{"text":"excellent tacos, but adobada and head tacos called my attention !!!
decent price at $2 dollars most tacos. plenty of meat.

only disappointment is that you have to order separately your tacos (eg. asada, adobada, chorizo, etc,and make line separately for different meats, thus first tacos ordered will get cold before you get all your order together,,,,,,, otherwise i'll be perfect !!! 

worth coming back ... BEST TACOS IN VEGAS  !!!!"}
{"text":"Best pastor tacos, ever! I will stand in line for eternity just to have these mouthwatering tacos. The pastor fries are amazing - meat, cheese, guac on fries! Yum!"}
{"text":"Pork tacos straight off the spit. What else do you need? We come here multiple times every trip. One of the required visits."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuummmmmm. Yup this is the same Tacos El Gordo from San Diego, but better because it's spacious and clean. Ugh I hate the one in SD only because how dirty it is. But anyway...
If you don't know what to order get these!!
-Lengua taco w all toppings 
-Adobada taco w all toppings and make sure to ask for pineapple
-Half order of adobada fries (huge!) 
 ^_^ Yum yum yummmyyy"}
{"text":"First if you're looking for a place that speaks English or has great service, keep walking. 

The menu is on a board and there are two cooking stations. You order your food then pay at the cashier. It's not the most organized place, but if you expected that then you were dreaming.

I'd say the tacos are the best deal at $2 because the are basic street tacos with onions, cilantro, salsa and guacamole. The quesadilla and vampiro were small and double the price. The carne asada fries were huge, tasty, but the fries were a little cold and after a while everything tasted the same.

I can see why it's busy. The tacos are tasty. I only tried carne asada since that's what everyone on Yelp raved about."}
{"text":"Came with Yelpers as the 3rd taco stop in our crawl. 

So there are lines going for different things. You go to one line, and then sort've slide down from one to another if you want different things. There is a adobada line (the one with the spit), the middle is kinda all the rest, then the grilled onions and peppers station (gratis with tacos so get some), and then left most is carne asada. It may take a moment if you're getting a few things, or if there is at least a few of you - split up. Since it's the last stop we ordered a few things to get full up. Then you go to the register to pay, get drinks,  and get red and/or green sauce. There is a serve yourself bar from limes and radishes. 

Adobada was good, juicy and a bit crisp on the edges which I like. We didn't get with pineapple but this one was a rather sweet adobada than most I've had, like they keep basting with pineapple juice on the outside. Not good or bad thing, just depends what you're into but I thought it was a solid, if a bit different adobada. Lengua was tender, but was a bit more fatty than average so the BF wasn't fond of it, but it was alright for me. It's like not enough of the connective stuff rendered off so there is a fattiness to it that can be a put off. The cabeza here was pretty decent and we both liked that.  I love they give you grilled onions and peppers. I moved here from San Diego and this was a normal TJ style thing to eat with tacos and I haven't had it since I've moved here. Definitely was a plus for me. 

Now, with a place that is so talked up I expect a lot and while it was good, it wasn't my favorite. And being not a grand slam means it isn't worth the trouble of lining up and then sliding down each of the stations then hoping there is a table open in the constantly busy restaurant (there are a few outside to one side if its full inside). I just get salty at chaos when it comes to trying to eat.  The one time I tried to stumble to the strip location we were a bit overwhelmed and confused (since I didn't know the deal with this place and the lines) so we left. Since it was our last stop too, comparatively the tacos were smaller than our other stops at the same price and the most hassle to get so this would be a plan C for me type place. I almost never want to make it difficult to get food unless it's phenomenal and even then I have my limits. I am not jumping the gordo bandwagon.

(Yelp 100 Challenge 44/100)"}
{"text":"Holy moly!  Best taco I have ever had. It's a little intimidating ordering.  But the staff are so easy going and patient. Well worth the trek here. Plus it was cheap!!!!  Best Mexican I have had in las vegas yet."}
{"text":"Al pastor/adobada, whatever you call it, get it here!  So good.   The meat is tender, with a little fat and chew.  I was hoping for some crisp/ char but I didn't find it at this place.  The three lines here were a little offputting for me.  I knew I wanted the adobada tacos (~$2) and didn't waste any time.  I did add an order of the mula (essentially a quesadilla with meat inside) and it was ok (~$4).  I wish the cheese they used was more flavorful.  Make sure to ask for grilled chiles, onions, and pineapples for your adobada tacos.  Also, someone suggested mula w/ flour tortillas tastes better than corn tortillas.  I will definitely be back.

Other important info: lines are crazy long and inconvenient because you have to get into different lines depending on what type of meat/cut you want, limited seating, pina colada fountain drink totally hit the spot, limited salsa offerings, did I mention the long lines and confusing ordering process?!"}
{"text":"At $2 per taco, or something like that, I took down over $20 in food.  Yes it is that good!  I kept going back for more.  I love that Spanish is the official language of choice in this place.  I loved that they cut the meat right in front of you and as you order you aren't sure if you are ordering something weird like tongue or liver or brain.  Who knows, but really who cares."}
{"text":"ADOBADA tacos there are the best! If you go to tacos el Gordo you must try these. 
Pretty interesting place. I have to say I am not a fan of how you order your food. Definitely reminds me of a food truck cuz u have to stand in a line to order ur food and you have to yell. I am 4 feet 10 and the counter is kinda high for me and with all the cooking and everyone in the restaurant talking and the loud Hispanic music they can't really hear your order if you speak like I do. I feel like I have to yell to be heard or else I get a lot of \"que dijo?\" 

Other than how u order the food the food is amazing. Highly recommend you try this taco shop :)"}
{"text":"One tell tale sign of a restaurants authenticity is when people in their own community support it.  Tex mex is so popular, and luckily for us Tacos El Gordo serves up truly legit Mexican.  Outdoor and indoor seating is available, but when you are from Canada and you have the opportunity to dine outdoors in March, you take it.  The ordering process is slightly confusing.  Upon walking in to the restaurants, there is a cashier, and you would think that you pay first and then order, wrong.  Instead you go in the designated line, for steak, pork, etc, order, and then you pay.  It is amazing to watch the food be completely prepared for you form scratch in minutes.  On your way to pay, their is an additional toppings bar that was stocked with limes, radish, etc.  We ordered 6 tacos and paid $12 for two people, where most of the fancy restaurants on the strip that is the price one cocktail.  I am a self admitted taco snob, just because i have had so many legit tacos.  These tacos rate up their with some of the best.  They come on corn or flour, but for me their is only one option, corn is a must.  For the carne asada, the meat was tender, and they chop and cook it on the flat top seconds before putting it on a tortilla with onions, herbs, and guacamole.  It had so much flavour without being too hot, it was extremely fresh, my one complaint was that there was too much guacamole.  The pork taco again had so much flavour  from the cilantro, it tasted so bright, and with a squeeze of lime i was totally satisfied.  Both tacos had a good base of extremely flavourful meat, they didnt need to be topped with a million ingredients to make them taste great, they were simple, authentic, and boasting with flavour.

Overall i loved Tacos El Gordo, they make a lot of las vegas residents and tourists happy with an amazing product that they dish out hundreds of times daily.  My only complaint was the whole ordering process, the cashier was helpful, but i am sure she tires of telling people where to line up.  One suggestion would be more signage.  I cannot wait for my next visit, i might be more adventurous next time."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in this parking lot and are starring down both Los Tacos and Tacos El Gordo..go to Tacos El Gordo.  Don't let the fact that Spanish is the predominate language spoken discourage you.  Don't let the fact that this doesn't look like Robertos or Taco Bell freak you out.  This place has the best taco I have ever had.  They have this gigantic spicy pork mountain that they carve stuff out of and it really and truly is like a Hispanic cloud of bliss which flies forth and brings taco happiness to everyone.  Again I emphasize that this is a very very ethnic place so don't go here if you expect tex-mex or Americanized Mexican food.  If you really truly want to try something Mexican though, go here.  It...is....awesome."}
{"text":"Yummy! Just like the other tacos el Gordo on the border of sd & Mexico. I thoroughly enjoyed their adobada & tripa. I think they might even put more meat than I'm used to. Prices are comparable as well. It definitely hit the spot for me & my husband.  Make sure to try their spicy pork, my favorite! If you're not a soda drinker, bring your own water since they don't have any except bottled."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, a long time ago, the lines were so long and confusing because we didn't know how to handle going from each station that we just gave up and left. Now I've been to the other location on a taco crawl I knew what to expect when our friends asked us to come grab tacos here. 

We go in line for the al pastor as that was the majority of what we needed, then tipped out the station for them to get the other stations to make our other tacos simultaneously and tip out those stations as well. Or if you are in a group of friends, have someone in each line ordering for the group and split the cost among yourselves. We were here at 11ish and the line took 25 minutes. 

I had - 

Al pastor - this pastor was decent. Not too fatty, the seasonings were good. I like the avocado sauce they put on it, as well as the salsa on it. Ask for pineapple too! I think if I go here, I will probably just get this meat in various vessels (tacos, vampiros, fries, etc). 

Cabeza - there was crispy edges to this which was different. The flavor of it was just OK though and there are cabezas I far prefer around town. I noticed they dip the tortillas at this station in the grease for flavor, but that made my taco also a bit soggy. It was better the last time I had them. 

I got a plate of the green onions and peppers as well (these are free) and the green onions is probably my favorite thing about this place. 

I don't want to do this very often as I absolutely hate the cattle line system. Maybe I'm coming off like a brat, but I've stood in lines for many of foods with zero complaints as there are some things worth the inconvenience and time spent. These are good tacos, but not the greatest taco in town as they are hailed to be. Great late night spot, specially for tourists, but I will rarely visit and will go to the Charleston one if I can help it."}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of hype for the quality of their meat and flavor and they do deliver. Last time I went I had tacos that were soaked and tortillas were soaked too. It was good flavor I can't complain. I've gone a couple times and I hadn't had that problem. Expect long lines during lunch and dinner times but the staff is always cool and friendly. 
I like the straightforwardness about Tacos el Gordo. I appreciate that they keep it simple and flavorful. 
My coworker told me to try asking for fresh avocados on my tacos and it was worth it."}
{"text":"If you come to Vegas you have to eat at Tacos El Gordo...
First off, come prepared to wait in line. On some occasions I was lucky enough to order right away especially on weekdays when it wasn't too busy. Service is pretty quick too.
The truth is, the food here is well worth it, people are not raving over nothing. 
You must try the Carne Asada Fries, amazing hangover food and easy to share with friends.
My personal favorite is the adobada tacos, thinking about them as I write this review makes my mouth water. 
This is the real deal authentic taste of Mexico right on Las Vegas Blvd so make sure you try it if you can spare some time!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, nothing special really just your run-of-the-mill taqueria (nothing wrong with that though, I love these kinda places).  

The lines are very very long(goes around the restaurant) and you can only order certain meats at each window.  For example. If you wanted a certain number of Al Pastor and a certain number of Asada tacos than you'd have to get in line at separate windows to order.  So if you and your group wanted different meats you'd have to know in advance how many of \"these\" and how many of \"those\" and how many of  \"that\" tacos in total that you want, than split up and order separately.  It's really really hectic inside so our order actually came incorrect but we just let it go since it would have taken just as long to get it fixed.  It took maybe 10 minutes standing near the window just to ask for some red sauce.  After you get your food you actually get in another line to pay, kinda like cafeteria style.  Here's the problem.  By the time you pay for your food and find a place to sit, your foods cold.  Tacos don't stay hot for long.  Again, the place is packed so there's a good chance you won't find a place to sit either.  


Again, the food is okay(albeit under seasoned) but I just don't get the hype and lines.  It wouldn't be as bad if they had a better ordering/paying system in place.  I know I'm not the only CA native that's been here but I still see high-marks from my fellow CAlifornians.   I'm thinking this place is either the only taco place in town or because everyone's just drunk from a night on the Strip(I get that) or you're from a place where the only existing \"Taco\" is followed by a \"Bell\"(or preceded by a Del, but I do love Del Taco though).  There are just a ton of better taco places back home with zero hassle.

Would not come back and go through all the hassle."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos but they are pretty expensive- I got the pastor tacos and they were fantastic with everything on it. Also got cabeza tacos but I was not that impressed . Overall great service and always full of people ! Those tacos are pricey tho!"}
{"text":"Massively busy. Food for every hankering.  Lines are confusing.  Certain lines only serve certain foods.  Inexpensive. Great taste. Kenya fries and Adobada were outstanding."}
{"text":"I guess some people are more hyped up than others, but I think Tacos El Gordo is delicious! Definitely try the Al Pastor tacos, those are the best! They are open pretty late, some days until 4am so this is a good place for a late night snack. They have everything from tacos, carne asada fries, tacos, quesadillas, sopes, etc. Definitely drop by this place! Sometimes it's busy, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is located near the end (or beginning of the strip, depending on where you enter), right next to Encore, sort of across from Circus Circus, and nearby the Riviera Hotel/Casino. Although it's a pretty unassuming location, rest assured you are in the right place.

Although we drove here from our hotel, I was able to find parking pretty easy. Your mileage may vary of course (we arrived around 9:00 PM)

For new patrons of Tacos El Gordo, things can be a bit confusing. There are actually three (3) different lines going. Two feeding into the restaurant from the outside and one on the inside which is closer to the restroom.

The two lines outside serve:

1) Carne Asada/Chorizo
2) Adobada (marinated pork)

The line inside serves:

3) Everything else

One of the staff members does come out from time to time to remind people which line to get in - if you are here for the carne asada, it's the line all the way to the left of the restaurant (typically the longest line)

After waiting about 40 minutes, I ordered 12 Carne Asada Tacos to share with my group which came with onion and cilantro, non-spicy red sauce, and a generous helping of carne asada and guacomole. I only decided on 12 because if they were really that good and I was still hungry, I did NOT want to get back into that crazy line.

Refills are free with purchase of a soda! A definite plus for me.

Tacos El Gordo also takes credit cards, another plus!

The Carne Asada tacos were truly amazing. Featuring flame grilled steak and fresh ingredients, this is the perfect food to have anytime or right after a night of dancing and drinking. I think I ate at least 10 of these tacos.

Tacos El Gordo is definitely popular for good reason. Whenever you see long lines it's one of two things:

1) It's awesome

or

2) It's overrated

I'm happy to report that Tacos El Gordo is awesome and then some. Cheap and delicious food, free soda refills, and takes credit cards? This place is easily a winner."}
{"text":"I live in LA. I was in LV this past weekend and wanted something special.  I LOVE the fact that we found this place.  I have been a fan of the original in Baja Mex for over 20 years (when it was a hole in the wall).

BEST TACOS in LAS VEGAS."}
{"text":"\"if youre in Vegas, you HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO go to tacos el gordo!\"

\"and you HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO get the tacos adobada!!\"

Jasmine went on and on, but how could I resist texts like this?  After all, she's a fellow foodie.  

Let me tell you, all it took was ONE.BITE.  I was hooked.  

Ok, so this location isn't the safest place to head to at 1:30AM, but if  you grew up in my neighborhood it will only bring back memories, lol!  I'm sure you will mull through the other great reviews of this establishment, but at the time I rolled through there (1:30AM) there were five people eating inside, and two vagrants outside asking for spare change.

  LADIES... I highly suggest taking a friend or friends if heading here late at night or before they close. 

That being said, their ADOBADA tacos are just short of orgasmic.  Seriously, if my taste buds were capable of such activity, they did it.  The pork is marinated and cooked just right, with incredible flavor that remained very distinguishable even past the fresh diced onions and minced cilantro.  All of this is succulently nestled in perhaps the freshest tasting corn tortillas I've ever had.  

They do not skimp on the amount, either... they are generously filled!

And what's up with that green sauce?  Jasmine and I agree, the main ingredient in it is crack, because it.is.addicting.

(just kidding about the crack...)

They have locations all over the Southland (LA) and in San Diego.  As far as Las Vegas goes, I will definitely make this a regular visit from here on out.

If you're a fan of street-style soft tacos, you owe it to yourself and your friends to give this place a try.  Go for the food, not the ambience!!

(... AAANND, for you hard shell taco fans, please look up my review on another Vegas great, Roberto's Taco Shop!)


Mahalos!!"}
{"text":"Good food. I've gotten some tacos that had lots of fat and gristle in them, and some that were just great tasting asada. It's hit or miss. I love them when they are right though. Lines can be really long, so go with a group, so each person can stand in the specific line of the item you want, and you can all congregate with your food and eat on! Great place, but it does get really busy sometimes."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after a few people recommended it. There was a long line, but I expected it since I was told in advance that its typically a 45 minute wait to order. Food: the carne asada vampiro was very good. A vampiro is similar to a tostada, one on top and one at the bottom like a sandwich. I also ordered a taco de tripa, it was salty and so overly fried. Not good! I let the chef know and he offered me a different taco. The carne asada taco was good, the tortillas are homemade. Service: The payment process is a little confusing. After you order and get your food you have to walk across the room with your food to pay. There's signs asking people to sit at a table after getting the food due to limited tables, But not everyone follows the rules so you are left with food and no table. I would eat here again but only if there is no line, it's not worth a 45 minutes wait."}
{"text":"If your tired of the same old gringo tacos and want real authentic tacos, this is the place. Thee most tangiest, flavorful and memorable tacos i ever had. I would rank them in the top 3 taco destinations in the city. The place was extremely clean. Multiple workers are constantly cleaning all areas of the dining area which really impressed me. Tacos al pastor topped with pineapple were my favorite. If you havent been here, theres no time like the present. AAA +++"}
{"text":"OK! Another favorite! Whenever we are in town, we make sure we stop by here. Avoid the location on the strip because the line is super long. We go to the one in North Las Vegas. I recommend the mulas!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever.  I used to think that the street vendor - Uncle Tito under the green tent - on the Maxwell St flea market in Chicago had the best.  Not anymore.

This is a must try in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Tacos al pastor are incredibly flavorful. I've had all the tacos on the menu and they are great. It's great seeing the the staff prepare your tacos in front of you; they do it quickly and with zest."}
{"text":"OH MY WORD!! Seriously delicious street tacos!! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Ask for everything on top or you'll miss out. The roasted chilies and green onions are nostalgic. (Reminds me of my grandma and how she ate her tacos growing up.) if ordering a quesadilla be prepared... it's not your typical quesadilla. No flour tortillas here just freshly prepared corn tortillas."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place. They have really good tacos and mulas. Every time I come to vegas I stop here for a bite to eat. Prices are resonable and the employes are all pleasant. It can be very busy at times but it is worth the wait and I have recomended this place to friends and family ..."}
{"text":"The tacos are effing amazing! We got both chorizo and asada tacos and they were amazing. The tortillas are great and freshly pressed on the cook line. I loved the vibe of this entire place."}
{"text":"We drop by here fairly frequently, and bring our friends from out of town a lot. Never disappointed. Delicious street tacos every time with about half a dozen choices. Solid for a midnight snack. Don't expect anything fancy. I'm sure we will keep coming back over and over again well into the future.

Sometimes you have to wait in line a bit and the tables are hard to find, but hey, strong business, lots of other customers, their business speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip in Vegas when I discovered Tacos El Gordo - it was definitely the BEST hidden gem on the strip! 

Like any other review, this place has good, affordable tacos! I ordered 4 of the adobada (spicy pork) tacos, and i definitely could have more! Each taco is served in a mini corn tortilla. At $2 each, you can't go wrong!!! I am sad that I didn't get to try the carne asada fries, so that's a must for my next visit to sin city. 

This location is about a 10 minute walk from The Wynn, so it is definitely very convenient for those staying there.

I highly recommend this place if you're looking for good, affordable food on the strip!!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos EVER.  I swear there must have been every part of every animal available.  Usually taqueria tacos don't fill me up so much, but 6 of these beauties and I was done.  I had a little carne asada, cabeza, lingua, tripa, and pork adobada that has been roasting along side pineapple.  Every one of these tacos were delicious, bountiful, and better than any tacos I've eaten before.  Not to mention their beverage bar is awesome.  They serve a variety of Mexican drinks and soda, and it's free refills.  A place like this you would expect to be a dirty hole in the wall that you would have to get into through a secret passage and a password, but it's quite the opposite and very clean.  They have two old ladies sweeping the floors and clearing tables around the clock.  As soon as I was done she took my tray for me.  Great service great food, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  My must-have is the tripe taco - hands down thee best of the bunch.  This is the dish that I always order. The tripe is crunchy, yet chewy.  It may be a bit oily but that's what happens when it's deep-fried before it's minced and served. If you decide to get this or any other taco, tostada, burrito, or nachos, just make sure to get everything on it, else it just won't taste right.  You can also ask for some free sauteed scallions and peppers, which are actually quite good as a side with your dish.  Their horchata is pretty damn good, too - none of that powderiness that lingers in others's mix. 

This place gets pretty packed, espcially on weekends and nights.  I couldn't imagine it any other way, though.  Well, actually I can, but it's on the strip, and the place has great food and for very decent prices. Regardless if you are drunk, coherent, strolling around the area, or hungry for some Mexican food, check this place out."}
{"text":"This is a must try restaurant! They have the best tacos in town. I keep coming back for their Al Pastor, Cabeza, Suadero, and Lengua."}
{"text":"Possibly the best I've ever had. I really didn't expect to find great tacos anywhere outside California or Mexico but I was wrong. Las Vegas has the best Pastor tacos I've yet had, the perfect breakfast after a night of shenanigans."}
{"text":"The tacos are very good here. But the seating and customer services hands down sucks. 
So this is what happened to me. 
I got my food and they were were covering the tables with no food. Just sitting there not being patrons. 
We told them to move and they didn't. The staff didn't help at all. 
They were four other patrons looking for seats. The staff did nothing. To those kids. 
The security guy just stands by the door and doesn't do anything for the business. Management needs to put up signs that people need to get their food and then sit down. Not have a person getting a sit and they have people looking like idiots looking for seats and there people sitting with no food waiting for people to get food. 

I hope the business contacts me. If they don't I try emailing them or else I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Amazing! Plan on spending what may seem more than normal for Mexican food but worth it! There are more than one location, the Strip location is always packed and seating is limited. Authentic food with authentic taste."}
{"text":"oh Tacos El Gordo, you definately take me back to the days when I was 18 and partying in Tijuana, Mexico!! 

Love the tacos although I normally stick to the carne asada and adobado (con todo) and the quesadillas are AMAZING! The quesadillas are different than how I remember- they have a tortilla (corn or flour) and then the cheese and meat of choice, then they had a crunchy fried tortilla on top! 

Another menu item I love is the adobada fries(half size)- I'm not one hundred percent sure what the green sauce is but its delicious! 

My friend Tony tried the lengua, cabeza, and tripe and he thinks that the cabeza should be \"highly recommended\"

Needless to say, everytime I go I overindulge and have to hit the gym hard to compensate lol

**I truly wish it were a 24 hour establishment, but then again maybe its a good thing it's not!

**also- BRING CASH for tips! there are tip jars all along the counter for the people who are slaving away cooking these food coma-inducing treats!"}
{"text":"Soooooo worth the wait...trust me. The staff was super friendly and the security lady had the lines on lock down. I couldn't decide what to get so I ordered a ton of food.... and I ate all of it. I wish I had more time in Sin City to eat there again. It's a must!"}
{"text":"\"What is cabeza?\"  I stupidly question my bud (an American via Mexico).

\"It's you know.\" he says, using two hands to point to his crotch.

\"What the?  I'm not eating penis tacos!\" I say to an explosion of laughter.

\"No, no, no.\" he chokes, now pointing to his head.

Having been many times before with Spanish speaking buds who handle all the ordering and just watch me eat their handiwork, I decided on this fateful visit to learn for myself what it's about.

That said, Tacos El Gordo serves up incredible, if not the best tacos in Vegas. 

House made tortillas.  Generous portions of flavorful house made beef and pork.  Tacos made to order on the spot.  Fresh veg and a great extra (grilled peppers and onions that are so good, they can be eaten alone).

Outstanding  \"normal\" proteins including:

- Carne Asada - well marinated, juicy, deeply flavored flank or skirt.  Hint of acidity.
- Adobada - The venerable pillar of meat, carved by a weapon.  Mildly spicy, juicy, seared finish adding a good bitter edge.

Offal selections include:

- Cabeza (face) - The best of all the protein selections.  Fatty, liquefied gelatin, moist beefy goodness.  
- Lengua (tongue) - very good beef flavor with a mineral finish.  Excellent, slightly chewy texture.
- Tripa (tripe) - Clean, almost milky with a slight bitter, organ meat finish.  Chewy and tasty.
- Buche (pig stomach) - Not for everyone.  Mild hint of mineral bitterness.
- Sesos (cow brain) - Definitely not for everyone.  Creamy, aggressively seasoned, strong mineral flavor.  In your face flavors.  (it lacks the mild flavor and finesse of a calf brain).

Straight forward, efficient counter service.  Strange multi line ordering system (one line for this, another for that).  Very low prices ($2 - $2.25 per taco).

In a word:  outstanding."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is a frequent stop for me. Incredible tacos at a terrific price. Some of the best tacos in town though there are a few others I'd say are in contention.  The tacos are largely prepared like your average street taco (/w onions and cilantro) and salsa. However, the meat is always well cooked and very flavorful. They have great options, my personal favorites being the Buche, Adobada /w pinapple, and it becomes a toss up between Tripa or Lengua. If you're starving, go for some Adobada fries; a large plate of French fries loaded with the slow roasted adobabda seasoned pork, cheese, guacamole, a bit of sour cream and salsa."}
{"text":"I have been to both Tacos El Gordos and they are great places to stop for cheap, simple, but delicious tacos. Definitely try the pastor with everything on it."}
{"text":"Okay, I hate to do it... but I have to bump Tacos El Gordo down a notch.  There are several reasons for this abrupt, unexpected change.  Notice that this is still a four-star establishment - I still love my beloved Tacos El Gordo - but now I have a few caveats.

1)The last two times I visited, there were men walking around the restaurant and trying to sell bootleg copies of new movie releases.  Beyond being illegal, it was just annoying.  They wouldn't take no for an answer and kept shoving copies of the movie Ted in my face while I was trying to eat.  I think it's pretty incredible that this goes on and no one seems to put a stop to it.

2)Once in a while, the meat in my tacos is downright cold.  From time to time, I get a taco that tastes just a bit funky and lukewarm.  Pretty unappetizing.

3)I'm beginning to agree with other posters (like Misti Y.).... the absence of rice and beans is very depressing.  Sometimes I get sick of just eating taco after taco.  And no, I really don't feel like eating gloppy fries with my tacos.  RICE AND BEANS!  That's what I want!

4)Los Tacos.  Los Tacos has ruined this place for me a bit.  To me, nothing can compare to my beloved LT.  Nothing.  Sorry, Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town hands down come to eat here almost everyday I'm on vacation. No grease just flavor sauces are to die for and just compliment the meat. Cabeza and Adobado are the best!"}
{"text":"I would say this is tof the three Tacos El Gordo restaurants in Las Vegas.. usually there are lines going out the door during the weekend so today was no exception. I really think El Gordo has been a must visit staple of LV for many years now and that's not going to change anytime soon. 

They don't do any phone orders so expect to come in and wait in line just like everyone else. Honestly this is the only taco place I'd be okay waiting an hour for. You won't find a better al pastor maybe other than in Mexico. 

Tip: they offer plenty free grilled veggies/jalapeño so make sure to ask them.

This place is great if you're trying to ball on a budget, because all the tacos are super cheap $1-2 range."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite taco place of all times. I've been to one in SD and when I found out there was one in Las Vegas, I just had to come. Just in just before lunch time but there was a good amount of crowd. I can tell this place probably gets crazy crowded during the peek lunch time so be aware! 

As far as tacos go, you can't go wrong with their al pastor! & of course they have other selection of tacos such as asada, lengua, tripas, suadero etc. They have great selection of fries and quesadillas if you aren't feeling tacos. I crave this place at least once a week so I'm so happy I found this place. A solid 5 stars for friendly service, clean restaurant and amazing tacos!

They're open till 4am?! Can't be mad at that"}
{"text":"My friends brought me here with the promise of the best tacos ever! I will say they did not disappoint! We had a big dinner planned and this served only as a snack so I only ordered three adobada tacos. It was like a huge tease, I wanted more! I actually stole one of my guy's to eat. He wasn't happy =P. 

The next day, we went back and ordered 28 between three people. It was delicious and I can't wait to go back. 

Try the adobada with pineapple!"}
{"text":"I think the ratings are a little skewed on this place. Unless you grew up eating this sort of disgusting crap, then you will not like this place. There is no chicken, fish, ground beef, vegetables, rice or beans. What they have is: beef brain, tripe, lengua (tongue) and some sort of fatty pork cut from a large skewer, and a few other combinations of these. Maybe this is authentic Mexican tacos, but the average AMERICAN diner will probably not be happy. Yes the tacos are 2 dollars, but hey are very small. The average male would probably want 4 to 6 tacos."}
{"text":"Really good food, friendly people, low prices, patient with English speakers."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas during July 13th weekend and came here twice during my visit. This place is outrageously delicious! I cannot fathom how good it is. The carne asada was so tender. Their carne asada fries is seriously the best I ever had! Get that with everything on it. I don't even like sour cream but it was yummy on the fries. Gosh I miss it. And I also tried the beef head and brain, which my bf got && that was my first and last. It's just too soft to eat."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is horrible. This is the second time I get charged over price. Ordered 6 tacos and seen my receipt got charge for 12. People please look at your receipts before these ppl steal your money."}
{"text":"PLACE IS AMAZING! Tacos are delicious and everything is made in-front of you. Only bad thing is that the tacos are very small but not expensive so you could chow down on 6 or 9. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"PRO TIP: You can order everything you want at any line. No need to wait in separate lines for Asada and Adobada, etc. 

Probably one of the best tacos in Vegas. The waits can be ridiculous but it's just testament to the flavor."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas hands down. Fresh hand made tortillas, perfectly cooked meats.

Cabeza, Adobada & Asada are a must."}
{"text":"Can you say -agujero de mierda mexicana ?
Go to Taco Bell, at least they have some standard.   I went into this place and wanted to vomit from the Grease on the floor."}
{"text":"LOVE Tacos El Gordo! This place has become a regular stop for us after visiting one of our favorite bars nearby. Everything here is fresh and delicious every time you go - even at 1am! I highly recommend their Carne Asada and Adobada tacos! Also, the Adobada fries and Mulas are to die for! 

The wait is ALWAYS worth it, I highly recommend checking this place out! You might even run into me"}
{"text":"I loooove this place. Tacos el Gordo, by far, has the best tacos in Las Vegas!!! I absolutely love the spicy pork tacos; don't get just one cause you'll be back in line asking to order another one. The price is also extremely reasonable which is definitely a plus."}
{"text":"By far the best taco spot in Las Vegas. I first came here when I went on a date with this guy; I still thank him for bringing me here lol. But ever since then, i can't stay away! I come here at least once a week and every time my taste buds praise me for gracing them with such great tasting food. I also brought my family here with me one day and they all fell in love. 

I've tried both the carne asada and the spicy pork tacos but I have to say that the spicy pork tacos are my all time fav! The people are always really nice and the guys working the grills be movin! I can't get enough of this place!! Great food for a great price... That's what I'm all about."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with tacos !!! All I would say the smoke inside kinda hurt my eyes while I was eating in there. Taste as good as them TJ tacos!"}
{"text":"Man... I don't even know how to explain how f*****g bombay the al pastor tacos are! Very flavorful and juicy. Only thing that sucks is the lines! I was in a pissed off mood the whole time up until I got my tacos. So be ready to wait a long ass time and have fun trying to figure out which line is for al pastor and which line is for everything else."}
{"text":"Can't get any better than this! Late night food craving after partying in the strip all day and night. The price is right $2-$4 and change. Super casual, great mix of crowd. This will definitely be a pit stop for me every time I visit the strip.

Here's a tip if you haven't been inside: do not follow the crowd. Fall in line in front of the dish you would like to order! There could be three or four lines that will give you different items. So find the right line! Love street tacos? This is the right place!"}
{"text":"1 dollar sign, average 4+ stars, and a ton of reviews makes for a must-see/must-try especially in a land of high rollers and expensive buffets.  Also, I just really like tacos.

My friends and I came in at around 2:00 PM on a Sunday, and the place was PACKED still.  There's even a bouncer (armed too) who directs entry as space permits. When you're finally in, you have to stand in a certain line based on what you would like to order; in other words, certain lines are strictly for certain items on the menu.  Hence, you gotta plan ahead and think about who will go in which line.  Honestly, it's pretty inconvenient imo because some lines are longer than others.  The food doesn't take long to prep, but it took a while overall for our group to get all of our food.  

We ordered a wide variety of tacos (adobada, carne asada, and lengua), adobada fries, and carne asada fries (I know I know...I judge me too).  They were all really good, but anything adobada (spicy pork) was my favorite.  The adobada fries were freaking nuts: just imagine the most epic nachos but fries instead of nachos.  
    
On a side note, the lines completely died down at around 2:30.  Womp.

I've been going back and forth between 4 stars and 5 stars b/c of the weird/inconvenient ordering process, but 5 stars it is.  

because adobada."}
{"text":"WOW! Gordo is Lord of all tacos. This place is squeaky clean and the staff is crazy fun and friendly. It's a taco circus with the cast of loco characters whipping out the finest tacos in the land. Very reminiscent of tacos I have had from many a street cart in the old country. So sit your culo gordo down and behold anything from spicy pork, to brains, to tongue, to beef and everything else. My faves so far are the choritzo and the spicy pork. A couple of yelpers have poo pooed the chorizo, I likey. At 2 bucks a pop, this qualifies as some exceptional cheap eats. 
Bonus for the gratis grilled jalapeño peppers and green onion, the fresh radish and lime station, and the free drink refills."}
{"text":"I usually don't take the time to write reviews, so you can bet that this place is special. 

Definitely got a local hispanic vibe when we arrived, but the staff were great.  Everything is made fresh to order right in front of you.  They have 3 main taco stations for each type of taco on the menu. I recommend the adobado and asada tacos.

If want a delicious alternative to nachos, try the adobado fries.  They are piled high in a large to go box with spicy pork, cheese, cream cheese and guacamole sauce.  Very delish!!!   

I grew up on mexican food and this place is as authenticate as it gets!!"}
{"text":"We were walking up the strip and came upon this taco place that has been raved about on Yelp and by some friends we know. Naturally, we had to eat there given the circumstances: tipsy, tired, and the great reviews.

We ordered two tacos and a mulita each, plus a coke. Of course it's Vegas, so the tacos were way higher priced than your normal King Taco. That's something I don't care about if the food is delicious. Unfortunately, the meat was so bland! The only thing we tasted were the onions and cilantro. That's it!

I'm not so sure they season their meat, but we were very disappointed!"}
{"text":"There are 3 lines that say \"order here\" and then lists different types of meat. Even though it's clearly displayed, I was still confused because it's kind of an irregular way of ordering. They were nice and let us order some al pastor tacos even when we were in the incorrect line. (Thank you!) After you get your food, you need to stand in a different line for to pay, and to order drinks. 

I don't usually like Mexican food, so when I like tacos, I REALLY like them. And this is one of the places I really enjoy! Asada and al pastor were my favs. Also, their guac is super good, put it on all tacossss!"}
{"text":"They have bomb tacos, and it's nice to watch them being made right in front of you. It gets pretty packed (as the place itself is on the small side) but over all, the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican tacos. Very legit. Menu is in Spanish but all the workers were very helpful even if you don't know what to get. It's all good anyway, so even if you are not sure what to get you will like it."}
{"text":"My friend loves this place. I think it is thrown off by the price point. It is very inexpensive. But, you get what you pay for.  I had steak and pork tacos. The steak taco was ok. The pork taco stunk."}
{"text":"The buildup: 
Tons of articles, over 1200 yelp reviews at a 4.5 star avg. and even Michelin-starred chefs admitting to craving this place when in Vegas.

The order:
3 asada tacos
3 al pastor tacos
1 small carne asada fries

The verdict:
Good, but WAY overrated. Some of the al pastor meat was crunchy...why did they give me the burnt ends? Also, one taco had more pineapple than meat. Thanks.

The carne asada was tasty, probably better than most...salty, but not too salty, on point...so props to that.

HOWEVER...If you've been to Tijuana (which is where this place originates) you can't walk a block without bumping into a better taco...on any street corner...there are even some trucks here in Vegas that put out a taco that's easily as good."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Tacos El Gordo when they were located at The Strip. I am unsure why they moved, but I still ventured off The Strip to get me some of their tacos! I actually came here at 9am when they opened (yes, tacos for breakfast is a thing for me!) and surprisingly we weren't the only ones dinning at that time. We tried the Asada, Buche, Sesos, Steak, Lengua and Cabeza and they were all amazing. The grilled green onions and peppers added to the flavor. We also got a half order of Lengua Fries which were AMAZING. Buttery melt in your mouth (or tongue) Lengua! -See what I did there??

I guess I wasn't wowed this time by their food since I already what was coming. The first time they blew my mind (my drunk mind)."}
{"text":"My new MUST stop when I go to Vegas (It used to be Earl of Sandwich and Fat Tuesdays). I am one of those people who like to try weird stuff so as soon as I saw the menu I got excited. I got: Tripa, Sesos, Lengua, Cabeza, Adobada, and Carne Asada. I loved all of them specially the Adobada and the Sesos!! I also like the fact that they give you grilled green onions with you food! Amazing and made to order."}
{"text":"Best Taco Place In Vegas No Questions Asked I Could Eat The Al Pastor Tacos All Day Long But At $2.25 a Taco It Gets A Little Pricey"}
{"text":"Very good! For it to be so busy it was fast service and the bussers or other employees kept the small seating area clean! There's inside seating and out, the food is prepared right in front of you, no alcohol but that's okay. I got the carne asada tacos and they were delicious! Would definitely return"}
{"text":"These tacos completely remind me of being in Michoacan, Mexico and enjoying some real home made food. 

Although this locations is always busy, the sheer quality and flavor of these tacos keeps me coming back no matter what. Right when you walk in, the enticing smoky aroma of meat on grill hits you right in the nose reassuring you that you're in for a good food experience. 

The first station you come across is the Al Pastor or adobada station. This is marinated shepherd style  pork meat cooked on a spit and sliced to order. This is actually very similar to shawarma. This meat is the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Neither one of the flavors overpowers the other and is paired wonderfully with some onions and cilantro. Don't just get these as the station next to this is my personal favorite.

The next station has all the little weird bits that completely. If you're a Bizarre Foods fan or pride yourself on being am adventurous foodie, you definitely want to stop by here. Ah yes, so, this station has beef tongue (to die for), tripas (beef intestines) which are very crunchy, cabeza (beef head), and this last one is my personal favorite buche (beef stomach). All of these meats are cooked to perfection and delicious to say the least. I would definitely recommend that everyone try all of these. I'm sure that these bits are something that not most have tried but, they are delicious. Writing this is making me hungry, lol, but on we go!

The final station is another favorite. Carne asada and chorizo (spicy Mexican sausage). These meats are grilled over actual charcoal which gives these meats
 the authentic flavor you must have for these tacos. The indoor hood over the grill is fantastic as the dining area does not fill with smoke like other establishments I've visited. Here you can also get some grilled jalapeños and grilled green onions, perfect combo with anything they serve.

I've only mentioned tacos so far but they also do amazing carne asada fries and nachos,  campechana fries which allows you to choose 3 different types of meats, sopes, mulitas and quesadillas! All should be washed down with a horchata or jamaica which will really round out the experience. 

Recommend this place? But of course!! As long as you're not in front of me that is lol! 

Happy Eats."}

These are the WORST tacos ever. The tacos are so salty and I got a Vampiro but they told be it was a \"quesadilla\" i know what's a freakin quesadilla and that wasn't it!!! 
I make better tacos without seasoning them. 
If you guys think these are the best tacos you have ever tried PLEASE PLEASE HEAD DOWN TO SOCAL NOW!!!! 0 stars"}
{"text":"Depending on the time you go, there may be different lines for different types of meat. That being said, DIVIDE AND CONQUER!! I got in line to get some lengua tacos while my boyfriend went to get the adobada tacos - if that's not teamwork, I don't know what is.

Anyways, Tacos El Gordo is situated right by a parking lot, so you can come and park here, no problem. But both times that I came here (same weekend lol), my friends and I walked because it's walking distance from the center of the strip (TI, Bellagio, planet hollywood, etc), and it's right by XS nightclub!!

Get the lengua (tongue) and the adobada (pork) for sure. I tried a few others that were good, but don't remember what they were lol. I believe cash only. Also, they are way stingy with the sauces -- I think they only give 2 per person or something. Have 2-3 people pay for the tacos if that means you can get more sauces.."}
{"text":"Yooooooo. Los tacos of heaven. Their el pastor is insane, and if you vampiric it, you're in for a treat!!! Awesome :)"}
{"text":"Excellent prices... Amazing food... Super clean... Open late. What more do you want? 
Had the adobada tacos. Soooo bomb."}
{"text":"The security guard here is such an ass. As we walked in he looked at my husband and said \"let a mother f***** try.\" For no reason at all. He was very ghetto and looked like he works for the cartel."}
{"text":"This place is always going to be busy especially weekend nights after drinking lol tacos tacos and more tacos. I come here as its close to my
Home."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The ordering method is straight funky.  One line for al pastor.  Another line for carne asada/quesadillas/carne asada fries.  Kinda towards the back, there's another line for organ meats (cabeza, buche, lengua, and tripa).  After you get your food, you have to pay at the cashier.

I loved the al pastor tacos.  At about $2 a taco, it's full of flavor but they are kinda small.  The carne asada tacos were flavorful also.  I wasn't a fan of the quesadilla...... it was not something I was used to.  It was just meat on top of melted cheese on top of a tortilla.  They make their own tortilla and you can really taste it.  The carne asada fries were a hit.  Get them!  Trust!

Overall, awesome place to eat even if the lines are long.  Totally worth it.  They are open late so you can hit it up after a long night of clubbing."}
{"text":"The best adobada tacos. Love this place. This is by far the least busy one out of all three locations.  If you end up going to one of the other two and see a 2hr wait it worth the 10 minute drive to this one far from the strip. Never waited more than 1/2hr on a busy day."}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco chain but too bad it's not anywhere near my hometown. No complaints here because now I have another reason to visit Las Vegas. The al pastor meat is not easy to find and these guys really got it down. Even the horchata tastes like the ones in Tijuana. I'm not saying the Horchata is the best but it sure does compliment their delicious food. My poison is the mulas with handmade corn tortillas. It's like Mexican version of a burger. Make sure you have plenty of napkins because they eat a little messy but the flavor can't be beat. I hope this chain comes to the L.A. area soon but in the meantime the Las Vegas trips are going to have a little pit stop."}
{"text":"This placed was so hyped by people in Vegas and Uber drivers too. After a long day of walking we wanted tacos. Typically we are warned that the lines are super long out the door. Upon arrival, lines were long, but not too bad. Your wait might make you reconsider. 


What I dislike about this place is that you have to stand in the line for the type of tacos your want. What if you want steak and beef? Well you have to get in another line which is time consuming and unorganized. I wanted fries with my tacos but felt so rushed at the front, it just didnt seem like an option

The 3 tacos were absolutely delicious and fulfilling though and I got everything on them. (Sidenote: My friend and I stomachs but got messed up later/day after because of these tacos. Could just be a single experience but still-it was the only thing we really ate that day). Doesnt' take from how good the tacos were. 

If you have time to waste and want to stand in line for some good tacos, recommended by so many, then definitely stop here."}
{"text":"Ok, I like Gordo, and even though I just recently found a new favorite rock throwing distance from here, my normal 5 star didn't get a drop to 4 due to this...

What did drop, was the cleanliness of the restaurant, when compared to their LV blvd location.  It wasn't bad, but it seems like they go the extra mile to tidy up at the spot I frequent often.

My lengua taco was not chopped up quite as much as it usually is at their other location.  I know, something very petty to complain about, but the taste also wasn't quite as fresh.  Or maybe it was just in my head..who knows.  Either way, I didn't feel the 5 star experience that I get at the strip loc.

Either way, these are still some excellent tacos, and at about $2 a pop, a good deal as well!"}
{"text":"The hype is real! This place is awesome. Drove by at night and the place was mobbed, decided to come back during the day and the crowd was much more manageable. The service is swift and the food is legit. This is definitely a must try place to eat while you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been here tons of times...just realized I never mentioned the Adobada Fries before!

Ask for a small portion because they are still huge and are plenty big enough to share!

$5 is the entry price.  Adobada/Al Pastor is the best thing ever in case you didn't know already!  Slightly spicy marinated pork with all the goodies!  

You'll never want to eat carne asada again lol"}
{"text":"Spicy Pork everything...Tacos, Quesadillas and Fries.  This is the best Mexican food I've ever had.  It's soo tasty and so authentic I can't even describe it.  I was thinking about it for days after (I wish I was joking).  

Just be prepared to be overwhelmed while you order.  They have separate lines depending on what type of meat you want to order.  The spicy pork line and carne asada lines are the longest.  The place was packed at 2pm...so I can't even imagine how busy it would be during the normal lunch or dinner hour.  

I highly highly recommend this place if you want an amazing meal.  Can't wait to go back again!

Favorites: Spicy Pork Tacos, Quesadilla and fries"}
{"text":"I was super excited to go here because I've read about it before on some \"Best Tacos\"-type list. The line was long, as expected, but just barely out the door so it was doable. I'll give them this -- they really do try to organize folks in there. It's kind of a free-for-all where you line up and tell the folks cooking the food what you want, which is really neat (and it definitely gets warm in there). They have four separate lines: 2 for adobado & something else on either end, and then two in the middle for sopes, chorizo, and a few more things. So, they really try to parse folks out based on what they're ordering. I wouldn't say all of the clientele was great at organizing themselves, but I gotta give it to Tacos El Gordo for trying.

There's a decent seating area, but not huge, and definitely not enough to support how busy they are, so we ended up eating on a curb in the parking lot, but it was just as well because it was gorgeous outside, and it felt more like eating street tacos, haha. 

I got a chorizo taco and a carne asada taco, and my girlfriend got a carne asada sope and a quesadilla. We ate the sope and had the quesadilla later, so maybe my memory is slipping me, but they seemed exactly the same. Regardless, they were the bee's knees. The tacos were delicious, and I liked their carne asada more than their chorizo (which was good, but nothing to write home about), but the carne asada sope took the cake. So, give this place a try if you're on the strip and looking for legit street tacos...but go for the sopes."}
{"text":"Oh man... TAXOS EL GORDO ES EL REY!!!! I'm not sure which location this is for, I have been to the one that (if it still exists) was on Charleston, deep in the bowels of Las Vegas. You will find that Taxos El Gordo will touch you deep in your bowels too... with their amazing food. It is incredible to watch how fast they will throw together your taxos, as if you were back in the old country South of the E.U.A.

I suggest the taxos al pastor myself. But then again, I can't spell everything correctly. Masa, meat, onion, cilantro, muy muy!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, homemade tacos!

Had the Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos along with the Carne Asada fries and WOW. The meat was so well seasoned and everything was incredibly fresh. Carne Asada fries must be shared with 2-3 people. Wayyy too much food. 

Visiting from out of town and heard that we had to stop here. We came around lunch time and the wait wasn't terrible(maybe 15 minutes) with the lunch crowd. 

Definitely will be back next time!

Tip: If you're with a group, split up between the lines and assign someone to grab a table when people leave."}
{"text":"So I had heard a lot about Tacos El Gordo, but never thought much about it. I usually don't care for tacos that much, and it seemed like just another taco place to me. After my friends kept making a big deal about it, I decided to try it on a Monday night. Upon arriving, I was surprised at how many people were there, standing in line at 11 pm. Despite the long lines, the service was quick, prompt, and ran in a very strategic way.

My first visit there, I decided to try 2 adobada tacos with everything on them. Upon eating my first taco, I couldn't stop myself from shoving the second one in my mouth and getting back in line for more tacos. It was so tasty and flavorful! The sauces mixed so well with the juicy meat, and complemented each other perfectly. My second round I decided to try the carne asada tacos which also drove my taste buds wild. Everything tasted and actually was fresh! The meat and tortillas are made right in front of you, how can it get any better than that? 

Tacos El Gordo is one of the best taco places here in Vegas. It gave me a reason to pay $2 for a taco, hopefully it amazes you too."}
{"text":"This place is definitely the type of restaurant that survives because of the food quality. It's a pretty dilapidated building: old, unkempt, dirty. The lines are long and waiting out in the Vegas sun is no good. The place is so crowded that it's really hard to find seating, and the tables themselves are , like the building, old, dirty, and unkempt.

Moving onto the food. It was...heavenly. They only sell tacos, but they make them VERY well. I ordered a carne asada and an adobado taco and they were perfection. It was like I was consuming ambrosia from the greek gods themselves; I felt like I was eating from a dingy food cart in the heart of Mexico (that's a good thing). What's funny is that they don't have any unique sauce or special way of making these tacos. In fact they make them on the spot really quickly. The chef just slices the meat off a large rotating skewer and onto the tortilla.

However, be warned my friends, I recommend purchasing many tacos as they are quite small. To be safe, I'd order at least 4. Otherwise, you'll be waiting in that long line again under the sweltering heat of the Vegas sun."}
{"text":"This place is the bombbbbbbb! Some may think $2/taco is kinda steep but I actually think it's worth it. Can't remember exactly but I know it was either a Friday or Saturday night when we went, and it was busy but the wait wasn't too bad. My husband and I had 3 tacos each, sampling the carne asada, spicy pork, plus horchata. Unfortunately, the horchata was just from a soda machine so it wasn't the best but like I said the tacos were def bomb and off the hook. We always look forward to hitting up Tacos El Gordo whenever we are out on the strip now!"}
{"text":"I swear every human being needs to come here. Whenever you go to Vegas we always stop by here. Their buche tacos are bomb, super tender super juicy. The al pastor tacos are sometimes a little dry for me, but still good. The cabeza tacos will make you orgasm."}
{"text":"So if it's you're first time going here..  You'll walk in & be freakin confused like me bc there are a lot of lines. So basically in there are 3-4 ? Lines on both sides of the store. Each line has a specific meat you can order. (E.g. One line for carne asada. One line for adobada). Now my tip to you guys: divide & conquer literally. Have each person in your group stand in different lines & just order for your group. After you get your food, just figure it out when you pay at the cashier. 

Pros: 
+ everything is made fresh to order. They cook it right when you order it.
+ they even make their tortillas fresh!!
+ price 2$/taco
+ lots of seating available, inside & outside. 

Cons: 
-long, like super long lines :( 
-confusing lines (why does there got to be diff lines for everything)"}
{"text":"The place was packed as usual, but well worth the wait.   The al pastor adobada tacos are phenomenal, tip the guy working the spit and he'll most likely hook you up.  Know what you want and get in the right line, they are cranking out tacos and don't have time to wait for you to ask questions or try to decide once you make it to the counter.  This location is just as good and just as busy as the one on the strip."}
{"text":"Amazing street tacos!!!  I tried one of each - beef, chicken & spicy pork & went back for 2 more pork.  Did I mention they were amazing?  
Order from the cook, then pay at the cashier.  They don't give you much direction or care that you are standing there with no clue where to order."}
{"text":"Good tacos and an indirect marriage proposal - one of of which I expected from Tacos El Gordo, the other...not so much. But hey, it's this sort of charm and casual atmosphere that I love in a place.

Having bookmarked this place for months, it took an entourage for me to have the guts to step in - of which, my brother, my friend, and two Spanish-speaking coworkers were all necessary. At first, I was a bit confused. But read the signs, get in line for whatever meat your stomach desires, and walk towards the counter. It's easy enough, especially when the guys making your tacos are some of the friendliest people (I may be biased after my coworker told me that one was smitten with me).

My brother and I do what we do best: divide and conquer. I grabbed a carne asada and adobada taco while he grabbed cabeza and lengua. At two dollars a taco, these are  completely worth the inflated price - brimming with meat and topped with various sauces. Plus, the tortillas are housemade...that's impressive in it of itself. Add a cup of horchata and our total came out to about ten dollars. These tacos are, in short, legit. Our favorites were the cabeza and lengua, but to be honest, I couldn't really distinguish the two by either taste or texture. Tasty has no distinction in my book. The adobada was especially delicious with a slice of grilled pineapple (be sure to ask for it!). But the let down was the carne asada, which was too plain for our liking. 

If marriage to the adobada man means more delicious tacos at my convenience, I may consider it. In fact, since these are some of the best tacos in the Valley, I accept your offer sir!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday at noon, waited close to an hour in the Carne Asada line. Got the Carne Asada fries which were bomb but was surprised that the Horchata was not homade. The price is pretty good but honestly not worth the wait in cramped quarters with people yelling and children scrambling around. They really need a better system than having lines out the door. Also customer service sucked and challenging to navigate if you're not a Spanish speaker."}
{"text":"It's funny how everyone is pleased, but that one bitch below!  LOL  Well, but then again, it'll be boring if everyone agreed.  You can never please everyone.  I just have to say that this place makes the best, legit Mexican tacos!!!  I've been coming to this branch for years now.  I used to go to the other branches, but this is now my favorite, being on the strip and all.  I'm currently vacationing in Australia right now, and I've been craving and dreaming of their adobada and carne asada tacos.  That'll be the first thing I'm gonna eat, when I get back to my Las Vegas home!  Keep doing what you're doing, coz you're doing it right!  Acknowledge the positive comments, and just ignore the negative.  They're just haters.  At least the good thing is, they won't be back to spoil our fun at Tacos El Gordo!  Much love! Ciao!"}
{"text":"My favorite location of the chain here in Vegas. A couple others are kinda sketch, small and usually way too crowded (even though that's a good sign). Regardless, I've never had bad tacos at any of them and super happy they opened up a spot on the north side. Lots of tables, too.

Pastor with everything is always a hit, but my favorites are the suadero, lengua and cabeza (with everything)! Not a big fan of the tripe so I always skip that, but you MUST try the suadero! The lengua is always tender and delicious. Don't forget the peppers and onions!"}
{"text":"This place is a must every time I'm in Vegas!! My boys and I go at least every night while we're there for the week! Yes we're obsessed!!! It's usually our late night dinner!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for so long and every time my friends went I would miss it. Finally I got to try it after waiting for perhaps an hour (that's where it's minus a star) but honestly I would say the al pastor is worth it.

We ordered I think 4 carne asada tacos, 4 al pastor tacos, and carne asada fries. Make sure to ask for pineapples for the al pastor tacos!! Otherwise they pretty much got you on covering your tacos in sauce. The al pastor is really delicious and I regret not getting more because the carne asada smelled and tasted burnt which really ruined the experience for me. I wouldn't order the carne asada again because it was burnt on the tacos and the fries. Make sure to get limes and radishes too.

The entire place is bustling and busy and it's extremely hard to get seating but just hustle and you should be able to get seats. It's super cramped and hard to walk but it's honestly pretty good. I would come back for the al pastor!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food! Only draw back is that you have to wait in 3 different lines if you want pork and beef. Also a few flies here and there but the food is so good I cant bear to give them any less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious simple tacos. Wait time was around 40 minutes. We tried the asada, al pastor, beef tongue, beef head. My favorites were the beef tongue and AL pastor. The asada is a solid choice but really don't sleep on the al pastor. I wish we got the al pastor fries too."}
{"text":"I am basing my experience in general, but the 2 Stars are for customer service! 
The line was ridiculously long, I didn't mind it because of the entertainment to people watch. Trust me that is quite amusing. Ladies, please be classy and at least carry a pair of flip-flops in your car to wear in a taqueria. I don't need to see dirty bare-feet while eating.
The tacos were good, I can't take that away from them specially when one is hungry and drunk. 
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE, however... Rude overall. The gentlemen behind the counters taking the taco orders, to the cashier ladies and cleaning crew. 
RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!!!!
I understand the gentlemen taking the orders because they have to cook the meat and serve the order, but the Cashier Ladies were very impolite and really need to take a class to educate themselves to deal with large crowds and take better handle of their restaurant. These ladies gave us a hard time when we asked for a simple plain bag to take our leftovers. 
Not impressed given that I heard great things about this taqueria."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday afternoon on Mexican Independence Day. It was not busy and the service seemed fast. You order and get your food before you pay. Seating inside is limited but people don't linger so it's easy to get a seat. The food was awesome. I tried four different tacos and all were very good. The best tacos I have had. I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Walking in, you can see by crowd it must be good. We were there kinda late too. 

Menu is simple, which I love because, not many choices leads to fast ordering. 

I didn't order, and let my boyfriend order, because I am not good at Spanish, and would be embarrassed if I said something incorrectly. I was not familiar with a few things on the board, so he wanted me to try the tacos first, and then if I didn't like them, we had a second option to order something I know. 

He ordered the Tacos and asked what else I would like as a second option. I asked for the quesadilla, and asked do they have chicken? The guy cutting the meat, gave me a mean look and bluntly said \"Does this look like El Pollo Loco? Where does it say Chicken?\" My boyfriend just defused the situation and just asked for some meat and we walked off to get our order. I was so embarrassed. I do not know why he had to come off so mean... Right there, I felt out of place. I just wanted to take our order and leave.. 

The food was good and I didn't even need the second order because I loved the Tacos. They look small but they are filling. 

Will I go back? No. To embarrassed I guess I can't read."}
{"text":"Great pastor tacos, fresh tortillas, and an easy location to get in and out of. What else could you ask for in a taco shop in Vegas."}
{"text":"They are good, but not the best I've had. I ordered adobada and lengua, the adobada was a bit salty. Lines are ridiculously long and the way you order is awquard! You have to stand in different lines to order different meats. OVERLY HYPED!"}
{"text":"Blown away ! Best ive had outside of Mexico. Old school all the way around. All sorts of options but the steak and spicy pork win my vote for tasty over load. At $2 a taco and super quick service you really cant go wrong. Sit outside and enjoy the sunshine off Las Vegas Blvd. 5 star Ill be back (few times)"}
{"text":"So this is one of those places that everyone tells you to go to when you're in Vegas either after the club or when you're hungover. I will have to agree with these people. I remember trying this after going to XS and I ate it in the morning. I thought it was manna from Heaven. But remember, I was sobering up and just woke up and all. I actually tried this place sober and went out of my way to just eat here. I ordered some carne asada tacos and they were pretty bomb. I had guacamole, cilantro, and onions on them and I ate my two tacos within a couple of minutes. I also ordered a carne asada quesadilla. That I have to admit was pretty small. It looked like two large taco tortillas put together. It did have a lot of cheese and with some salsa verde, it did the job and was finished in minutes as well. Main thing is if you're in Vegas and haven't tried this place, then try it. For me, one time is enough and I don't mind trying another taco place."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try while I was in Vegas.  The way to order is really confusing.  There are five seperate lines that lead to a counter where different workers are making food with different types of meat.  The lines are usually out the door so you have to try and stand in the line with the type of meat you plan on ordering and then when you actually get to the front to order you can ask the worker to get you food from the other workers with the different meats down the line.  It gets really hectic because the restaurant gets so packed that there is literally 40 people in a very small space in front of the food counter.  If you are claustrophobic this place will freak you out.  You pretty much feel like a sardine in a can.  

The best meat that Tacos El Gordo has available is the ADOBADA (spicy marinated pork meat) that cooked rotating on a spit.  The worker will slice the meat directly into the taco tortilla and add on all the toppings you desire.  The Adobada is a little spicy so if you cannot handle a little heat this might not be for you.  

Tacos El Gordo is right off of the strip so its really easy to find.  Parking can be a little difficult at times because it just gets so crowded on the strip."}
{"text":"Walking back to the hotel from the club, a (great) friend decides to drop off some 20 tacos he ordered for the 12 of us from \"somewhere good.\"  And boy were those tacos good.  All I remember was everything was on point from the steak to the guac.  I remember seeing Tacos El Gordo on Yelp before coming to Vegas and I wanted to try it so bad because of their awesome reviews.  Once I took my first bite, I had a gut feeling the tacos were from here because they did not disappoint.  Coming back home, my fiance and I still crave the tacos from Tacos El Gordo and are itching for our next trip to Vegas.  A definite must eat whether drunk, sober, alive, or dead.. you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Best MEXICAN FOOD in the USA. 

My favorite here is the al pastor tacos. To order your meal you walk up to the station labeled with your meat preference (pollo, chorizo, al pastor, etc). You then take your food and purchase it at the register behind the line. There is not much seating and definitely no service but the food is extraordinary, especially whatever they put in that green salsa that they add in the tacos. 

If you've never been to Vegas and want to try some good food this place is a definite MUST."}
{"text":"One of they few places that gives class A fries.

The place is located next to the wynn, and parking is never hard to find as they most of the customers that come walk in from the strip. The interior of the place is surprising clean. The place also offers inside and outside seating, more than likely you'll eat inside cause it's either boiling hot or goosebumps cold outside.

Ordering the food was confusing at first only because you're greeted by the register as you come in. But just go up to any of the workers, order, go back to the cashier, and feast on your food. The prep time for food is miniscule only time you would have to wait is if you order fries.

From your first bite you can tell the quality of the food is far beyond any regular ole taco place. The sauce & adobado just go so damn well together. But to me the main star of this place are their adobado fries. THAT THING IS SERIOUSLY PACKED. Guac overload!!!!! The fries crispy, the cheese cheesy, the sour cream & guac perfect amount, and the avocado on top? Equivalent to a cherry on a ice cream. 

Personally the price of the taco's a ripoff. But the price for the fries a steal.

PRO TIP! You can call ahead of time and order so you don't have to wait in the long lines!

If anything could change in this place, it'd be for them to add heaters in their outside seating, it's just too cold out to eat outside."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas.Felt amazing seeing all the food. I love how they give you an extra plate of jalapenos and onions . The tacos are big and fat and the service is pretty fast unless its during the busy hours. My family enjoys  coming here all the time staff is very friendly at all times"}
{"text":"My friends of Mexican decent say this place is over rated. I could not disagree more. It's been here a few years, it's always clean and the food is always fresh and consistently delicious.

I'm a slave to the sopes. For $10 you get 2 and a soda with free refills. I may not be from Mexico, but as for taquieria food in Las Vegas, none comes close to this place. 

With the exception of total demolition, tacos el gordo is the best repurposing of an old Wendy's ever."}
{"text":"Best Tacos I have ever tried! I have tried them in Vegas and in San Diego and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Lines are always super long so be prepared to wait. Make sure you are waiting in the right line because each line is a different meat. Everything is bomb here but the al pastor is a must try!!!! So delicious!!! My mouth is watering of imagining the al pastor fries. Can't wait to go back. I love this location because this is where they place their best taqueros."}
{"text":"This was quite convenient as we stayed at the encore and it was literally within 5 minutes away. The place is packed on sat night but was quite quiet on friday. I've never had this place in the california area but only heard good things about it.

Definitely not the most healthiest place to eat at but a good price for tasty food. (think the pork fat / oil is used to cook the tacos hence the taste. It was actually a lot smaller than I thought just from looking at the pictures but 4-5 of them filled me out. 

Seems the adobada is most popular. There are multiple lines as well for what you want to order. There are 2 sets of these lines if they are opened. Also it seems if you line up for one you can still order from the line next to you and skip the line (someone can correct me if I am wrong). I just saw people doing it which seemed to be locals.

I'm surprised this place is quite slow though. The wait for adobada took 30 minutes, atleast.

I would still come here again but not much selection for the vegetarian eaters and the veggie options were not that great as I was told. Can try Komol Restaurant for veggie eaters."}
{"text":"Buche tacos estilo Baja California. Super tasty, but super expensive. This is on the strip so that was expected, even for tacos. Didnt  bother to ask for sides, just planned on eating all the tacos I could. Fresh cut carnitas prepared upon order. Go in ready to order in the proper line, or you will hold up the line. Awesome carnitas!!"}
{"text":"Greatest Tacos Ever! Heard it's has closed down at the strip location....sooooo bummed!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A small place in a strip mall that you would drive by but I peeped in & saw the goodness happening behind the counter & had to go in. The pastor on that huge mound made me salivate! They used a huge hand held blender to make the fresh guacamole. The lines was long & the tacos was flying over the counter! The shells was being made right before your eyes. Ooooh Yelpers another must return to!!! Vegas has really treated my stomach like Royalty!!"}
{"text":"Spicy pork taco with that creamy sauce is amazing!!

I'm a sucker for good street tacos. I guess that's what happens living in LA. It's become a comfort food for me. This place is all the way north of the strip, near Encore. We took a taxi because it was 109 degrees outside and I sure as heck didn't feel like walking from Vdara.

Now, this place is legit. And their system is great. Meat. Line. Meat. Line. Pay. We got 3 carne asada tacos, 3 spicy pork tacos and 1 sesos taco (beef brains). We loved the spicy pork and the creamy sauce that came with it. It also had a bit of a kick, but not crazy spicy. Actually it could've been spicier. It was delicious. Carne asada was smoky and had a delicious charred flavor. Came with some guac too, which I love on tacos. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Sesos was off, texture wise. It was too squishy and soft, kind of reminded me of chicarrons. 

They have orange bang too!!! Yum!! The lines move quickly since there's 2 areas. Each taco is $2 simple and easy. Loved all the flavors. Definitely an awesome local spot!"}
{"text":"Their tacos are really good... I always go here since it's a convenient location for me. Often times though I have noticed that the  meat is undercooked and for some reason it's always when I take to go tacos, they wrap them before they hand them to me so I don't notice until I get home :("}
{"text":"Great street tacos and on the strip. I ordered 2 of Asada, 1 of pastor and a mulita of Asada. Tacos are served on freshly made tortillas red salsa, onions and cilantro, and quacamole. The pastor taco came with a green sauce I'm not sure what it was made of but was definitely unique. I found the Asada to be a bit on the salty side but fine once you squeeze a bit of lemon on them. The location seems very busy but clean and easy to get to from the strip. I will be coming back on my next stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to eat here :( After a late night out on the strip, we asked our Uber driver if there were any local spots that sold tacos open (It was a little after 4) she took us to Tacos El Gordo and said it was delicious. We arrive around 4:20/4:30AM. The lights were on inside and the hours on the door said OPEN UNTIL 5AM. However, when we walked in staff was yelling at us that they were closed. 

There was a security guard outside who was nice. She said she has been telling them to change the hours on the door as well. But so far, nothing has changed. 

So um... change the hours on your door and update your Yelp to current hours so fellow visitors won't be disappointed like us!!

As a result, we were 3 girls standing on the Strip waiting for our uber for a while. Not safe."}
{"text":"Is it worth the wait? YES! Make sure you know what you want from the menu and when you get to the front, head over to the counter of tacos you want. 

Cheap, opens late (5am), delicious and authentic! There's nothing more to say, HEAD OVER TO EXPERIENCE HEAVEN!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Absolutely LOVED this place!!! Out of all the restaurants we went to in Vegas this was our whole family's favorite. They had a separate line for specific foods, so make sure to pick the line for the food you want. The line for the Adobada tacos was a lot shorter than the line for the Cabeza tacos and moving a lot faster so we ordered Adobada tacos.  Mmmmm. Delicious! So glad we decided to try this little gem in Las Vegas NV! Will be back next time we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos! Wish you could order from one spot and pay there too. Other then that the food is fantastic and needs no perfection. We got the el pastor tacos and the quesadillas, and they're just like the street tacos in puerto Vallarta!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was how disgusting the area is. Walking in you pass their disgusting dumpster leaking black sludge. It smells awful to the point of puking. Walking in it was overly crowded to the point a fire inspector would shut the place down. People were so packed they were practically sitting over your food. They are all talking and you see sprays of saliva going over your food. All in all the food is not worth this nightmare."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much. But I sorely underestimated this place! I stopped for a bathroom break, as I am an Über driver, and this was by far the best break ever! These tacos are undeniably the best in town! Honestly, I cannot wait to try the ones down on the strip because, with the amount of people waiting in line at 3 AM, it must be amazing!
This location leaves nothing to the imagination! All the food and employees leave NOTHING to be desired. That is a real rarity. This is true Mexican tacos in Las Vegas as it should be... never to be ignored. If you are on the north side of town this is the definite pit stop!!!
I had the spicy pork adobata and I'm not sure I'll waver from that  any time soon."}
{"text":"I wish so so so badly that this restaurant was in Utah! They had the best tacos EVER! My husband and I loved the steak tacos very fresh and tortillas made right in front of you. However the spicy pork taco took the cake. They cut the pork right off this spit with a pineapple above it to add flavor and juices. By far the best taco I've had in a long time. Don't be discouraged by the craziness of the place either everyone just wants there tacos. Just go up to the counter and tell them what you want yummmm! Talk about a best thing I ever ate moment."}
{"text":"The tacos were ok. Be sure that if you order take out for a large group, that you specifically ask for utensils, napkins, etc."}
{"text":"Gave them 3 stars for the limited amount of meats they have available for their tacos. It's like a street Tacos al Pastor street food, but inside. Though you see its packed the whole time....they could probably be more packed if they offerred more items. The tacos themselves are quite small for their price too! The place is set up very uncomfortably with their tables the way they're set up. Forget about if you need something extra you forgot? You've got to go back into the long line again...ughh If you're desperate for a small taco with a price thats not worth it then stop by..."}
{"text":"Tacos de asada are very good  only and they give extra large size drinks thats all the apastor is too greezy"}
{"text":"A good as the one in chula vista! But being in Vegas makes it it that much better! 
Plus they have $10 carne asada/adobada fries!!!
My recommendation: lengua!!! Tongue!"}
{"text":"$2 dollar tacos on the strip? AWESOME!!! I tried to place recently due to the rave reviews on yelp. I was pleasantly surprised! I come from Los Angeles, and know all about \"King Taco\" and \"El Taurino\" and been to taco places in Mexico itself. I would say this place is in the same category as \"El Taurino\" if not better. 

Their Adobada (spicy pork different from Al Pastor style) with everything on it, is my favorite! I can eat 6 of these easily lol. I tried the \"Taco el Lengua\" (cow tongue) and was thrown off a bit. (I love cow tongue in Japanese and Korean BBQ) but the taco version is a little... well tastes like a mushy tongue lol. I wouldn't order that again.

Avoid this place on Friday nights and Saturday nights unless you want to deal with dozens if not a hundred drunk loud clubbers who are literally throwing up outside in the parking lot... :( 

Also their \"Horchata\" and other mexican drinks are not made fresh or from scratch.  (kind of a bummer really), they use the mixed syrup machine dispensers. I guess I'm spoiled because where I come from the Horchata is always made fresh daily.
This is my go to spot for late night tacos after work. If you are just visiting, I definitely recommend this place if you are a taco lover such as myself."}
{"text":"In the world of street tacos, this is fine dining. If you come in expecting something other than a fresh slung, double-layered, mighty fine street taco, you may be disappointed, but then again, judging by all the reviews, ya probably won't be. 

However, I will say on my first visit, I was disappointed. Why? Because I found the tortillas to have an odd taste. Is it a white girl tongue talking? Perhaps, but they seemed overly sour, and I generally love corn tortillas. I was going to sit on the review sidelines for the Gordo, but a hubby craving led me back. 

On the first trip, I had not known to ask for the pineapple on my adobado taco, and thus, did not get it. This time, I was on a mission for the pineapple, a mission easily accomplished by simply asking, \"Can I please have some pineapple?\" This request made a big difference. Do not skip the pineapple as it is the secret to a complete flavor explosion! I think the adobado may be the best option, as the husband was not super impressed with the lengua. Plus, how can you resist a giant, red swirling cone of pork? 

The resulting taco was a street taco win (not big, but flavorful), and the atmosphere is definitely like a street party. The place is generally always overflowing, and you have to head directly to your meat to place your order. Don't be shy! Everyone is very helpful and friendly. If you don't know what something is, just ask! Otherwise, you may end up with a brain or tongue taco. Yes, they roll legit with the meats. 

The menu is limited, pretty much tacos ($2), carne asada fries and perhaps a quesadilla? There are no rice and beans, and you can call me names, but I love rice and beans and miss them sorely. There are no vegetables, except for a side of grilled scallions and peppers, which I have yet to effectively eat in a manner that contributes to my overall meal experience.

If you're looking for quick, street-style tacos with meats galore, this could be your place!"}
{"text":"I came here because of all the hype that I have been hearing about this place! What a disappointment. They only get one star because of how hard I see the cooks working. The lines are long. The food is not good. Not a fan. I got the asada fries and they didn't meet my expectations. Consider I eat asada fries a lot. This are by far the worst. The meat has no flavor, and put big chunks of meat. The carne asada fries were $14. That's absurd. They should be more like $7 if anything. So I order my fries, & the cook says they'll give them to you on the other side after waiting there for 5 min. So I went to the other side to wait. I was waiting for 10 min when he says your fries are up there. He put the fries in the middle of a busy line. How was I supposed to go through the middle of the people. He could've hand them to me where I was. It was super hot inside and the ordering and paying 
Process is confusing. They need a better plan. $2.25 for a taco is a little pricey. The only taco I liked was el pastor. My friend purchased a quesadilla that had like a teaspoon of cheese. It looked like a plain taco. Overall, I would
Not come here again."}
{"text":"Spicy pork! Literally so amazing! So go eat a ton of tacos. It's so worth it."}
{"text":"Is this the best place in U.S. where you can get authentic, cheap, tasty tacos? No. 

I do frequent this spot for cheap snacks between meals. The service - think fast food chain. You're pretty much order your food at different counters separated by variety and cuts of meat. Grab a tray, and within a minute you'll get your tacos on the tray then you proceed to another register to pay for your tacos and soda. I honestly not a fan of their al pastor tacos - despite the rave reviews, they were nothing special and I've had better al pastor across the country, even all the way in Philly! My favorites are the lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (beef head), both cooked very well and very flavorful. If you prefer something lighter or clean flavor, get the asada (steak). I saw that the fries and sopes are also very popular choices in here but I rather save my appetite on the tacos. For the quality and flavor the price is a bit high, at roughly $2.50 per taco. If you're looking for the best tacos around the area - go to Monterey Park in Cali and visit one of the food trucks where the lady barely speak English, or head down to Arizona. Sadly, there ain't much decent taco places in Vegas."}
{"text":"TODO HECHO A MANO!! Everything made from my like the taste of this food maybe cause I'm used to Tacos Gavilán and king taco type of Mexican food or hole in the wall places. Anyways, I was super excited to try this but it's extremely HYPED UP. Like nah. There are better tacos out there and sopes. The sopes we got here were not good. I usually eat all my food but I didn't finish anything here. I think it just gets a lot of attention since it's a Mexican establishment in \"LAS VEGAS\""}
{"text":"For those of you that goes to Encore Beach Club, this is THE spot to go for hangover food.  It's a short 5 minutes walk from the club so it's a bonus!  The restaurant divides up the line by the type of meat you want to order.  I like how they arranged that since the system works.  My favorite tacos are the Al Pastor and Carne Asada.  The Al Pastor is the best here and it is a little spicy.  The meats are super flavorful and you just want to keep eating it!  My friends said the Lengua (tongue) is good here too, but I'm not a fan of exotic meat.  There's a side bar that you can grab radish, carrots and different types of salsa.  During busy hours, the line does get long, but it's totally worth the wait for tacos!"}
{"text":"The tacos were good, I recommend carne Asada. It was really smokey and delicious. The Carne asada fries are massive so keep that in mind. The prices are higher than in the past, but it tastes just like Tijuana tacos. Horchata on tap for less than 2 bucks."}
{"text":"First time today and we had the Azada tacos and they exceptionally tasty!  It took a while and well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas for authentic and street style Mexican food. I recommend their tripas, cabeza, buche, carne asada, lengua and adobada tacos, campechana and adobada fries. This place is so good that I would eat here every other week. Overall, it is a must try for locals and tourists."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos such a great experience here! Not being from Vegas and this being my first time here it was a bit confusing when you first walk in. Its a little hectic only because it was so busy. We walked in waited in line then ordered our tacos which they make right there in front of you. They also make all there tortillas completely fresh. 
So you get your tacos then take it up to the register and pay. The tacos were by far some of the best iv ever tasted I would recommend anyone who loves tacos to stop by and give this place a try it will be well worth it. The prices on everything were very reasonable also i will for sure make this a stop anytime i'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"You know the place where food tastes better after each bite and you can't wait to take another bite again? This is that place. Amazing tacos and authentic Mexican food a definite must if you're coming to Las Vegas. Not the fanciest place but the food and the atmosphere make up for it."}
{"text":"The best tacos next to the ones in Tijuana... actually heard this chain is from there, explains why they are so good.  Have to order a good spread of about 5 to 6.  Wish they had fish though, nonetheless still 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times.  The food is consistently good.  I have had better street tacos, however these arn't bad for Vegas!"}
{"text":"C'mon man,  that's just ridiculously good.  So glad I didn't waste money at the fancy hotels"}
{"text":"The food was good. 10/10 Carne Asada is the way to go. The service was great and food came out fast."}
{"text":"This is my spot

I love this spot.

Drove 10 miles from the strip to who knows where and what,, to get these tacos

only thing is they cheap on the salsa"}
{"text":"Went here with my old lady, it was pretty amazing. The tortilla was good

2 carne asada tacos
1 shoulder taco
1 tongue taco
1 carne asada tostada- this was the worst one- I would pass on it
1- orange whip drink

$13

It was all good, they didn't have salsa and jalapenos
This is where you meet ghetto and club goers milleniums"}
{"text":"We eat at Tacos El Gordo in San Diego all the time. This location is just as good. I love the chorizo fries here."}
{"text":"the HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE out weighs the good food by far! Just because i dont speak your language doesn't mean you have to be rude to me. I would've tipped the cooks big because I work for tips but with that bad attitude i just wanted to leave. Came home to my food with very little meat on my tacos & nothing else on them, when I really wanted everything. The cook even asked me if I wanted everything and I said yes.. Smh really disappointed. The Charleston location wouldn't do this to me on their busiest day."}
{"text":"Service is great if I could rate for only service it would be 5 stars. Food was good just a little salty and be sure to ask for light avocado if you want to enjoy the Asada more. Still probably the best tacos in Vegas but far from AZ tacos for authentic taste."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here twice because it was soo close to our hotel and it was so cheap.  The first time, we shared an order of carne asada fries for $10.  I had no idea what to expect, but it sounded interesting.  It turned out to be exactly what it sounded like.... french fries covered in grated cheese, guacamole and carne asada.  They were good but not really what I was looking for in terms of spice.

The second time we got the spicy pork tacos.  The pineapple on top was a nice touch.  They had great flavor and spice.  My husband got flour tortillas and I got corn.  We also learned to ask for peppers and onions on the side, which were free.  The people were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is pretty cheap, although the $2 tacos are small for someone like my husband that could eat 5 of them.  Love the spicy pork."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had, hands down.  The guac is where it's at.  Need that recipe since KC is so far from LV."}
{"text":"Really good fast food kind of tacos. Not fancy ones, just plain good and tasty.
Cheap prices for the tacos.
However - $13 for a bad of simple plain fries?! 

What kinda affect the experience is the CRAZY long lines. You can easily find yourself waiting an hour just to get a taco.

Most of the employees only speaks basic english so it's kinda hard to have any \"special requests\" like extra meat or so..."}
{"text":"Bad service, went there but tacos they have three sections for meat type, I didn't know was in line once I get there I order tacos and the worker tells me I'm in the wrong line. So get in second line I order they give me the tacos for one variety meat I ask about the other tacos I had ordered they tell me to go next line and tell them what I want. That the most stupidest idea of ordering will not go there again I also told all my coworkers about it, they said they will not go there some have experience the same drama. Also they're not that good neither it's so so,"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing tacos. Loved the Lingua (Beef Tongue) taco. Also had the Tripa (Beef) taco which is also out of this world. Was there at 9:30 pm in the evening and the place still had lines of people waiting

Affordable and tasty tacos that melt in your mouth.

Will return as my go to place for tacos when in Vegas."}
{"text":"So, this trip to Las Vegas was essentially a post-deployment treat - one that I went on by myself as to get the freedom to do whatever the heck I wanted - including playing 20 straight hours of poker at the Wynn, which is the reason I found Tacos El Gordo - which I believe means Fat Tacos.

2 a.m., I drunk, walking down the street - just about the only tacos I was going to get to eat at that time was a real one - and I wasn't going to complain.

Stepping into Tacos El Gordo is to be transformed from Las Vegas to Tijuana - in fact, the owner says they are formerly from Tijuana, which I often visited as a kid. Dirty, scuzzy, and authentic - that's about the only things I can use to describe this place. 

Although there are about eight different types of tacos - each costing about $2.50, I opted for the stomach and tongue tacos - both culinary delights I'd learned to eat having grown up in Southern California.

In my best Spanish, which I failed both in college and high school, I ordered two of each, and an Horchata (a milky, cinnamon drink). The guy behind the counter looked at me with amusement, and in lightning speed, whipped up two of each. After paying for it all and putting a few bucks in the tip jar, I went to my seat only to be summoned back and given an extra side of meat. 

\"Shoulders,\" he said. \"Try it.\"

I tried it and instantly fell in love (the next day I came back and ordered more) - it was not only flavorful and full of spices, one could almost taste the nutty, meaty taste of the cow cheeks. I was in taco heaven.

Onto the tongue and stomach, however: stomach tastes exactly the way you'd expect it to - a bit slimy, but flavorful with a hint of bitterness. No worries - a bit of lime and salt takes away the flavor that you might not be used to. I quickly wolfed it down and then tried the tongue.

Subtly beefy - that's the only way I can describe it. Tender, moist, and full of flavors, it also packed a beefy flavor that no way in hell Taco Bell could deliver - new 100 percent meat be damned. It's also a light meat - that is, it's beef, but doesn't come with the heaviness that beef often is known for. It is, in a sense, as soft and gentle as a baby's sigh - heavenly goodness.

I washed it all down with the drink I mentioned - the sweetness cleaning my palate with each swallow, allowing me to go back to the tacos and tasting everything packed in it each time.

The next day, I went back for more. In fact, during my eight-day stay, I ate at Tacos El Gordo five times - each time leaving me satisfied, but also longing for more.

If you do go there, I recommend the tongue and the shoulder tacos. I also recommend the Horchata. What's more - get the little vegetables that are left to be eaten over a bed of ice. They are meant to cleanse your palate. Take a bite of it after each bite of the tacos (or if you're like me you shove the entire taco in your mouth), and I promise you'll be ranting and raving about this place, too.

Another note: do leave a tip. These people work really hard, and they do a good job serving. You're in Vegas - you're going to splurge anyway. Might as well make someone's day."}
{"text":"food is AMAZING!  

i love getting the steak tacos and the price is very affordable

$2 tacos!!

they open late night so definitely check it out"}
{"text":"Best taco shop.   Ever since i went to the chula vista location i have been hooked.   The vegas location line is ridiculous though.  Perhaps the only reason i wouldnt go is waiting in line for an hour"}
{"text":"Love this place, Tacos were amazing, especially the tripe that was recommended by a friend. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place. But since I don't whenever I'm in town for SEMA I have to come here and order at least 3 maybe 5 tacos just for myself.  The al pastor tacos are amazing! The meat has so much flavor. I always get that with avocado sauce stuff on top. And lots of lemon and extra salt yummmm."}
{"text":"I was really skeptical when people were telling me that these we're the best tacos they've ever eaten.  I have had some of the best tacos all over California and these are hands down the best pork adobada tacos period.  

Our group also ordered carne asada quesadillas and asada fries.  The \"quesadilla\" comes out as a 3\" round?  It was odd size and small but tasted delicious nonetheless.  Their carne asada fries, tasted fine and the portion was huge.  But the star of the day was the adobabda tacos.

It's a great spot for lunch or for a late night eat after a bar or club.  It is within walking distance from Encore/Wynn.  Be careful if you want multiple items from the menu.  There are different lines for the multiple items offered so be prepared to wait in multiple ones especially if there is a wait."}
{"text":"My daughter Jessica Ann 23 had brought up let's go sit down somewhere and eat I immediately thought of a pub place we had been to she said No because I like to gamble lol so we went here, as I have never been almost did one time but ended up going to Denny's right next door... I'm so disappointed that I waited at least 15 year's since I have had these tacos I have been looking for and BOOM my daughter was so smart and I was Soo full and Happy happy happy after leaving! The best and took me that long to find the carnieasatas that once use to be everywhere here in my hometown for under a 1$. Still better than ever and I would of paid 2xs as much, ice cream omg was even great!!! Gonna have to get some again tonight"}
{"text":"Worth the wait!!!! Adding the lime made it over the top!!!! The Abodobo (sorry for the incorrect spelling) was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Una y otra y otra vez estos tacos son buenísimos 
Ningún otro sabor como estos en todas las vegas Nevada Los recomiendo"}
{"text":"I think I have just discovered another must stop by place in vegas now after a night of drinking. We got here around 12/1 and the line was out the door so we waited well over 40min for our food but it was well worth it. 

Something new that I haven't seen at other places.. their Adobada is very delicious and flavorful. These are street taco size so I'm sure you will be able to chow down on more than 3 tacos. There are so many of their other stuff that I would like to try next time... like their fries? Yes please! Lengua Fries to be exact!

Free Refills, ample seating, decently priced delicious mexican food. I don't think theres more that needs to be said."}
{"text":"Mouth wateringly delicious! Went there with the fam at 3pm on a Sunday and it was completely packed- long lines and no empty seats- I soon figured out why. 

First! You must have the Carne Asada fries!! (A full one if you are hungry and half if your not; $10 well worth the price) they use the real deal carne asada topped with guacamole, cheese, sourcream and their tasty (spicy) green sauce!! 

Sencond, I highly reccommend Tacos de Pastor (or adobada as they are called at this location) the green sauce is to die for and Tacos de Cabeza! Cilantro-onions- red or green sauce- and guacamole.

Third, You have to try their Horchata- perfect finish to the meal! A little sweeter than how it normally tastes but still very good.

I was in total shock when I saw that they had BUCHE as not many places have this particular meat on the menu nor is it ever cooked right. I didnt get to try it cuz I was too busy stuffing my face with the Carne asada fries but trust me when I say just looking at it, you could tell it would be good! 

If I had to complain about anything, it would be that I wasnt to fond of the way they made the guacamole- it seemed thin and didnt have much flavor, kind of like paste :/ other than that- everthing else was perfect! **TAKE NOTE that there are three or four separate lines each for a different type of meat- Carne Asada-Pork-Pastor*** SO CHECK WITH A COOK OR WORKER BEFORE YOU GET IN LINE!!***"}
{"text":"If I want tacos and I mean better than King Taco in LA this is the place. Hands down best tacos I have had in a long time.  I went here with a couple friends and we destroyed at least 8 tacos each.  They are just good, fresh made tacos.  

Want to get your grub on and not spend a bunch of cash?  Hit this place up and you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"The best street tacos I've ever had anywhere.  Get the adobada pork for sure.  I also like the carne asada too, but the pork is special.  The chefs who prepare them are also fun to watch as the sling ingredients into the air and make tacos from scratch with such speed that it's amazing.  I would consider moving to Las Vegas just to be near this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped here because a friend recommended it and it was really good, fast and cheap! It took the guy about 30 seconds to make me 2 tacos and a sope. Compared to anything else around here this is the best option that still taste super good!"}
{"text":"simply the best tacos in Las Vegas. Their Asada is second to none. Their Pastor while good is probably only topped by the Taco Truck on Bonanza and the boulevard. I've had tacos all over this city but this is quite possibly the only place I'll go from now on. I hear their exotic meats are good too but I'm not a fan of the types. I can only say of they're made with the same expertise as the other meats then they're just as delicious. 

if youre on east Charleston craving a quick bite there's no other place that's better."}
{"text":"I dream about this place!
It makes me so happy!
The tacos al pastor are the best things I have ever ever ever tasted!"}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD! My boss suggested to eat here after clubbing at Marquee and we came around 2:50am before closing and there was no line at all. :) I only tried their adobada (al pastor) and their carne asada fries. mmm & I love their sides! Especially their fresh grilled onions! :9 watch out on their grilled jalapenos...its super spicy! My friend started to cry. :( lol

For only $2 a taco, I am definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Meat was so tender and juicy Yummm you'll see the juice dripping from the rotisserie while you're in line makes your mouth water"}
{"text":"This place has some great tacos, but they don't make it easy have the optimal taco experience. Having to wait in multiple lines to get the various types of tacos difficult at best. If you go by yourself, you might be s.o.l.
My favorites are the Adovada (marinated spit roasted pork) and their carne asada. Both are excellent representations of how it should be. The Adovada is impressive with not one, but two massive \"trompos\", the vertically stack slices of marinated pork rotating in front of a fire, with the constant manicuring, slicing thin, juicy slices into freshly made corn tortillas, is worth the wait. Be sure to get them \"con todo\" (with everything) so that you don't miss out on the full experience. The carne asada is char-broiled over a lava rock broiler, creating that delicious \"al Carbon\" flavor that caps off the perfect carne asada experience. Go in a group and have one member stand in line at one window to get Adovada, then have another member get the carne asada, and then another to get the suadero or lengua and you can all meet at the cashier before the tacos get cold."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by this taco place after hearing good reviews. 

Well, this is not a place I would visit again. 

The line was out the door, there was about 15 people in front of me and It took about 45 mins  to make it in the door. Once inside there were about 6 lines more so Im standing there puzzled and I ask the lady in front of me how does this place work. 

So, I need to stand in line for the type of meat tacos I want. Well I wanted 2 of each so that means I have to stand in each line to get my tacos and each line has about 15 people waiting. So, I decide to stand in the shortest line and get whatever they have. That took about 1 hr 15 mins. 

Once I had my tacos I had to stand in another line to pay. 

Total time to get soggy, cold and expensive tacos 2hrs. Never again. For $50 next time I'll eat at a casino buffet. 

If you decided to eat here make sure you dont come alone. Bring atleast 6 people with you so then each person can wait in each line at the same time and one can wait by the tables in hopes of getting a seat."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST GO TO! It is traditional Mexican food, not anything like Taco Bell or Chipotle etc..

Their onions are delicious, and I love their carne asada tacos!

Pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious. 

FYI they do have Sour Cream, you have to ask for it on the side if you want to add it to your tacos (for anyone that likes their tacos americanized lol)

Love this place! They are open super late too."}
{"text":"I probably have zipped by this place dozens of times and didn't realize what I've been missing. The adobada is the best I have ever had. Hands down the best authentic street taco joint!! The adobada had such deep layers of flavor and melts in your mouth. We had ordered a variety of tacos to see which will be our go to when we return. The carne Asada had a great smoked flavor while very tender like the adobada. I also tried the chorizo and once again I savored ever bite to fully enjoy all of the spice and complimenting flavors. But it was the adobada that was the winner. I would have loved to buy a container of that meat. Open till 5 am this place will be my new late night grub stop."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch it's amazing food cheap be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes if you come in the late afternoon bring a jacket there's no seats inside always crowed but again the food is amazing. I had the steak frys!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo can best be described as the Mexican food version of In N Out. It's always packed, the line feels like forever, and the food is finger licking good. We ordered Pastor tacos, Lengua, Pastor fries, and a \"Vampiro\" (a tostada sandwich with your choice of meat, pico, cilantro, and a slab of cheese).

To help speed up the line, there are three order windows. They are identified by what type of meat you want. Still slow going, but definitely helps. Tacos are $2.25 - $4 each depending on what you get. The fries are more, $13 - $15, but they are a good size.

True to it's name I felt like a gordita when I left."}
{"text":"Order any of their Adobado dishes. Trust me... they are fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow. On the suggestion of a customer, I went to this place. Upon looking at the location, I thought what have I done. But my rule is don't eat in a restaurant with an empty parking lot. That was not the case here as the locals were all over the place. I got the Tacos al Pastore. How amazing. This place is so simple but good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get Mexican food. Love that it's open late! Though the lines are sometimes super long I feel that it's worth it! I always get a lengua taco, asada taco, and an asada sopes when I go there and it is delicious! I love the cheese they use as well!"}
{"text":"Had the carne asada and chorizo tacos. Both very good. Taste like the ones we eat in Tecate, MX. Will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I wish they had more of these in town! Very legit taco spot located on the strip. They close very late so it's a great place to go after finishing a night on the strip. It can get very busy during these times but it's worth it! I recommend their al pastor tacos (ask for pineapple!) and their cabeza tacos."}
{"text":"I personally, am happy they moved to the middle of nowhere, because now I don't have to deal with the craziness of the strip in order to get delicious tacos!

I lived in San Diego, where legit Mexican food exists. After moving to Vegas, I needed to find my go-to taco shop. Tacos El Gordo is hands down one of the best tacos I've ever had! Yes, they're a bit pricey for tacos, but they are bomb so it's all good.

Adobada tacos are amazing, the meat is so tasty and the toppings (guac mayo!) combined just make it heaven in my mouth. I usually order three, but I can probably two more if I want to be a fatty. Campechana fries are also a must- half adobada/half carne asada. *Drools*

Only thing is that they are stingy with the salsa. They keep it in a fridge behind the cashier, and you'll go over there with all your tacos and full order of fries and they'll give you one measly cup. I'm usually like, \"Can I have 3 more?\" and they're good about it."}
{"text":"WHY DID THE ONE NEAR WYNN SHUT DOWN.......
seriously though why!!? It was the most convenient drunchie place ever because of it's walking distance from XS.. ugh, so instead we had to drive all the way here!
Oh well, doesn't matter because the lines here were still ridiculous, even at 3am..so business must still be good.
I love love love their spicy pork and carne asada tacos! They already include sauces in them so that's why they don't have a sauce bar. Plus they include guac on them!!! That's 5 stars right there!
I also got their sopes but they weren't as good as  the tacos. I really like the melted cheese though!
btw, you can ask for grilled veggies! its free and goes great with them tacos!"}
{"text":"Best. Drunchies. Ever. 

Came here after a great night at XS, love how its located right next to Wynn!
The lines do get pretty long, i mean, cheap delicious food after a night of dancing is a must!

All their tacos are great! esp. carne asada!! Juicy and tender, I love how they cook it right then and there so you know its fresh! You can also ask for grilled veggies! Don't forget to ask for their hot sauces when you're ordering because they don't have a hot sauce bar. 
Their sopas are also superrr good. Would really recommend it!
BTW, there are different lines for different kinds of meat, and dishes so make sure to stand in the right line!"}
{"text":"This IS the best taco place in the US.  The tacos are superb.  But be ready for a line. The wait is worth it.  Plus, they are organized based on the type of taco you want. Therefore, some lines go a lot faster.  One item that is not listed on the menu is tacos de noples (cactus). Don't know why because they are delicious!!!   The tortillas as freshly hand made. A true heavenly experience.  Oh, they have traditional sweets for dessert.   You must come here!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go especially after a late night out being that they are open till 3am on the weekdays and 5am on the weekends (Fri/Sat).  

The adobada is extremely popular and usually has a long line but don't forget about the lengua or cabeza which are my personal favorites.  All of the tacos are very fresh being that they do so much business it feels like you're ordering \"à la minute\" and range from $2.00-$2.50 each.  Must get is also the grilled green onions and jalapenos which are complimentary for your order."}
{"text":"I didn't get anything to get here because I was recovering from food poisoning. But my BF got the spicy pork tacos and he said they were the best tacos he's ever had. This place is authentic and the long lines and people show that it is really good. He gives 5 stars for that.

However, one has to ask whether it's worth the 50+ minute wait. The lines bring down the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. The queuing system was really confusing. As others have mentioned, there are separate lines for everything. There are six lines, two sets of three lines. The three lines are for pork (abodaba), offal (brains, tongue, stomach, tripe, intestines, etc), and beef (asada, etc). The line didn't actually look that long so it was ridiculous how it took so long. 

As we got closer, we found out why. It's because there was one guy doing the job of two people. He makes the tacos really fast but he would have to make like at least 5 for each customer. Also, he made like 50+ tacos while we were in line that looked like it was for to-go orders (paper plates wrapped in foil). So the amount of time per person and the amount of extra work the taco maker is doing for people not in line contributes to long wait times. It feels like there has to be a better way for them to do this!"}
{"text":"When I got here around 10pm on a Monday night there was a line! The line was well worth it the food was so bomb we got al pastor , lengua and Tripas. I love tripa tacos but The tripas here were way too crunchy for my taste and no real flavor but the lengua tacos and al pastor tacos were amazing as hell !"}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: Authentic, flavorful tacos in a \"hole in the wall\" style restaurant. Just be willing to put up with a line.

Try:
Asada
Sudadero

Pro:
There's little else to be said except they make excellent tacos, fast. Definitely a great place to pop by for a quick snack, and they have a good variety of meat. (Not good for vegetarians)

Con:
The lines are long, especially for their more popular meets due to their unique ordering system (lines by meat type). The place is very dingy, but depending on your point of view, can add to the authentic experience. It's a little pricy for what it is, but decent for Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome. Just simply awesome. The food is prepared in front of you and the environment was pretty amaZing. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Very inefficient means of service - an \"assembly line\" type of structure might work a lot better for this place. Instead, there are three separate lines for three different types of meat and the lines for asada and al pastor are significantly longer. By the time we sat down with our tacos, they were cold (because the line to pay is even longer and there is only one cashier). Not sure if it's just this location but my party was disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"I've been told by many friends that this is the best taco place in Vegas. They are not my friends anymore as of now. What a disappointment, for reals. A piece of shit taco truck in Los Angeles is way better than this dump. (I got carne asada and chorizo)"}
{"text":"Line is long but that's the norm here. The carne adobada fries are awesome and are the only reason why I come here. There is not dining area so come with a plan."}
{"text":"I found this place thanks to yelp...and it was amazing! The staff are friendly, enthusiastic, and work very fast. The portions are perfect and the prices are great. I had the carne asada fries, with chorizo on corn taco. DELICIOUS. I will be back. 
There a many interesting characters coming into this place at night. Including myself :p"}
{"text":"I preferred the marinated pork tacos over the beef tacos.  Its kind of inconvenient that you have to wait in different lines depending on what you want to order, and then another line to pay for it.  Overall, the value was pretty good.  4 of us ate there for about $45 and we all got drinks too.  It was hard to find a seat here as a result of its popularity.  We all liked the tacos and will go back again."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying the Tacos El Gordo franchise and I just happened to be starving in Vegas. 

As someone who hasn't tried their SD location, I relied heavily on my friends who have. We waited around 40min in line for the food. 

It's a bit confusing in the beginning because the line out is singular, but once you step inside, you'll only be able to wait in \"meat-specific\" lines. For example, a line for lengua & cabeza, a line for asada, and a line for el pastor. I think you're able to request a different meat in line, but it just makes waiting longer for you and everyone else in line.

Theyre pretty quick once you place your order because they only work on one order at a time. After you get your food, you'll have to pay for it and then go find a table. 

My friends told me that this location was pretty salty and not as great as SD. You gotta factor in that this is Vegas and the lines get really long in the evenings so that might be the contributing factor for long lines, and bulk production of food (over-seasoning).

3 stars because it honestly wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Open late. It's a good place to stop by if you're ever hungry and wandering the strip. It's always busy, although they have really fast service in spite of all the business."}
{"text":"Just tacos ... nope.  Delicious tacos ... getting a little closer.  Mouth-watering, savory, makes you go \"Mmm mm\" tacos ... yup, there you go.

What's going to happen:
1.  Pull up to Tacos El Gordo and see the massive line outside (95% of time, there WILL be a LINE outside).  Fret not, the line goes pretty quickly my friends.

2.  Get in line.  This is when you make your game plan.  If you want more than one meat, hopefully you're with a friend or two.  There's about 3-4 lines inside separated by what meat you plan to get.  Strategize so everyone in your group knows which line they're going to and what they're getting.  Write it down it make note in your phone if you have to.

3.  Get inside.  Chaos!  Wait, you planned for this. Relax.  Get in your line and know your order.

4.  Order.  Regroup.  Pay.  ENJOY!

And I mean ENJOY!

My eyes are always way too big for my stomach here.  I can't help it.  It all looks and smells so good.  I can't help myself.  All their meats are full of flavor that I couldn't possibly pick my favorite.  I've tried them all.  Don't be afraid of the lengua and cabeza friends, they are indeed delicious and worth trying.

If you'd like to venture out of the regular taco, also remember there is the vampiro.  Basically the contents of the taco with melted cheese inside two crispy tortillas.  A yummy crispy taco sandwich ready for your consumption."}
{"text":"Went at 10am right when they opened. I got the first Carne Asada tacos of the day! Jackpot. We enjoyed the Carne Asada, chorizo, and Adobada Tacos. 

Everything was fresh and awesome."}
{"text":"I was driving past wondering why it was so packed in there,  now that I'm in here I see why! !!  Yummy @zzz carne asada tacos.  I needed to order a twelve pack!!!!! Good service.  It's great."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a total cluster f*ck  to get your order in, but that kinda adds to the charm. It's always packed and you will know why with the first bite. Eat here enough and you'll eventually wind up having to share a table with a stranger!! 

Don't come here thinking you're going to get a fat burrito. They don't sell them! The tacos are amazing, as are the sopes. My favorite is the adobado fries. They have this green sauce on them that is like creamy heaven in a box with French fries and pork. So good!

This is mos def the place to go when you need to feed the alcohol!!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas this place is a must everything is so good here

Avoid lunch time 

The postor are my favorite here 

Also de asada you can't go wrong with anything here"}
{"text":"Very bad organization five lines takes over a hour and the food was not as amazing as they hype for a hour and 45 min wait and huge lines outside the building not worth it never coming again there's better taco places in cali."}
{"text":"Great place for some tacos! Expect long lines! 

I will say that you have to inconveniently order certain items on separate lines... Which takes longer to get your food. :/

Also, pay after you get the food, but before you sit down. The cashiers will stare at you. Oops, we were first timers and didnt know their protocols."}
{"text":"Some of, if not, THE best tacos I've had in Vegas since moving here in 2003. I live in Summerlin and have no problem driving to the other side of town to get my fix. 

The carne asada tacos are decent (as are the tripe and lengua tacos), but, the spicy pork adobada tacos are golden. At $2 each, they can't be beat. If you're planning on visiting, make sure to order at least one of the adobada tacos, you'll thank me later.

The service is extremely friendly as well.

Originally from San Francisco, I'm a seasoned vet when it comes to cheap, delicious, hole-in-the-wall taquerias. I almost don't want to admit it, but these tacos are better than any I can remember having in the Mission. 

I almost feel sorry for the taco shop across the way in the same strip mall, \"Los Tacos.\" Almost. They're good, but overpriced. I believe Los Tacos originated in San Francisco, around 24th and Mission, and they're overpriced there as well. A single taco shouldn't cost $5+. 

Tacos El Gordo appears to have decimated the business at Los Tacos. It's funny driving between two competing taquerias where 90% of the cars are parked on one side of the lot. If they made burritos, I'd probably cry tears of joy."}
{"text":"My cousin has heard nothing but good things about Tacos El Gordo so she decided to take her kids and I here for dinner. Let me tell you, if I could, I would take a turbulent flight back to Las Vegas for some chorizo tacos and some carne asada fries right this second. 
When approaching the plaza El Gordo is in, you can definitely tell its not the upscale part of Vegas. 
Trust me, I definitely felt sketchy walking up to this place, I was thinking \"what's my cousin thinking? We're in Vegas, let's go eat at a buffet or something\", but my cousin stood her ground! We ended up waiting in what seemed to be SUCH a long line, but it moved pretty quickly. It can be expected to wait around 30-45 mins. We ordered and what impressed me most is everything is made to order, even the tortillas! So fresh, so good. Getting to watch your food being made, even better, smells and all. 
I would say that the experience that you would receive here is no different than a fast food restaurant. Order food, pick up and pay. Tacos El Gordo is not a really waitressed place although there is tons of seating. Even when there was so much seating it was super packed so we decided to take it to the car to enjoy. I can tell you right now, that it's the most authentic Mexican food I've EVER had and it's the BEST Mexican food that I've ever tasted. 
I guess the saying is right, \"you should never  judge a book by its cover\"."}
{"text":"I LOVE tacos, but who doesn't? This place is phenomenal. If you're not in a rush, if you want authenticity, this is a must try. Pastor, adobada, sesos, intestines.. Yes, all that stuff that has been \"Americanized\" by other taco places like King Taco, you can find here. 

I don't like the long lines at all times of the day but it really is worth the wait. 

Locations only in San Diego & Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm usually the person that says, \"Vegas doesn't have any good Mexican restaurants.\"  Well...Tacos El Gordo has renewed my faith in Mexican food from Las Vegas.  The carne asada fries lived up to the hype and then some!  The tacos reminded me of those found on a legit food truck.  Good cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!! I can have asada tacos from here for breakfast, lunch and dinner!! Just like in TJ you get in line to order your food first at the line corresponding with the meat you would like. Pay after you get your food. Place gets very crowded, expect to wait. The food though is definitely worth the wait and worth my 3 hour drive!! Don't leave town before trying this place!"}
{"text":"SOOOOO legit

This spot is a transplant from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.  
I had something that is called a \"Vampiro\" from a street vendor in East LA a few years back and was never the same.  They were some of the most amazing secrets of Mexican food I had never discovered up till then.  Sadly the vendor was robbed at gunpoint, not having enough money to buy new equipment.  

It can never be as good as those original Vampiros to me, but thank god I have come across somewhere I can find them now this side of the border.  Just order them, don't even worry about what they are.  I am sure many have given the description in their review.  

Also, the al pastor vampiro which are also called adobado.  The line for this meat is long and dedicated given the amazing taste of the meat and you will see the line form behind the giant rotisserrie for the pork, capped off with a whole pineapple on top which allows the juice to drip all over the meat."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos in Vegas.  Excellent.  Just like TJ.  Prices are reasonable and its quick and easy to get your meal on."}
{"text":"After driving past this place so many times and seeing an enormous line out and around the restaurant I was thinking to myself this must be the best place ever for tacos in the history of Nevada.

Boy was I wrong! Waited 2 hours to get my food. 1 hour and 15 minutes outside in the 110 degree heat and then inside another 45 minutes. Got in the shortest line inside and ended having the longest wait. The people in front of me ordered enough food for 30-40 people each. 

The asada tacos were chewy and full of gristle, the spicy pork tacos were really fatty and rubbery but had a good green sauce on top. They make the tortillas fresh on the spot which was a plus.

The flan tasted pretty old even though the expiration date wasn't for a few more days. The horchata came out of a soda fountain machine and overly sweet and not creamy.

I honestly don't get all of the hype of this place? They aren't as good as the tacos here in Utah and we aren't known for the best Mexican food in the west coast. Definitely not as good as the taco's in Cancun or Tijuana. 

Will not go back to this place, that 2 hour long wait was a killer and I will be holding a grudge for a while to come."}
{"text":"The best pure mexican food spot in Vegas by far and it's 24 hours. Definitely coming back for other selection they offer."}
{"text":"First I have to say that the tacos de adobada (pastor) were delicious! But I would have preferred finely chopped onion instead of big huge chunks.

The real problem here is that the lines make NO SENSE. Why the hell do you have 4 lines for different types of meat? If you want to try the different meats you have to wait in four damn lines.
Then you get your food and you have to wait in another damn line. It make makes NO SENSE.

You could easily grab your food go sit and eat and not pay, they would never know.

TACOS EL GORDO, I recommend that one of your employees should be a customer and have to wait in every line and order one taco of each type of meat on a busy night and hopefully you will realize how crazy it is to have to wait in five lines. 
Maybe this way you will fix your line situation.
5 damn lines, unbelievable!!!!!"}
{"text":"I still remember seeing this place when it first opened and witnessing how its evolved into this taco juggernaut. The space got bigger, they added outdoor seats, and now the crowd is out of control.  Midday Saturday I waited 15 minutes for food. Can't imagine what its like peak times.  Same recos - spicy pork is solid, almost like chinese bbq pork. Lengua is good too. Spicy pork fries are $10 and massive enough will feed an army of children (or hungry men,  whomever you have). Even the half size lengua fries are massive, but the pork is better,  unfortunately only comes in large."}
{"text":"I don't have nothing to say about this place just drive by and notice how crowd is always there looks like they are giving free food. Always packed I been here a couple of times no regrets in their tacos."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had. When I return from Vegas I was craving tacos for weeks. I must have tried 5 different places in the Olympia area and nothing compared. I'll have to wait another year to get my fix. It was a bit intimidating when you walk in the door. Very busy hand confusing. We stood there and kind of watched people to see what to do. Once we realized to get in line in front of the items you want to order we felt like a local. This place has nothing to do with Vegas and everything to do with awesome tacos. I felt and little uneasy in the area but I went there 3 days in a row because the tacos were so great."}
{"text":"Talk about amazing tacos! Chicago may be well known for its taco scene but a Tacos El Gordo is defintely needed. I wish I could eat here everyday.

I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Please update this location is closed. We went at the end of December. Tried the Charleston location but the wait was so long we didn't want to wait in line for an hour. The food though is probably some of the best tacos and quesadillas I have ever had."}
{"text":"By far best food on the strip as are as tacos go .. This is as close as it gets to Mexican out side of Mexico!!!' Will for sure be back"}
{"text":"My god the all pastor is good here! Along with a side of their grilled onions and peppers, a meal could not get more perfect. My husband and son are obsessed with the half pastor half asada fries, they stay crispy, the guac is killer, we passed on the sour cream. Why they closed their prime location on the strip is beyond me, but both their other locations are close enough and more than worth seeking out.
Both have outstanding service, amazing food and way too long of a wait to get your food.
You really have to be lucky to find a seat here, worst case eat it in the car or outside, again more than worth it.
Prices are fair, the $10 will fill you up for days, the $2 tacos are tiny, get at least 4.
A must stop every time I am in Vegas!"}

If you want more than two meats, then your food will be cold. The chile was whack. If you want real San Diego Mexican food, try Roberto's. It's opposite end of strip. In between Mandalay Bay and South Pointe. I've lived in SD before and they have the best! Better than. LA!!!"}
{"text":"OH MY TACOS EL GORDO! When you thought you lived in a city with authentic mexican food, Tacos El Gordo... hands down beats it all! THE BEST TACOS. Whether you are drunk or sober, it doesn't matter. I love how this is jam packed & open during early & late hours throughout the day.

* Ordered:
- Small Carne Asada Fries (3/4 stars): Sorry, I've tasted better in Southern California so this is just a good back up for your asada needs. A small is shareable for 2 unless you're drunkenly, hungry.
- Al Pastor Tacos (5/5 stars): SO good, that I wished I got more than 2!
- Asada Tacos (4/5 stars): Squeeze the lime all over & you're good to go. I think picking asada for tacos are better than the fries.
- Horchata (3/5 stars): Too small for it's price, but good enough to wash down the tacos.

- They have a salsa & lime bar

* Concept:
1) Come in, pick your \"MEAT line.\" They have specific lines for all their meats from al pastor to asada to pork to beef to beef tongue & more!

2) Ask them what you want between tacos, fries, tostadas, sopes, mulas, quesadillas & drinks. They'll grill the meat in front of you!

3) Take it to go, they'll wrap it in foil for you or dine in, they'll simply put it on a plate hot & fresh for you to eat!

4) Pay at the registers.

5) Finding a table here can get difficult, but when you keep an eye out, people leave left & right here & there. We didn't wait very long to sit down because most tables were in groups. 

6) They have workers coming around cleaning up & take your trays & trash when you are done eating. 

Do not be intimidated by the lines & crowd. For a Friday night, lines were fast, got our food cooked fast, & the only line that was longer here was to pay because they only have 2 registers. This is THE SPOT to eat before, during, or after partying in Vegas!

GRACIAS, Tacos El Gordo!

ps - This isn't the only location! (North LV & the strip)"}
{"text":"I've been to the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, and to this day, I'm still convinced they lace their tacos with some sort of euphoric drug. These are my favorite tacos in the world (well, except for actual Mexico) and I'm glad they lived up to the standard I was accustomed to in San Diego.

My friend and I came here on a chilly Las Vegas evening after a long two-day meeting at SLS Station. The lines were pretty long when we arrived, and everyone is forced to step inside the restaurant so the doors can close. It's security-enforced.

While I snagged a table for the two of us inside, my friend stood in line for al pastor tacos. Usually in San Diego, I'd have the flexibility to stand in multiple lines to get a variety of tacos, but it seemed ridiculous with a 15 minute wait in each line.

People came and went quickly, but I stood my ground at our table, knowing it could be a full house at any time. They ran out of al pastor at the station my friend was at, but they weren't able to \"restock\" from the other al pastor station, so she had to wait an extra 15 minutes. Never waited this long for tacos before, but I knew it would be worth it in the end.

Eventually my friend showed up with our tray of tacos and my cup of horchata. I was in heaven. All the trouble and the wait was well-weathered. Tacos El Gordo still gets 5 stars for its food. I've seen that they have less busy nights, so our visit was probably just poorly timed. Seems like a bunch of locals and families come here, but if you have the flexibility and you're visiting, check it out."}
{"text":"We had Carne asada tacos. Definitely tasty and flavorful. Tortillas are fresh hand pressed. There were a list of different meats to get (like chorizo, beef head, tongue,  pork etc). I do not think chicken was one. I'm glad I came to experience the food. However it's kinda pricey in my opinion for tacos. We got 6 tacos with guacamole and our bill was $15. Definitely not enough to make you full because they are so small. It was more of an appetizer. So if you plan to eat to get full be prepared to have at least 5 to 6 tacos for one person and pay almost $3 per taco. No burritos but they do have quesadillas and fries. 

Ordering was a bit confusing at first. You order from the guys cooking the meat and pay at the counter afterwards. I'm not fluent in Spanish so it took me a sec to get my bearings and no one was trying to help me.

 I would come back for a good Carne taco to grab a bite before dinner. But I'm not adventurous enough to try anything else on the menu besides the carnitas."}
{"text":"Wow it gets worse. i wasnt a fan of this place before and i keep coming back but it SUCKS 
first off theres no AC on a nice hot summer day in las vegas. they have some horrible air machine that blows the hot ass hair on your back

the people who go there are mostly ghetto , last time i was there i saw ANOTHER fight break out in the tent then the dumb security comes and pepersrpays everyone so the spray gets in our food and eyes and nose, my eyes start to hurt and everyone starts sneezing..
come on , so ghetto. the lines are CONFUSING 

theres a damn long line for carne asada and another for the al pastor. ARE YOU GUYS STUPID? dont do that

this place is aweful its a mess its dirrty and looks like a dump
its TRASH dont go here the food is average but everything else sucks 
stay away 

oh and bring someone who speaks spanish or else good luck

god i hate this place ghetto and dirty"}
{"text":"Love this place! The spicy pork tacos are my favorite however, everything I've tried here (and I've had damn near everything twice) has been better than great.  the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.  No wonder there are so many great reviews for Tacos El Gordo.  
  it can get busy and it's frustrating waiting on a table when some folks want to take their time and not get the hell out but this by no means the fault of the restaurant, simply a testament to their success."}
{"text":"The food is very good but I'm extremely disappointed with this place. I'm extremely disappointed by the staff and the experience I had. My girlfriend and I stopped to eat here because we love the food. As I waited in line, my girlfriend went to use the restroom. My girlfriend, a FEMALE, walked into the restroom and a staff member took one look at her and asked if she knew it was the girls restroom, she explained to her she knew and that she is female... My girlfriend wasn't upset at this point, but what upset her and myself was the fact that two of these female employees then laughed when they thought she left the restroom and continued to make jokes about her while she stood there and listened. I can't even begin to explain to you how degrading that was for her. Seeing the embarrassment on her face was heartbreaking. So NO, I don't recommend this place because the employees are HOMOPHOBIC and judgmental."}
{"text":"My friends hated this place and said they will never come back. I admit the meat is good but there were a lot of other things I didn't like. Through our experience, it was packed, hectic, and wasn't as great as we thought it would be. When you go in there will be lines based on meats. Everyone talks about the carne asada fries so I decided to go in the asada line. The asada line usually goes out the door. Someone was telling me to either stay outside or go in and I wanted to go in but there was no room. So by the time I ordered I wasn't sure if the guy who was making the food heard me or not. I also ordered the tacos which came immediately. So I assumed he didn't hear me and my friends were in a different line and we wanted the same thing so I decided to join them in the last line furthest to the right. My friends said they were in line for the carne asada line, but they were actually in line for the lengua line which didn't show the asada. The line for the lengua goes to a side so you can't see what the line is for until you get about half way through. Someone in line told us that we are in the wrong line. So I wanted to make sure I wasn't in the wrong line. I asked the cashier which line is for the carne asada and she didn't speak English but she understood me and pointed at the line, the line I got the tacos in. Turns out the guy did hear me and got mad at me for stepping out of line. But he was already taking other people's orders so I got confused. I felt like the whole experience was confusing.
When I finally got my food, I needed napkins and had to ask where they have the napkins. Apparently they don't give you napkins you have to ask for it.  I felt like this place has poor customer service. The first cashier that helped me was ok but the second one seemed so grumpy. They are not friendly to first comers either. They just assumed that everyone knows what they are doing. 
Anyway, the food ended up being just ok. The fries were soggy but the meat is pretty good.  The food was pretty salty in general and made me super thirsty.
As for coming back here, I don't think I would come back unless there was nothing else opened. But it's Vegas, so probably not. It's the city that never sleeps. Maybe the grumpy cashiers just needed to sleep?"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect stop when in Vegas. We ordered like 10 adobado tacos which is a taco with spiced pork and pineapple on a flour tortilla. It's a bit spicy so eat wth caution and the portions  are a little small so if you're hungry you may want to order more. Their menu is diverse and comes with tacos or plates. This is the perfect meal for any occasion even after a night of drinking. We also ordered their orchata which was very refreshing. Perfect touch of cinnamon and not too heavy. 

The only complaint I have is that the line is soooo long. It was out the door. The wait is worth it though and the line moves fast. Definitely come."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said, thank goodness they are opening another location next door hopefully larger. The lines here are Non stop & for good reason. Good price authentic tacos. Love the side of grill vegetables, the jalapeño has a kick. But you can cool down with fountain served Orchata drink, not the best version, but ads to the meal experience. Which line to stand  for different types of meats, & then pay, is discombobulated, but still a place I would go eat at again."}
{"text":"SPICY PORK TACO! Adobada, how do I describe my love for this bad boy?

1) DAT SAUCE! The taco Gods were kind enough to share their nectar of life with us lowly beings and not only drizzle, but give this taco a drenching bath in a creamy sauce of deliciousness. I have no idea what kind of ingredients they put in this sauce, but I hope it's illegal because something that tastes this good is pure addiction.

2) SPICY PORK! Meat so huge its as though if you stuffed your face and tore meat from the bone with your own teeth. There was so much in this taco, they did not skimp out at all like some other places. It also had so much flavor, I am salivating just thinking about it. 

3) CILANTRO! SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! I am a huge cilantro lover and the herbiness with the cream sauce, pork meat, and corn tortilla was NOM NOM NOM! I can seriously ask for a ton more because cilantro is so amazing.

4) The adobada really isn't spicy according to my standards as I have a gazillion spice level tolerance. But, I poured a whole container of the green sauce they have to the side table, and it gave my tacos that extra kick with the cream sauce.

5) LITTLE MEXICAN LADY! How AWESOME & NICE can she be?!?! I called in to pick up 10 tacos for my friends and I. First thing she does is answer in Spanish, that's how you know this place is LEGIT! After asking to speak in English, I could tell that she was super busy with other customers in line. Drove for about 5 minutes, and i was expecting to wait in the store for our 10 tacos, but as soon as I walked up to the counter, she said \"You called for the order Huh?\" @__@ How did she know? I didn't even say a single word to her. Psychic powers? And out from under the counter she pulled the most beautiful plastic bag FULL of tacos already packaged in little plates, foils, plastic forks, spoons, napkins, sauces in containers, and horse radish in ziplock bags! Customer service was so fast, amazing, and nice at 10PM on a packed Sunday night that it made my taco taste a bazillion times better!

Tacos El Gordo, until we meet again in Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've eaten on the strip. Love street tacos! So happy we went here"}
{"text":"So decided to go here since the reviews were high. Whats the hype all about? I completely   have no idea. My fiance and I tried it cause of the reviews and we were near by. We ordered 4 tacos. Which by the way for 4 were 9 bucks on a taco tuesday. They were so tiny, I could have went to El Pollo Loco instead and got an entire meal that was worth having.

I got the carne asada tacos. The taste was wayyyyy too salty and cold by the time I bit into them. Sad to say, I gave the rest to my fiance. It is more sad cause whomever thought this place was worth rating a 5 has NEVER had authentic Mexican food from real Mexicans. As a matter of fact, go to Lindo Michoacan, thats where its at. Or if you want, go to the bay area and so cali where the real Mexican food is worth paying for big portions.

Even I can cook better. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I tried going to other taco places to search for the best, but I just keep coming back here. If In N Out is to burgers then Tacos El Gordo is the champion of all taquerias in LV. Simple, delicious, no-frills menu. You can't get better than this. 

Since my last review I've been here numerous times and I always order the same thing: CABEZA, ADOBADA, and LENGUA. If you have not tried these yet, please, step away from your carne asada and discover the sheer pleasure of these juicy, flavorful meats. Out of this world delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Im an originary of TJ and I must say...Vegas is the shiz nit, however, havin' a lil' piece of TJ made it a tad bit better this last time around...

Tacos El Gordo has been in Vegas for roughly half a year now.  I dont know how they hadn't thought about settleling in Vegas before, given such a large Mexican population, but I'm glad they did now.

I was thrilled to have some good old fashion Tijuana street tacos after a long nite of drinking and dancing :D  However, the carne asada fries took me by surprise and made my night even better than it had originally been.

I definately plan on coming back to this establishment when I come back to visit."}
{"text":"Heaven in a tortilla!  Great  atmosphere with flare!  Great food that is delicious and nice portions!  Go with the pork, it is amazing!!! The homemade corn tortillas make all happen!!! My go-to place in Vegas for tacos!!!
MUY BIENO!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday afternoon and ordered 2 spicy pork tacos, horchata and shared carne asada fries for 8. 

- BEST tacos I've ever had! SOO GOOD! MUST COME. 
- Spicy pork is awesome. they slice it right in front of you and put this delicious sauce! DROOL ~____~
- Carne asada fries are huge. a bit expensive, 10 for a large, so you have to share. A large in socal is a bit less, 8. Lots of guacamole. :)
- Security has a GUN! gangsta...."}
{"text":"$2 a taco?!

Brought 15 tacos back to the room, had a picnic taco party on the floor while all the girls got ready for going out.  The favorites were the Asada tacos, with the Al Pastor coming in second. Lengua came in last.

Best idea ever."}
{"text":"I was staying around the corner from Tacos El Gordo in Las Vegas and it was late and I was hungry.  I started walking down the street looking for something, I didn't want fast food, I didn't wan t a fancy restaurant and I didn't want a chain place.  All of a sudden I saw Tacos El Gordo!  Front the outside It looked like the place all the locals would go, and then on the inside I was the only non Spanish person there! I felt out of place for about 30 seconds but quickly got over it.  The menu on the wall isn't very descriptive and it's a little challenging to figure out what to order where, but with the use of my IPhone looking words up I quickly figured out what I wanted, I took another 2 minutes and stepped back and then I figured out what to order where.  I think I ordered 2 Taco De Asada which are 2 steak tacos with a red sauce and guacamole and onion and then I also ordered 2 Adobada Tacos which are spicy pork!  They were all delicious.  After you get your food you walk across the restaurant to pay,  this is where I have a small issue.  There was a little display with some desserts and I have a sweet tooth, I started asking the lady at the register what each item was and she basically told me she wasn't helping me, if I didn't know what it was then tuff.  WOW, kinda rude, and I can only assume because I'm not Spanish.  I paid and left.  I gave it three stars because of the rude lady at the checkout and the little bit of confusion I had ordering and the fact the menus wasn't very descriptive of what certain items were."}
{"text":"Greasy, carby food always sounds good after drinking. Actually, pretty much anything tastes good after drinking...except for more alcohol.

We went here after a fun night at the club. The other location on the Strip was way too packed and we were way too hungry to wait 30 minutes to stand in line and find a table with other drunk people on the same mission. A 10-minute drive and wait at this location trumps that.

We got horchata, carne Asada fries and tacos al pastor.

Carne Asada Fries:
Even the small portion was a lot. Warm fried potatoes loaded with cheese, carne Asada and guac. 4/5

Tacos al Pastor:
Spicy meat. Yup, that's all I can remember so, I'm not even going to attempt to be descriptive about it. 4/5

We were the only Chinos in this area at 3am. It's all good."}
{"text":"Comfort Mexican food with 3 locations throughout Vegas. Always busy no what time you go. luckily I went on a Easter Sunday night around 2am and only waited no more than 5 minutes. Lines are divided by meat type. Order food first and then pay afterwards. 

Although all their food is delicious, don't waste your time ordering carne asada. Might as well just save your time going to another Mexican spot. Must order adobada fries (small size is just enough for two). I took away 1 star because my adobada fries had waaaaay too much oil on the bottom of the box, which has never happened to me in all my experiences with Tacos El Gordo. My friend whose order also came out with mine had no oil. Hopeful that is will not happen again."}
{"text":"I was craving fish tacos and horchata so, I went here. I forgot they don't serve fish tacos. Oops! Well, I was already here so, I might as well get something else. Tacos El Gordo is always a good choice - most people would agree which explains the long lines at their other locations. I came at the right time when there was no line and the place was practically empty - it was weird.

I normally get the same items: adobada taco, carne Asada taco, Al pastor taco, horchata...and carne Asada fries when I feel like I deserve it. Great meat-tortilla-fixins ratio. The flavors are wonderful. And tacos are inexpensive. Sure, the horchata comes from a vending machine but I still like it. I can drink as much horchata as I want and take it home with me. Mmmm...

My bro-in-law likes their tripa taco. I don't eat tripe so, I'll just have to take his word for it.

The people that work here have been the friendliest group out of all the locations I've been to. They have more tables here than the other locations. This used to be a Sinclair gas station but the gas pumps are still there. Can I pump gallons of horchata?

I came home with puffy lips and itchy throat - I also forgot that tacos have tomatoes and I'm allergic to them. But how can you eat Mexican food without tomatoes??? The discomfort was worth it."}
{"text":"Service is great, positive attitudes and smiles all day long even when they are busy, and I mean they can be busy but I am more then willing to wait for my food, this is one of the few places in Las Vegas that actually has has all of the rare authentic Mexican food that's hard to find anywhere else (head, stomach, intestines), if your not into that type of food no worries, I've almost had everything on the menu and I haven't been disappointed once 

I come here at least twice a week, and I would recommend this place to anyone who is serious about great food."}
{"text":"This is located right next the Ross, just after Cathedral Way (past the Wynn). You can't miss the hoards of people meandering in and out of here. 

It's fast, cheap and good. It's got this interesting set up of 3 different counters all serving up different things on the menu, although some of the menu items repeat. So you really should know what you want to get before you stand in line somewhere. I was sober and had 4 years of high school Spanish and I was still having a hard time figuring out where to stand and what I wanted to order! 

You will see all sorts of people in all sorts of dress, here, a true testament that affordable good food draws the masses. In the 30mins we sat and ate, I saw suited up limo drivers and casino security, folks in medical scrubs, construction workers, migrant workers, families who look like they just came from a quincinera, UNLVers, clubbers....and us tourist from HI in our slippers looking for a proper taco that doesn't cost $4 each.

At any rate this place is so convenient to the strip and my beloved Guardian Angel Cathedral that it will be a steady freddy everytime I'm in the 702. 

Pros:
-Late hours, cheap, good, easy parking, fast service, good lighting, lots of people around, no brainer for a taco fix
-SPICY PORK. Yup...that's the one. 
-One order carne asada fries can seriously feed 4-6 people. Watching them prepare it was ridiculous! Seriously, a mound of meat and cheese about 3 inches high just dumped on an entire fry basket of fries. WTH! 
-There's a parking lot and lot's of open spaces. 

Cons:
-It's ain't fancy and it ain't fragrance free. So you will walk into a place where smoke from meat being roasted and things being fried is visibly hanging in the air. 
-Seating can be hard to find as it's busy, but turnaround is fast"}
{"text":"Tried their pastor tacos, very very good!!
There was a bit of a line when we arrived but got to the front pretty fast. As u enter u are guided to a line based on what you want to order. Be prepared with ur order before u get to the  line inside. 
Would highly recommend to anyone craving Mex food!"}
{"text":"So before now Roberto's was my go-to spot. But after finding this place I'm now convinced I'm eating genuine Mexican food. It's a little far from me that's the only downside but I gave them 5 stars for the food and the service. No need to drop them a star because I live far away. I wish they had a drive-thru that would be amazing."}
{"text":"Si vas a Las Vegas no te puedes perder una visita a \"Tacos El Gordo\" en donde, a mi gusto, probé los mejores tacos estilo México en todo estados unidos. Me gustó la variedad de tacos que hay. La verdad, por la calidad, siempre va a haber fila, pero la verdad vale mucho la pena."}
{"text":"This place is the place I go to when I want delicious food and they NEVER dissapoint!  There are no surprises here, the food is consistently good, tasty and fresh.  This local is BIG, plenty of room for everybody."}
{"text":"One of the best meals in Vegas. Easy walk from the Venetian. Great tacos recommend al pastor and good price easy in Vegas. Line can be long but the security manages it well. Delicious"}
{"text":"1. This place is very disappointing. The tacos are NOT WORTH what you're paying for @ 2.25 each. The tacos are extremely small, in Los Angeles, we buy the same tacos for $1 each. 

2. The quesadillas are the exact same size as the small tacos, only difference that they put a little piece of cheese on it. 

3. There is a long line for each type of meat, which is absolutely ridiculous, as everybody more than likely will be ordering 2 different meats every time. Wait time is approximately 45 minutes. 

4. By the time you receive your tacos, you are waiting for the other meats, and finally pay, your tacos are already cold. 

5. Dining in is a challenge as there as like only 5 tables inside. We were lucky to get a table, but it's super uncomfortable eating when there are a bunch of standing hungry people waiting in line next to you. 

6. This is my first and my last time coming here. I would definitely opt for going to \"El Tizon\" as they actually make burritos there."}
{"text":"Super yummy spicy pork tacos! The locals eat here. The tacos are small so order a few... You order your food first and then you pay."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed. My asada tacos were amazing and my husband said his asada sopes were ridiculous good like they are at King Taco in LA. Lines were quick and short, took us a total of 3 minutes to order, wait for our food, and pay. Will be back for sure!! Just get lots of napkins!"}
{"text":"It's good to take friends visiting since it is so famous but I like taco y taco better. The people are not as friendly and they push you through to fast without being able to ask questions. So know your Spanish and what you want before you go"}

{"text":"Being from LA I've tried all sorts of tacos from upscale to taco trucks I have to say hands down my favorite tacos I just wish I live here tacos are the best....."}
{"text":"So after finally visiting one of these in the state I can see what the hype was all about. Fresh tortilla made in front of you. Al pastor being juicy and super flavorful. Carne asada was tender and out of this world.

Our group got a variety of stuff so I'll highlight the main ones. First off there are two lines. Just look st the sign and get to the line that corresponds to it. There's a pay area once you get everything you want to the right side. One tip though... the carne asada fries, a small being about 7.25 and the regular is 13$. It takes about five to ten minutes to come so order that first and get to the second line for some al pastor tacos! Tacos are about 2-2.50$ a piece and I'd recommend about 3-4 because they are quite small. Tostadas are just basically crispy tacos and I personally enjoy those better than the soft tortilla. Quesadilla have soft tortilla on bottom and a crispy shell on top. It looks weird but eat it all together and it's bomb!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The lines can be long but they move fairly quickly. Multiple lines for different meats, friendly service, incredible food. If you're in the Las Vegas area definitely seek this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is what Tijuana street tacos are like. Everything is made fresh and the meat is seasoned well. I love watching the adobada being cut right in front of your eyes. I wanted to try something exotic I decided on tacos de seso. Who would of thought that beef brains could be made into a meal? The tacos arrived quickly and tasted great + lots of flavor and succulence-WoWzA!! This is a go to place for Mexican food fixings! Check the signs to see which station is preparing your favorite meat-Receive tacos first then pay, ALWAYS TIP!! ¡Con Mucho Sabor!"}
{"text":"Cheap tacos for a cheaper price! If you're looking for authentic Mexican style tacos I would recommend trying this place. They have carne asada, adobada, cabeza, and many other types of tacos to decide from. The interior isn't the best, but the tacos are definitely worth it."}
{"text":"You might think tacos are tacos..but we waited in a line that was out the door, in 36 degree weather. And I would do it again. The al pastor is aaaamazing. Chorizo tacos were yummy too! Prepare to wait. Place is kinda small, so there isn't a lot options for seating."}
{"text":"My husband asked my to go to this place because he loves Mexican food. The food is really GOOD! they only have meat not chicken and only soda that's why 4 stars. The price is very affordable. They have seats indoors and outdoors, was yummy even I'm not a big meat lover."}
{"text":"All my friends agreed that this was the best tacos we ever had. I guess the Seattle taco scene can't compare. There was a long line outside the door around lunchtime on a weekday so we ended waiting about 20 or 30 minutes. As you get closer to the front, it just gets more chaotic. It's not a big space and there's people everywhere. The confusing part is that there's different ordering lines for different meats. If you want a lot of different things, it's probably best to come with a group of people so you don't have to stand in multiple lines yourself. The best part is that the tortillas and meat are made right in front of you! Then you take your tacos to yet another line to pay. I wish their lining system was different since it was confusing but the food was so worth it. Also don't forget to go to their confinement's bar where you can get limes and radishes! The meat was so flavorful and delicious. Get the al plastor tacos! With the cheap prices, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The best tacos ever!!!!! The lines to order are very confusing but all the food is bomb"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas hands down!!

You start by getting in line for whatever meat you want. They have a long list of options. You say which meat then you can either get everything on it (sour cream, salsa, cilantro, guacamole, and onions) or just what you want on it. Each taco was under 3$.

The second time we went I got carne asada fries. AMAZING! There were so much flavor and so much on them. I only ordered the small for about 8$ and I couldn't finish it. It's basically a taco on fries. The fries are topped with meat, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. You can choice to put salsa, cilantro or onions on it. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh man. This place is delicious. The first station is pork rotating on a big spit w pineapple cooking above it. Get the pork taco and don't forget the pineapple. Then move on to the steak station and get everything on them. They also have tripe which I passed on. All the meats were tender and packed. I love Carne asada fries but me and Warren got pork fries fully loaded. A medium is big enough for two people to split. Nom nom nom. And they have roasted peppers which aren't hot but mild and delicious.  The employees are all friendly helping you along if you've never been there before.
And they have orange whip. The place can get packed depending on the time you go. And prepare to get messy. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Simply put, the best street tacos in Las Vegas!

The minute you walk into this place you will notice it is insanely BUSY, and that most people are on the pork line-- because it is the best item on be menu. Don't get me wrong, steak is also tasty, but the pork is excellent on any menu item. Here is what I normally order.

Campechana fries, half order. These fries are smothered in steak or pork, cheese, cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream and their special sauce... Virtually a food group of its own. Beware you can probably share your fries with three of your friends and still eat plenty.

Pork tacos: I get them with everything and a bit extra of their green sauce--a cilantro based sauce.

Mulitas on flour tortillas: there are topped with the same ingredients as the tacos but the ingredients are sandwiched between two flour tortillas with grilled, melted cheese on them. Amazing.

You can have a filling lunch for no more than $10 bucks. If show up during the lunch hour be ready to wait for about 15 minutes before getting your food."}
{"text":"I have been to a couple different locations now and every time is an incredible experience. Great food and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo: the amazing flavor of authentic street tacos without the sketchiness of visiting a food truck parked in front of a dark alley.

Honestly, sober or drunk, these tacos are OUTSTANDING. If you don't believe me, just look at the line. It's always out the door no matter what time of the day it is!

This location was on hiatus for a bit, but I'm glad it's back in full swing again. Its got its own charm that keeps reeling me in. Plus they're cheap, and for being on the Strip, that's kinda hard to find. Yeah, it might not be the fanciest eatery in town, but can you really turn down fresh tacos made right in front of you?!

My recommendation: Adobada tacos or carne asada fries. You can't go wrong with either choice. 

Real recognize real with this place. Seriously worth it, imo."}
{"text":"Best food ever. One of the most unlikely highlights of vegas. This is the real deal.. Try everything."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding for traditional Mexican food. They are known for their pork adobada tacos and let me tell you they are outstanding, they are a must try. You will not be disappointed with anything on the menu but the adobada tacos take the cake. Another plus is that they are open late for the late night people in Vegas. Anyway delicious food, late hours and easy to find. Give them a try..!"}
{"text":"I love coming here and getting tacos they have the shortest lines of all the locations during the week because it is mostly dedicated to locals, and because it is so far off the strip. I don't eat pork so.all I get is the carne asada but it's the best I have had in Las Vegas. I'm originally from Cali so finding a place this good out here is golden to me. Best tacos you will find hands down in Las a Vegas in my opinion. I eat at this location atleast 3 times a month since I work at CSN on Cheyenne."}
{"text":"All I have to say is Adobado fries. The rest is history. I usually stop by here otw home after the club. 2am food. Possibly a long line. Fyi"}
{"text":"Got a tip from a friend about this place. Great down and dirty taco shop just like the ones you would find back in Santa Ana. Good food, good prices. You can't beat a great $2 taco. Bring a few beers or get a couple cold ones next door. It's the simple things in life that make you smile the most."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE TACOS EL GORDO! All time favorite drunkchies in Vegas. Don't mind me stuffing my face with these delicious tacos still in my club dress and heels...

There's always a long line outside but PROTIP: that are several shorter lines inside depends on what you want, you don't have to wait in that super long line out the door. 

Ya girl got 5 tacos and fries at once. Honestly all the tacos are my favorites, Al Pastor, Lengua, Buche, Cabeza, Tripa (omg the tripa was so good I'm drooling again). I shared a large Lengua fries with the girlfriends...People sitting next to our table were quite confused at all the orgasmic noises we were making from eating. YUM!!!

Will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Tacos - The Adobada and Lengua are two must haves. After that, as long as you steer clear from the Tripa and Sesos, everything else is pretty good.
       - Ordering - You grab a tray and you go up to one of the three guys and order your tacos. Adobada is on the right. Carne Asada is on the left. Most of the other ones are in the middle.
       - Neighborhood - This place isn't in the greatest neighborhood. However, there are mostly families in there and it's well lit so you should be fine.
**Ordered**
       - $2 Taco De Adobada (Spicy Pork) - The greatest taco I've ever had. It's cut from a giant rotating pork wheel. Genius (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q?select=KTg0vlPNZqaZC4m7oh1nKw).
       - $2 Taco De Lengua (Beef Tounge) - It tastes like very tender beef. It's delicious and a must try.
       - $2 Taco De Asada (Carne Asada) - It's good carne asada, but there are definitely other things to try.
       - $2 Taco De Buche (Pork) - Tender, but not as good as the adobada.
       - $2 Taco De Cabeza (Cow Head) - It's just like regular beef.
       - $2 Taco De Tripa (Cow Intestines) - I was expecting tripe like in pho but got intestines. I found out that tripa didn't translate into tripe when I got home. Regardless, I didn't finish this taco.
       - $2 Taco De Sesos (Cow Brains) - This was also a miss for me. 
       - $10 Adobada Fries - Best in a group. Skinny fries covered with adobada meat, cheese, guac, and mayo. It's delicious but will also slow your insides down for the next couple hours (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q?select=h3ntc5q93sgsWcQUOofnZQ).
**Recommendations**
       - I'd definitely recommend this place. I'm not a fan of Mexican food, but this little taco stand has turned me around."}
{"text":"This location used to be a gas station and it's away from the Strip.  They do have a Tacos el Gordo on the Strip somewhere but I chose this one instead.  Totally worth the drive if you want some good tacos and less people.  I was able to find parking right away, unlike the one in San Diego.   Once you get inside, you have to get in different lines for beef, pork or others and place your order.  Then you go in another line and pay there.  It's kinda confusing actually unless you read the Yelp reviews or you've been to one before.  I've only had the carne asada tacos (which was pretty good) and the adobada tacos (my fave).  Don't forget to ask for pineapples.  It goes very well with the adobada tacos.  The tortillas were freshly made and yummy as well.  I wished they would open one in the OC area.  Hehe...  Expect long lines.  These people work very hard so please tip them in the jar if you can.  I know I wouldn't be able to work at a busy place like this, standing for a long time and chopping up the meats.  I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"One of the things I miss most about LA is our street tacos. So after hearing great things about this authentic Mexican taco shop located on the Strip, I just knew I had to try Tacos el Gordo out for myself.

The opportunity came when Hubby & I were shamelessly Pokemon hunting on Las Vegas Blvd. We just so happened to drive by when I immediately began craving tacos. I even made Hubby stand in the long line with me as we waited to order. There are different lines for each type of meat they sell. Since we aren't adventurous enough for cow tongue or intestines, we stood in line for some good ole steak tacos.

Since Hubby does not share my love for Mexican food, I didn't expect him to enjoy his carne asada tacos. Turns out, he loved them just as much as I did! We each got two tacos and both ended up joining the line again for a third since they were so delicious. The steak was so tender and flavorful, it didn't even need hot sauce. I still poured some on though because my motto is the spicier, the better. ;-)

I do have to comment on the whole ordering process since it's very inefficient. It's probably the only complaint I have (asides from the poor ventilation that keeps your clothes smelling like tacos for days!). You receive your food and have to stand in another line to pay for it. Not only do your tacos get a little cold, it is very easy for dishonest customers to sit down without paying.

Thanks to Tacos el Gordo, I can finally take Hubby to a Mexican joint he will enjoy too! What's really awesome about this particular one is their handmade corn tortillas and fresh salsas & guacamole, all prepared daily.

So while I may be far from my hometown, I'm only a drive to the Strip away for some amazing tacos!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge taco fan and my friends have always told me that el gordo or at least the location in SD is amazing. 
I got to try the Vegas location a few weeks ago and I was pretty disappointed. I came out of the restaurant thinking, \"so what is supposed to be so great about this place...?\"
I was pretty bummed out because I came in thinking I would have the best tacos in my life that day, but it didn't even do half as good as the taco trucks I've been to. Oh and random, but they make their own tortilla!

Most tacos are $2.10. The ones I got were $2.10 each. 

1. Carne asada - it was too hard and cooked too much. It was not worth waiting 45 minutes for just the asada.

2. Al pastor - DO NOT GET. It was super salty, wayyyyy too salty. Pretty sweet too. I was shocked. Even with the pineapple, it was pretty bad. 

The tacos have too many things going on with it. They put a bit too much guac that I barley tasted the meat. I'm not sure if they just put really little of the other hot sauces, but I barely tasted those. They scooped way too much guac. It was too much.
I'm never going to go back to the LV location, but maybe I'll try the SD one later on."}
{"text":"Good spicy pork taco and lengua.open late night.  Avocado cream sauce delicious."}
{"text":"Estos tacos estaban con madres. Some of the best street tacos I've had in a while. They hook it up and the food was cheap. Tacos al pastor and the tripa where off the chain!"}
{"text":"Let me say that i thought the Adobada tacos are very good, but the Asada tacos are a disappointment and so are the carne asada fries.   And come on $2 for ea taco and $10 for the fries is a little tooo much. I've had better for way less.  I don't think i'll come back for a while..."}
{"text":"Got here at about 11pm and went to the off the strip location and it was packed but the lines moved fast. So they have three lines and each line services different tacos so depending on what you want you may have to go thru 3 different lines. Then you go to the cashier and pay and get a drink also if you want. They do have a salsa and lime bar to help yourself. Literally it was packed with Latinos which meant it was authentic and a good place to get tacos. I was like one of the only non Latinos in the joint. 

The tacos are small but jammed with meat and flavor. Very tasty, wish I could have tried all the tacos. They do have a variety, I tried the carne asado which was tasty and the balance of flavors were right on. I also tried the adobada (spicy pork) which looked like sharma where they shave the meat off very tender and flavorful. I believe that's one of their specialty tacos. The tacos are priced at $2.25 each. They do have loaded fries and some other items.
 
Plenty of parking well lit lot since the neighborhood could be a bit shady at night. There was an armed security in the restaurant which makes you feel better. 

I definitely will go back since now I feel comfortable on the ordering system and how everything works there. 3 tacos and bottle water was a little over $9 dollars. The price per taco could be a bit cheaper in my opinion but way cheaper than eating on the strip and the food is pretty good quality. All the workers there were very friendly."}
{"text":"I go to Mexico all the time just to get tacos, so when I heard about this place I had to Make sure I made the pit stop here. We arrived at 10am and we're done eating by 10:45am. The wait can get pretty long, but I don't mind waiting for food that I actually love. I don't mind paying 2.25 for a taco because it's vegas and if you're gonna complain about the prices then you might as well stay home and eat jack in the box tacos. The food was really great and very flavorful. These tacos are the closest you will get to TJ tacos! Amazing. There are different lines for everything, but it seems like they were going for the feel you get when you go to there TJ locations. The only thing I didn't like was the security guard letting certain people cut in front of everyone who was waiting in line. It is small in there but I don't think they realized how much people would love the food when they opened it! Overall it was worth the line"}
{"text":"Tacos de adobada/el pastor are popular here.  And for good reason.  I think the tacos are a tad over priced.  They are very little and not filling.  I ordered 4 and my boyfriend ordered 4, we got 2 drinks and it was over $23 bucks.  

The workers are nice and you can tell they like their job because they stay so busy.  The workers have mastered the ability to cook very quickly and efficiently, I was impressed.

I can't wait to come back!! Even if I have to spend a good buck!"}
{"text":"I came here at around 2pm so it was practically empty.  I must say the guys working in the kitchen sure know how to make a taco in lightening speed!!!  I had 3 tacos de adobada and they were very good.  They are some of the best I have ever had but being Mexican and a decent cook, I can honestly say I have made better....not by much but better.  

I think I will come back....I really wish they were open 24/7 just because I can get hungry at 3am....and have a taco craving."}
{"text":"Best taco place I've tried in Vegas!!!! They have an awesome serving system that works really well. The tacos have good flavor and are good sized. People are friendly. Will be visiting this place again!!!"}
{"text":"Brought some of my friends that were visiting from California to this place for some late night tacos. We were happy that they were open at 3 am! lol We ordered the Pastor Tacos, and Asada Mulitas. They were scrumptious!!! It was very busy considering how late it was but worth it!"}
{"text":"I had the al pastor tacos and holy shit. People aren't joking about the line but it was worth it 100x over. The tacos were delicious and way cheaper than a lot of other food near the strip. Definitely recommend getting more than you think you want. I instantly regretted not buying more when I finished mine. Will be returning to this little gem when I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"One of THE BEST carne asada tacos I have ever had, hands down.  The juices and everything about this taco is worth every penny.  I usually get mines with no avocado, since most of the time they usually put a spoonful of avocado & i really dont need to taste that much avocado in one sitting.

Not only do i order the carne asada tacos, but also the carne asada fries. The carne asada fries can either come in half ($5) or a large order ($10). I ordered the half ordered and OHHH GEEZ it was pretty BIG! I couldnt even finish it, it was good but not THAT good. 

Needless to say, I could always come back to this taco eatery. Yumm yumm"}
{"text":"No need to be scared. Read the menu, figure out what you want, and get in the designated lines to get your tacos. The idea of splitting the tacos into groups and getting people to order from a certain person is genius. Instead of one long line, the customer can bypass it and just get what they want before heading to the cashier to pay.

Yet again we were the minority. I am beginning to enjoy this. When the menu does not tell me exactly what I am eating and the other patrons are of the ethnicity, the food must be A1. I came here with my sister and some of her co-workers. Since she is about to leave town, we have been knocking off her bookmarks in blocks. Today, it was time to get some tacos that have united the Yelp world. 

My fundamental Spanish was enough to understand that I wanted tongue and head meat filled corn tortillas. They are definitely the stand out of my meal. The meat was tender and melt in your mouth. No gaminess and all flavor. I could eat a tray full of these alone. Then my sister got the shaved meat and carne asada. The Adobada is just as good as everyone has made it out to be. With the shaved pineapple only makes it that much better. The steak taco was nothing spectacular and was my least favorite. I know now that it is all about the leftover proteins. If I stick to these, it would be a solid meal. Add a horchata to wash it all down and I have never been happier. Four tacos and a drink was only a little over $10."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a quick bite, no frills, just great tacos!"}
{"text":"Give me the adobada tacos with everything on it. Please do not leave off the pineapple because that would be a crime. The other location has much more inside seating than this one, but the food is still just as good. One of my friends and I came straight after work and had to sit outside under the covered seating. It was 110 outside, but a couple of those tacos and a small order of carne asada fries to share makes anything bearable. Do not forget a cup of ice cold horchata to wash it all down. 

I would not normally lean towards Mexican food unless nudged in that direction by friends, but I am glad that I have some people who do enjoy this fare. Every once in a while, a trip to Tacos El Gordo does well for the soul. For some reason, I throw out most of my concerns with this establishment. What? You do not serve any veggies with your tacos? Okay, as long as you pile up that spit roasted meat, I will easily overlook it. What is that sauce you are dousing over my tacos? Whatever, it is just delicious, so keep it coming. By the time I am finished, I have ingested more than I normally would allow, I drank some of my calories and it is not getting me buzzed. Oh, how I have fallen. Yet it feels so good. Don't look at me!"}
{"text":"So much better than Taco Bell any day!
And just as cheap. 
Perfect after the bar munchies fix.
The place gets packed but the line goes quick and there seemed to be plenty of seats to go around. 
Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco restaurant in town!! I love how their tacos taste so authentic. I always get lengua (beef tongue) and adobada (spicy pork) tacos with every topping in it. Today I tried my first mula and it was amazing.. Mula is kinda like a quesadilla where they put cheese on top of a taco and put another piece of tortilla. Everything comes out super fast so you don't have to wait so long."}
{"text":"This location is the better one out of the two we've been to! My boyfriend and I stopped by here on a Thursday afternoon. The place was not crowded at all. We frequent the one in Chula Vista where there's always long lines for parking, food, and tables. This place has ample parking and plenty of tables. We were the only ones in line. The food tastes just as good here. The guy that made the tacos for us was really nice and hooked it up with a lot of pineapples. Minus one star for the cashier. She looked so lifeless. Didn't say much to us and was really stingy on the hot sauce. 

This location rocks. It gets busy during certain hours but certainly not crazy. It's a couple of miles away from The Strip but it's great if you like to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Down the strip from the Wynn. This place is delicious. Fast friendly service. Plenty of room to sit and eat. Alpastor and carne asada were amazing, cheese quesadilla was tasty."}
{"text":"Yes, everyone raves about Tacos El Gordo. Yes, their tacos are pretty good. Especially if you get them with everything (cilantro, onion, salsa and guacamole). THE only thing that is great about this place, is just that. The food. The way they operate does not make sense. Different lines for different products, which result in longer lines, longer wait times, and if you're going to get more than one kind of meat (or product), make sure to come with someone as you both will have to go to different lines, otherwise be prepared to stand in line again for a long period of time. I stood in line for over 20 minutes (yes, foolish), but didn't know where else to get tacos. Definitely will look for somewhere else before I return here!"}
{"text":"The lines to order are very confusing and they are slow as hell. I think there overated and the people who wo r ks there aren't friendly at all. Customer's service is terrible."}
{"text":"I had the deep fried chicken tacos, they were a little oily.  For the most part the food was ok, nothing real special to write home to mom about."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! If your looking for authentic food this is the place to go! We come here EVERY TIME we hit Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is POPPIN' even more than the day clubs and night clubs in Vegas. If you're a foodie and you've been to Vegas more than once but have not yet stopped into this spot for some super duper authentic Mexican tacos, SHAME ON YOU.

I love that the tacos are still priced pretty decently even in this craycray economy we're in ($2 a taco).

They also have quesadillas, burritos, tostadas, etc. 

I've had the Carne Asada, Chicken and of course the Lengua tacos here. BOMB.
The salsas they use and offer are also BOMB.

Like I said, this place is always POPPIN'. So don't be alarmed if you're walking into a mosh pit full of hungry or hungover Vegas visitors and/or locals."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best taco place in town. Tacos are so good that you always have lines no matter the time. Love their tacos al pastor and their adobada fries! It seems like we come here ever Taco Tuesday! If you haven't tried these tacos, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype of this place. Food wasn't that great. But the cashiers were amazing!"}
{"text":"You can understand how Tacos El Gordo has earned their reputation after one visit. The food here is simple yet perfect. Spicy pork? YES. Roasted nopales? UH HUH. Perfect asada? OH BABY. This is the way Tijuana-style tacos should be done. 

A warning for the newcomer: this place can get crazy busy, really packed with people, and figuring out where and what to order can be a bit overwhelming. Stick through the awkwardness of the first time and you will be handsomely rewarded."}
{"text":"Its a pretty chaotic place during your first visit. I have to stand in different lines for what I want? Where are the drinks? How do I pay? What do I do? I actually watched a couple walk in, stand aimlessly in a line for a minute, say something - then leave. 

But once you get over that, these are some of the best tacos I've ever had - and believe me there is an extensive list of competitors. Top notch food and the price is right. Its usually slammed at lunch so get there early."}
{"text":"There is no adobada al pastor but Tacos el Gordo. Not choosing to indulge may as well be a choice for death. Let the Gordo into your mouth. Let the Gordo gush flavor into your life. 

Gordo."}
{"text":"Great fast food. The food was delicious and quick. The down side was that they did not offer chicken as a protein option. Definitely worth a visit if you love pork. Try the adobada fries !"}
{"text":"This place is probably a 5 min walk from Encore. When we got there around 10 pm, there was a huge line. However, the lines are separate per station so be sure to make sure you're in the right line. The carne asada lines were out the door but the adobada al pastor lines were much shorter and started inside the restaurant so we decided to go there. You pick how many tacos you want while they shave the pork right in front of you with freshly  made tortillas. These tacos are pretty small so make sure you order enough! After you get your food, you pay at the counter and then you are ready to eat. The tacos are delicious! There was the right amount of spice and seasoning on the al pastor and the tortilla had perfect texture. I will definitely come back here to try the carne asada next time!"}
{"text":"The cashiers are super rude and the food is not as good as it used to be!.
They know that most of the customers are out of town so they lost respect to the people since they know someone new will go the next day!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo knows how to treat their meat! 

I heard about this from my good friend who told me this place was the shiz in Mexico and San Diego. Now I've been with my friend to Mexico to visit family so I trust his tastes. And man wow, amazing! 

-Adobada was flavorful and moist.  If you love creamy green sauce you'll like this taco. I thought it was a little too much and took away from the flavor of the meat but the sis loved it.
-Lengua (mind you I don't eat Lengua - tho I'll eat Yakitori tongue) was so tender and just melted in my mouth.
-Suadero, I've had before at El Taurino in LA but man, the Suadero here is delicious.  

The Mulas is quite greasy, I mean HELLA greasy so I'm not sure if that's your thing. I would just stick to the tacos to appreciate the meat. I didn't really see much of a difference between that and a quesadilla.

They close at 5am on Friday (we didn't even notice, we just assumed it was 24hrs).

Most of the workers are OK in English but the main cashier can help explain to you whatever you want.

Be sure to ask for the grilled green onions. So amazing, just like in Mexico!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN VEGAS. My son had the beef tongue Taco and loved it! So much great in Vegas but we always have to come get some tacos!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype and is worth the hassle of ordering! They were packed when we came for lunch on a weekday, there are different line to order different types of tacos so it's kind of a cluster and you'll have bad memories of waiting in line at the post office. Trust me, it's worth the hassle and if you're with someone else split up and each get in a different line. The tacos are amazing, the adobaba pork and carne asada were both some of the best I've had in my life and they're dirt cheap compared to most places on the strip. Ordering here is an ordeal but it's worth the effort for awesome tacos."}
{"text":"Small place with two locations I know of . Amazing tacos usually busy during normal hours. Open till 5 am I think . Best tacos in Vegas"}
{"text":"Loved it !!! For lack of better words !
Tortillas are made fresh in the spot and it makes the delicious taste of authentic taco, never had a better Mexican Restutante experience!!! The price is really really low as well, I had to stand over 40 minutes in line ! But it was worth it 
Don't leave Vegas without visiting this place"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! This place reminds so much of Mexico. The food is sooooo bomb. They never let you down."}
{"text":"I ordered a Mula and some tacos de asada but my number one choice are the tacos. The tacos are bomb!! The only thing you need to have is patience to be waiting in line to order your food."}
{"text":"With all the good reviews, I had to give this one a try. Glad I did! All the other reviews were spot on. Only downgrade from 5 stars is due to the disposition of the cashier. She was not very nice and was not happy when I had to ask more than twice for some translation because my Spanglish needs some work. Other than that, a few pesky gnats found their way onto my tacos. Ordered 2 steak tacos and 2 spicy pork tacos and a diet coke.---$10.05. Not bad for Vegas."}
{"text":"As people said, there are separate lines for each kind of taco. My go to taco is usually the lengua. Some people are uncomfortable eating tongue, but honestly it's some of the most tender meat possible. 

Unfortunately I was little underwhelmed by the lengua here. The meat wasn't as savory as I've had at other places.

Looking at the reviews, I guess I should have tried the pork. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"This taco spot on the Vegas strip was actually really good and authentic. But there are always the pros and the cons....

Pros: 
 - Handmade tortillas! Yes! You can see the lady actually making them right in front of you while you order.

- The fam all ordered asada tacos and they were really good. Lots of flavor and they add guacamole. They don't skimp on the meat either!

- They have a fountain machine so that's convenient. 

- Prices are pretty decent considering their location.

Cons: 

- Line was long consistently.

- Not much seating. Mostly inside with a few outside. 

- When we first went in, the whole place inside was so smokey that the employees had to open up the doors to air it out. So watch out asthmatics! 

- There's no salsa bar! They have a bar for lime, radish, etc., but no salsa and I was not going to wait in that line again. 

Overall, I think the pros outweighed the cons. I'll definitely be coming back! You"}
{"text":"Moments after landing I was whisked away by my cousin and his words are ... I know I am going to take you to some very fancy places to eat while your here, but the first place we have to stop to is this taco place. 
He was very right we had the spicy pork tacos with the fried peppers and green onions on the side. This was the perfect start to my trip to Vegas. I also loved the horchata (the rice milk drink) and it was the best I ever had. 
If your going to Las Vegas I would make sure to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Dude. . . It feels like you are walking the streets of Tijuana. This place is fantastic.  Busy all day and all night. There is no better place to go after some long hard vegas partying. It's a little pricy for the size of the tacos but hands down the only Mexican food better than taco y taco. . . Too bad they don't serve cerveza!!"}
{"text":"Flavorful, tasty, and greasy tacos are just the thing drunk people look for after a night of partying and dancing. That's exactly how I stumbled upon this taco shop, just like probably 75% of everyone else that come here too LOL. Tacos el Gordo is a classic, and it's well known not only in Vegas but all over Southern California and Tijuana. I've been to the location in San Diego and I wanted to give this place a try as well. Considering the fact that it was 3am, the line was fairly long. I waiting about 30 min for my food. Definitely try the adobada tacos here, and ask for the pineapple!! I don't know if it was because I was buzzed or if the tacos were really that good, or probably both... But the tacos here were great!! I got some snobby attitude by the ladies at the cashier but tbh I didn't care too much lol. Definitely stop by Tacos el Gordo for some cheap food to grub on if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Bombest mexican food ever! This is what \"The Valley\" needs! I come from LA and tried this place! It is the perfect mexican food spot, and everything is perfect and tasty! Would definently come back again, when i go visit vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Reminds me of my time living in Tijuana. Traditional street tacos :) 

This is not a run in and out, fast food restaurant - expect to wait 1/2 hour or more to even place your order. Well worth the wait! 

Food is EXCELLENT!!! For those who have never experienced something like this is strongly recommend the adobada tacos - super flavorful. I have never met a person who did not like them :)"}
{"text":"Great street tacos at a great price. Lines were long but well worth the wait. A bit chaotic in line."}
{"text":"Carne asada taco's and adobada sopes with carne asada fries.  Long lines, order at one window pick up at another, and move onto another to pay.  Lots of people, crowded dinning room, be prepared to fight for a seat.  But the crowds move in and out quickly, so it usually works out.

As for the food, I love this type of taco, small, bite size with an avocado sauce, and adding chopped onions, and cilantro.  The french fries are smothered in the same avocado sauce, cheese, sour cream and chopped onions and cilantro.  The small bite size pieces of carne asada are soft and has good flavor.  Love this for lunch, dinner or late evening treat."}
{"text":"Updated review: 3.5 stars

Carne asada fries $10, not worth the price!  Not as good as Alberto's. the lengua tacos are good and very tender. The spicy pork tacos are good too. If I have to compare, the taco truck in pasadena,CA is better, taste wise and price-wise."}
{"text":"Bomb ass tacos first time trying it and wow the tripas tacos are super crispy and good"}
{"text":"Lengua is the shit... lines are long. Approx 40 ppl in line but well worth the wait! Ill be back ;)
Bomb! Nuff said..."}
{"text":"My daughter found a bug in her food and when I went the Asada was too tough and all of  gristle so I would not recommend this location.,other location on Charleston was better."}
{"text":"En un viaje a Las Vegas fuimos a estos tacos porque la gente de you tube y familiares los recomienda mucho .cuando entran tienen que hacer diferentes líneas dependiendo que tacos quieren , fui un domingo  alrededor de las 2 pm y avia de 20 a 15 personas por línea , los taqueros son muy AMABLES!!! A pesar de la presión de tener tanta gente.... PERO la cajera NO!! Mal genio ,groceras y critican a los clientes !! No gracias, NO bienvenidos NO NADA !!!!! Las cajeras  que nos atendieron tenían pelo amarillo nose si sean las de siempre, estábamos cortos de tiempo si no me hubiera gustado averiguar quien era el manager para quejarme del servicio tan malo de la cajera era más grande de edad que la otra . Disculpen las faltas de ortografía y la verdad yo no pienso regresar allí , los tacos están buenos pero prefiero buscar otro restaurante con mejor servicio al cliente."}
{"text":"love their tacos!!! beat tacos ever!!! super authentic!!! 

My favorites are al pastor and cabeza!!! don't forget about your free peppers and onions!!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos I've ever had. Hands down. Get the pork tacos."}
{"text":"One of the best if not best taco spot in Las Vegas (yes I know it's originally from SD).

Adobada is fire.

Carne Asada is fire.

Suadero is fire.

Chorizo is fire.

Make sure you get the grilled onions and peppers!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this spot and I'm so glad he did. Ever since I moved from LA about a year ago I have not been able to find anything close to the Mexican food I grew up on. And now ever since I've found this spot I'm not sure if I miss it! The one thing I've never had is an adobada taco.  And man it is amazing. The spicy pork with the salsa and sauce they add to it is just perfect. Every bite literally pulls you into the next one. I wish I had gotten 10 of them but I only got 2 so I could try other things. The carne asada tacos were good. We also had the carne asada fries which were also pretty good. But I kept on yearning for more of that Adobada. I'm hooked and plan on hooking as many other people too so that I can enjoy again and again with them. The service was cool. It was counter order and pick up but none of that matters because the 5 stars was for the food. And when the food is that good, it trumps any other reasoning."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos or shall I say all of the food here is to dye for my husband and I tried all the meats and mmmmm it is delicious great service and food equals an excellent experience I came twice back to back recommended to all that love tacos tj style"}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos are the best here. Though I think the one in San Diego tastes better, this one is still good. Lines are a lot shorter than the San Diego one and this one is right on the strip near circus circus. Awesome location. Awesome tacos!"}
{"text":"Never have I ever dated a Mexican restaurant so highly before but boy can I say that Tacos El Gordo deserves it. 

The prices are incredibly cheap! $2 per taco and $2 for fries. Specialty fries are around $10 and quesadillas are $4 with meat ($2 without). The sign is in Spanish and the workers speak Spanish and English so if you are not a native speaker like myself they can easily take care of you. 

The tacos are small BUT they pack on the sauces and meat like no other! NOT TO MENTION GUAC IS INCLUDED!!! At least for the tacos de asada it was. And man did they give me a generous portion! 

I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving authentic Mexican food while in vegas. It may be off strip but I would easily make this drive again just to eat some amazing Mexican food at an incredibly low price."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had! They have different lines for different meats so keep that in mind when ordering! Yes there is a huge line but it goes by really fast. Al Pastor is the way to go! Very clean and very organized. Always hit this spot when visiting Vegas! EDC 2018!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very frustrating ordering process (check out signs and lines......gotta get in the right line for different types of meats, fries, drinks).  Weird.  But awesome food.  Wow, and I know real mexican taste and this is it.  Well worth the effort to get your order places and paid for.  Will go back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Came all the way from strip, paid $40 round trip to have this wonderful taco. It was definitely worth it.  Only reason why I gave it 4 stars was that it wasn't as good as the old location. The old location was the bomb, it was the best.
Don't get me wrong it is still excellent, just to give you a comparison , my visit was on Sunday morning around 2:00am, it was full house here but Taco Mexico few blocks away was empty, I mean zero customers."}
{"text":"Great tacos. But they have a weird system to order them...If you go by yourself and want to order different things you will be spending longer time ordering. Anyway worth the visit."}
{"text":"Both locations in Vegas are on point, walk in w/a smile, ready to eat Tijuanas finest! I'm a happy camper every Friday night! Bueno!"}
{"text":"First time here. I usually eat Roberto's but my cousins had me try his spot out. It's really good and you get your food quick even if it looks busy. Tasty tacos and clean spot. I recommend this place if you really love Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas!! Nuff said!!!"}
{"text":"delish!!! lines are wayyyy to long....but worth the wait. dont go sunday early afternoon!"}
{"text":"The tacos de carne asada were very good. The quesadilla was made with a hard shell tortilla on top... Different, not bad but different. The ordering system's a bit on the confusing side so don't hesitate to ask for help.

Definitely recommended if you're craving Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"The line system is a little confusing but the food is super, super good."}
{"text":"Service was good. Not great. The food was horrible! Never going back to this place."}
{"text":"Overly hype taco spot -.-  this place sucks! Plain and simple. I don't know if it was just me but these tacos suck. Tacos from Los Angeles are 3x as better and for a fraction of the price. Paid $30 for 12 lousy taco . Save your money and time."}
{"text":"Awesome and delicious $2 tacos. Blown away by the juiciness and flavors. Try their Beef tongue tostada and you will be in heaven!!! It's that good. They also have an all you can eat radish station :) pretty cool to munch on them to clear your palette in between tacos or just for a good old crunch... 

PS we paid more money for a cab to get there that for the actual food... But so worth it. So happy we tried it. Definitely coming there again."}
{"text":"Loved loved this place . I'm Mexican and I can say these are real Mexican tacos . So much flavor & filling !! I will keep coming here every time I'm in Vegas 
I've heard people say it gets super packed but my boyfriend and I have gone around 6 and we've gone in and had our tacos and ready to eat within 10 mins . Maybe we just got lucky:) lol"}
{"text":"There is nothing specifically wrong with this place. The service is good, the staff are friendly. The tacos are fine...just not my type. I prefer hard shell, I prefer choices in filling. These are definitely street tacos, so if you're more accustomed to Americanized Mexican food like I am, you'll probably feel the same way as me. But this is not a bad review for El Tacos Gordo, it's just not somewhere I'd eat again by choice because it's not my personal preference of flavor."}
{"text":"Hands down! Best Carne Asada & Al Pastor you can find in Vegas.  

The Pastor(pork) is on a rotating spit with a chunck of Pinapple on top like it should be and it's the first thing you see when you walk in the door.  It has that sweet and smoky flavor any good Al Pastor should have.  I've been suckered into various taco joints in town that had a Pastor spit, hoping that I would find something as good as you can get in Mexico.  I've always come away very disappointed.  El Gordo's has it down.

The Carne Asada is marinated and grilled to perfection.  It has that distinct flavor of the Original El Gordo's in Tijuana.  Getting Asada this good is a rare occurence these days.  I've been all over Southern California and Vegas and I can only count 4 or 5 Taco stands that I've found in the last 15 years that even come close to this Asada.

When I first saw that the tacos were 2 bucks, I balked a little, but when I realized it was the same name as my favorite stand in Tijuana, I would have paid 4 bucks for a taco in hopes that it was half as good as I had remembered it.  The tacos are well worth the 2 bucks considering that they pack them full of meat and will top any taco off with as much guacamole, cilantro, and cebolla you want.

I've only been there three times since I found this place, so I haven't had a chance to try some of the other meats.  I'm sure everything is on point just based on the Asada & Pastor.  Next time I'll have to try the Lengua & Buche."}
{"text":"Bleh tacos in Vegas are absolutely horrible! Sauces are yummy , guacamole lacks everything you can imagine . Meats are dry, even the \"pastor\" that everyone seems to love . I've tried this place over and over in hopes that one day the chef will get it right . It's always packed and I can't quite seem to grasp why. Coming from California where there is numerous hole in the wall spots for Mexican cuisine . Nothing lives up to standard. And no matter how  far \"east\" I go in Vegas I get the same results."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this place is over hyped.  Friends that had visited this place  made it seemed like tacos were amazing.  Not so after my last visit.  

Place is ur typical mexican joint serving tacos.  Only difference here is there are 5 lines for the type of mean you want.  Asada line 1, al pastor and chorizo line 2 and so forth.  Lines are not organized.  My line for pastor tacos was somewhat short but my wife's line for asada was long especially since person in front of her ordered 22 tacos!!!!!.  That meant that I had to wait for her and by that time my tacos were cold.  I was upset to say the least.

Asada meat was dry with no taste.  Felt like i was chewing on beef jerky. Pastor was ok. Sauces are plain, not spicy at all.  I like to sweat from a good sauce, only reason I was sweating was due to no AC.  Outside temp was 105 degrees. Tortillas were too oily for my taste not to mention small.  Two bites and kiss that taco goodbye.

Prices are a bit high with each taco going for over $2.  Not alot of options besides tacos.

Restrooms were dirty and one toilet was clogged.  AC was not working.  Tables are not cleaned after customers leave so you have to clean it yourself.  If your group is bigger than 4 people, chances are you won't sit together.

Would I come back?  Read my review again to get that answer."}
{"text":"The food was good but service was horrible!! And it was not that even that packed for them to have really bad service. And they wanted to charge for a small size of guacamole, that I needed for one of my adobada taco. Smh on them . Y'all need to come to the one in SD"}
{"text":"Tacos were amazing! Line was long but went by FAST! Also seating sucks! Not much room to sit. It gets PACKED!"}
{"text":"Always  expect a crowd,  especially  on a Friday night,  tonight being a Friday  is no exception.  The dining  area is to capacity and lines are waiting for about 20-30 minutes. Tacos are always good and good portions are always expected  especially  if you are a person that  appreciates good service and knows how to TIP adequately. Please  Tip these hardworking people  which are all probably  working for minimum wage. 

When I come to tacos el gordo I always like to  order the carne asada  which come with  home made tortillas,  or any other variations  which come with processed  ones.  I had never tried TRIPA  tacos I thought  the idea of trying tripe tacos  was nasty,  my wife being a loving caring wife said try them and shoved one in my mouth and I won't lie to you  ever since that day  I order one or two  of those.  I've also tried the carne asada fries which are OK I suppose  but not for me I'd rather have a taco. 

With all of this being  said,  I miss the location  on Vegas Blvd,  because it  is closer to  home and much  more convenient  that is the reason  I don't come as often as I'd like to. Mexican food always brings back childhood memories, as a child I loved going to the taco  truck with the family I guess this type of atmosphere  is what I like  sometimes (less the rudeness and loudness of some  macho acting Mexicans that  want to fight over a table.). 
I guess you can't always  have everything  in this life. Well about to eat me some food food and enjoy good times with great friends,  til next time yelpers."}
{"text":"no frills, huge lines, chaos inside......best tacos ever.  Asada tacos grilled in front of you and you can taste the freshness and the authenticity.   Every visit to Vegas will include a visit to Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"There was a long line but I totally understood why after trying the carne asada fries  definitely check this place out if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm!! We walked to this little gem our first day in Vegas, it was quite a walk from Aria but well worth it, just a little past Encore. The restaurant is bright and clean and full of friendly staff. 

The ordering is a bit confusing because when you walk in your not too sure where to order, so I can see how it can get a little chaotic when it's busy. Luckily we were there a little early so no lines. You order first than pay at a separate station. 

We went with some spicy pork tacos and the carne asada tacos. The spicy pork tacos were amazing!! You can see the pork rotating and being carved fresh by the counter. The asada was nice and smoky but a little dry and the texture was off. We also got some spicy pork fries it was huge and pretty filling. Opt for the small if its just you and your boo, comes in large which could easily feed 4. The tacos come with salsa and sides of pepper and onion. You can ask for more salsa if you want. 

The prices were great and the food was excellent, will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I hardly ever eat Mexican food but a friend kept telling me how good this place is and also very affordable. It is open until 2am weekdays and 4am wknds, so after my late night workout i was starving so I decided to check it out.  It is not in the best area of Vegas and there is an armed metro cop on duty to diffuse any potential problems which I could definitely see something shady going down in the surrounding area. I'm sure the cop is a good thing and makes customers feel safer going there.  It was kind of a rough crowd the night that i went but then again it was a Friday night around 11 pm. If i went again which I probably would I would avoid weekend nights. The place was packed which is another good sign as far as quality. 

I had no idea what to order so I got a Quesedilla and a few Carne Asada tacos.  They were both very authentic. Some of the best mexican food I can remember having.  Especially the Quesedilla. It was so good i thought about turning around and getting another one (I did a to go order)

I would go back but realistically I do not live to close so it wont be happening anytime soon! I only give it 4 stars due to the location and surrounding area. I have to take a point away due to the fact it is in the hood with an armed Metro officer on duty. Nothing to do with the food. Food is great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here after a long drive to visit him and HOLY SHIT. Where has this been all my life? If I wanted legit warm, meaty and delicious tacos I'd definitely say this takes the cake. We ordered a bit of everything including capecheta fries which is huge! Late night dining is when it's most busy, so look out of for that, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Driving to Vegas our first stop was a taco place , of course \"taco el Gordo \" . Was my first time trying it , hands down best taco I've eaten  so far. 
Fresh meat that cooks in front you ,grilled veggies , the employee are nice too. Great place worth every penny"}
{"text":"Yet again, Yelp delivers. Hungry and on the hunt for something local, we came across Tacos El Gordo on Yelp. In an unassuming shopping center off the Las Vegas Strip we found this little gem.....thank you Yelp.

Walking in, the place can be somewhat overwhelming. There's like 200 things on the menu (ok, I'm exaggerating a little) and you can line up in like 10 different lines. Depending on what kind of meat you want - you go to that line. They cook the meat fresh - in your face. Right on the grill - a few feet away. Sure, this means you will smell like smoke for the rest of the day, but with casinos in Vegas being smoking and all, I rather smell like carne asada than cigarettes.

I got: 

Sope de asada - Whoa! This thing was pretty massive. It was a fried dough (?) with a ton of toppings like salsa, guac, onions, cilantro and of course carne asada - with a crispy chip on top.

Tacos asada - Two tacos with carne asada. Awesome! 

The wife got some quesadillas - they were a little small, but the cheese was so good! I think it was a white cheese for frying. Pretty tasty.

We washed it all down with some Horchata! They have two machines for fountain drinks - one for regular soft drinks and the other one for traditional Mexican drinks! Pretty cool - I would of liked to try some of the other drinks, but was pretty stuffed.


The staff was all surprisingly nice. With as busy as everyone seemed they didn't hesitate to answer our questions (the folks cooking all the meat). The cashier was a bit of a character (hey, it's Vegas!) but SUPER nice as well."}
{"text":"A must visit when in Vegas!! Great choice of meats and drinks, get there early because it gets packed!!"}
{"text":"Just like TJ baby!! This place has thee BEST authentic Mexican Taqueria. I recommend everything on the menu.  Minus one star because of their ordering system though; very confusing, unfair, and unorganized."}
{"text":"New favorite taco spot! Carne Asada fries hit the spot and even the half order is huge!"}
{"text":"Why would anyone go to Denny's a block away when this place has the best \"street\" tacos (even better than in Santa Ana)!  We had the taco de lengua (beef tongue), quesadilla de lengua, taco de asada (beef)-even had a tablespoon of guacamole, taco de tripa (tripe), and taco de adobada (spicy pork).  My favorites were the beef and tongue tacos.  The beef tongue was so tender and tasty.  And the tortillas are freshly made in the tortilla presses and then cooked right while you watch.  Awesome fresh food!  You can even ask for grilled green onions and jalapenos!

Compared to the taco served at the Wicked Spoon buffet the night before, these tacos rocked and were so much more satisfying, cheaper and tastier.

I'll definitely go back here when we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, especially the tacos de adobada.  Just as good, if not maybe better, than the Chula Vista location.  Be prepared to wait in line with some fellow hungover Vegas party people who had just enough energy to make the short trek away from the main part of the strip."}
{"text":"Being that me and my husband are from out of town, we got on Yelp and found this place. This was the best decision we made our whole trip. If you go here you won't be disappointed, the lines may be long but it's worth the wait, I promise!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS EVER!!! I've eaten lots of tacos trust me but these are probably the best even better than tacos from MEXICO! I'm mexican and I took my white boyfriend here and he loves tacos too and he said these are the best he's ever had as well!"}
{"text":"Yes the lines were split into meats but at 2 am it was worth it, didnt wait more than 10 mins. Got al pastor tacos as recommended and carne asada fries. Very fresh flavor and a good hangover cure. Recommended. I didn't really need to speak espanol, just use broken english and point."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, delicious and friendly, our best meal during our last stay in Vegas.
It doesn't look great from the outside at first glance, but the fear goes away once you taste the food."}
{"text":"Best street tacos in Vegas. Possibly the best I have ever had and I buy them on the streets of Mexico. The asada, buche, cabeza, & spicy pork were great. They are small and cost about $2 each. Sopes, tostadas, mules, quesadillas, french fries disguised as nachos are also available.  

The lines are inefficient. Each type of meat has its own line. Not great if you go alone. A group that splits up works best. 

This place is EXTREMELY loud. It's in Vegas on the strip so most patrons will be intoxicated. 

The flavor was great. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Thanks to the closing of the Strip location....the North Las Vegas Tacos El Gordo opening has finally come!  Nothing gets better than $2 tacos! All the food is the same quality as the old Strip and Charleston location.  There is limited seating, so be prepared to stalk the tables if you plan on eating here.  My favorites are still the adobada (spicy pork) tacos...make sure you ask for pineapple with it!  The adobada tacos have the avocado/sour cream sauce that helps balance out the spicy red sauce.  My second favorite are the carne asada (steak) tacos, which have a nice charred flavor and comes with cilantro/onions/and avocado.  I've also tried the suadero, but the meat is just a little dry for me. I would prefer the lengua (beef tongue) over the suadero (beef breast).  If you like a little side of grilled veggies, you can ask for the grilled onions/peppers as well. I haven't been adventurous enough to try the cabeza (brains), beef stomach, and tripe yet...but one day.  I love that the drinks here have free refills....that means I can drink horchata all day =P."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious! The lengua (beef tongue) and adobada (spicy pork) tacos stand out compared to the other offerings.  This is a legit Mexican place....none of this chicken taco shenanigans.  Just the scary stuff and pork/beef! I ordered for me and the BF...but before he got there I ended up eating his tacos too....3 is not enough even for a little Asian girl....so make sure you order plenty!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The price and tacos are great! I wish the staff were better. I tried to cater through there website but no one responded to my inquiry. Why have an online catering option if you don't respond or do it. I thought that was rude."}
{"text":"Most bomb taco's I've ever had. I normally don't even enjoy Guac, but the guac at Tacos El Gordo was just so damn good.  I no shame would make a trip to vegas just for their tacos."}
{"text":"I had a sope here. Close to the most delicious meat I've ever had in a taco joint, but the sope wasn't crisp enough for my taste. There was a tostada shell on top though, which more than made up for it!"}
{"text":"This place has fast become a staple in the Vegas scene. This is the place to go after the club for sure! They have a large variety of meats, the only downside that is important to note is that you have to make separate lines for each type of meat. Worst idea ever, so bring friends and tag team those lines. I will give them kudos for having security and keeping the lines in order. The quality of meat is ok but very well marinated. They have a grilled onion station which you also have to line up for and they have some tables to sit at. This place is a must after the club but bring a lot of patience with you if you want asada tacos, that line is usually an hour."}
{"text":"Surprisingly amazing best spot I ate at in Vegas I hate low expectations and was the best food I ate here"}
{"text":"Their adobada tacos - stuffed with greasy, red-tinted spicy pork and topped with white onion, cilantro, salsa, avocado crema and - optionally, if you ask, slices of grilled pineapple - remain the gold standard for a taco in Vegas. The carne asada isn't quite as renowned but it's still great - topped with pico and a simple guacamole. Red and green salsa both pack a little flavor and a little punch. I'm glad the Strip location is open again but this one was definitely taking its place for a while during its absence."}
{"text":"So I've been eating more veggie lately (although nowhere near entirely), and the one major carnivorous mainstay of my diet lately has been tacos. To the point where I've started calling myself a \"tacotarian.\" (And yes, I know they make fish tacos, I just don't care.)

So on my latest trip to Tacos El Gordo, I decided to branch out and try their vegetarian option - to see if I could keep visiting my favorite Vegas taco joint even in the absence of meat.

The taco azteca (nopales asado) is strips of grilled cactus served on your choice of corn or flour tortilla with salsa and guacamole. The cactus really had a nice snap when you bite into it and a bit of a peppery flavor. A lot of times with vegetarian options for Mexican it feels like you're \"missing\" something. A vegetarian burrito from Chipotle feels like a magic trick sometimes. And not in a good way.

But this was legit. If I ever pull the trigger and go full-on vegetarian, this will be a staple of my diet.

(The adobada is still amazing too.)"}
{"text":"Line was long, but after tasting the food I now know why.  Best tacos hands down in Vegas.  Make sure you know what line your in because there are different lines for steak and pork.  Sucks they didn't have chicken but oh well can't win them all."}
{"text":"My favorite place for tacos in Vegas! Asada tacos and mulitas are my favorite! Along with the guacamole they top them off with. Customer service was great. The girls where very friendly. The place was full of customers the whole time we where there. They really do bring the flavor from Tijuana. This is a must!"}
{"text":"Okay but not impressed. Asada meat is pretty good. Guacamole is just smashed avocado with nothing in it. Quesadillas are tiny so order multiple if you're hungry. Carne asada fries are just fries asada guacamole cheese and some weird green sauce which is maybe cilantro cream? Didn't do it for me when I'm used to fries cheese beans rice sour cream and bomb guacomole and salsa. But my biggest problem was they didn't have carnitas. lol I can't wrap my head around that."}
{"text":"Figured there was something to this place because it was packed every time we drove by. Great location just off the strip and the food was yummy! Forget about getting good or fast service (ordering food was ALL over the place...very disorganized) That being said we had tacos on freshly made corn tortillas and I felt I was south of the border! delicious guacamole and salsas were the finishing touch. A great stop when your craving authentic soft tacos!"}
{"text":"This is probably the first time I have seen a tacos being sold in vegas... with the exception of your local fast food restaurant with their fake tacos. So I think that it was very smart of the El Gordo owners to have opened this shop here. I cam here in the wee morning and everything was pretty organized. It was crowded for the wee morning.. but this is on the Strip. So no surprise there.

I had the Spicy Pork and it came with this liquid green sauce that I wasn't so sure what it was... It already had the guac... so was this liquid quac? Not sure but I think this is what makes El Gordo special. The pork was season great and it's always nice to see a traditional taco place with their pork rotating on its skewer in front of the fire.

I don't see what's so special about Tacos El Gordo. The presentation of the taco was not so nice. and it was really difficult to eat because everything was just thrown on top for me.

My experiences with tacos have come a long way because of LAs vast offerings. I still prefer the traditional hand made tortillas and taco carts from the streets of Highland Park in LA."}
{"text":"What's the formula for good, low cost tacos in Vegas? Start with fresh-made tortillas and a variety of meats from carnitas to steak, add in a super friendly staff with plenty of smiles and suggestions, top it off with a sparkling clean visible kitchen filled with mexican music from a jukebox and you have a big winner. The al pastor with a mild avacado based salsa and a thin slice of roasted pineapple is just like being in Mexico City.  Inexpensive and good - a rare combo in Las Vegas (especially at the CES convention week)."}
{"text":"Freakin awesome food and great prices, stopped by while walking down the strip, pleasantly surprised by awesome food and good prices"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place! Let me start by saying I'm a local and I've heard so many great things about Tacos El Gordo from others that I told my wife we had to swing by when we were downtown. We went around 12pm so prime lunch hour and had no issues finding parking which was awesome. Walking in we found there was a long line but it sure did move very fast! So you order your food and they hand it to you, almost like a school cafeteria style, and then you walk your plates over to the cashier for payment, soda purchases, and salsa. For three carne asada tacos, one carne asada sope, and a drink I only paid $14. The tacos come with a red salsa, guacamole, cilantro, and onion. The tortillas were almost brown instead of white or off white color, I'm assuming from not changing the oil regularly. The tacos themselves were very underwhelming. The meat was cold and all of the ingredients lacked seasoning. Just very blah... Sucks because I really did want to like it!"}
{"text":"I came here at 4 AM and it was packed, so you know what that means. It's the \"go-to\" spot for after hours eating. AKA you'll come across some interesting characters and/or personalities that come out post-clubbing. Lovely. 

In terms of the food itself, i'd say it's average at best. I've had much better tacos from taco trucks in LA, but hey, you're in Vegas so don't expect the very best. The meat is a little bit rough and dry, but it's definitely not the worst ever. Plus, when it's 4 AM...what would you rather have - tacos or nasty McDonalds? I say TACOS."}
{"text":"I have to say it is the best taco in town. We stopped by this taco shop at 2am after clubbing. It is a good hang over food! The only problem is long waiting line."}
{"text":"I love walking into taco shops like this and you can just smell what's happening in there. The energy of the workers, the line. The street feeling of it, but not literally out in the street.

They have all kinds of meat from your usual standard taco meats to the more internal organ type stuff. See what I mean about street. I am not an internal organ or one for the uncommon body part so I usually stick to my Carne asadas.

Their tacos were delicious and as authentic as it could possibly taste considering I have never been to Mexico to even know what authentic Mexican tacos taste. But because they're so good...I'm assuming this is it right here. Heard this company is actually a business from Mexico. 

I had to dock a couple stars for inconsistency and perhaps overhyped. I did rave about this place to fam that were in town. Had the guys go out on the taco run. Upon returning, I was extra eager to eat my taco, but then I bit into it and almost threw up. My Carne asada tasted like an internal organ, it did NOT taste like Carne asada at all, although, it looked like it. I took another bite and i couldn't even swallow it as I had the first time. I had to spit my food out in disgust and disappointment. I think what happened was they probably didn't wipe up their knife and cutting board properly so when they chopped up my meat, it was mixing in with whatever crazy meat was on there prior. I never went back.

They are good, though. I recommend it to anyone who feels like indulging into some decent tacos. I simply have my own personal tastebuds, opinions, and gross factor which will take me sometime to recover. I shall return, eventualy. Hope I don't catch such luck again. Hopefully YOU don't catch such luck.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly!"}
{"text":"Sorry but at best this place is a 2 maybe a 3 for food wise but the fact that the ordering process is so chaotic and unorganized my overall experience here was a 2 and that's because the taste of the pastor or abodaba tacos was pretty good but hands down and undeniably not even close to being worth the fact that everything else here was pretty weak! Maybe this place is booming like this because Vegas lacks other legit mexican places or taco spots. And to top it off the prices aren't the best for what you get we spent $30 at this place for tacos and got full but definitely wasn't satisfied with the meal at all. And the carne asada here taste bland and flavorless sorry but I'm an avid yelper and this place completely missed the mark for me definetly won't be coming back here again"}
{"text":"So good.  So fast.  So necessary.  The world needs more late night taco joints like this.  I k ww I was in for a good taco when 90% of the clientel were Mexican and clearly regulars.  GO HERE.  EAT THESE TACOS.  They will change your life."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the US! The only ones that I know that beat this for the price were in Guadalajara."}
{"text":"First time here on my lunch break.... Poor customer service for Non Spanish speaking or reading customers. When asking the cashier information as to how to order she was very rude, \"The lines are according to the type of meat you want! Can't you read it!?!\" If I could I wouldn't be asking...."}
{"text":"Compared to the branch in San Diego, this location was pretty disappointing (and I LOVE the the one in San Diego). 

However, when you run out of your famous spicy pork/al pastor before midnight, with 2 more hours of operation, it's hard not to be disappointed. It's even more disappointing when you dole out your last portion of spicy pork to one dude, who realized that he should order 20 tacos instead of the 4 he was originally going to get, because he can (though I guess I can't exactly fault the establishment for that).

So we decided to deal with it. While the tripa tacos I got were just as good (super delicious for those curious), they got my friend's order wrong (they gave him the asada instead of the tripa)... twice...

Maybe we just came on a bad night, but I think I'll stick to the one in SoCal for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"We ordered, steak fries, lengua tacos, al pastor tacos, adobada tacos, steak mulas, and cheese quesadillas.
Of all, the adobada tacos were the best because they put the green sauce and other stuff on it. I saw pics that other tacos had it on but my other tacos only had onions and cilantro which didn't make them \"great\" or \"better\" than other taquerías I have attended. Tacos are small and expensive. They are fresh so that is good. We were in line a good hour and a half. 
Three separate lines for anything so it sucks not to know this ahead of time. 
One for adobada and al pastor, another for asada and I don't know what else, and another for lengua and cabeza, etc.
Worth making a long line for them?
Not in my opinion! The only thing I would go back for is the adobada tacos and I guess my husband liked the Al Pastor."}
{"text":"Food here is great. Can't argue, mexican food is always good. It was busy but worth the wait. Prices are worth it. I hope everyone try this place out. My favorite is the carne asada fries."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a new \"go-to\" taco place since Los Parados on W. Sahara closed a while back.  Their al pastor was one of the best things I've had in LV and seeing the Yelp pics of Tacos El Gordo's adobada on the spit posted had me salivating in front of my laptop.  Must. Go. ASAP!

We ordered 4 adobada, 1 carne asada and 1 beef tongue.  We really liked everything except the tongue.  Maybe it was just our mood that day?  I was freaking starving so I was ready for more.  As soon as I'm about to speak to the guy manning the adobada, he grins and asks \"How many more do you want?\".  I'm sure this happens every 10 minutes there.

I got 2 more adobada along with a brain taco.  The guy automatically perked up when I ordered brain.  The person in charge of the internal organ taco dept went to work digging out some to chop up and put in a corn tortilla.  They also assumed it was my first time trying it.  They assumed right!

It wasn't bad although I didn't love it either.  It was like a beef pate with a lobstery taste to it.  Not ready to order another the next day but we're glad we tried one.     

I might be in the minority of reviewers eating here while sober.  I definitely see how this place would be even better when you're loaded like a freight train at 5am.  Certainly look forward to when I am here in that condition."}
{"text":"Amazing place! My aunt and uncle who recently moved to vegas really wanted to try this place to see what the rave is all about & it definitely lives up to the hype!  We walked in kinda confused cuz there were just a bunch of lines but this nice customer gave us a rundown on how it worked- line up in front of the sign that has the meat/item you want and then pay at the cashier. We got carne asada tacos and fries, but I thought they were just alright. I tried adobada mulas for the very first time and was mind blown how good it was. I had to get back in line and order more! Definitely check this place out for some mouthgasmic tacos"}
{"text":"We got here around 10 and the line was already out the door. But worth the wait, our favorite was the mula."}
{"text":"Wait... Whaaat? Cheap late night eats on the strip!!

Each delicious taco is $2.00 which is kinda expensive for your typical street taco but considering that it is Vegas, these prices are cheap and well worth it! The abobado (spicy pork) and carne asada tacos are so flavorful and tender.  And I especially love that the carne asada tacos come with guacamole!

********WARNING********

The roasted jalapeno peppers are SPICYYYY!  Just sample it first or the tears will come!"}
{"text":"This place was so disgusting. Im not even a picky eater but my parents and sister got tacos. The meat had a lot of marble and cartilage. I had the carne asada fries and they where cold and soggy from the beginning. No veggies at all, nit my sort of place, sorry."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The spicy Pork and Tongue tacos I had were on point. The tortillas are small but so tasty. They also put so much on it you cannot see the tortilla. It smells as good as it taste. I wish I would have eaten more but I had a buffet waiting for me a couple hours later. No complaints about anything so it is a definite 5 STARS *****"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite taco shop in Las Vegas. I always order the ADOBADA tacos or the ADOBADA fries with everything on it. The line is a bit of a wait. You order your food first and then pay for it after. There's no salsa bar, but your able to get it on the side from the taco counter. 

If you have a late night craving for Mexican, this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas! I ordered 4 of the Adobada tacos with everything on them. So good that you don't even need hot sauce. The line was a bit long, but expected since this place is super popular. I would come back again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"Great tacos, but hands down the best sopes and mula I have ever had. The al pastor, and the adobada are the standouts for me. Although the lines can be hectic and outside the door at times; it's not only inexpensive, but it's delicious ! A Vegas must go !"}
{"text":"My second time coming and the tacos al pastor delivered again. This is a very busy location but we got here at 2 pm and it was ok. The tacos de tripas are dry and hard. When I went back to order more tacos de lengua, I saw why... they deep fry them. That is why they are hard and dry. The other food was great."}
{"text":"fast and friendly, I have tried other menu items but i keep returning for the adobada, I don't think you will ever find a better tasting taco... in this country at least."}
{"text":"Okay soooo I was recommended this place by a friend who lives in Vegas. I was like okay I need to check this place out and I'm so freakin happy I did. I went in on July 4th about 7ish and the lines were pretty long and it was a bit confusing on which line to get in but after a couple of minutes my boyfriend and I figured it out. One word BOMB! Sadly I did not get tacos which I regret now I got a half order of the carne asada fries which was delicious no complaints BUT after getting a taste of that MEAT I was like man I should have gotten tacos! The meat seriously had such a good flavor hands down one of the best meat if not the best meat I have tried from a place. Although it would be nice if they could figure out a way to make those lines move faster. But seriously can't wait for my next visit to Vegas to come here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! The tacos were amazing perfectly seasoned. Just like the tacos you'd find in Mexico. Seating is scarce but once you taste the tacos, standing and eating isn't on your mind even after you've been walking 7+ miles. The Aguas Fresca's were an added bonus.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So after THREE freakin times trying here, we finally on the 4th time just said lets do it. We came at 0330 one time.. Line out the door. We came at 1100 on a Sunday morning, line out the door. We came a 3rd time... Guess where the line was... Yup. 
This 4th time we were like dude, I hate lines and am so starving but omg this place must be amazing if it's getting this kinda business, right? Right. 
I can't promise you'll love it. So I can't promise it's worth the wait of the long lines. It's definitely authentic. The cooks/preparers are very kind and efficient. Friendly. Nobody starting sh*t or acting crazy. Living in El Paso, I CAN say I've had better... However I CANNOT say I've had better in Las Vegas. Cheap, on the strip, good \"drunk food\". 
Tacos (for a dude my size) are smaller so order a few. My Japanese wife, who barely clocks in at 100lbs, ate 4. It was tough of course but she still finished all 4. So you see what I mean... Big dude with big appetite? Get about 6... Not kidding. Everyone seemed to love it. Didn't see any sour faves or disappointed kids etc... I mean it is what it is. Locally it's obviously the dope biz... I guess I'm immune to it because of where I live, which is basically Ciudad Juarez lol...of course it's El Paso Texas, but you wouldn't know that from the license plates you see. But I'm cool with it, border towns got the bomb food! 
Go to Tacos El Gordo... Get a few, try it out. Won't break the bank. Worth it. I say 3 stars, but Let the long lines and overall rating on yelp guide you."}
{"text":"OMG! I am in love with the tacos at this place. Every time I visit Vegas, this place is a must! Everyone is so friendly, been here a couple times, (let's say...three times a year) & the staff still remembers my face every time."}
{"text":"This location was closed for over a year and I  am so stoked that they're back. These are the BEST tacos on the strip PERIOD. They are so good, when I would visit Vegas last year I would make the journey off strip into a real seedy part of town to wait an hour in line to enjoy these tacos. And it was worth it. I'm excited to see them back on the strip and still operated by the same owners. The quality has not changed. Before this business closed down last year it had thousands of reviews and a solid 4.5/5 star rating. Not only is this the best street taco place in Vegas, this could be the best street tacos in the United States. Besides the classics: carne Asada, pastor, pollo Asada, they also offer specialty items like lengua, cabeza, tripa, sesos, chorizo, the list goes on and on. Everything is authentic and delicious. All the tortillas are made in front of you. The meat is grilled in front of you. Everything is fresh and made to order. At their price point, it will be one of the least expensive meals you can eat in Vegas and easily the most delicious."}
{"text":"If I ever come here again, I will only go for the adobada tacos. 
Friendly staff pretty fast service for a busy night
BTW they also have a drive thru"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to visit this place for a while 
We walked in and a lady explained how the three different lines work but we were still confused and started with one of course we picked the wrong one which was ok, we went to the middle one which was the steak we wanted but I wanted French fries too and the third line was so slow we waited 10 minutes and our tacos were already cold so I left to get into another line to pay 
It was not to busy 
The meat was kind of tough and ok 
So my experience was just ok 
Nothing special"}
{"text":"They have delicious and authentic tacos here. From what I gathered they only have corn tortillas and boy are they yummie! I tried several and really enjoyed them all. My favorite is the taco de asada with everything which is salsa, onions, cilantro, and guac. 

The salsa is good and slightly spicy. They've got limes and sliced/whole raddish to dress these already perfect tacos. 

They've got plenty beverages as well! 3 tacos and a pineapple soda is the perfect meal before hitting the strip. At $2.10 a piece you can't beat it! 

I'm sad I didn't try the al pastor but that's a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Techs El Gordo is one of my favorite food spots here is Las Vegas this is now my second location."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for me & my bf after a night of drinking with friends at Downtown. Their carne asada fries is what we usually crave for some \"sobering up\" food but we've noticed the past few times it isn't as great as it used to be. We came here last night and our carne asada fries was just okay and we realized that that might have been the last time we would be craving it for a while. Plus the price went up which was another bummer. But of course if you're here for the tacos, that's another story lol. Definitely go here for that taco craving!

Service was quick for us at 3am on a Friday night which was surprising but then a whole flurry of people came in just shortly after. I like this location better than the one on Las Vegas Blvd because it's usually less busy and there are enough places to sit."}
{"text":"Omg best dam tacos ever.we come to vegas probably every four months weather it be for biz or play but every time its a must to have tacos here so if your in vegas and have a craving for mexican you must try this place.its right on the strip and open real late so weather its lunch or late nite after partying all nite munches this is where you must go.:D"}
{"text":"On our way back home from Vegas, one friend in our group highly recommended this place and we stopped by around 11:30 on a tuesday to find a packed house!
the lines move fast, and when i say lines it is because one line kind of diverges into two, the first counter allows you to order certain meats and plates, the counter around the corner has difference options then a separate line to pay for the meal

everything looked so damn good i couldn't decide so i ordered:
2 tacos de al pastor
2 tacos de Buche
1 Sope de asada
1 Horchata
all came to about $15 

and holy shit from the first bite of each taco and sope, this was instantly the best mexican food i have ever had!! 
the al pastor was to die for! each and every piece cut from the al pastor tower was crispy with the flavorful and broiled bark, so juicy and a little kick oh just wonderful
the buche was  tender, so juicy and greasy, amazing porky flavor
the sope oh man, nice size, crispy from the flat top, cheese guac veggies and the asada was bbq galore
literally every bite had me shaking my head, wanting more, and experiencing a flavor and taco and plate that i had never had before from los angeles! 
the horchata was a nice refresher too, especially from the machine

this place is a definite new spot to visit every damn trip! DO NOT GO TO VEGAS WITHOUT STOPPING HERE!"}
{"text":"i don't know hooow this place got such high reviews... i think it's over hyped.

nevertheless, i wouldn't mind stopping by again when i'm staying at Wynn or Encore.  the tacos are SO much cheaper than what they got in the hotel!! totally worth the short walk from Encore lol

their salsa is fantastic! it makes chipotle's look like a joke.  don't underestimate it though, it's hella spicy! i'm from east coast so i was loving the authenticity of mexican food from southern west coast.  the steak taco is recommended-- i couldn't get myself to try those cow brains and w/e strangeness they were offering.. 

just a quick note about their quesadillas.. they're not your typical american quesadillas.. it looks something like between a sandwich and a salad.. bottomline--  it's really hard to eat! 

but yeah, i wouldn't go out of my way for this place even if you love nothing but tacos."}
{"text":"Sorry but this place is all hype!  I did not like the food at all! I ordered a mulita de chorizo (dry) and 2 tacos de al pastor & tripas. Lacked sooo  flavor! Not to mention they have Olé horchata from the soda machine!!! Wth!!!!"}
{"text":"Being from Southern California undoubtedly makes you the hugest snob when it comes to Mexican food. And usually the rule of thumb is the farther you go from the border the higher the chances you will hit a dud. 

However it was late on a Sunday night after a full weekend of nonstop raging in Vegas and we were on a quest for some sustenance for our 4.5 hour drive back to Socal. After one option was closed and another was too long of a line, Tacos El Gordo became our saving grace. We ordered our tacos on the phone togo as we drove our way over and were very pleased when they were ready once we got there!  The place was packed at 11PM on a Sunday night with locals which is always a good sign.

To my happy surprise all of the tacos were foil wrapped on plates separately which made sharing them so much easier. I was expecting huge togo boxes filled with tacos. You definitely get more bang for your buck if you order them with flour tortilla but I feel like that is a serious crime. They still do a very good job of giving you a lot of meat on the corn tortillas! I opted to try the a lengua, a carne asada, and adobada taco. 

LENGUA: The lengua came in generous tender chunks! Not too chewy and very succulent I wish I had gotten more. However at $2.25 a pop I thought that was pretty pricey. But I guess that's what you have to pay for a decent taco in Vegas. 

ASADA: The carne asada taco to me was pretty dry and chewy. I have definitely had better and I am glad I did not opt to just order only asada as I usually do.

ADOBADA: ADOWHA?! I was very excited to try the adobada taco as I don't see this type of meat on the menu at many places. They call it \"spicy pork\" there but it is not spicy at all. The pink tint on the skin of the pork reminds you a bit of chinese bbq pork and makes you almost wonder what it's doing in a taco. But boy is it so good! The meat is so delicious and plentiful! Now ever since that fateful day I have been on a search for some well reviewed adobada in Socal with no avail and cannot wait to get back to Vegas to get some more of this rare gem!"}
{"text":"When you want real tacos, no matter what part of the U.S. you reside in, this is the shizznit.

Probably my favorite thing about this place is not the fact that they have two locations, one in Tijuana and the other in Las Vegas. The best thing about El Gordo is they offer NO el pollo items. I love it, since chicken tacos are pretty stupid. There is not enough fat and tendon juices that can enhance a chicken taco to umami levels. No chicken, I love it.

The Al pastor is Mexico City style and perfect snack between 4-5 hour gambling sessions at the Wynn and Palazzo. The lengue with a little lime and onion is perfectly braised. The tripe tacos are also perfect and feel really healthy when you have them.

I need this spot once a day when I'm in Vegas regardless of what the encore at Wynn/Venetian/Cosmo/mgm are offering in their buffets. I end up winning after eating this Al pastor."}
{"text":"Look - I know one assumes that a 5 star meal in Vegas will always break the bank. Gordo is here as living proof that the assumption does not always stand.

One of the BEST MEALS I had on my trip. Tacos Azteca were some of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. The experience itself was great too. A little weird at first (you have to stand on different lines depending on what you want) but you'll get it. And you'll be happy you made the trip up the block."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos period. Best tacos we had in Vegas (Carne Asada, Adobada).  There's a line but it moves fast. You'll be back in the line since they are so good."}
{"text":"Favorite carne asada fries in town , and awesome prices also great tacos the only thing I hate about this place is that it's always so full of people but, hey I don't blame em the food is worth it"}
{"text":"Attention first time visitors: Get the Adobada tacos! They're AMAZING!!!

I went here for the first time and was not sure what to get! Thank god for Yelp, I made the right choice! Me and partner only ordered one each, and we easily could have eaten 2 each because they're so small (but tasty)! I am NOT a pork person when it comes to tacos, but when it comes to these I totally am!! Winner winner, Adobada dinner!!

The carne asada nachos we're good also!"}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos in town. Can be a little mind boggling with which lines to go to for certain tacos. But once you get it figured out, it's well worth the trouble. Will definitely return before our trip back to SC. Thanks guys, great job!!!!!"}
{"text":"El Gordo rules and if you disagree you are probably still crying about Bernie losing. Get a life."}
{"text":"These tacos are to die for!! A little confusing on how to order and where to pay but i figured it out, me and the wife ate for 11 bucks. Gotta make a stop here when in town get you some grilled veggies when you order too."}
{"text":"You have to try the pork. It is amazing!!!! Great prices. Spent around $22-24 for two people and we were so full. The Service was fast. It was a little confusing when we got in on where to place our orders. They were set up in stations."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Hands down one of the best taco spots in Vegas. Their adobada and carne tacos are to die for. If you're craving Mexican food this is the place to fulfill your cravings!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Food! Everything here is good. Great atmosphere and helpful staff! I almost passed out of all the meat I have consumed."}
{"text":"Honestly, the second best al pastor taco I have ever had. First was down in Mexico. They do authentic very well!"}
{"text":"Now, this is what I call Mexican food. I am such a sucker for verde sauce, corn tortillas, and the bustling market feel that I couldn't help but follow the hype. There are a few things on the menu that I have never heard of like Vampiro haha. Eventually, I'll try everything because their Adobada is dericious ~ 

Try it out! It's so affordable that you could miss out on your Big Mac for a day, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"First time coming here,  and I can honestly say not the best tacos at all. Been hearing about this place for the longest time decided to give it a shot, the wait time was almost 20-30 minutes. I ordered 7 tacos de asada and a quesadilla. I thought the quesadilla was a regular quesadilla honestly, nope it isn't it's pretty much the same size of a taco just added with some cheese that thing is like $5 the small portion that it is , too over priced. Then to top it off the tacos where HELLA SALTY couldn't enjoy my food at all had to down every bite with my horchata shitty tacos I've ever had, least I can say I tried it and not coming back,  too over hyped. Coming from all the way from LA , not worth the money whatever I paid here could've gone to a nice restaurant for better taste in food."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD.  OMGoodness.  I am glad I don't live in the area because I would be here every single day...and as big as a house.  This place is right near the Wynn in a little strip mall.  Very casual.  

Let's talk about the tacos.  Oh the tacos.  We ordered the Carne Asada and El Pastor.  The Carne Asada comes with the usual onions and cilantro.  Get the avocado sauce...on everything.  It is amazing.  The El Pastor was cut off of a huge stack of meat roasting on a spit.  Then it gets covered in a red sauce and the avocado sauce and topped with onions and cilantro.  Meat is tender and well seasoned.  AMAZING.  

Yes, it's crowded, but that's a good sign.  If you have to sit on a curb, stand outside, or stand on your head to eat your food...do it.  The prices are great and you can get a drink with free refills.  Tacos El Gordo is truly a gem in an area where prices are ridiculously expensive, the price for one taco is about $2.   I ordered four tacos and had to go get another one even though I was full.  It's that good.   

My recommendation?  Run, don't walk to Tacos El Gordo.  I would if I could."}
{"text":"Definitely lived up to the hype! Now I get why everyone told us to try this place out. Yummy authentic tacos!"}
{"text":"There are a ton of reviews that capture everything you need to know about this place.  Get the lengua, by far the best tongue taco I've had.  The pork is great as well, the sauce they put on for you is perfect, and the warm pineapple sliver tops off a great taco.

The Campechana fries (1/2 pork 1/2 steak) are a must, although they will put you to sleep within an hour of consuming.  The smoke flavor is very prominent in the meat when served on top of the fires, flirting with overwhelming.

Ate there 2 times in the same day, that should speak for itself."}
{"text":"Best. Tacos. Ever.

You haven't had tacos until you've had them at this place. I envy anyone that lives near a Tacos El Gordo. That used to be me until I moved from San Diego to Chicago. People in Chicago rave about tacos and Mexican food but it pales in comparison to this place.

Order the cabeza tacos. Sure, it sounds disgusting. But I love head! *insert dirty joke here* No seriously though. The meat is moist, sweet and delicious. The perfect taco.

Also, be sure to save room for some adobada mulas. I never knew what a mula was until I came here. Basically, it's a quesadilla version of their taco. SO GOOD!

This location is open until 2am on the weekends so do yourself a favor and make a stop here. Leave the club early if you have to. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Definite must try! , so tasty, so fresh, so cheapppp!!

Fast, made to order and just packed with authentic flavors! 

Try one of each honestly and the roasted peppers!

The drinks are Delish!"}
{"text":"The food looks so delicious and smells so good. Unfortunately they don't serve chicken, fish, or shrimp so I couldn't try the food since I don't eat beef or pork."}
{"text":"Best tacos! I got al pastor and carne Asada and the asada fries and they were so bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY had Tacos El Gordo on the last the trip to Vegas. I've had many friends tell me I gotta try it but we never made our way to it until recently. We opted to go to the Charleston location with a big group who all had not tried it yet so that was cool. It wasnt too long of a drive from the City Center where were staying for the weekend.

So indeed you wait in line for the meat you want, as other Yelpers have pointed out. We wanted mainly pork adobada tacos so we were posted up in that line. Al pastor was also available there so that was good. It was probably the longest line at that time. So you can order tacos, mulitas, quesadillas, sopes and the loaded fries as long as they're of whichever meat is served in that specific line. 

I really liked the adobada flavor. It's different than what I usually have. It had great stewed-in flavor and I like that. The al pastor was also very good. Great flavor on that meat... I also went in line for the suadero tacos. That's the middle line which was generally empty when we were there. Maybe it's because they also served sesos and cabezas in that line. Haha... I get it. Might be too crazy for some folks. But i'm sure they do those well too... The suadero tacos are very tasty. My understanding is that suadero is rib meat and it was real good. Moist not dry. I liked it a lot. The campechana fries are a monster. And at $13 is a meal in itself.

Plenty of parking in a shared lot. It's a bit down Charleston so keep driving until you see the shopping plaza on your right side if you're coming from the Strip. Bring your patience... Wait in line. Order your food. Wait for your food up front... And pay all together at the cashier."}
{"text":"Tacos are super tasty, but know what you're ordering before you order because unfortunately English is not really spoken here. The salsa is spicy! So watch out. The carne Asada was flavorful and a decent amount of meat on the little tacos. We got the carne asada, chorizo, and lengua.... all of which were good. On the strip, so expect a long line and no seating, but definitely worth a try and the prices are great."}
{"text":"The place is packed out the door at 2 a.m. on a Friday night. There's plenty of seating inside and outside. They have a system to order certain meats at different lines and you pay at a different area after getting all your food. I got three carne asada tacos and they were great. Good flavor in the meat with a lot of guacamole on top. Not super expensive either, Less than $3 per taco."}
{"text":"AMAZING TACOS. Has to be one of my favorite tacos ever. Freshly made torillas they cook right in front of you. The Carne Asada fries were soooo good. Ate there twice it was that good and satisfacting. Love that they are open late and there lines were a little confusing but the tacos made up for that!"}
{"text":"BEST. TACOS. OF. MY. LIFE. And the crazy part is-I don't even like tacos normally! So glad we found this place: it's on the strip in between the Wynn / Encore and the Stratosphere (closer to the Encore). There was a crazy line when we got there but it was well worth it! The inside is kind of a diner style place with plenty of seating (but you might have to wait to get some if there are a lot of people). They have multiple lines depending on which tacos you want to try. I opted for the spicy pork (adobada) and beef tongue (lengua). Both were DELICIOUS. They shave the spicy pork straight from this tower of meat (imagine shawarma style) and every bite is juicy and delectable. The beef tongue is surprisingly soft. They also put a salsa that gives it a real kick on the tacos, so be prepared for that! To top it all off, this place is also crazily cheap. Each taco is $2.10 so you literally see people grabbing a whole tray of them. For me 3 was plenty for lunch. 

My only regret is that when I crave these there's no way to get them except for to get back to Vegas, but guess having to return isn't the worst thing in the world!"}
{"text":"Cabeza, lengua and Adobada...winners!!!!

It's like organized confusion when you step in the door, but not waving my .44, all you hear is papa slamming tacos galore!!! LOL...RIP...BIG.

Seriously though, there are like 3.5 lines...1 for adobada (longest line), 2 for everything else and half a weird azz line for drinks or paying..?

Whoever mapped out the daily operations here is a genious, Not!  Still the tacos more than make up for the craziness.  I do wish they were a tad bit bigger, for $2 bones a pop...but they do put the works on it...and pronto.

Not a fan of fountain horchata, but it does the job washing down tacos between pauses.

If you are smart, try to avoid the rush...this place can get mad packed.  Pretty sure we came in about 1:45 p.m. and it was still a zoo!  Seating is kinda cramped too and peeps are moving about freely in all directions.  

But what else can I say...gotta be one of the better quick taco joints IMO."}
{"text":"YES - this is a five star place.  Tacos el Gordo has perfected the \"Taco Shop!\"  I might even move over to the east side just to be closer...

The place was packed with mexicans!  This is a no english establishment.  You can get by with just pointing and saying \"si\" or \"dos\" or \"gracias.\"  In other words - the place is authentic!

There is a cafeteria style ordering system.  Adobada, carne asada, something that looked like beef parts.  The cooks were slapping the tacos together as fast as you could snap your fingers!

I had the adobado tacos and carne asada tacos.  Adaboda - other than the pork and pineapple I have no idea what went on my taco but it was MUY BUENO! Same with the carne asada tacos - ME Gusto Mucho!

The service was fast and friendly.

The place was very clean - especially for how busy it was.

It was worth the 20 minute drive."}
{"text":"Excellent place to visit great food must try the Carne azada fries. Long lines but food is great."}
{"text":"I've heard about Tacos El Gordo as their main branches are in south San Diego and they are WELL known for authentic Mexican street tacos. These aren't just *any* run of the mill chicken/steak/carnitas tacos but the REAL ones where they use certain... innards of the animal. Although I've lived in Chula Vista for so long I hadn't visited one (shame on me), so not only am I able to complete a pilgrimage to such a well-known taco establishment before I move to the Bay Area, I also got to introduce the No1DP to REAL tacos. It's a step up from the \"Mexican\" food he's been used to eating on his business trips but he says it was way too late to try brain and stomach tacos :/

This is one of the few places in Vegas that are open quite late on a weekday (3am) and even more late on weekends (5am). Frankly there's not much that's open for late night eating afterwards unless you are willing to go off-strip and even then you have to know what you are looking for. This area is also short walking distance from the Wynn/Encore hotel group so this would be a perfect late-night spot for people getting out of XS/Surrender/Tryst and needing to sober up.

There's indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating is covered. No1DP says that outside is a good place to go people-watching as it overlooks Las Vegas Blvd.

Inside the taco shop there are various counters. Each counter you can order specific items. Place your order then fall in line at cashier towards the door to pay.

All tacos use two flour tortillas to soak up the fat/give stability to the taco plus each taco has a generous portion of salsa verde. There's no cheese or sour cream on the taco (which is a sign of a true Mexican taco joint). Each taco is between $2-$3.

Asada: Typical beef carne asada taco. Tastes like any other carne asada taco. If you live in SoCal and are lucky enough to have taco shops within reasonable driving distance, just do yourself a favor, be more adventurous and try a taco that you'll only find here.
Suadero (shoulder): One of the best cuts of meat for a taco I've ever had. Shoulder seems like it was braised as the meat was quite soft and juicy without it being too greasy.
Cabeza (head): For this taco I think they grind up the head so that the end result texture is similar to a pate. The taste was a bit weird and didn't have much flavor as a meat; it absorbed more of the oil and the salsa verde. 

I can definitely justify the hype regarding this place and this taco joint, along with TJ's Oyster Bar for tacos from the sea, are my two recommended taco joints for REAL street tacos. Now if I can find someone to drag along who is willing to try beef brain, tripe and pork stomach before I leave..."}
{"text":"The food is good but you have really bad service. First, it is very unorganized, they  have you ordered your food and then pay for your food and they have employees check for the food to be pay making me feel uncomfortable because the employees asking you very rudely if it is paid.   By the time they make you wait is very long than by  the time you paid and eat your tacos they are cold."}
{"text":"Across the street from the Encore- easy walk- authentic food. Try a little of everything. Winner."}
{"text":"My life will never be the same. Hands down best taco I have ever had. Truely authentic. With our limit Spanish my group and I weren't sure what we were ordering,the beautiful thing....it didn't matter, everything we order was amazing. Fast, friendly, affordable and the best tasting taco ever."}
{"text":"The wait here is unbelievably long but it was worth the wait! Unfortunately i had a huge cut inside my mouth/gums (tacos were a bit spicy!) so i couldn't fully enjoy my tacos :( From what i remember, they were super authentic and made super fresh to order. The workers move quick and make the tacos in front of you. Indoor and outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"This location sucks ass.   DO NOT EAT HERE.  Take the extra drive to the one on charleston it's worth it.  This location gives tacos el gordo a bad name.  The adobada was already pre cooked and was not served cut straight off the ball.   WTF"}
{"text":"It was nice to get real tacos. 

There is not alot of variety; but what they do they do in bulk. 

I ordered the tacos de nopales, tacos de suadero, y tacos de tripa. They included a generous helping of cebollitas on the side. 

I will say that, due to the heavy traffic, the tacos are a little greasier than I would generally prefer . Everything was fresh; and well prepared. 

I was suprised that, even though they were on the strip, they charged regular taqueria prices."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas. Been countless times and I can't stop. Al Pastor taco's are a must have for sure and to be honest is what I usually get so I can't give to much insight on the list of other tacos. The Carne asada tacos and fries though are also amazing. I know my Mexican food and promise you it won't disappoint. 

If you want something quick, authentic and delicious then this is the spot. Good prices, quick service (although there is often a large line), and delicious food. Both locations are at par to me so don't be shy by this ones location next to a gas station."}
{"text":"I go here all the time and haven't had a bad experience yet. The food is always good, and even though it's busy at times they always get to you pretty fast."}
{"text":"aw man, this is a far, sketchy walk from the quad at 2:30am but worth it!
i kept going back up for more and more spicy adobada tacos- they were so freaking good.  i thought that the asada meat was a little dry but delightful nonetheless.

this is not gastronomie, it's street food at it's finest and probably the most authentic taco experience i've ever had."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever.  Hubby loves them.  Different varieties of meats fast service.  Place is always clean 
Real yummy.   Try it you will love them !!!"}
{"text":"So damn good, better then the tacos in a rocky point in mexico"}
{"text":"Oh my god.... Go here. My only error was I forgot to ask for pineapple. Soooo good. Vampiro was meaty and messy and fabulous. The taco adobodo (? Al pastor) was moist and flavorful and I love the white sauce, the carne asado with and without nepalitos, perfect with a healthy squeeze of lime... The nepalitos, as a gringa, I would probably cut it into smaller bits, the slab of cactus was a bit much, but I liked the flavor addition. Yum, yum, yum.... Y
The flan was rich and creamy and 4 tacos and flan set me back $15- oh and horchata too. Perfect for dinner back I. The hotel, then breakfast and lunch the next day.... Check it out!"}
{"text":"Right smack on the Strip! Perfect for after a night of clubbing & drinking. We actually came for dinner before the club. There was a hugeass line. Each line serves a different kinda meat. I enjoyed the tripas and the spicy pork! Very tasty tacos but......... I ended up having food poisoning afterwards and yacking everything out. =( The tacos did tasted good though so I will return next time to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! I've been to TJ and yes this is pretty damn close to the same flavor you get in Baja Mexico! 

I tried the carne asada and adobada tacos = delicious!

Order first, pay at cashier and then find your table.

This place is doing so well, they added two outdoor patios and just bought out their neighbor's space."}
{"text":"As far as I know, this is the only place to eat if you're drunk on your night out in Vegas. There was a wild line out the door with the crowd only speaking Spanish. 

I only ordered Al Pastor tacos due to the advice of the surrounding customers. The meat is sliced off in front of you and prepared with incredible speed. I don't mind the price because compared to the fine dining of most places in Vegas, it was incredibly cheap. I snagged horchata as my drink, and my coworker got this dried pumpkin snack thing (I think), and I loved it. I didn't even know I liked pumpkin. 

You make friends in the line. Squirt a lime on your tacos, and check out the mini topping bar to spice it up further. You may or may not remember eating these amazing tacos, so do it again on your next night out~"}
{"text":"Been eating at this place since they were only in TJ, Mexico 15+ yrs. Great back in the day ... Still great today. Can't wait until they set up shop in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"The pork tacos here are fckin amazing !!! I'm so sad that I can only eat this when i'm in vegas. I know they have another location but it's not close to me either. It can get kinda crazy in here so try not coming during peak hours. So if its your first time coming it can kinda be confusing kus I was lol. You'll see a few different lines so make sure you're standing in the right one for the right kind of meat.  The lines get long I know BUT they move kinda fast. Make sure you already know what you want when you get to the front. After ordering and getting your food you'll move on to the cashier area to pay and you're all set !"}

Muy amable, muy bien muchach@s"}
{"text":"Back when I was a ye lad, my family and I used to go to Tijuana, Mexico at least 6 times a year. We would stop at this taco stand named Tacos El Gordo. It was some of the best tacos I have ever had. And my first time having a mula (it's like a small sandwich of tortillas with cheese, guacamole salsa and choice of meat). I always wanted them to be in the states. 

I came to Vegas a few years ago and I was driving down Las Vegas Blvd, I can't believe my eyes! Tacos El Gordo! I immediately stopped and ordered my tacos.  Wow! Tasted the same as the small stand in Mexico! And they hand make their tortillas. 

It's in a small plaza passing the Encore. Parking is sufficient. Outdoor and indoor eating areas. You have to order first and then pay. Your wait is a while, but well worth it! You have to stop here and eat!"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 asada and 2 adobada tacos and an adobada quesadilla. The tacos were whatever, but the quesadilla was wonderful. It is a not a traditional 2 tortilla quesadilla, but more of an open-faced quesadilla. Even though there were slightly more onions than I would have put on the quesadilla myself, it worked well together. After eating my quesadilla, the tacos were just ok. If you have a choice, I would recommend you choose flour tortillas."}
{"text":"El Gordo is possibly the most amazing taqueria I have ever been to. It's completely frantic at lunchtime, so know the system: there's one line for the adobada (spicy pork) tacos, one for the other kinds of taco, and a third for everything else on the menu. You're going to want plenty of the divine adobada, full of meat fresh off the spit and garnished with avocado, cilantro, onions, and just a bit of tangy sauce. But you also can't miss the flavorful lengua or the tender cabeza, so your friend should stand in the other line to order those. A third person, if you have one, should grab some limes and radishes and nab one of the picnic tables outside. A happy taco feast will follow.

El Gordo is also a late night lifesaver. I think there's like 5 hours in the day when they're not open."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Always packed and a little confusing if you've never been. Theres basically lanes for what meat you want in your taco/quesadilla/sope.  Don't be shy and order what you need cus you won't want to wait in the line again. The guy in front of me ordered like 20 and didn't bat an eye lol."}
{"text":"The Adobada is something that once you've had it, nothing will compare. Get it any way you can, but the Adobada fries are awesome. If you can, come with friends to divide and conquer the different lines. Oh and try the different Bang! Ole! Fountain drink flavors."}
{"text":"The tacos here are 100% delicious but prices are expensive for tacos. I grew up in a majority Hispanic community and have been eating Mexican food for as long I can remember. Tacos el Gordo is famous for their El Pastor tacos. These tacos are one of the best tacos I have ever had. They come on double corn tortilla, onions and cilantro, el pastor meat that's been roasting and is cut in front of you, and the most delicious green sauce I have ever tasted. I had other items on the menu like the carne asada but it's mediocre as best. Even if you are not a fan of el pastor I recommend trying it before going for carne asada. I feel that the price for tacos at this place is kind of high, about $2.25 for each taco. I'm use to getting tacos for $1 so it was odd for me getting 4 tacos and paying roughly $12 for it. Also, they have separate lines for ordering if you want different meats. There is a carne asada, lengua, and the el pastor line. You order first then you pay at the cashier. I feel this is a very inefficient way to order because it means if you want carne asada and el pastor, you have to wait in 2 different lines. The el pastor is the most popular yet only 1 man fills the orders. The line can get very long and move very slow. Overall, I love eating tacos in my home town of Southern California, but the el pastor tacos here are a must try."}
{"text":"Loved this place when we went to Vegas and we're cruising on the strip. We were craving good mexican food.  Yelped tacos and voila! This place came up! Hopped in a cab at the wynn and we were there.  Loved it so much, we were staying at the Cal, took a cab to the one on Charleston the next day and caught the bus back!  Good eats and the line well tell you so.  We had the adobada!"}
{"text":"These tacos..... damn. So fecking good. The Mula de asada or al pastor you have to try. Make sure to order with maiz tortillas.  All the tacos are good. Even the \"strange\" ones like tripa, cabeza, lengua. So damn good. Ordering is very different so pay attention. Each meat has a different line and once you have all you ordered,  then you pay. Legit delicious REAL tacos like you get in Mexico. Everytime I'm in Vegas or their one in Chula Vista, I order about a dozen and take them home with me in a cooler. So, so good"}
{"text":"This place is a winner. 4.5 stars and only 2$ just $6 uber ride from the Venetian. You can't beat it. $17 bought 4 pastors and carne Asada  fries and water. More than enough for two. Very fresh. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Their lengua taco is the bomb diggity dot com, I liked it better than their carne asada, authentic Mexican tacos, made to order food, hand pressed tacos made right in front of you"}
{"text":"Amazing Pastor tacos, best tacos in general and super cheap! There pastor fries are crazy fire"}
{"text":"I don't understand why their tacos better than any tacos I ever ate @$#? ... yeah Most people coming from Los Angeles area, will be shocked and surprise and weird-ded by this...I think it's the fresh meat and/or  that  over loaded avocado sour cream sauce, but I can't wait to go back to vegas just to get some more."}
{"text":"The Good: Best Taco's I ever had, but I did come here really hungry after clubbing on a Saturday night.  It's really good though and I live in Los Angeles. I didn't really know what I was ordering (Tacos Carne Asada) Doesn't matter... what ever you get,  you'll love it .

The Bad: I'm Filipino so  didn't mind the ambiance or the scene there that night. But, if your not a minority ...you might feel out of place, but that's really up to you."}
{"text":"Eat Where the locals EAT!!!

Mexican food in Vegas means Tacos EL Gordo!!!

Instructions: for those who have not been here. It maybe one of 5 locations, yes the line maybe out the door and around the block! Yes it's that good!!

There are different lines for different proteins. One line is pork cooked middle eastern way, as standing up open flame. The locals get pineapple ask for it. They don't give it otherwise.

Try the tongue or Chorizo it's really tasty.

Then you Que up, stand in another line to pay.

They trust you will not run away with your food. It's a Mexican concept of honor and class. The thought is you will pay, sometimes after you eat. El Gordo is pay and get your drinks.

Again most of the locations are not high end, this is authentic Mexican style street food served in a causal food environment.

The food is tasty and people are nice. So eat Where the locals eat."}
{"text":"best tacos hands down!!!! 
i've been here a number of times over the years and i will keep going back every time i go to vegas! honestly i look forward to eating here everytime! 
the guys on the line are all so nice and quick to make your food, all fresh and made in front of you. i love that they have fresh made tortillas the lasy is literally right in front of you making them! their vegetables are always so fresh and so good! 

LOVE THEM!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was great! Definitely a must when visiting Las Vegas.  


Cons:
-lines can be long ( really recommend to know what you want before you go in)
-Very packed in the evenings (as expected).  You need to really have an eye out to grab a seat 
-pastor taco tortillas aren't made by hand (not that big of a deal, but thought worth mentioning)


Pros:
-Amazing food, definitely worth the lines
-Great service, picked up trash from our table 
-They have a security guard, to deal with any drunks or drama 
-AC units 

Tips
-know what you want ahead of time 
- the pastor is a MUST 
- spread out your people in different lines if you're in a group.  There are different lines for different types of meat."}
{"text":"Wow.  The pork adobado tacos are simply the shiznit.

This place is right up there with the best tacos I've had ever in my long life of taco eating.  It's not like a regular pastor taco, cut a little thicker.  The meat is so tender and juicy and flavorful.  I couldn't get enough of that pork.  The carne asada was average at best but the puerco more than makes up for the beef's mediocrity.  

They give you a creamy green sauce (avocado cream?  cilantro cream?)  and a righteous red sauce.  I can't imagine a better taco (til i open mine very own taqueria.  stay tuned for that).

Great, fresh, delicate corn tortillas, meat, onion. cilantro, self-admistered sauces.  Great tacos.  Thank you, el gordo.  I love you..."}
{"text":"(Unpublished piece I wrote for a magazine.) 

One of Las Vegas' best kept secrets is sitting squarely on the Strip (with another location downtown). Known for the most delicious street tacos this side of Baja California, Tacos El Gordo has an almost cult-like following, and for good reason.

With favorites such as tacos al pastor, to tender lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (beef head), Tacos el Gordo sells not only some of the most flavorful tacos, but the cheapest you can get for the quality. Despite their Strip location, tacos are between $2 - $2.25 each. Piled high with toppings and hand chopped meat, the tacos are finished with a drizzle of homemade salsas and served right off of the grill. 

Although routinely very busy, the lines tend to be deceiving. Each chef on the line cooks up a different type of meat, with patrons lined up in front of whichever station they want their taco from. Somewhere near the middle, green onions and various whole peppers are grilled to buttery perfection. Motion for a plate of these - they come free with your meal. 

If tacos aren't your style, Tacos el Gordo offers lengua and adobada fries, with meat cut straight off of a large spit. Topped with sour cream, cheese and guacamole, these fries can easily sustain a party of four. Although the menu is generally small, quesadillas, nopal (cactus) and tostadas are also available.

Before paying, fill up on fresh limes and radish slices to compliment the tacos, free of charge. Top off the meal with a glass of frothy, cold horchata. It is a life saver if you've consumed one too many grilled peppers halfway through your meal. 

Trying to find a table may prove difficult during the lunch rush or late night. But don't despair, the tacos are well worth it, sitting down or standing up."}
{"text":"This place, although Mexican, reminds me a lot of the open markets back in Thailand that had the most affordable and delicious food. There were numerous employees, all very friendly and helpful. Since it was our first time there, one of the guys let us try a little bit of every meat (more like he handed it to us without question).

I tried five different tacos - the spicy pork (adobada), steak (asada), tripe, beef shoulder (suadero), and beef tongue (lengua). The tacos also came with nice portion of cooked green onion and jalapeno! Every taco was great and had the perfect portion of meat, sauce, and vegetables (which is something you will rarely hear me say). My favorites were the adobada and tripe. 

I also got horchata, which turned out to have INFINITE REFILLS. My good friend and I were ecstatic over that for quite a while.

Next time I'll try out their fries for sure."}
{"text":"Soooo good! We had carne asada fries and adobada tacos. Very busy and you have to line up in different lines for different meat so thankfully we had friends in each line to order otherwise it'd take a long time to try all the options. 
Flavours were amazing, including the meat and sauces on the tacos and fries. Only thing is we wished there was more topping on the fries.
Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best authentic as you can get to real Mexican tacos. Its sort of cafeteria style and you wait in 3 separate lines to get different kind of tacos. Will be back again"}
{"text":"Oh baby Jesus! This place is BOMB! 
Asada fries: AMAZING!
Tacos de Asada: AMAZING!
Quesadillas: AMAZING!
Tacos de tripa: AMAZING! They are so crunchy and delicious.
Anywho! Only downside of this place is the lines. I honestly don't like how they work. And I'd say they need a bigger seating place but obviously they're still getting a 5 star review lol.
Love how they make the tortillas right on the spot and very friendly service. I am definitely coming here for every visit I make to vegas! Wish we had one in SoCal!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated. Its packed so be ready to wait in line for about an hour. The food is ok, nothing special and nothing u can't get at any other Mexican place. Got Asada tacos, and they were good. The carne Asada fries were meh... Lacked something. Idk what but the picture looks better than they taste. I don't think I'll come back here only because I thought since everyone made a big deal that the food would
Be amazing... Nothing special."}
{"text":"Food 5 stars
Service fast food style
Atmosphere 3 stars

If you can handle the riff raff of the Vegas strip it's worth a visit. The Taco selection is pretty basic and authentic so if your a Traditional Taco Stand fan make sure you swing by for a quick drunk dinner. The flavor is amazing so I would recommend trying every taco if you have the stomach and you like trying interesting things. 

I think Andrew Zimmerman and Anthony Bourdain would both have something good to say about this place. 

Good late night grub at a low price."}
{"text":"Good tacos. The ordering is a bit confusing and can cause some of the tacos to be not as hot when you get to the tables. The Al Pastor was better than the asada. Nice people"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!! (so I don't have to wait in line as long to get my delicious food!)

I'd have to say explicitly.....BEST F&%#EN  LATE NIGHT MEXICAN FOOD in town!
Whether drunk or sober, this place is amazing and a must have anytime I am in Vegas. The lines can be crazy, but there is a reason why. Unlike the night club's long ass lines, this line is well worth the wait!

From what I can remember sober ....my favorite food orders were:
- Lengua fries
- Adobada Fries
- Adobaba, Lengua, Carne Asada tacos
- There were more....but I think this is the part where I just ate anything in sight and KTFO afterwards.

Overall, a hidden gem and great after hours/club spot to go to. Parking sucks and seating is first drunken come, first drunken served. Good luck and happy grubbin'!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo!!!!!! Where have you been all my life?!!! So my family is from Jalisco Mexico, so I know a good ass taco when I eat one and folks what we have here is pure perfection. They even carry lengua and buché which is crazy most Mexican places I've been to here don't carry those two meats. They are fast, efficient and friendly. I guess if I had to give one con it'd be that they are always packed to almost capacity if not right at it which to most it's a good thing for freshness of the food, however for people who like personal space it's a bit overwhelming. Still Extremely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Best adobada tacos I ever had!!! We drive pass here all the time when we're in town and I always see a line out the door.  There's always a line so be ready to wait. Hands down I like this better than any place in California, Midwest, and east coast we have tried so far. We also had the lengua, tripa, and buche tacos all with  lengua fries!! Everything was delicious but our favorite was the adobada spicy pork tacos with flour tortilla."}
{"text":"Needed something to tide us over till dinner later tonight. Have heard a lot of good vibes about Tacos El Gordo. Four of us had a couple Al Pastor tacos each and they didn't disappoint.  Good spicy al pastor, lots of flavor and the eight tacos were less than 20 bucks.
What's not to like, decent amount of outdoor seating, tasty tacos at a good price. Perfect for an afternoon snack before dinner!
Even better is that it's a two minute walk from our hotel."}
{"text":"Food: asada tacos and al pastor tacos. Hmmmm, I just thought these were ok. When I saw other Yelpers had waited 45 minutes in line for this, I thought, HOW SAD!!! I would sooo be mad if I waited in line that long and it tasted like this. Flavor just did not wow me. Honestly, the street tacos at Jefe's Taco Shop is so much better. Luckily, we went for an early lunch at 11am so there was no line whatsoever. 

Ambiance: I was glad how clean it was in here. Crowd was mostly in military uniform from nearby Nellis AFB. 

Service: friendly and with a smile so that was nice."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is always a classic, and it did not disappoint! This spot was right next to our hotel (Encore), so we just walked across the street to get our fix. Luckily, there was no line and we ordered our food immediately! You basically go to different sections to order the type of meats you want. After waiting in line and getting your meats, you go to the cash register to pay for everything.

I got al pastor, spicy pork adobo, and carne asada tacos. I also ordered the lengua quesadilla, and I got my food quickly. The lengua quesadilla is pretty small- it's barely larger than a corn tortilla. However, the lengua was so tender and soft, and I love the cheese, crispy tortilla, and toppings that go on the quesadilla! The spicy pork adobo was full of flavor, and the other meats were bomb as well! Don't forget to ask for spicy sauce at the cash register as it is the cherry to the icing!

Prices are extremely reasonable and food was so good. The guys working the meats know what they're doing and work quickly to accomodate towards their guests. Can't decide between 4 or 5 stars... but I will be back to check for consistency!"}
{"text":"We were headed back to San Francisco from Utah at the end of spring break and decided to drive through Vegas in search of something to eat for dinner. We stopped at the spot on the strip and ended up at this location, hoping that the lines weren't as long. Unfortunately, the lines were just as long. However, they have a system in which there are three different lines and you order your food accordingly. Since I had gone in there by myself, I stood in line for Al Pastor and Adobada. I had ordered 4 tacos but after eating them, I wished I had ordered 4 more. They tasted like the ones I used to buy from the cart in front of my grandma's house in Mexico. Aside from the great taste, watching the guy at the counter prepare my tacos was just as beautiful. I had never seen someone prepare tacos that fast! 

Don't let the lines intimidate you because they move pretty quickly and the $2.50 tacos are soooo worth it. Their creamy salsa verde has me looking for a reason to make the journey back down there soon :)"}
{"text":"Expect to wait in line when you get to this spot as the lines go out the door. When you do get inside, understand how ordering works. There are two lines if your ordering a menu item for Adobada, two lines if your ordering Asada and just one line if you are ordering the Lengua, Cabeza, Sesos, or Buche. If your in a group, split up as once you get done in one line, you would have to wait in the other lines to get a different meat item but once your inside, you don't have to wait outside again in the long lines. Once you get your food, just pay at one of two cashiers.

Now on to the food. I'm a big fan of the Adobada Tacos however it's pretty small and I think I would at least need four to six to feel satisfied. Asada tacos are okay. The carne asada fries are okay with meat, guac, cheese, and salsa but I think it would have tasted a lot better with chips than fries. Overall, I would go back again if the lines were shorter and just order some Adobada tacos."}
{"text":"This place is very busy and the food is very good... Order at separate windows and pay at the register.  It seemed confusing but it was simple.  Asada is the best I have tasted."}
{"text":"OMG! The tacos are the very best that I ever had! There was quite a long line but after trying them for the first time, I am hooked!  It took me time to figure out the different lines but it's ok with me! This will be my go to taco place!"}
{"text":"Had to see what all the fuss was about while in Vegas... 
Well we were very much disappointed! 

Waited in line for 20mins+, ordered tacos alpastor, de asada & alpastor mula. The tacos are a 3 out of 10, lacking seasoning, the salsas are not spicy at all which we thought would give it the extra kick that they were missing, but we were wrong. Have to say that the tortilla was the only thing good about the tacos. 

We, coming from L.A. where you find street tacos practically in ever corner have to say that Tacos El Gordo does not compare it self to the street tacos you find throughout L.A. County."}
{"text":"Worth every annoying wait time...it actually builds up your appetite even more! Do not worry, after all that wait, you will love what you get!!
The al pastor/adobada is the truth!! I mean you can't really go wrong with anything at tacos el gordo!!
The grilled green onions & jalapeño peppers are great condiments and love that the radishes are always fresh & cold!!
It's a must stop for us in Vegas so go and try their tacos!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos in all of Vegas, best flavor you won't be disappointed with the quality of tacos el Gordo. Clean place great food. You must try tacos de al pastor or vampiros de al pastor. Busy place with long lines to get you're tacos but over all a great taco shop better than any other pace in Vegas."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurant I've ever experienced. This is saying a lot as I am a LA native. Their al pastor or pork taco is incredible. Others are definitely ahead of the class. It's a very casual restaurant. One casual restaurant that sits at the top of my dine list during my visits to LV."}
{"text":"I see all the reviews about the crazy lines --- one for each type of taco. Okay guys that is just cray and I feel bad for you all! Thankfully I came in on a Sunday night.. post-clubbing munchies, probs about 3 in the AM and the line was not that bad. Didn't even have the separate lines for each taco! SCORE. I guess I recommend going those hours? lolol 

Okay, it's past def past bedtime and silly me couldn't even read the menu. Yup, the struggle is real. Of course I was looking for 'Al Pastor' on the menu and it was the first thing on there, up top. lol. Taco guy understood that I wanted Al Pastor and started cranking them out in front of me. V cool. I noticed (yes even drunk) that he put some meat on the tortilla in the beginning and flipped it, toasting the meat with the tortilla before flipping it again. #texture. #yas. He put more Al Pastor meat and then some standard cilantro and onions. Noms. 

We also got some lengua and asada tacos. Lengua was sooo tender and so juicy. Asada ones wee also stellar. Personally, however, the Al Pastor ones were my favorite. Lengua a close second! 

Highly recommended for late night cravings!!! Even better than your steak and eggs/ prime rib post-clubbing munchies. Also soo soo close.. Actually a definitely walkable distance from Encore or Surrender!"}
{"text":"WOW. Saw a huge crowd outside this place and decided to check it out the next day. So glad we did. Came around 5pm on a Monday and there were no lines. Got the carne asada, abogada, tripa, suadero. We got 5 tacos, then went back for another 4 within 30 minutes. TBH.. I don't remember which is which, but those are some BOMB-ASS tacos. Ask them for the grilled veggies, it's free and so good together. Really a must after all that partying."}
{"text":"I trusted the reviews from others to come get some tacos. The tacos are delicious and authentic. There might be a bit of a line... but well worth it! Bonus: pricing is super!!!m

Recommendations: 
Tacos carne asada & al pastor"}
{"text":"This place is actually a welcoming addition to the Las Vegas strip, to stay the least... This place is nearly
Always crowded at literally all hours of the day but the tacos and fries are ridiculously good. The carne asada is legit, al pastor is awesome and the adobada is off the charts. The tacos are great but the adobada fries are well worth several return visits. This is my go to late night Mexican spot in Vegas and it being within close walking distance to the Wynn and Encore make it a must visit each time I'm in town. 

Legit-
Great tacos 
Nice meat selection 
Friendly staff 
Adobada fries 
Large portions 
Walking distance to Encore 

Meh-
Really crowded 
Long waits
Very messy and likely not all that sanitary"}
{"text":"I cannot stress enough how amazing this place is. The spicy pork taco was our absolute favorite, and when I say favorite, I mean we stayed in Vegas for four full days and went to this hole in the wall place four separate times for their tacos. We had dinner at really nice places and paid $200 for our meal, and this place outshines all other food on the strip at $2 a taco. I mean it. Go here. I am never going to be happy with another taco once I leave here. Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Cash and card accepted. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Tacos el Gordo is behind Encore in/near the same plaza with the Kimchi Korean BBQ restaurant (lots of parking lot parking). This place is amazing and super affordable. If you want to eat here try to go during the day because the line is ridiculous at night once people start going out and partying. 

Once you enter the restaurant there are different lines to form depending on the type of meats you want and if you want to order fries. It's a little confusing but looks for the signs above the cook stations windows that list the types of things you can order. Once you order go to one of the cashiers and pay. When your food is ready the cooks will yell out your order."}
{"text":"Damn. Did I wake up in Tijuana? It doesn't get more authentic than this. I found this spot by walking to Los Tacos and noticed that it looked a little busier than usual so looking around I spotted this place about 30 feet away so I decided to head over there. As I walk towards the entrance I have a young kid trying to sell me bracelets that I see in Tijuana, okay check. I walk in to the restaurant blaring mariachi music - check. The guys behind the meat speak to me in nothing but Spanish - check. That red pork or whatever meat it is, on the right closest to the door with that green creamy sauce had me speaking Spanish in 3 seconds flat. 

Damn, good."}
{"text":"TACOS EL GORDO.  : DEM FAT TACOS

This was one highlight of my vegas trip LOL

I ate at this joint one hour before day 2 of electric daisy carnival..  Stupid idea, but amazing food. 

The breakdown:

40 minutes to get our food in the most hectic line I've ever seen.. 

$10: Campechano fries - Adobada y Carne asada on top of fries topped with cheese & guac. (Spicy pork and Steak)
$2.25 each: 3 Tacos de Lengua. (tongue)
$2.00 each: 3 Tacos de Tripa (Tripe)
$2.00 each: 3 Tacos de Adobada (spicy pork)

Every taco was off the hookk, especially the Campechano fries.  
Also the drinks were awesome, I've never had horchata like that.

If I'm back in vegas, this will be one of my first stops"}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I have ever eaten. Don't look for anything fancy, just awesome food for a great price. $12 for both my wife and I, we were full as a tick."}
{"text":"Delectable, fatty, smokey ingredients wrapped in greasy, hot tortillas.  Tasty tasty stuff my friends.

Now for the wait...it's a nightmare, especially when you're hung the f**k over and need to get it in ASAP.  So, it's ill advised that you go here after a night of drinking unless you have the capacity to wait about half an hour in line.  

Separate lines for different meats/ organs.  our friend tells us its the most genuine replication of tijuana style tacos.  Whatever this is, it's f**kn delicious.  

4 1/2 stars.  Product is solid 5 but the wait is unbearable."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Best tacos in Vegas!! I highly recommend everyone trying it out..the meat is delicious, I recommend the adobada meat you will not regret it! There is always a line but it moves pretty fast and the workers are very nice and they work hard to serve everyone as fast as they can. They give you what you order as soon as you place your order. I am definitely coming back tomorrow to take some on the go!! Love this place, check them out"}
{"text":"Sorry but I am not a fan! I heard so many great things about el Gordon but no way Jose... taqueria back home in OC!! I got the adobado fries, carne fries, al Pasteur, and cabeza tacos. Nothing impressed me at all. Everything was bland!!! The Horchata there was the worst of them all! It came from the soda fountain!!!! It did not taste authentic at all... I was drunk as hell coming from encore beach club and the food made me sober up real quick! I needed something good to eat!! Glad I got this off my bucket list."}
{"text":"I tried this place based on other yelp reviews and I am glad I did! In a strip mall just past the Wynn Hotel, it is easily missed as somewhere to try but, stop in and try their food. $2.00 street style taco's so full of meat. We tried the carne asada and the spicy pork, both were so flavorful. We also ordered the carne asada fries, man this could feed a whole family. $10.00 but worth it. You will be sharing. Fresh food, made on the spot. Friendly, friendly service! It is seems to always be busy but the lines move very quickly so don't let the crowd deter you. Everything had so much flavor!"}
{"text":"Seriously awesome Mexican fast food. Try the spicy pork vampiro (sp?)  

The wife totally dug the tongue. Neither of us were brave enough to order the brain. 

As well as your typical Coca-cola/Fanta soda well. They also had well drink dispenser serving orchata, tamarind, sorrel and others. 

Definitely one of the best places to eat in Vegas. Close to the strip. Near Stratosphere, Circus, and Riviera casinos"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Even as a novice the ordering was easy, staff was nice, and the food was wonderful! Definitely worth the walk if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Carne asada tacos are the best!!! Pastor wasn't bad... had a little kick... for $2.95 each you can't go wrong!!! Open late, reasonable prices, delicious tacos! You can't go wrong with this spot!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Tacos El Gordo so I was super excited to try their famous tacos. I wanted to try the al pastor, carne asada, and lengua tacos, which had their own separate lines so I had to line up three times but it wasn't too bad since it wasn't crowded at the time.

Al Pastor (3/5): it's definitely a unique type of al pastor taco, interesting sauce but I prefer a more simple style.

Carne Asada (2/5): the meat wasn't very flavorful, and the guacamole sour cream sauce overpowered everything in a bad way.

Lengua (4/5): surprisingly this was my favorite taco of the three, the meat was nice and tender and I enjoyed the salsa.

Overall I think Tacos El Gordo is a little overhyped. For $2.50 a taco it's not really worth it unless you can't find any other taco place around at the time. All the employees were friendly though."}
{"text":"Muy ricos tacos Los recomiendo cada vez, Que vengo alas vagas , me gusta venir aqui!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the second time over the weekend and it's still as great as the first time. It was my boyfriends first time coming and he really enjoyed it. We got there around noon and waited about 20 mins in line. We didn't mind the wait because we knew what to expect. The line situation is a little inconvenient because you have to be in a certain line for the kind of meat you want, but since there was two of us we just split up and ordered for each other. The tacos were amazing especially the al pastor. We also got some quesadillas which were EXTRA delicious!!! Wish we had a place like this at home!"}
{"text":"Very good tacos! You line up according to what type of meat you're going to order so that really helps with traffic. I ordered asada and al pastor. They tip off the tacos with salsas and onion. So delicious. Pricing was decent and the tacos were nice and big. There was a lot of meat in them so you won't stay hungry."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some good mexican food. I wanted to try something new. I looked on yelp and this place came up as the top rated mexican resturants in Las Vegas, Nv. 

I took a little drive to Dowtown to check it out.

I drove there and got online. once I got inside there were several lines going to the counter area. You need to see a small sign indicating what station it serves, for instance the carne asada tacos are in one line and the pork tacos are in another. 

It was really packed inside and the lines were long. Once I got my tacos it was all worth it.

I had 6 carne asada tacos (they are small) and they load them up with qacamole, cilantro and onions. Make sure you ask for the jalapeño and onion side.

I will be back here, Fyi there is another location on the strip, however the lines there are huge.

Down fall is they need to move the fountain drinks to a different location. They keep them in a tiny corner next to the kitchen door. It got really packed in there and I had to wait a while for people to get out of the tiny corner."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a long time but I was never up for waiting in their long lines. My friend wanted to eat here for his' birthday so I made my way over. I believe the wait was almost one hour on a Saturday's night. 

I think someone needs to come up with a better system. I had to stand in three different lines and that didn't include the line to pay. If they can't change the system, you got to change your game plan. You just need to remember to bring three friends, at least, with you so everyone can be in different ordering lines.  

After all that, this is one of the best al pastor tacos, I have ever had. Don't forget to have them cut a piece of pineapple with your tacos. The combo of the two is delicious. I have been cravings for one or ten for months now."}
{"text":"Yummy food and good quick service. They just need a liquor license. A cold beer with spicy tacos seems important :)"}
{"text":"Tony The Tiger.. GGRRREAT!!! I will go back!"}
{"text":"Where else can you order brains? Delicious. Tripe was delicious!

Come on it was beautiful, textural heaven in my mouth. I watched a video on youtube about labiaplasty (come on we all end up on parts of youtube where we ask ourselves, \"How did I get here?\") had the tripe and it was nice. If it was chewy it would be hard to eat after watching labiaplasty, I'm just saying."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! The prices are reasonable for the quality and size of them. The carne asada was overcooked and burnt but the al pastor was amazing. It's always packed, so expect a wait. These tacos are similar to the ones in Tijuana and the handmade tortillas are delicious. 
Definitely worth the visit! It's 15 min away from the MGM, it's located in old town Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here I had A taco and 1/2 of Asada fries they were not good, wouldn't came back. I been to better places were they have delicious tacos and asada fries. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS."}
{"text":"Tacos adobadas. I mean Tacos a la badass!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food.  The atmosphere is an experience!  Don't miss this if you like great food and prefer authentic!"}
{"text":"Taco was pretty good. Only beef and pork elmost every part of the pig.  Prices were good and the line was not very long. The menu really does not explain whats all on each Taco."}
{"text":"Hungry? Or Hungover? Looking for a cheap meal ? This is the place to be !!

This place is always busy but the lines move very quickly. There are SEPARATE lines for different cuts of meats. Read the signs before you wait in line! Bring a few friends to divide & conquer to try them all ! Fresh tacos made quickly in front of you. If you don't want a taco they do offer quesadillas, nacho fries, and tostadas. After you grab your food walk past the soda machines to the counter to pay. 

Must order adobada (spicy pork) & lengua (beef tongue) tacos !

The adobada is carved off a huge slab of pork on the shawarma grill. Each bite was so tasty with the green guacamole cilantro sauce ! Remember to ask for pineapples on top! The lengua is very soft and tasty! You can also ask for a plate of green onions and peppers. (My bf loves this). If you are thirsty and taking a break from alcohol grab some horchata ! 

I'll definitely be back for the yummy tacos! They have a parking lot here if you are too lazy or tired to walk !"}
{"text":"The only thing that would make Tacos El Gordo better is if they served beer. Luckily you can grab one across the parking lot. 

We ordered 9 steak tacos & I'm ready to die of happiness. I can't wait to go back & try the adobada tacos & fries."}
{"text":"The food is good but not the same as the original location in TJ. What I was really amazed by was the prices though, I don't think it's worth eating here for the prices they charge for a taco, come on people it's not a 5 star restaurant plus there no one that waits on you."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST Mexican food I've ever had in my life (coming from Alaska). Worth the aching walk from the Venetian lol. I'll always make a stop when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome real Mex tacos Everything Made and chopped right infront of you. The only HuGe negative is the Line for ordering the most popular items have one guy handling all orders besides that great food"}
{"text":"I would take this place over any other Mexican place on the strip (we had a gross experience at El Segundo 2 days prior). Really great tacos, service, and price to match. Love the spicy pork taco. We eat a lot of great Mexican Food in Atlanta and I would definitely recommend to anyone going to Vegas."}
{"text":"This was insanely delicous. I wanna live in Las vegas just so I can come here everyday.  The food is very authntic and delicous. Prices are good, and  I actually like their system of getting the food first then paying for it."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos and asada fries very friendly people very good price considering its on the strip will come back for more every time I visit!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Tacos, Burritos, & Carne fries @ good prices! Wide selection  of meat options...
 I like to try a variety entrées when i go to a new establishment,  I never tried sesos until picking random items off their menu,   then i learned a new Spanish word \"sesos\"... oO"}
{"text":"This is my hubby's favorite taco place and avoiding the strip's location is probably the best since it could be an hour or two wait. We tried probably everything on the menu since we've been going for a few years now. I never ever posted a review and I should have sooner. I love this location because you have plenty of seating. They have one side where you order, another side which has a lot of tables and booths plus outdoor seating! If you want to enjoy your Tacos happily with no hassle to ever find a place to sit, sacrifice a few more dollars just for an Uber/Lyft ride to this location. I know a lot of people travel to enjoy food and have fun. So my travel foodies, go to this location! :) The best thing they have is probably the pastor (hand carved in front of you). I'm making this review on behalf of my hubby too lol. He always orders Adobada Fries. Sometimes half adobada and half asada. I am the buche and the seso type person. It might sound scary to some but that's some good sh****! LOL! Best sesos Tacos I've had! The fries are always golden brown and delicious. You can always ask for sauce on the side of you don't want it on your tacos. They have grilled onions and jalapeños for you to enjoy with it. You just have to ask for it. You should! I love it! Nothing better then a kick with every bite of your food. Happy eating my fellow foodies!!"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time after the Dayclub, but coming back here, idk if they're 4-5 stars anymore :(
First of all, the lines are so confusing. They divided up into what type of meat you want to order I.e if you want Asada and Al Pastor, you have to wait in one line and then get into another line. So come with your friends if you want different types of meat. In addition, you have to go to the further right line to pick up your fries (if you order fries).
I'm glad we beat the rush (we got there around 1pm on a Saturday). When I got to the line it was just outside the doors. After 30minutes to just order and pay for the food, the line was buff.

Food: I love that they make their own tortillas. The Asada was okay. It tasted on the dry side. And the fries were stale... I was disappointed :("}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. They act like they're doing you a favor. Good tacos. But the Mexican lady at the register will only give you one small cup of salsa at a time. Wants you to keep on coming back. As needed. I offered to pay her for them. And she refused to give me two. 
I won't be back
I will keep on going to Taco y Taco which is better and they have a full bar"}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst possible service at a restaurant. Clueless waitresses and horrible service. It took them 30 mins to tell us that they were out of tequila. 40 mins to get the food and order that was mixed up and a few that were missed."}
{"text":"Variety choices of meat. Three different stations to order by meat. Love their fries. Very clean and nice people. I would come back for sure"}
{"text":"Easy to rate this place. Out of this country tacos. This place is good is better than good. I love the fact that they are quick and it's always packed. Staff in the kitchen is friendly but the cashiers are short overall great food suadero tacos vampiros And mulas are the thing to get, asada tacos are super bomb."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure what the hype is about this place, or maybe my boyfriend and I are just accustomed Los Angeles tacos...or maybe this is just a tourist spot?

I'm not a meat eater so the only vegetarian friendly item on the menu was a quesadilla. My boyfriend ordered carne aside tacos. My quesadilla was literally the size of my palm, with just 2 slices on cheese on a extra small flour tortilla folded in half. They wouldn't put anything in it when I asked, which was okay because I thought that I could at least put some Pico de Gallo on the quesadilla or hot sauce...nope. They did not have a hot sauce bar, or even Pico de Gallo, which I found extremely odd. They did however give me chopped cilantro and chopped onion in a container. My boyfriend's meat had a ton of tendons, and was incredibly small with nothing else on it."}
{"text":"Food is pretty solid, although the surrounding area is pretty ghetto.  There's a good reason a security guard is on the premise at all times!  They close at 2AM so come in for late night eats.

Sopas (Al Pastor) $4-Slightly above average- The Sopas here is 10x better than anything I've had in So Cal.  It's overflowing up w/ meat, covering the entire corn base.  It's also loaded w/ veggies, sauce, guac, and covered w/ a hard shell on top (I didn't care for the hard shell, I actually removed it when I ate it).  While expensive, I highly recommend it.  My only gripe was the Al Pastor was very sweet.

Sopas (Carne Asada) $4-Exceptional-Same as above, except the carne asada is cooked to perfection.

Tacos (Carne Asada) $2-Slightly above average.  Again, the tacos here are much better than what I've had in Cali.  The sauce on the tacos really give it a great taste.  I'm used to \"Cali\" tacos which only have onions & cilantro.  Carne asada here is pretty good.

Tacos (Al Pastor) $2-Average - Same as above, except the al pastor was way too sweet.

Carne Asada Fries $10 - Slightly above average- I think the fries are pretty good but nothing to write home about.  If you are sharing w/ a group of people I'd go for it, otherwise you are OK passing on it.

Tips:
-Area is pretty ghetto at night, but there's a security guard there
-Restaurant is pretty clean
-The Carne Asada here is exceptional, but the al pastor is very sweet (but still good nonetheless)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco joints.  The inside is split into 4 sections in terms of what you want to order.  If you want pork, you get in the \"pork\" line.  If you want asada (beef), you get in the asada line, etc.  There's also a miscellaneous line for stuff like pork brains/etc.  As such, if you want multiple things you have to go to multiple lines! =(

After you collect your food, you pay at the counter.  

Beef Tongue Sopes - $4.50 - Awesome 4/5
The sopes tasted awesome.  The beef tongue is super tender and soft.  The sopes was tasty and one of my favorites.

Adobada (Spicy Pork) Tacos - $2.50 Each - Solid
Also solid.  The adobada (aka spicy pork) tacos are super good.  You won't regret it if you order it.

TIPS:
-Ordering for the first time is very confusing!
-Inside is pretty spacious/clean"}
{"text":"Was a must try from what everyone has said but was not impressed. Long wait for cold tacos that lacked flavor"}
{"text":"Adobado pork tacos were bomb! They make everything fresh in front of you. Kind of a hole in the wall off of the strip but well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! If you want really good Mexican food go there. Tortillas are handmade and honestly that is the best tortillas for tacos. And their asada fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"The adobada fries are so good! This is one of my favorite Mexican places in San Diego and I was so excited to have it in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't get all the hype. Authentic tacos ...I DON'T THINK SO. . Food was mediocre at best.  Carne Asada was fatty and chewy...al pastor was dry with no flavor and the chorizo was average..If you're looking for Great tacos in Vegas you should  try  (Frijoles and Frescas).. Unfortunately we will not return to tacos El Gordo"}
{"text":"I got hooked on Carne Asada tacos while living in San Diego many years ago.  Outside of California, it can be difficult to find authentic mexican tacos.  We ordered the Campechana fries which consists of carnea asada and spicy pork.  The meal was enough for two people and for $13, that's a steal on the strip.  Ordering can be hectic as there are multiple lines and you have to pay attention to which line you're in.  You can't order carne asada from every line.  Also the seating arrangement can be a headache too.  The place is small on the inside so all of the tables are side by side except the ones along the wall.  You may end up sitting and eating next to somoene while at the same time bumping elbows.  Everyone was pleasant when I was there, lets hope the same for you since you're nearly sitting in each other's lap. Expect a long line if you go during lunch like we did.  They even had \"security guards\" letting so many people in the building at a given time.  From the time we arrived to finally sitting down and eating was a little over an hour.  Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of tacos in my life and I can say without a doubt these are the best tacos on the planet.  My favorite is the pork adobada but all of it is amazing."}
{"text":"Did you know you can visit Mexico right smack in the heart of Vegas? Better brush up on that Spanish, else you might be in for quite a bit of \"I want that\" pointing to the workers who barely speak a lick of English.

Most people come here for the spicy adobada, but my favorite is the lengua tacos--the fattest, juiciest lengua tacos ever. You can also request grilled jalapenos and green onions at no charge.

The set up is a bit confusing if you've never been. There's a separate line for each type of meat. The lengua/cabeza is all the way to the right, the adobada is the long line you see, and the asada is to the left. You order, then bring your order to the cashiers to pay.

Open until the wee hours because you know you're going to need drunk food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best, close to authentic Mexican food, you can get in Las Vegas !! Amazing food ! So sad they closed down the Las Vegas Blvd location."}
{"text":"If your looking for some authentic tacos, this is the place to go. They cook all their tortillas fresh right in front of you. Each taco is $2 which isn't bad. And if your feeling adventurous go for the lengua tacos."}
{"text":"Ive tried to write this review several times, but I end up writing my
first sentence , stopping ,heading there, eating some mulas, tacos and
quesadillas, get so full that when I come back I cant even write my
name. It is that good, or im a fatty mcpherson.I would like to believe
it's the 1st.

Yes it looks sketchy, yes its right next to the wynn in a weird plaza, or on a not that nice of a part on charleston blvd,
yes you will have to walk a little far if you are staying at caesars
or mandalay , but it totally worth it. The adobada meat, the carne
asada, mulas tacos, quesadillas(real ones) are the real deal; Full of
flavor , and  authenticity.

Sometimes there might be a line but goes pretty fast. If you got at
\"damn im drunk and need to eat something right now\" time of the day,
which is after midnight, you might encounter  this said line to be a
little bigger. Fear not..95 percent of the time, it goes quick and
there is plenty of seats."}

Walking in you may ask yourself, what line for what? I admit if I had not learned Spanish through Rosetta Stone I'd be tornadoing in confusion. But take your time to google the meats before you choose your lines and you will be fine!

The taco dilemma was in full effect here. What combination plate should I create?

My Taco Creation

(2) Asada: The asada was nice. It wasn't full of fatty pieces nor was it over salty. You can taste a bite and feel like you're in your mothers vecindario. 4.25/5

(1) Lengua: I always need that tongue action and Tacos El Gordo gave it to me nicely. Soft and chewy and flavorful, no fault here. 4.25/5

(1) Al Pastor: Would of been 2 but someone drunk dropped one. My favorite out of them all. The meat was marinated to perfection. 4.75/5

(1) Asada Sope: This was okay, sope ingredients were eh. 3/5

Tortillas: Not handmade but it's a street taco not a mercado taco. Fits the schema well. 

Customer Service was Mexican fast paced, meaning no smiles, just order and keep it moving, except for the cashier (;

Tacos are made to be eaten here. It's quite that simple."}
{"text":"I walk in on a warm Summer Tuesday night at 11:30pm and look at the ridiculous set up of different lines for different meats and I and many others are overwhelmed.  It takes an hour to finally get to the counter and get my food. The tacos de adobada (al pastor) are nothing to write home about and much less spend an hour in line for. They were OK. If you think these tacos are 100% authentic tacos al pastor or arabe or adobada.....whatever you want to call them. You have not tried 100% authentic street style tacos. Even L.A.'s famed King Taco blows this place out of the water. Not worth it. P.S. I saw many people ordering food and not paying for it."}
{"text":"This place is now a must every time I visit Vegas. $2 each for all that good stuff?! So worth it! This weekend was my first time and I had little expectations. It was confusing at first, but I got the hang of it. Each line has it's own meat, so pay attention to the signs. After a night of clubbing, it was crazy packed but moved fairly quickly. I loved it so much, I got some more the next night. Can't wait to make another visit, with a Fat Tuesday to accompany my meal."}
{"text":"Well, it is what it is.  If you want those little tacos with sizzling meat slabbed on as it's grilling, topped with veggies, pico de gallo, and other sauces all in about 10 seconds flat, tasting all delish with proper grilled taste, this is the place to go.  It's a close facsimile of El Taorina, except I think it's better.  

Line doesn't move terribly fast but once you get up to order it goes quickly.  Then you line up at the pay line and that can take a bit also, but all in all not a bad wait overall.  I guess it all depends on when you go, and if there are 15-20 people in line I can see it taking a bit of time before you sit down to eat.  As it was for us, there were only couple of tables open as we were cashing out but we only spent total of less than 10 minutes through the entire process.  That's pretty good for that level of busy-ness, I think.

The Asada and Adobada were both very good, but the the spicy adobada took the cake.  Outstanding stuff.  $2 each, thinking 3 will be enough for most, maybe 4, so not a bad price for lunch and definite bargain for dinner.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Well, it is a fast-food type of place so it's certainly fine, but you'll have a hard time feeling good about taking a whole table all by yourself with all those people waiting...  Take it to go."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We waited 20 minutes for the place to open. But when they did, none of the food was ready!! Hello, you got customers waiting outside!! Might have been a good idea to prepare the meat ahead of time!!!!"}
{"text":"*Thumbs up*
\"Tres tacos de adobada, por favor.\" Thats all you need to know. I love the color, the flavor, and the spicy kick from the pork -- a variation of al pastor, but better. The carne asada is okay, but boring. The lengua is also a standout. Wallet-friendly prices, which is such a welcome relief in Vegas and on the Strip -- especially if you're dirt frickin' poor from losing all your money gambling.

*Thumbs down*
First time stepping in, it can get a bit confusing on where to order. There are supposed to be different stations for each type of taco, but just brush up on your Spanish and go loco. Just look for the big, rotating juicy pile of meat and order there."}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap lunch at the older end of The Strip, I stumbled across this place, knowing nothing about it. I could tell the minute I walked in, the place was authentic. Smoke and steam and yelling and people of all stripes waiting in line. It took me a few minutes to figure out the system of waiting in line according to what meat you want, and then paying for your meal at a separate counter. I was not daring enough to try some of the more exotic meats, so I went for the adobada (spiced pork). Waiting for my turn I got to watch several orders of these tacos get made. They have layers of marinated pork turning on a vertical rotisserie that is first skewered with whole pineapples. As the meat turns and heats, all that juice saturates the pork. The guy making the tacos would take a long knife and just carve down the face of the turning meat, getting enough shavings for one taco. Really fun to watch. I got two and found a place to sit in their outside tent. They were the best tacos I have ever tasted. I don't know if they're the best out there, but not being from the southwest or California, they opened up a whole new world for me. I immediately got back in line for two more."}
{"text":"Great spot to visit off the strip! I ordered the Taco de Asada and it was really good and the meat was tender. 

BE SURE TO ORDER THE HORCHATA! It's really good even though it comes out of a vending machine. There is also a side condiment bar with limes, sauces and radishes which was surprising. 

Overall good experience and I'm not surprised this place was featured on Buzzfeed"}
{"text":"The place can get crammed with people but the wait is worth it. Easily up there with some of my favorite al pastor spots in CA. And it's always a plus when they don't charge extra for guacamole like most places do. The pastor was flavorful and plenty juicy. The salsa was great too, had some kick but won't set your mouth on fire. This will be my go-to spot for tacos next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I feel really bad giving this rating, but if I could I would give this place a 0 star rating...Their tacos are drenched in oil and sit in the fat as it cooks. I have no idea why everyone gave it such a high rating...I have never had such bad tacos. Their service if anything was nice, but that's about it. Do not come here unless you like to eat oil and meat."}
{"text":"I really hate visiting Las vegas, but tacos el Gordo makes it worthwhile. This food is legit, and it isn't horrendously overpriced like everything else on the strip. I eat here when I am in San Diego as well. The spicy pork is one of a kind. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"What a great place to get some food when you are hungover and need some greasy tacos to ease that headache. Some things are great about this place and others that I could pass on.

The place was packed with people so there is a little of a wait for the tacos. There are multiple lines that you order from and only make a specific taco (ie: one line for carne asada tacos, one line for lengua and cabeza tacos, another line for adobado tacos, another for chorizo, etc). So if you want to try different types of tacos you pretty much have to stand in 3-4 different lines. The best way to get a variety of tacos to try here at an efficient rate is to come in a group of 5 and divide and conquer. I spent most of the time standing in line and trying to figure out a more efficient way of running the place instead of standing in multiple lines. You pay afterwards at the two different cash registers when you've picked up all of your food.

The best taco was the Adobado (sp?) - spicy pork. Loved it. So tasty and the sauce goes really well with it. The adobado quesadilla was great too. 

Carne asada was okay but a little tough. I had it with some fries which made it pretty good.

The lengua was okay and it was all right with the fries we ordered. 

The pork shoulder was dry and tough. I would pass on it the next time.

So all in all, the spicy pork is the one meat that I would come back here to eat. Props to the place for  having orange bang and all of the other fresca flavors. Free refills too! Great to have on a hot day in Vegas.

Seating is limited because there are only so many tables. If you're willing to sit outside in the heat, there is a tented area that has some additional seating."}
{"text":"This place seemed pretty good at first but after I got really bad food poisoning I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND to go there because it was really bad experience never again  I'll go again worst time ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}

{"text":"I've been to Tacos El Gordo multiple times on my last few trips to Vegas, and they continue to remain my favorite taco stop around.  They get everything right:

- Street tacos
- cheap price ($2 - $5 a taco)
- fantastic \"toppings\"
- variety of meats from beef tongue to pastor, chorizo, asada, etc
- prompt and polite service
- on the strip, just a block down from Encore

The tacos here are delicious, miles better than anything I've had back in the Midwest or anywhere else for that matter, and considering El Gordo is only in a few cities it's worth the pilgrimage just for these alone.  My favorite is the El Pastor tacos, with the meat shaved off fresh right in front of you, and some mixture of green toppings that sends the senses into a warm embrace.

Warning - this place gets busy at night, so be ready for lines if that's when you arrive.  But they're open late (we've been at 3am before and during the day), so added bonus if you're having a night out on the town and need an after party spot.  Thankfully the line moves extremely fast, and you will walk away ready to plan your next trip.

Don't skip this one"}
{"text":"Terrific, Authentic mexican street food served fast and deliciously tasty. The beauty of this place is the simplicity of their setup. Cafeteria style with employees cooking right in front of you and ordering in a fast paced line. Lots of selections to choose from, varieties of tacos, quesadillas, sopas and more. Go here and youll never regret it."}
{"text":"Want some real authentic Mexican tacos go eat here! They were delicious. I really enjoyed the asada tacos the meat was very flavorful. The only complaint I have is the customer service. We wanted our mula cut in half and they didn't want to. Also we had to ask for the chiles asados too and they only give you one wth a couple of grilled onions. But over all very delicious."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I love this place and I visit it every chance I get....however....
I/we stopped by today for a quick biz lunch...all good till we tasted the food! salty beyond belief!..unadible,I though its was just the abodobo tacos so we ordered a few more in carne asada----Same thing!
Come on guys, get with the program, there is no excuse for this and no need to piss off loyal customers."}
{"text":"1st impression of the place was it looked dirty. I got in a huge line and had my whole order ready mentally when my turn came. Only then I had figured you had to go to different lines to order  what I specifically wanted(3 total lines). After an hour of waiting I finally had everything I wanted, so I looked around to find the cashiers and saw them located at the exit with another line... Being annoyed at all this waiting I was paying for my food and the female cashier was being rude and unprofessional... All in all the food was meh... at BEST. Do not, and I repeat do not, expect this place to be good just because of the huge lines. Looks can be deceiving."}
{"text":"HOLY GUACAMOLE! I was hungry after a night of clubbing, and I asked the uber driver to take me somewhere where it was opened and somewhat decent. He took me here. Best fcuking decision ever! Can'y recall if I was sober or drunk, but I know I stood in line twice to get seconds. ^_^ Just be prepared to stand in line. And it's Vegas. Get with it."}
{"text":"Lines can get long, prices for a small taco is up there at $2+, but this place is totally still worth it!

If you're a newbie, I would highly suggest the adobada taco!

It's located on the northern side of the strip closer to Circus Circus and the Wynn."}
{"text":"Overall: Tacos El Gordo is overhyped. Definitely stop by if you're on the strip and you want a quick, cheap bite. Otherwise, there are better places to eat.

Food: 3

I ordered a taco de cabeza, lengua, and suadero. I was not a fan of the suadero because the meat is a little stringy, but the cabeza and lengua were tender. The corn tortilla was too soft and falling apart.

In respect to other eateries on the strip, you can't get much cheaper than Tacos El Gordo. But if you have time, off strip food is way cheaper and tastier. Plus, if you come from a place with an abundance of Mexican food like me, you're better off waiting until you get home where a taco is half the price and at least as tasty.

Service: 4

Tacos El Gordo has an interesting concept for ordering. There are signs pointing to where you should line up depending on what you want. Once you have your food, you go to the front counter to pay.

The lines weren't too long when I came because it was a weekday night, but I'm sure it moves fast even if it were long. The cooks work at a rapid pace.

Ambiance: 4

The restaurant is decently clean and well-lit, and there's plenty of tables to choose from. Parking doesn't seem too bad."}
{"text":"This is my first trip to Vegas. On the shuttle to my hotel, I heard a guy say that they had the best tacos in town. Naturally, my curiosity was immediately piqued. I walked by a couple of times and today I decided to give them a shot. I walked in and it was PACKED almost out the doors. I ordered the adobada tacos"}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is BEYOND fire. I always only get their al pastor tacos and the green creamy sauce in combination with the spicy salsa is everything! Best tacos in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Always the spot to hit no matter what time of day! Friendly staff and good ol' comfort food to put a smile on anyone's face no matter the night you've had!"}
{"text":"These are some of the best street tacos I've ever had. Always a popular spot on the strip, so be prepared to wait if you are there are peak hours! The Carne Asada tacos are to die for. If you want real authentic Mexican street tacos, this is the place to go. You order and they cook it right in front of you. ABSOLUTELY DELISH!"}
{"text":"The tacos are unquestionably some of the best I've ever had in my life. That is without a doubt. 

The downsides to Tacos El Gordo:
It is one of the worst lines systems in the world. As far as efficiency, it's the worst. Combine that with cramming people on every side, and it really begins to get on your nerves when you're hungry.
Also, as far as me, everyone speaking in a language I don't understand makes things difficult.

With all of that being said.........those al pastor tacos...ask for pina (pineapple), and man are they to die for."}
{"text":"For cheap tacos, these are quite good. The lines can be pretty long but you have a choice of beef, tongue, carne asada, adobado, and quesadillas. Each comes with cilantro and a special sauce that might literally be to die for. If you're in Las Vegas and looking for a quick bite or drunk food then this would be the right place! Only about a $6 Uber from most of the hotels on the Strip."}
{"text":"Great tacos, hopes, burritos and other stuff. No beans and rice, just taco. Roach coach style food in a restaurant. Be ready to wait in line but worth the wait. We go once a year for a week and eat here at least 3 times. Delicious food. 
  HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"This place would refuse to give me any sauce the cashier was so rude i regret paying for the tacos i had. The worse place in vegas for real."}
{"text":"I had their spicy pork tacos. Every other bite had chunks of fat that I didn't care for. It's ok."}
{"text":"when i heard they were going to shut down taco el gordo, i panicked and cried and panicked some more.  this place is located right on the strip, and its honestly one of the best drunk foods to get your hands on.  I AM SO GLAD THEY BROUGHT THIS STORE BACK!!!!!  Sometimes, i plan my hotels located nearby taco el gordo.

if you don't like taco el gordo, you're not human. 
there is a reason this place is always packed, ans rightfully so.  

the different types of lines and meats and items you can get will be confusing for new comers, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be a taco pro.

the food is really fresh here and the service is friendly and they try and work as fast as they can to accommodate everyone.  

as for the drinks, make sure you get yourself a cup of orange bang to wash everything down."}
{"text":"I don't see what everyone is talking about!  First off their ordering system sucks! You have to wait in three different lines depending on which meats you want. By the time you get your food from one line and have to order in the other your food is cold.  Then you still have to wait in another line to pay. Second, they use chuck steak!  A carne asada taco consists of flap skirt/Ranchera meat.  Third, the al pastor tasted like a piece of sweet thanksgiving ham and they smothered it with a green moco looking sauce. Fourth, the lengua was kept in a boiling pot of lard.  Lengua is boiled then kept steamed, not kept warm in lard.  The tripas tasted like they were not clean and when I asked if they were crispy he said, \"yes\", but were soggy.  The cabeza was also kept in the lard to keep warm.  I know mexican and this was not!  I come from Guadalajara where the street tacos are amazing and when I seen they had \"Vampiros\" I was super excited. Until they came out.  The cheese was not good and they packed it with a pound of pico de gallo that made what should have been a crispy tostada a soggy tortilla!  Will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"2 Asian girls and 1 white guy...that was my first thought walking into the door of tacos el gordo. I've never felt so out of place before, as we were the only non Mexicans there, but everyone was super nice. The adobada guy even offered us a sample slice. It reminded me a little of Korean spicy pork. I went with an adobada taco, carne asada taco and chorizo sope.
There was an assembly line with the first woman making tortillas by hand. The adobada was everything the yelpers said it was! Spicy, a bit of crispy, and not much fat. I definitely want to get adobada fries next time. 
Carne asada was ok, but not my fav. It was thinly sliced vs chopped like most Mexican places. It was nice and tender with good flavor, which was ruined by the awful pasty guacamole it automatically was topped with. The guac was pretty damn bad. 
Chorizo sope was good, the least greasy chorizo I've ever had with  Mexican white cheese melted on top. The texture was almost like a good mozzarella. I've had better sopes, BUT I've also had worse :)
Neighborhood was way sketchy, but Tacos el gordo was very clean, they had 2 ladies there just bussing the tables so there's quick turn over. Parking lot was well lit so I felt pretty safe there. It was great Mexican but I probably would only go back if I was in the general area. We got stuck in traffic for electric Daisy so it was over a half hour drive from my side of town."}
{"text":"Same great food at cheap prices, and love the new location! Line is a little more chaotic and confused because its mostly tourists not used to the procedure (separate unmarked lines for the desired meat). They don't have chicken for some reason, but I always opt for beef and pork so no matter to me. 

Big issue with seating. The restaurant is half the size of the Charleston location, so there's only a few booths inside. There's a lot of booths outside, but it was raining and windy so we had to eat standing up w our trays on the trash can. The outside booths aren't covered, and someone obviously didn't think it thru - plastic and vinyl booths sitting in 100+ degree desert sun? Nobody will be able to sit there. Looks like they just opened, but they'll have to figure out a solution pretty soon (tent like at playgrounds?)."}
{"text":"Best carne asada tacos I've ever had in the US restaurant! Can you guys open a location in Phoenix, AZ! Guacamole is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas. This place is always packed and I can't get enough of their tacos al pastor. I really enjoyed there buche tacos and for the affordable price of $2 you can get a full meal for the entire family for under $30 which is a deal to me in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Strayed away from the convention center and big name palatial casinos to take a break from all the overpriced nonsense and corporate types.  I felt comfortable at Tacos El Gordo, the service was fast, and the steak and spicy pork tacos were excellent.  I'm glad I checked this place out and am going to make it a place I come to every time I'm in Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS!!!!
To begin with, it can get very busy, but I believe it is a good food joint if you are craving some Mexican tacos. However, the way it is designed for customers to order their food is different and can be confusing for some. So let me break it down for you, upon walking you may see different lines, you may asked why? Well each line serves different type of meats. So, make sure you read the signs before making line. Also, when you pay, the cashier will be on the back corner. From many taco joints I have been to the price is not bad. The quality of the food is what matters the most and its pretty darn good. Just to make it clear, this was the first time I ever been here, so it's not as bad as other reviewers make it seem. 

TIPS:
IF you do not like waiting, this may not be your place.
IF you like everything to be handed to you THIS may not be your place
(You may have to read some signs inside to make sure you are in the right lane to order)
IF you do not want to be around a lot of people, this may not be your place.
IF you like you do not want to wear nothing, but some jeans on because you feel that you have an Abercrombie model body, THIS MAY NOT BE YOUR PLACE. 

ALL jokes aside, be realistic and try them out. They are worth the try!"}
{"text":"best lengua!

Beef Tounge Tacos to DIE FOR... Best in WEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It has lines depending on what kind of meat you want in your tacos, quesadillas or tostadas.  We ordered carne asada and al pastor tacos.  The carne asada tacos were good, but the al pastor was excellent and they craved the al pastor.  They pile in the meat and you can add onions, cilantro, guacamole and salsa.  You will want more than one taco.  If you are in San Diego or Las Vegas, this is a must go to place for tacos.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"ADOBADO TACOS ALL THE WAY!!!

Friends were raving about this place while we were planning our Vegas trip and I knew we had to stop by. It's soooo worth it! It's located slightly further down the strip in a slightly sketch(ier) neighborhood. We parked at Wynn and walked over. for $2 per taco, not bad! I highly recommend you get the adobado. Don't get anything else, the line takes longer. I'm mesmerized at how they slice the meat off the rack. And don't forget the pineapple!!! So delicious. I also ordered a horchata to top off my meal and was surprised it came out of the soda fountain. 

Will definitely visit again on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"The tacos al pastor are the best I've had outside of Mexico. If you get an order of fries ($2) it is enough for 4 people."}
{"text":"What can I say, they have great food here. My favorite is Carne Asada Fries! The workers are always nice and serve the food quite quickly. Never understood the multiple lines for different meats but it works."}
{"text":"Eran mis tacos favoritos, especially al pastor con la salsa de crema de aguacate fresca pero la carne es la segubda  vez que agarro food poisoning.  Y luego mire  una. Cucaracha"}
{"text":"Holy moly Batman these tacos were off the chain!!!! As a kid i spent a lot of time visiting TJ, and always filled up on tacos.  I would never expect to find them in nevada, so far from the boarder. But this place brougt back all those memories with one bite of a taco adobado.  The tortilla tasted freshly made, the meat was perfect, and the sauce topped it of!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I just found out about this after I've been to Vegas for so many years!  If you're craving some a late snack this is the place to be at. This taco joint has different lines for different types of meat. This place does not serve chicken, only beef and pork.

My friend told me to order some adobada tacos. The line was fairly long but after 30 minutes I was finally able to place my order. I ordered four adobada (marinated pork) tacos. The guy sliced up the juicy meat right in front of me. Once you receive your food, you pay for the food at the cashier on the side.

The tacos were juicy and tasty. When you see meat on a spit, you know the meat is fresh and cooked well. Don't forget to ask for the hot sauce! 

Overall, this place is great. The only down side is the wait. This place is walking distance from Wynn, so expect the place to be packed late night. At two dollars a taco, I couldn't ask for more. You are definitely getting quality meat at this taco joint. Will come back next time I'm in town! BTW, place closes at 5AM on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Initially this place was recommended to me by my cab driver, he said it was the best Mexican food he has ever had. I wasn't looking for anything too crazy just something fill my appetite . I had no crazy expectations for a Mexican restaurant on the strip. i was made a fan after my first bite. this humble little place packed a flavorful punch! the portions were big enough to share and the price was very reasonable. they even had their own hot sauce which i added to everything. all in all great food and friendly service.

I recommend: Asada fries & a Sope!"}
{"text":"Definitely like this location the best out of the 3 in the valley. It can have a long wait time but I think the quality of the food is better then the other 2 locations.  Can't go wrong with the adobada tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is a must-go! The reviews here are no lie. I hear the branch on the Las Vegas strip is better but I was already very impressed by the downtown branch. The tacos here are freshly made, both meat AND tortilla! Average price per taco is about $2.25, which may sound slightly expensive compared to taco trucks in LA, but it's definitely worth it! Each taco contains a LOT of meat. Not only that, but they give a very generous amount of guacamole per taco. All that combined with the rich flavor is reason enough why they're so well known!
Be prepared to wait in line for at least 30-45 minutes though, especially for the Al Pastor. I personally did not try the Al Pastor because the line hadn't moved for a good 15 or so minutes and I was hungry so I will definitely be back to try this in the future! They also have Asada Fries for $13!

My advice: Eat the food you order from here as soon as you get it. It definitely does make a difference when you eat it fresh vs when you pack it up and eat it back at your hotel 15 minutes later!"}
{"text":"Four stars because the workers are rude. Tacos are not anything special. Asada are their best. Probably won't come again."}
{"text":"Eh. Just thinking of this place makes me sad :( So disappointed! I was sooo excited to try this place when I was in Vegas. Saw all the 4 and 5 stat reviews on Yelp and my friends told me this place is a must try!

This place is located on The Strip/sort of near Circus Circus. Man the lines can be crazy long/out the doors and they even have a security guard or whoever directing you where to enter and which line to stand in. Soooo my friend and I stood in the \"asada\" line since we wanted carne asada tacos. Man the wait was sooo long and sooo not worth it. And we ordered like 15 tacos and I'm still sooo sad we ordered 15 tacos and it wasn't even delicious (but of course I still ate it). Anyway, place is busy, and not a lot of seating. Pretty much you stand in line forever, order, and go to the other counter by the exit to pay and then sit down or take the food to go. Oh there's a salsa bar or something too. Overall, eh. I don't recommend this place :( I'll stick with Taco bell lol...k Sad4Lyfe"}
{"text":"Legit Mexican tacos for cheap!!

Don't be overwhelmed by the usual long lines, they move quick! 

Different lines depending on the type of meat. If you're not familiar with a type of meat, ask for a sample! 


Yesss. Just go. It's always a good time for tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place through the mighty powers of Yelp because of it's high ratings. 

Upon walking into the restaurant, the first thing you see is a huge meat pineapple. Seriously! 

The line was pretty long but moved fairly fast. The place was PACKED! Luckily for us, the time we spent in line was spent talking to people around us to find out just what the heck we should order and what the heck the meat pinapple was.

The meat pineapple is pork on a vertical spit with pineapple on top so that the yummy juices drained down onto the meat. Through the other patrons, we found out that if we ordered the Tacos de Adobada we would get to partake of the meat pineapple. We were also advised to order 3, which seemed to be a sufficient amount since they are rather small. I did see several people go back for a second (or third) meal, so if you're hungry you might want to order more. 

I can certainly see going back here as a tradition for our Vegas visits. The food is delicious, and definitely more \"authentic\" than we get in Nashville."}
{"text":"MY MUST STOP BY TAQUERIA WHEN IN DOUBT I'M IN VEGAS. I ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO COME GET MY FIX ON HERE WHILE IN VEGAS. 
They have the best carne & pastor tacos here!!!! let me not forget to mention their carne asada fries!!!! My best friend & I ALWAYS order the carne fries and tacos with carne & pastor. The lines look long as they go out the doors but it goes buy very quickly! Word on the street is that this place is so good/famous because they use pineapple slices in their pastor tacos and the juices from the fruit come dripping down from the top. The carne tacos are loaded with meat, cilantro, onions, and guac. The pastor is loaded with cilantro, onions, pineapple, and this yummy green sauce they have. 
THIS IS A MUST STOP FOR FOODIES, YELPERS, ANYONE WHO ENJOYS FOOD WHILE YOUR OUT IN VEGAS!!! COME & GET YOUR GRUB ON!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPOT!!!! KEEP UP THE GREAT HOSPITALITY & KEEP THE FOOD COMING! def a fan & will be continuing to return to this great spot for your delish food!"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed maybe had to high expectations due to all the good reviews I read, but wasn't impressed.  It was forgettable by all means. Had the Al pastor fries which didn't have a lot of favor."}
{"text":"I can go on for pages about how great these tacos are. And no the alcohol is not an influence. Sober or intoxicated these are THE BEST TACOS IN THE WORLD. Yeah, i said it. No I have not travel the world but nothing will change this claim. Whats my favorite? Try one of everything, I'm sure you cant decide. Tacos are a little more than what you can get in LA but its all worth it. My first time here, I was told to try their Abodabo meat. It reminded me of spicy Korean pork. Which I like but I prefer to stick to  carne asada, buche and tripa. The place is pretty well kept, clean and organized. If ever in Vegas, this is a must!!!!!"}
{"text":"My sister said it best, \"If you love a restaurant and their amazing food, do not go to their bathroom.\"  Accurate AF!!!  

We go out drinking, you know?  And then it pops up in brain.. \"mmm tacos.\"  Normally, my mom is making them and we just go home, but when my mom is too busy to do them, we go for this place.  

They got it all!  Lengua, Buche, Tripas, cachete, Al Pastor, Adobada and of course Carne Asada. Al Pastor fries are the best! I get them with errything!!!  Pineapples too. 

The only bad thing about this place is the bathroom!  Yuck!!!!!! I guess it's supposed to be a single person bathroom because they have a toilet and a stall, but it's all together... no divider, no door that when you peek in the crack, or look at the floor you can see the eyes or the feet of the pooper...  nothing!  And I'm pretty sure it only gets cleaned in the morning cuz by 5pm it looks horrible and unwelcoming.  Long story short: I was afraid to wash my hands.  

Highly recommend taking whippes or moist towelettes or sanitizer. Maybe even a table cloth...

Another bad thing is the tables in between the long ass lines.  It's so uncomfortable having people just stare at you eating and hovering over your food. 

Unless you're like me and I stare right back and chew with my mouth open on purpose till they stop looking at me!

The other bad thing about this place is the \"chusma\" who comes to eat here.  I don't mind people, I really don't, it's just the ones that go to short line (normally the Tripa) and then go ahead and order: Al Pastor, Carne Asada Fries, pineapples, cebollas, mulas, huaraches, tortas, aztecas, HBO Go, Netflix, horchata, tostadas for their entire family...  everything that line is not for!!! the business of course being nice, they go ahead and do it for them, but that's why people keep doing that shit.  If your signs says Tripas, only take trips orders!!!!! Not the entire menu!!!  

Other than that I'd give this place 5 stars. The bathroom drops it to 4. 

Anglos:  this place is safe!  They even have an armed security guard on patrol...  wait... now that I think about...  maybe that means it's not so safe....

Whatever, it's worth the risk...."}
{"text":"I have been there two times now and each time there was a line. But, it's definitely worth it. I wish they had a location in Los Angeles. The pastor tacos are amazing! The adobada fries are just as good. However, I would pass on the carne asada. There's nothing special about it."}
{"text":"It's as good as it is in San Diego! Takes about 45 minutes to get to the front of the line for their Adobada. They actually have Adobada Fries on their menu too! 

The same great service you'd get at the original Tacos El Gordo location on H Street. This place is bigger than the Palm Street location so that's a plus but oh man do they get packed here. 

The Al Pastor/Adobada meat is juicy and tender. The special guacamole sauce is nice and creamy which goes great with their adobada. 

I definitely recommend swinging by if you've never been or if you're just craving some tacos. Tacos El Gordo sets the standard higher than ever when it comes to Tacos and their Adobada Fries."}
{"text":"Worst tacos ever! Not only disgusting but over priced!  never again will I eat there! Btw I tried the alpastor, tripa, cesos, cabeza the only passable ones are the buche."}
{"text":"Let's just say, I am one to rarely wait for food. Like if there's a line and it's gonna take longer than 10 minutes, see ya. If I'm waiting, chances are I will end up extremely irritable and well, I'm the definition of HANGRY. So my friends convinced me to come here when we were in Vegas. Wait time? 1 hour. Oh and it was early January, FREEZING, and we walked here...from Planet Hollywood. Was it worth it? HELL F**KIN YES. This is one of those rare times I was caught in a line and according to the security guard regulating the line, it was \"short.\" Holy hell I wouldn't want to find out what a long line is. There's 3 lines once you finally get inside: Al pastor, carne asada, and I believe like other animal parts (ie lengua, cabeza, etc). We only got in the carne asada line and of course, I over-ordered tacos (jk, no such thing as over-ordering tacos from here). The meat was made right in front of us. The guy serving us worked super quick and was nice when we asked for our toppings on the side. Definitely recommend this place for late night taco fixes."}
{"text":"Terrible Service !!!! I understand it's packed and you want to get everyone their order.... but the man literally slapped all my food into the plate my food was outside the mulita ... 

There was a rude man working on the grill and when we were next he told us we had to make line at the lane nExt to us.  FOOD WAS NASTY, we got old hard carne, I asked for a mulita and the cheese was still cold and hard.....

Bad service, would never come back again!  We wasted $45 for disgusting, cold food !"}
{"text":"This place is a joke their system of ordering is horrible, I could loose my mind waiting in that line and heat. 2 hours of line to just end up walking out because the taquero would stop every 5 min to go do who knows what in the back. Tried some of the meat from my boyfriends tacos and I have tried better tacos at a better price with a way shorter wait time. Point is I would not recommend this place unless they hire at least 20 more people."}
{"text":"This is a chain of Mexican fast food joints. There are at least two in Las Vegas, and god knows how many elsewhere. The one on the Strip is on the same side of the street as Wynn and Encore, and a little further north.

***The Menu***
You can order quesadillas, tostadas and such, but most of the menu is tacos: taco de asada (steak), adobada (spicy pork), tripa (tripe) and a host of others. Tacos are small (around 3 to 4 inches in diameter), with a heaping tablespoonful of meat, cilantro and other spices in the center. Two tacos make for a modest lunch; four would be a hearty dinner.

***The Atmosphere***
Pretty much like any other fast food restaurant. There are a few tables inside, and many more outside.

***My Meal***
I've only eaten one lunch here, so I can't comment on much of the menu. However, I am hopeful. I tried two tacos: taco de cabeza (beef head); taco de buche (pork stomach). The taco de cabeza wasn't as unusual as it sounds. In taste and texture it was pretty much like minced steak. I liked it, and think it would please most people. The taco de buche was by far my favorite: lots of flavor and good texture. To wash it down, I had a bright red, strawberry soda.

***Summary***
After one meal, I want to go back. The tortillas are good, the fillings are good, and there are lots more to try.

***The Bill***
The meal was $5.72, for two tacos, a soda, and tax."}

The 2 guys we usually get our tacos from remember our order by now and make our tacos and quesadillas just right!

Tacos el Gordo came recommended from a friend who said that it was hard to get Mexican food like this outside of Mexico and we weren't let down.

Everything was awesome and it was a cheap feed and we'd recommend it as something different to the run of the mill Tex Mex fare that is more often passed off as Mexican."}

Probably 9/10 street vendors were bomb, 5 stars, best tacos I've ever had to date. And I've luckily managed to find tacos almost as good in Los Angeles and in vegas (very recently). 

I've given tacos el gordo on Charleston a chance about a year ago, but didn't post my review as I didn't want to get stoned to death. 
I chose to give this new location a second shot for the tacos el gordo experience. 

Carne asada- 2 stars. I prefer some parts of my carne asada to have a char and prefer to have the meat more marinated or seasoned. This place is not my favorite. 

Al pastor- 2 stars. Pretty much for the same reasons, I did not enjoy it much. 

The plain fries for $2.25 were the highlight of my night, though it's probably frozen stuff.

The salsa bar doesn't have green and red sauce, so make sure to ask for it while getting the tacos. 

For those who are big fan of Tacos el Gordo, you will love this place. I had no lining up to do around 10pm on a Monday night. Wooooooo!!!!! This place will surely be poppin' as it's in a convenient location from a couple casinos (Encore and Wynn) by walking distance. Clean restaurant, with bright lights!! As for myself, I'll be sticking to other places for my taco fix."}
{"text":"Hot damn! I feel as if I have missed out all of this time, if only I had known about this place years ago. The al pastor and carne asada tacos taste just like the ones in Mexico. 

My friends and I met a few girls on the strip, they were headed to El Gordo, so they invited us to come with them, glad they did. 

The tacos and carne asada fries are amazing."}
{"text":"Bad service, long lines , food ok , not good enough to make big lines , some rudeness from the people in the kitchen, not enough space, definitely they need a bigger space and more workers don't recommend if you are starving, takes more than 30 min to get to the front of the line"}
{"text":"Finally ate at this place while in Vegas and it was amazing!!!
I had al pastor tacos and asada mula and it was so tasty and cooked just right. 
The lines are long but move fast. The place was clean and staff was friendly. Highly recommend this place is you want authentic mexican food :)"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for the weekend, looked up food spots on yelp an Tacos El Gordo came up. Decided to give it a try, it was about a 15 min drive from MGM. I got there about 11pm an the place was packed, it was a Monday night. They actually have 3 different lines for ordering food, it depends on the kind of meat you want, that is a little weird but ok. Anyway the food was great, specifically the tacos, I usually order a carne asada burrito but they don't have that option, what???? I should drop a star just for that but I won't. The tacos turned out to have great flavor an were a good size. I even ordered 4 more to go for later on that night in the room. They keep the place clean, the price is ok, I just wish they had burritos, still I will definitely make a return trip on my next visit to Vegas. TACOS ARE PRETTY BOMB."}
{"text":"Ohhh! Tacos El Gordo in Vegas (this location) has improved. I came here after a night of craziness, and the food was tasty. 

Ordered: 
- Adobada taco (spicy pork): Yum! This was the best one. Spicy flavor is there but not too strong, and meat is so juicy. 
- Asada tacos (beef): Pretty good - slightly smokey but still tasty. 
- Lengua tacos (tongue): OK, not the biggest fan since it tasted a little too soft/mushy and the sauce was on the weaker side.

Overall...
Obviously the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego is the big winner (and original), but Las Vegas has upped its game in terms of taste & quality. Also, you can get the red spicy salsa sauce directly from the guys giving you your tacos (don't bother asking at the cashier's, they're always running out of red sauce there)."}
{"text":"If you like to order your food, then wait in line while you look at it on a tray in front of you, just watching it get cold before your very eyes, then eat here."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap and delicious... What more could you ask for. It's fast paced so know ahead of time what you want to eat."}
{"text":"The food not bad.  I've had better but not bad. (They have to work with those salsas, not spicy at all) I gotta say I came here for the hype and was impressed with the long line coming out from the place. This was about 1hr line, it was horrible to find out there were multiple lines for the different meats, my hubby and I had to split to get our orders, I got the adobada tacos and he got the asada,chorizo ones.. I got there faster,  but by the time he got the tacos mine were cold..so yup 1Hr!!!!. I was hungry tired and frustrated.. I wish they could arrange things differently,  like having other people cooking the meats while the others serve or the traditional way,  have someone taking orders... I guess I have to give them another shot, but I dont recommend on going if your very hungry in a busy night,  you might get stuck behind someone ordering 20+tacos.."}
{"text":"Mexican fast food, fun to see the cooking preparation.  Perfect choice for a quick meal and run."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals in terms of bang for my buck I had in Vegas - I paid $15 for 6 tacos and was very content. Nothing more to say than simple food done exceptionally well. They have a very straightforward ordering process where multiple lines serve different types of meat (but you can order all kinds of tacos from any line). In order of increasing flavor, I would recommend the lengua, carne asada, and adobada, which is pork cooked on the spit roast. Don't forget to ask for some grilled leeks and peppers, which come free of charge and are a great complement to the tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo is a must-have when visiting Vegas! We usually go to the location closer to the strip late at night. We decided to stop by this location on our way out of town and it was just as good!
There are 3 separate lines for different types of meat so be sure to check the signs before you line up! I usually decide what I want first then wait in one line while my friend waits in another so we don't have to wait in line twice. 
My favorite is the al pastor taco! The meat is so good and it's topped with a sauce that compliments the meat really well. I also like the carne asada (steak) and lengua (beef tongue)!
There are complimentary limes and radishes in a salad bar on the side! I like to squeeze a ton of lime on my tacos. They also have aguas frescas! My go-to flavor is the jamaica (hibiscus). So good!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Tacos El Gordo! If I'm picking a tacos spot it's this one or sometimes I just have a craving for Al Pastor (with a slice of pineapple). Everybody I've brought here enjoy it too. My brother is a tacos freak and when he came to visit I immediately took him here. If you're looking for some high class, sit down tacos place you're at the wrong place. It's bleak but has way more sitting then the old location on the strip. But who cares about appearance it's the food that matters to me!"}
{"text":"My go to place in Las Vegas when hungry for tacos. We enjoyed all their tacos especially the lengua. They are equally good as ones that I've had in Mexico. They are open until 2:00 am daily."}
{"text":"Despite being not being on the Strip any longer, this taqueria is still ahhhhmmaaazzziinngg. I was surprised that even though this spot is off the Strip, tourists were still jam packing it to get their infamous adobada AKA al pastor tacos. I of course had to get at least 3 of those bad boys along with a half order of the carne asada fries. I definitely recommend getting the half size because the full order will feed a small army. In addition, they carry the Orange Bhang drink, which I can only ever find in So Cal and now in Vegas. Though you'll  have to fend for a table if you dine in, once you indulge in some Tacos El Gordo, it'll all be worth it in the end my friend."}
{"text":"Being from East Side San Jose, I am fortunate enough to have an array of awesome taquerias to grub at, but this place is the BEST taqueria ever! Thanks so much to my homie, Ruben for showing me the epicness that is Tacos El Gordo. Luckily, the first time I entered with the homie, there was no line so ordering and getting the food was almost instant. However, when I came EDC weekend, the lines were out the door! Nonetheless, this food is totally worth waiting for. The stuff that I have tried here include: Al pastor tacos, al pastor quesadilla, and a half order of carne asada fries.

The al pastor meat is seriously the best al pastor I've ever indulged in. The meat is super tender, juicy, well marinated, and overall awesome. I love the nice little crunch the outside of the meat has from the rotisserie cooking process. The al pastor tacos also get some toppings such as cilantro, onion, and a creamy sauce. As for the carne asada fries, the portions are huge. A regular order can feed about 4-5 people and a half order can take care of 2-3 people. The fries are perfectly crisp and are covered with delicious carne asada, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and some other sauce...drool worthy deliciousness. Not only do they have epic food, but their drink machine options are unique and refreshing. I absolutely am in love with their Orange Bahng drink. Overall, this taqueria is the seriously the best ever."}
{"text":"Every time I'm driving on the Eastside of town between 11-3 I try to stop in for a quick bite at Tacos El Gordo. The food is usually quick, although it can get very crowded at times. I love the Asada Quesadillas with everything on them. The Asada is much saltier than I would prefer but adding lime helps cut through it. 

El Gordo reminds me of getting street tacos in TJ or Baja when I was in high school. It's authentic and a couple years ago it would be a 4 star but the novelty of remembering my many trips to Mexico is starting to depreciate and the meat is tasting saltier than I remember. 

Overall if you want the real deal stop in and remember they have different lines depending on the type of meat you want so don't be the guy who stands around because he can't figure it out."}
{"text":"First off...there's only two cities that have this restaurant. Las Vegas and Tijuana. I came to this location once & I'm in love!!! So happy my boyfriend recommended it!! Their tacos are totally delicious!!! The real deal; very authentic, if you want GREAT Mexican food. $2 a tacos too!!! Can't beat that. More reason, to rent a car, just to go to this place, because it is a little out of the way, even if your taking the duece. I don't want to waste any time getting there. I just wanna EAT!! I understand why this place gets so crowded. 

Inside, obviously gets packed, so its best to sit outside in the patio area. Ya......EVERY visit to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here...no doubt. You just have to check it out yourself!! I can't wait to try their other stuff!! =D"}
{"text":"Pros:
1) Carne Asada Fries are SOOO good
2) Great location right outside of XS/Surrender (night club)
3) Open 24 hours

Cons:
1) Pricey
2) Small portions"}
{"text":"This is my goto Taquieria fix. Just like Mexico and keep in mind all orders come dressed unless you ask for \"salsa on the side\" grilled onions and peppers are complimentary, a must and steaks on the grill are always fresh . Flour tortillas are EVERYTHING!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for some great tacos in Vegas? Check this place out. I ordered the carne asada tacos and shared carne asada fries with friends. Because they use real charcoal grills to cook the meat, the tacos had great flavor. Smoky essence and refreshing from the cilantro, onion, salsa garnish. The carne asada fries were good and similar favors like the tacos, but instead of the garnish mentioned, it's topped with cheese. Can't go wrong, but I recommend sharing the fries. They had other tacos such as lengua, pastor, and cabeza, which I'll try next time. Ample parking outside, and we came on a Thursday night and no waiting in line."}
{"text":"My socal friends highly recommended this place so we decided to hit it up. There was about a 20 minute wait, but luckily for us, our friends had went ahead and ordered for us, so we skipped the line. 

Our group of 4 ordered 10 adobada tacos and one large adobada fries. The adobada isn't actually spicy so it was easy to devour the tacos. The fries have some green sauce drizzled all over it that my friend likes to call \"crack\" sauce since it is so addictive. 

This place is probably too far to walk from the middle of the strip, so I'd recommend taxiing here. It is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst taco places ever. I will keep this short and full of tips. Tip #1 avoid this place. The only PRO here is the meat. Everything else is subpar at best and negligent somewhere in the middle. If you are from California, this will be a fucking great disappointment for you. 

If you still want to go there after reading this far, I got some useful tips below:

Tl;DR avoid corn tortilla tacos and fries. Guac is shit. Get vampiros or mula. Idk about the rest. Go at night and take a time machine. The food looks alot better. I went at 4 and it was shitty. Most of the good looking pics looks like it was night time and in 2015.

1. DO NOT get the TACOS. The taco tortillas are shitty as fuck and are from a bag. They make tortillas in front of you to make it look like all of it is fresh, they are not. It looks like they only use those fresh tortillas for the Vampiros and mula. These two were alright. If you really want tacos, ask for flour tortillas shit. Their corn tortillas are like fucking sand paper.

2. Fuck these fries. are you fucking kidding me? $15 for that small ass serving of lengua fries? This place charges twice as much as any place I have ever been to for fries. The fucking guacamole.... Holy shit it looks and taste like it is out of a tub of shit. If it taste like shit, looks like shit, is it shit? so disappointed with the guacamole here. This is a fucking disgrace. Fuck this shit. Stay away.

3. Horchata is shit. Don't get it.

4. I had to ask this fucking white looking fat lady to get salsa from her. With $60 worth of food for my fat ass I ask for salsa and she gives me fucking 2 tiny ass cups. I asked for 8 more because I have so much food, she says no. Then she starts talking shit about me in spanish in front of me like I don't fucken understand her. Fuck this bitch. Then I was like are you fucking serious? And she gives me the salsa. Fucking people man. I doubt I'll go back.

Well so much for a short review. Thanks for reading my rant and I hope it will be better for you if you decide to go there."}
{"text":"Super yummy!! Love this stuff!! Just like what I had in Acapulco. Really takes me back!"}
{"text":"I left Vegas two weeks ago, and I have been dreaming about this place since.  I am from Texas, and we have some awesome tacos....but this place, holy cow!  This place offers literally the best taco that I have ever had the pleasure of consuming.  Get the Al Pastor tacos and some Campechana Fries, and you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Best place to go after going out clubbing....cheap good taco's!"}
{"text":"Authentic street tacos. Lines are a little confusing come prepared to wait and prepared to find a table"}
{"text":"So good! The taste of the tacos is wat better that any other taco place in town! I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Holy crap, their tacos are seriously the best!! Coming from Southern California, we are spoiled with a lot of great Mexican food, but El Gordo's knows how to make a taco. As you wait in line you'll see them literally making tortillas from scratch and heck yes, it makes all the difference. I had their carne Asada tacos on a corn tortilla will everything on it and I was eating my meal, I was already trying to figure out when we'd be coming back. Lines can be long, but totally worth the wait!!! And you just can't beat good cheap eats in a city that has crazy prices for most of its eateries. Definitely a must-do when you're in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the taco... Steak taco and quesadilla are the best. Sometimes the queue are too long and u have to be in line for at least 20-30 min and their ordering system is weird BUT for great tacos you still go.."}
{"text":"THE BEST LENGUA (BEEF TONGUE) TACOS EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE!

I first got hooked to El Gordo in San Diego, near the border to Mexico. At that time, I was not a big tacos fan like now, but I remembered I really enjoyed the lengua tacos and the adobada (spicy pork) tacos. Ever since then, I always reserved some time to go to El Gordo every time I visited San Diego.

I discovered that El Gordo has 2 locations in Vegas just recently. In Vegas, I found a new love for the carne asada fries. They give you a whole bunch of asada (steak) on top of a bed of fried smothered with their heavenly white and green sauce. BOMB!!!

The line can get really long, I once came on a Saturday night and we waited in line for around 40 mins. Side note, once you're inside you have to line up based on the meat you want to get. So split up your crew so the ordering will be faster.

One more tip, do not, I repeat, do not take the tacos home. You have to eat them right away because everything is made fresh, even the tortillas so they will get soggy once you take them home. So, wait in line, order your heart out, pay, and devour immediately."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm from the bay area and I wish they had one of these places there because the spicy pork tacos are addictive!! The carne asada tacos are very good as well, probably the best I've ever had. Give it a try. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mulitas de adobada are the best. Adobada is pork meat marinated. You can order tacos, sopes, french fries, french fries with meat on them, quesadillas and a few other stuff. There can be a very big crowd at times. I fined if it is less crowded during the day and during the week. The tacos are street style tacos very much like they sale in Mexico.ENJOY"}
{"text":"The tacos were just okay. The group that I was with made it seem like these were the best tacos in the world so I had pretty high expectations for this place. Being from San Jose, these tacos were not anything special to me."}
{"text":"This place is bomb !!!!!

We ordered tacos, asada fries, and a quesadilla. Everything was really good. The meet is well seasoned and they hook you up with meat, they don't skimp you out!

The staff is nice and it does get packed !"}
{"text":"Grat tacos nice enviroment, lots of people come here right after spending lots of money at high end night clubs such as XS"}
{"text":"Taco el Gordon let me tell you fresh tortillas are my fav and the meat is so bomb I ate all my food and wanted to get more they are the best taco spot in vegas"}
{"text":"Still a great consistent place for some awesome tacos! 

There are separate lines for what meats you want, so make sure you read the options before you get into position!  Lines go out the door easily when it approaches noon, we were able to skip the lines by arriving a bit before 11AM.  Tables are filled, but clear easily.

If it's your first time here, give the carne asada and al pastor/adobada a try, some great staples.  Tongue and other options are good too if those don't freak you out."}

Now best tacos in vegas very bold statement but as of right now best tacos I've had in vegas. Came here cause it was cinco de mayo!!!! and well I love beef and all but where are the fish and chicken tacos man??!! came with the wife and well i had a bad night after that cause she wanted to eat something a little less beef tongue and stomach haha. I love LENGUA if i could eat it everyday i would but the lengua tacos and the asada OMG fucking amazaballs!!!!! the beef shoulder not so much very salty. Service here well think its cause im not hispanic or of any hispanic back ground so the language barrier was def a factor but the set up here is def weird was in one line for asada than they told me to go to another line for asada?! i know each line has separate meats but i was in the right line!!! anyways love the tacos but hate the eating setup outside in vegas when its summer are you kidding??!! yeah i dont think so on the plus side i saw little john there yeah!!! overall this place is good the best so far but i am on the look out for more hidden local spots acutally my local friends told me about this spot so"}
{"text":"This place so good ! I came with with friends before heading home from Vegas . The asada tacos are so good . I tried a Asada tostada and quesadilla as well and everything was so good and affordable. I wish we had one in Los Angeles ."}
{"text":"Best taco place in Vegas. Even if you don't speak Spanish don't be scared to check this place out. Authentic Mexican tacos!!"}
{"text":"In my recent visit to Las Vegas, my family and I ran into this jewel of a taco restaurant. We went on a Sunday night around 1am, it was pretty dead inside. There was plenty of chairs and tables available. The workers were very attentive, and the food it self is amazing. It's a little pricey for a taco, but hey its vegas!"}
{"text":"If you happen to have 45 minutes to spare just to wait in line here is the spot! Tacos are bomb!!!! The adobada is bomb.com the Asada is a little dry for my taste! They hook up your tacos with a good amount of meat, cilantro, onions, avocado sauce and salsa! My favorite part is the pineapple, grilled green onions and Jalapeños hey give u on the side! Make sure to say hello and tip MARTIN! He's the gentleman cutting the al pastor for your tacos! His service is unbeatable! Literally a great guy!"}
{"text":"I really love this place ! It's kept clean. How ever there is a wait especially on the weekends. That's the only down fall. But other than that the food is great! I love the carne asada fries the best!"}
{"text":"I came here before I hit up Encore for some fun. Best decision ever. This place was poppin' at 10am in the morning or something - tells you how good this place is. 

I ordered all of the 'safe' normal stuff - carne asada, chorizo, carnitas, and they were great. Carnes asade was my favorite! Beef had amazing flavor and the melange of onions. lime and guac was great. I would say this is the best carne asada taco I've had. I'd say the chorizo and carnitas lacked a bit of flavor and the texture was a bit dry but still good. My favorite thing here, was their peppers. You can ask for roasted veggies/peppers on the side free of charge! They have both green and white and they complemented the tacos to perfection. Cook well, a bit too well (slightly brown/black) but they were just cooked to perfection. Texture was hard on the outside, soft on the inside.

I'd recommend everyone to hit this place up, and not some other taco place. It's impossible to miss."}
{"text":"This place is a must have. I dnt say that for very many places. Tacos Al Pastor are a treat! Sooooo good. Carne Asada is a touch above average. 

Always super busy, long lines, loud atmosphere, crappy parking, but all worth the hassle. Hole in the wall type place, so if you're ok with that, then this will work for you. 

I feel like $2.25 per taco is a bit pricey but, the flavor makes up for the size. I easily take down 6 at any given time. Which lead to an expensive lunch/ dinner. 

Coming from a taco lover, you wouldn't be mis directed in trying this place. Hope this helps. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"I don't get what the hype is. I've had tacos from all over LA and I can only compare this place to what I had before. This place is decent. It's nice that it opens until 4:00am on the weekends so you can go clubbing and then grub afterwards. Try going late at night and you'll be in line for 45+ minutes. 

There's also a sign that says you can't order if you don't have a shirt on. I was at night swim and ended up losing my shirt so I had to sit outside while my friends ordered for me. I look pretty fit and athletic with my shirt off, but they still said no. I hope management changes that rule soon..."}
{"text":"Twenty stars for this taco joint. The adobada is the best adobada you are ever going to find from Vegas to Cali to TJ and that's because  that's where you will find another Tacos el Gordo. The tacos quesadillas and tostadas are delicious. The homemade tortillas and that green sauce they put on the tacos just makes them the best tacos. I'm from Los Angeles so I will not be having them for a while.;("}
{"text":"AWESOME place..hands down.. BEST mexican tacos in vegas!! The service was great, the variety of fountains drink selections was nice... (They had different flavors available then the normal ones we usually see)
We got our food right away, before you sit down as it's  made Hot and fresh right in front of your eyes."}
{"text":"It was very pleasant to stop by in Vegas to the famous tacos el Gordo!!! And let me say... It was the best tacos I've tasted here in Nevada. I mean the stars and reviews are not enough. I'm someone to be a big judge on Mexican food, and I'm very picky. This food was just amazing!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Taco place in Vegas or anywhere that I can think of. The al pastor is the shizzzz. Do yourself a favor and take an uber when you're in Vegas, you won't regret it. I can easily eat 6 to 7 of these whenever I get to go. Sure, Vegas has a lot of excellent restaurant whenever you visit, but there's 3 meals in a day, head down and try it out!!"}
{"text":"ok this place is nuts! awesome food but what the hell is wrong with them setting it up this way? depending on which menu item you want, you have to wait in a different line. then once you have gathered your food from the various lines, you get in another line to pay. after the cashier has assessed your tray and figured out what you owe, then you can get in line to fill your drinks. but the food is excellent so go and bring a friend for each line."}
{"text":"A notch lower than the one in Chula Vista definitely, because the pork goes on the grill for a little bit before reaching your taco, rather than cutting it right off the rotating roaster and dropping into the taco.

in order from best to good

1 - Spicy Pork Tacos
2 - Lengua Tacos
3 - Shoulder Tacos

quite honestly I would recommend getting 4 spicy pork tacos and 2 lengua tacos for yourself.  ask your friend to simultaneously line up for a different ingredient so you don't have waste time standing around"}
{"text":"I never understood the hype about this place and I still don't. The tacos are good but they're not ~amazing~. They honestly just taste like any other taqueria. It's a great spot for super late night drunchies though! 

ALSO. The people there work HARD. They bustin' it just to fulfill orders flowing hour after hour. Some of their movements are like so robotic it's crazy. Leave a nice tip for them because they work so hard to make your tummies happy!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last weekend and I wont be back. There's nothing special about these tacos. I've had better asada, lengua, & cabeza tacos. The adobada tacos are pretty good. 
The concept of ordeing your food is pretty cool but it sucks because your food gets cold by the time you sit down to eat. You have to stand in one of three lines to order the tacos. The adobada ones are closest to the door so we decided to get some because there was no wait period & thats what we did wrong! By the time we sat down to eat them they were very cold because there was a long line to get the asada ones. It was about $20ish for 6 tacos, 1 mula, & a drink! :/ . . . Go next door instead!"}
{"text":"so this place just kind of happened, true authentic Mexican food, you will not be disapointed.  some of the best tacos I've ever had, definitely worth a 2nd and 3rd and 4th trip back when i come back to vegas. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"}
{"text":"This place is epic! I mean... they have seriously ruined street tacos for me forever. No where else I go will ever measure up to this place. I admit I only tried the spicy pork and head tacos, but both were excellent. Actually, the spicy pork ones were amazing as I had four of those and two head tacos. Plus, what really put this place over the top was they had Orange Bang and all the other Bang products on tap! On tap! Needless to say, I started to OD on the frothy orange goodness of it. All and all, I can't wait to go back as this place is not only amazing for their food and drinks, but service to."}
{"text":"When it comes to Mexican street tacos, the first places that come to my mind are Taco's Mexico, late nights in TJ and the best hang over food ever. However, no more.... well at least not Tacos Mexico. Anyway, lets just get to the good stuff. 

Tacos el Gordo is amazing place. Hands down the best street taco's ever. Being that they are orginally from Tijuana, they are already off to a good start. Personally I am a huge fan of their carne asada and ablongida (sp.?) tacos. They also have more exotic delights as cabeza (head) lengua (tounge) and a few other goodies I have yet to try. Plus, their cane asada fries are nothing short of amazing in my mind. 

And on top of all that great food, you can wash it down with unlimited refills of Orange Bang! Or Pina or horchata if that floats your boat as well. 

Buenos timepos!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah!!! Open 'til 4am! Super authentic. Sooo good!. Right off the 15@ Cheyenne. I always get the quesadillas, the cheese is amazing. Lots of parking, take out, dine in."}
{"text":"The tacos here are magnificent. But before we get started with the big review, some quick tips.

1. The meats are divided into sections with INDIVIDUAL lines!

2. There are two locations for Tacos El Gordo, the second one being near the Encore.

3. This locations prices are a little bit better, but if you're driving from the strip, it's probably more worth it to go to the first location.

4. Try the Adobada tacos, their carne asada tacos are equally good too!

5. For the Adobada tacos, everything means all the fixings EXCEPT for the pineapple! Ask the guy making them for a tiny slice of tacos.

6. The fries come in three flavors: campenchana, adobada, or ANY meat. Don't be fooled that the sign says adobada or campenchana only.

7. The fries come in half/full size, a half size is more than enough for two people to share and just right for three to sample!

8. Plenty of parking! Two entrances!

After discovering Tacos El Gordo on our second trip to Vegas, we have gone back every single time to eat at their fine establishment. There are MANY meats to choose from, but by far our favorite is the adobada. My personal one that I really like is the carne asada.

What truly sets apart Tacos El Gordo is that they grill up/fry up their meat right in front of you. You can watch them cooking up your stuff and making the tacos. Another thing that I really enjoy is the great service. Every single time we've been there, they've always been really nice to me and my girlfriend. I think it might because they see us as Asians in a Mexican joint who have no idea what's going on. But beyond that, the place is really clean. They wipe down tables after people are done and the cleaning ladies usually offer to take our trays for us when we're still sitting down and finished.

The last thing is the price. For Vegas, this place is a steal. We usually get somewhere from 6 tacos, a drink, and a half order of adobada fries for $20.

Awesome food, awesome service, awesome price! What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Go with someone who speaks spanish. Food was good but had no idea what the heck was going on. I didn't even know where to stand. What the hell did i  even order. Greasy greasy greasy food. I love greasy fries and burgers, but this was extreme. I mean your mouth gets a grease coat every time you bite into the carnitas. Gnar man... super gnar.

Expect Stomach problems if you don't eat a lot of greasy food."}
{"text":"Latin American flavor and flare. You might as well be in Mexico. 

The lines make no kinda sense and the chaos is half the fun, but these tacos are great. Little bites of perfection. We tried Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Adobado, Choirzo and Lengua and our favs were by far the Carne Asada and Adobado (spicy marinated roast pork). Fortunately for those who love the Adobado, the lines are usually quite short. Don't forget to ask for the roasted pineapple on the Adobado. You will also see some getting the Chiles y Cebollas de la Plancha (grilled peppers and onions) which I thought looked so good but really weren't. I would pass. Horchata was not fresh, comes from a Coke machine, but it was still really good. Lengua was very good actually, just didn't have the layers of flavors that the Asada and Adobado had. 

Really packed late at night. Lines aren't so long during the middle of the day. Come here!"}
{"text":"The smell alone is hurting my pride and its also making wonder why I don't live next door yet, Gotdamn this place is the truth!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're planning a trip to Vegas, take note: this place will feed you when you've lost all your money to gambling, overpriced meals and club entry. And they will feed you well. I think we went 3 times during our 5 day stay. Just so darn good. Very authentic. And most importantly for Vegas, dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Please open a location in LA!! Every time I visit vegas I have to stop here.. Sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"It is pretty much the best Mexican Food for quick eats such as your Tacos, Quesadillas, and such. I love their Tacos de Asada by the way as they are cooked with real Ranchera meat, which is the best meat to cook for tacos. They have a location on the Strip as well, but this is also the spot for those who want to be away from the Strip, especially for locals there. I have to say it has an awesome taste!"}
{"text":"Not that great. Very greasy tacos! I have been to the one in Tijuana and it it's much better! I think the competition surrounding the place sometimes are better options. Either wayThe place is always packed so for some people it must be good. I prefer less greasy more taste."}
{"text":"There was a piece of hair in my taco but it was so good I still ate it. Adobada is the best meat. I prefer the adobada flour mula. It's like a mozzarella quesadilla with extra avocado green sauce. The area isn't the best but it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait in line and sweat your ass off, but it's totally worth it. Al pastor is fantastic, some of the best tacos I have had. Very limited seating with the amount of people that come here, but very worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos Al Pastor in the City of Las Vegas, I go to the one located in East Charleston. Make sure you get a few with pineapple slices. Hands down the best Al Pastor Tacos by far!"}
{"text":"AH-MAY-ZING!!!

You know you're in a great food joint when all of the locals are swarming the place...

Also... You know its authentic when the employees just assume you can speak Spanish. Lucky for me...  i'm Cuban. =)

My fiancé and I just had a half order of carne asada fries since we didn't want to get too full before a night out on the town. We were blown away with just how awesome these fries were. The carne asada had the most flavor I have ever! There was just the right amount of everything on there! btw... best guac i've ever had too... it was creamy and perfect... I would totally come here again and again the next time that we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Be ready to WAIT !!!!!! Even at 3 in the morning the line is absurd !! And there is no organization people are just everywhere. My girl who swore these are the best tacos... we came & tried them out. And they were OKAY. 
I can live without it.

The green sauce is good, without the food would be bleeeeh."}
{"text":"The Real Deal!  Great Tacos with Authentic Tijuana, B.C. Style!  If you want the real tacos this is a MUST!"}
{"text":"The best food ever. Very authentic.

Don't need  to say more, but Yelp makes me. 

Best Mexican food, ever!"}
{"text":"Come on people, how can anybody NOT give this five stars!  Food is always the BEST Mexican food outside of Mexico.  Yes, the lines are confusing, but you figure it out quickly after coming here 3 or 4 times.  But if I were the owner, I'd find a much better system of ordering and picking up food, so that people don't get confused, and so that they don't have to wait in multiple lines."}
{"text":"This is the only place where I actually like the carnitas... Pretty good place to get tacos. Definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"Not healthy at all! 
...I came here thinking it had a variety of selected foods and it didn't. I was completely disappointed. Everything looked greasy, dirty and old-looking, like if the food was from several days before. It didn't look fresh at all. It gave me an instant unpleasant perception as I walked in, so I decided to immediately turn around and walk out. As I looked up, I saw LOS TACOS and felt like I had betrayed my favorite Mexican Restaurant in the world. Thank God I just had to walk across the parking lot to get guaranteed amazing food at LOS TACOS."}
{"text":"Taco's El Gordo is worth the wait. Sure, you have to stand in the line for the type of meat you want and sometimes that can be a while or even make you wait outside depending on the time of day.

I really enjoy the Al Pastor they have and usually get it on a plate of french fries. The Carne Asada is also delicious and the way they make their tacos is so good. You can request flour or corn but sometimes they don't ask.

Overall it's a really good spot for Mexican tacos or meat over fries. I travel over 20 miles each way when I'm craving Tacos El Gordo and I'm always happy I did."}
{"text":"Authentic delicious taco spot. Went on a Saturday at 10pm and it was poppin. The line looks short but it goes slow. You need to stand in different lines for carne asada tacos and for lengua/ sesos/lengua. Thankfully they let us order all the tacos in one line but my friend stood in the other line just incase. The tacos are small but flavorful."}
{"text":"Adobada tacos. SOOOO GOOD! No visit to Vegas is complete without a visit or two to this wonderful establishment. The food here is good any time of the day - breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night snack. 
You order at each station (they all specialize in one/two types of meat). You get your food and pay at the cashier. The first time we went, it was empty and we were confused so the nice ladies walked us through the entire process very patiently.
I will always make sure to make a visit here every time I visit Vegas. This place is THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"The best taco joint ever. I actually lived in San Diego for a couple of years before moving to Los Angeles and they had their original location down there. I went there more frequently than I went to the gym. Their adobada and asada are my go to choices. I don't really go for the tongue although many say that it's delicious. I don't know, it's just the thought of eating tongue that doesn't sound pleasing to me at all. I'm pretty sure it tastes great, but not my cup of tea, if you know what I mean. Their carne asada fries are amazing too. They put loads of cheese and guacamole on it. Actually came here just recently this past weekend. It's a little hectic so make sure you read the signs above. Pretty self explanatory. You order from whatever you want on the menu, pay at the register, and then grab an empty seat. This place gets pretty packed on the weekends btw."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. Tacos should be enjoyed warm, right after they are served. Also, you are supposed to have a variety of them.
 
In here, this is impossible sure to their ordering system. If you want Al Pastor, you have to get in one line; if you want Asada, in another line; if you also want Suadero or Cabeza, a third line. After all that, another line to pay. This whole deal makes the experience frustrating; by the time you sit down with your 2 Al Pastor, 2 Asada and 2 Suadero, everything is cold.

Not worth the hassle of multiple lines."}
{"text":"This place runs like a well oiled machine! Each employee has a job and they take it seriously! Once you get past the crazy line outside, you go inside where there are several lines based on the meat selection you have made. You get your food and then go to the checkout counter to pay.
I got four carne asada tacos and they were very good! The tortillas were excellent and fresh.
Definitely a must try if you are on the strip! It's just a short walk from the Encore property and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I come here EVERY time I visit Vegas. 

This last time was the worst experience ever... the wait time was 40 minutes we waited in line because of how good the food is...

2 stars? Well the whole time I was Waiting in line along with other people the gentlemen serving tacos was letting people cut the line. After seeing 2 people cut I finally spoke up.


Put it this way I had half my order they had to throw it out and give me New tacos because they were cold of how long I was waiting."}
{"text":"Coming from someone who isn't really a fan of Mexican food, this has got to be my favorite place for tacos! Every time I'm in Vegas, I have to stop here. 

Although the lines are always extremely long, I feel the carne asada tacos are worth the wait. They have two different lines for certain types of meats, so make sure you're in the right line! 

Give their carne asada fries a try too! But a half order should be enough for two people for it's really filling."}
{"text":"Unfortunatly I'm addicted to this place :-( 

It's cheap, it's very filling and delicious. A small order of asada fries are only 5 bucks and we were unable to finish ( we did have two tacos before).

The adobada stands out... Have it with fries ( LOADED with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, PINEAPPLE) or in tacos, quesadillas, or mulas. Either way you can't go wrong with adobada.

Asada was the second best although I didn't enjoy the pico de gallo, it was weird on a taco, I usual have that with chips.....  I was not too fond of the greenish running guac salsa? Although everyone seemed to love it.  The chorizo was too dry and over cooked, although I might not be used to type ( seasoning) of chorizo.

They have a soda fountain so you can get as many refills they also have Mexican drinks such as horchata, jamaica and pineapple juices also unlimited fills and self serve. They have a lime and radishes bar but no salsas .. Which I thought was different. This place is more like caferia style dinning which was a hassle, being there for the first time and not knowing how to order sucked but I totally got over that since we were there the very next day.

As far as the location, it's not a really nice area nor is it fancy, It's open late but it's always full of people. If after 1am ur going to run into a lot of clubbers.. Most not sober. During the day this place if full of families. 

I'm am contemplating going there right NOW!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Las Vegas. Quick service, and the pork is amazing there. Def try if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"I have to compare this location to the one in San Diego. This one in NLV is similar I miss the burning mesquite wood smell from the one in Chula Vista, but still very good here too!"}
{"text":"Hands down to Tacos El Gordo the best tacos in the States! I travel a lot and every time I land in Vegas I go to this awesome and fast taco place without breaking the bank!
Tacos in LA, Chicago or Texas are not even close to the flavorful Al Pastor tacos they have here! do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Recommended both by Yelp and my Vegas junkie friends. The inside kinda looks like a Wendy's that serves tacos.

After discovering that the location on the Strip had closed down, we ventured to this branch on Charleston Boulevard, only to be met with the long lines nearly coming out the door. A couple of us scoped out a table, while the others waited in line. We decided to go for broke and order a little bit of everything, which meant waiting in each of the different lines, since each line served a different type of meat. The wait took about 20 minutes, but we were rewarded for our patience.

My favorite were the al pastor, cabeza, and carne asada tacos. The asada tacos had that delicious char that you get with grilling over the fire, which was awesome. The cabeza tacos were great too, albeit a bit on the fattier side. We got a few of the vampiros which were bomb as well. The horchata tasted freshly made and not too sweet. The crown jewel, though, was easily the carne asada fries. A bunch of shoestring fries, topped with cheese, carne asada, guac, and a variety of sauces. A huge portion for $10, and they don't skimp on the meat. So bomb. Comes with some grilled vegetables and different fixings, which are pretty tasty.

The service is relatively quick, the prices are cheap, and the food is very satisfying. Definitely will be back when I'm back in Vegas and hopefully not dead from being chased by loan sharks. Ha."}

{"text":"DATE/TIME: Wednesday, August 22, 2012 // 2:15 PM

PRICE: $10-$15/person (Around $2 per taco.)

My new favorite spot for late night cheap eats on the Strip. If we had one in the Bay Area, I'd definitely be going on a regular basis. The tortillas are hand made and the meat is juicy, tender, and well-flavored. 

Tacos el Gordo is a favorite amongst locals and well-informed tourists alike, and for good reason.

Favorites: Adobada (Spicy Pork), Suadero (Beef Shoulder), Lengua (Beef Tongue), Tripa (Tripe)."}
{"text":"Let me just tell you... adobada tacos.... BOMB.

It's great authentic mexican food. Super yummy. It gets really busy at times but service is super fast. You just stand in front of the line depending on which type if meat you want. I would suggest standing in the adobada line!!! 

My friends and I always come here late nights. 
If you want mexican food I would come here!
Better than Fausto's and Roberto's. :)

5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a straight up taco joint smack in the middle of the craziness that is Las Vegas. The set up is a bit confusing so I left my boyfriend to order and I didn't experience the order/pay portion.

The tacos were so good! It was definitely busy and speaks to how good these are. I loved the pastor and he had lengua and also enjoyed them. It's a bit off the strip but worth stopping in to cure that hangover with some greasy goodness."}
{"text":"The most authentic tacos money can buy you outside of L.A. or D.F.! Get the Al Pastor, if they're out, get the Asada, if they're out of that, get the Lengua, if they're out of that, get anything!"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine kept telling me to come try out this one Taco place in Vegas. I think the location used to be a Wendy's lol, anyway the tacos were pretty bomb but I would say the portions are too little for $2 and some cents they charge per taco. It get's pretty jammed packed and the line can even go outside. Overall I would come back here."}
{"text":"WTF is this place??  They have an unnecessary and complicated way of serving customers. It's not one big line to place your total order, but several huge lines for every kind of taco they sell!  I ordered 2 of their tiny tacos and left....And what kind of Mexican street tacos have mayo??  I have had way better tacos elsewhere.  What a stupid and annoying place, that is all all hype!"}
{"text":"Their tacos are probably the best in Vegas. I recommend their Adobada fries and tacos they're soooooooo good! I only gave it 3 stars, since they changed they're staff it's a little different. The food is still good, but not how it used too. And the staff is okay, their old staff was a lot better!!!"}
{"text":"It's 3am on the Las Vegas strip. You're tipsy from all the free booze. Stumbling down the boulevard, you squint and make out a sign over a busy store front. Tacos El Gordo appears. It's chaos inside with a security guard out front. Hmm, why do they need a uniformed security guard for the entrance? Which line do you get in? No one's saying where to go and the alcohol causes some indecision. You read a sign for the adobada (al pastor) line. Lucky choice but you've been winning at blackjack lately and your streak continues with food. While waiting in line, you ponder what the old mafiosos would think about their little playground in the desert, if they saw and smelled the tasty meats.

The price is right for the little flavorful tacos. If it were Mexico, they'd be super cheap, like $0.50, but it's Vegas at 3am. There are different lines for different taco meats. Adobada  (al pastor) tacos and fries are the best. I tried the others (asada, cabeza, chorizo, buche, sesos, tripa, and lengua). All are good. But the adobada stands out. They slice off pieces of seasoned goodness, like those middle eastern shish kabob/gyro places, into a couple of small steamed corn tortilla soft shells. The tacos are around $2.20 a piece. They are about 3 savory bites full and well worth the money, considering I was staying at the Palazzo, $25 minimum for something decent to eat at this time of night at the Grand Luxe Cafe (also very good). The setup inside is strange and a bit of an honor system for payment. It's cheap, busy, tasty, and a great value with guacamole and salsa. Grab it to go. It's great to prevent a hangover. Maybe it's 3 or 4 stars in the daytime but it's absolute street taco heaven in the late night/early morning twilight of the neon strip before the long island iced tea hangover arrives. Rock on El Gordo!"}
{"text":"by far THE BEST tacos i've ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i first tried tacos el gordo in san diego and i was relieved to find out that it was just the same at this location!!! tacos with al pastor! MMM MMM MMM DELISH :) oh! and also try their tostadas!!

warning: this place can get extremely crowded and it doesnt help that this place is freaggin small! there are different lines for different tacos and the cashier is on the opposite side of the room...its an awkward set up for sure but bare with it because it's really worth it :)"}
{"text":"Very excellent taco shop serving up yummy, made with love, authentic street tacos south of the border right here in Las Vegas.

OperatingHours:
M-Th 9am-2am
F-Sat 9am-4am

I am pretty adventurous when it comes to food, and will try most things at least once plus willing to make the trip to get it.  So after spending too much time in the school library and still needing to find a good late night spot to eat, I somehow found the Yelp reviews for Tacos  El Gordon on the East side of Las Vegas.  The reviews were all positive, and the pictures posted helped cement my decision to drive 40+ blocks down Charleston to find this tacos heaven.

The place was not difficult to locate, as it was a corner unit facing the E. Charleston Blvd.  The restaurant is well-lit inside, with modest décor but the tables, side garnish and drinking fountain stations are spotlessly clean. Even at 10:45pm on a quiet Wednesday night, the lines in front of the ordering counters seem to swell and ebb like the motion of the distant oceans.  Luckily most here are old pros at ordering the tacos and the lines moved quickly.  Even though I felt like a tourist visiting Mexico here, the friendly gentleman at the Adoboda station greeted me warmly with \"what can I get you my friend?\" and helped me translate their fairly straightforward and simple menu, he even helped my placed the rest of my orders at the other station when he was done fixing up my two Taco de Adobodas.

By the time I was at the cash register, my red plastic tray is brimming with 6 tacos (2 Adobodas, 2 Asadas, 1 Chorizo and 1 Lengua), a plate of the grilled scallions and roasted pepper and a cup for their bottomless Horchta ($1.40) all for just under $15.  Pretty sweet deal for what many reviewers are saying as very authentic Mexican street tacos.  I am no taco expert, but a restaurant filled with paying Mexican and Hispanic patrons is a great endorsement and what I look for when seeking a taco shop like this.

Tace de Adoboda - (\"Shepherd's Style\") Spicy pork with adobo seasoning slowly roasted like, and shaved off the rotating skewer into the freshly prepared homemade hot corn tortilla and topped off with the sauces, onions, cilantros.  I enjoyed this the most.  5 stars!

Taco de Asada - Basically a carne asada taco with the regular fixings.  Taste was just okay for me, the portion of beef was generous but I felt it was a tad dry.  3 stars.

Taco de Chorizo - Made with the firmer chorizo and not the kind that melts into a poodle of grease and spices.  Others don't seem to care much for this taco, but I thought it was good.  4 stars!

Taco de Lingua - The \"tongue\" taco.  I really want to like this more, but it was just a little salty for my taste.  Otherwise the portion of the beef tongue was also generous.  I will still give it another try.  2.5 stars.
The grilled scallions and roasted pepper was good and the lady behind the counter really filled the plate for me, even though I only needed like  of the scallions.  I might have used more if the scallions were chopped up, but I will chalk that up as being the traditional and authentic way it is served up at the street taco carts.

Oh yea, the tacos here are not big and can be disposed off easily in 3-4 normal bites, but at $2 each (plus tax) and with the generous meat toppings, it is a still good yummy deal.

Décor:  2/5  Very modest, but you are here first and foremost for the food, right?
Food:  4/5  Overall, very pleased with the tacos here.  If it is closer to me, I will likely be here at least 1-2/week, alas that is a lot of traffic lights to drive through at 35mph.
Service:  5/5  For a low cost and unpretentious restaurant, the service was friendly and fast.
Cleanliness:  5/5  There is something to be said about how the staff here keeps the busy front of the restaurant area spotlessly clean.  Very nice!
Parking:  3/5  May not find the closest parking spaces but there are many in this strip mall.
Location:  3/5  Located in probably not the best part of town, but it is in a location that is surrounded by the bulk of their targeted demographic and on a heavily traversed street no less.  Perhaps a bit out of the way for those living on the West side of the 15, but the drive wasn't too bad later in the evening once the traffic dies down.

4 Stars!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Its a hole by Vegas standards and might be intimidating for the average joe. Its obviously authentic, because we were the only people that didn't' speak Spanish in there-other than a few other brave tourists. There was also only a few people who could take our order in English-love it! The spicy pork tacos are for sure the yummiest and the asada fries are delicious.  This place is right past the encore on the corner of a strip mall with outdoor and indoor seating. So good!"}
{"text":"I'm a taco man, and tacos el gordo is a great local favorite. It's not slap yo mama good, but it doesn't disappoint if you need a quick meal, or just something to settle you from a long night of drinking. Tacos are $2 and lines to get food are separated by whatever meat you want. This location isn't as busy as the strip location thankfully but it does get packed at certain times. The downside of it not being in the strip is that it closes earlier. 
If you're hanging downtown and need some dank Mexican food then this spot is perfect for you. The tacos are quick and good.im not a particularly big fan of their quesadillas and  The nachos are middle of the road, but somehow the nacho fries are off the chain and probably their best item. It's something that I would recommend sharing because they are big and filling. They also have good jamaica and orange bang if you're into those drinks."}
{"text":"If you've been to Any of the other TEG locations before, then you know what you're in for. 
There's the counter, divided into lines depending on what meat you want. You can find me in the Al pastor, carne asada and the suadero lines
The lines here generally move pretty quickly, unless you come during rush hour, then it slows down a bit, and when that happens, if you have to go to multiple lines, it can really slow you down. A good TEG pro tip if you're in this situation is to get in one line, and whoever you're with can wait in the other one
They are pretty generous with the meat on the tacos. They are very generous with the carne asada fries. Like they just pile up everything on those fries, so thank you sweet baby Jesus. 
They come with the standard juice drinks: piña, horchata, Jamaica. They are also one of the few places in town that I can get orange bang 
The only issue I had with this place is that the first month or two that it was open, they only had half the seat in area available, and that basically killed any chance of me eating there and not taking it home, but recently they I'd open it fully, so I'm much grateful for that. 
If you need some good tacos in your life, you know you need to get here"}
{"text":"Lots of different meats, but they were kind of rude to me, the food was kind of over priced for what I got and they did not have a salsa bar. I think this place is over-rated like some people."}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos are the best part.  Cut from a rotating column.  Reasonably priced, tender and to die for."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good reviews about this place. First time it was super packed ! But per the photos it always is. The food was great omg the asada moja  it was great. I will DEFINITELY BE going back."}
{"text":"I'm quite obsessed with carne asada fries. And I really haven't found a good place for asada fries in LA since I've left SD. But that hunt will have to continue. I want to talk about the AMAZING carne asada fries here in LV. Carne asada fries loaded with (real!) avocado, cheese, and some of the best carne asada I've ever had with crunchy fries. Ahhh...drooling just thinking about it right now. 

Bf tried some of their tacos and those were mighty delicious as well! All their tortillas are hand made fresh in store. 

OH! And they have Orange Bang!!!! I'm in heaven!!!

Things I did not like:
- PRICEY! $2 for street sized tacos, $10 for carne asada fries
- Confusing ordering stations: you order different things from different stations 
- pretty far off strip (but there is a closer location to the strip)"}
{"text":"Fabulous, fast, authentic delicious street food. Try the mulas if you haven't had it before. Incredible taste and value. Top notch!"}
{"text":"These tacos are NASTY! I came here expecting good tacos, and left disappointed! People overhype them. They taste like bad carne asada chopped in pieces."}
{"text":"I HOPE SOMEONE FROM MANAGEMENT READS THESE REVIEWS !!!  3 stars because the food is really good, but very disorganized and disorderly when it comes to ordering. We stood in line over 40 minutes with people cutting in, and to make it worse,  once we got the food we went over to try to find a seat ...another 35 minutes , there were more people seated down waiting for friends to bring the food over than people actually eating.  It became a lounge rather than a dining area!   By the time we found a seat,  food was cold and it will never taste the same . WHAT A SHAME TO FAIL IN THE MIDDLE OF SUCCESS.  At least put signs outside stating that you cannot save seats if you are not consuming food!"}
{"text":"I heard about this from one of my neighbours who is a rockstar literally the lead singer of the killers who lives a couple blocks away from me he told me that his favourite Mexican place in Vegas was the tacos L gordos 
Although I'm not a huge fan of the Mexican food because I do not eat onions or peppers my. Eligibility to order things are pretty limited but at the same time if I can escape the onions peppers and pico then I absolutely love Mexican food
I was able to get a chimichanga and a chicken quesadilla to my liking there was two times where I saw that it was busy it's busy because everyone Vegas loves it especially locals this is in a place where someone good girl that's a tourist
This place is basically a staple in Vegas because of word-of-mouth and I heard from the best
I recommended this place to many
But everyone in Las Vegas has already been there 

If you are a tourist it is worth an Uber to try this place out especially if you are not from California or Nevada or Arizona where you can easily access Mexican food where it authentic and delicious and very cheap I would recommend this to people that live on the east coast the north or the midwest"}
{"text":"The BEST tacos in town... period. I'm begging the owner - pleeeassse come closer to Summerlin! Its totally worth the drive, but I'm telling you this would be dangerous if it was closer to me :)."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome taco shop! We had the tacos de adobada (spicy pork), asada (steak), and suadero (beef shoulder). The pork was my fav!!! We also got the grilled onions and peppers, and paletas for dessert! Mmmm gotta try this place if you like tacos!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out last night... and it was fire!!! the line is long af and kind of weird.. so order everything you want/need cause it's a pain to get back in line. The Pastor tacos are the best tacos I've had in a long time... and the horchata is same cost as a regular drink.. give it a try it good.. trust..."}
{"text":"The wife insisted that I try this place, which has apparently expanded quite a bit since she was here last. Anyway, it was amazing...among the best tacos I've had. We came at peak lunch time and it was a little hectic, but totally worth it! We each ordered a Taco Adobada, and from the tortilla dipped in pork drippings to the delicious sauces, everything was on point."}
{"text":"I went to vegas this past weekend for my birthday and my boyfriend wanted to visit a taco place he went to back in the day.  We told the cab driver where we wanted to go, he said, no you have to try here and thats how we found this place.  

The food here was so freaking good! I spent 3 days in California with my cousin and had mexican at places that I thought had the best food, but after going here, I was proven wrong. 

First of all we had no idea what we were doing or what anything was.  But i knew it was going to be awesome because of all the cops eating there.  I went up to a cop and asked him a few questions about what to order and what he recommended.  10 minutes later we walked out of there with a giant bag full of food.  

I wish i could give specifics on what we ordered, but honestly, I don't really remember.  We just took the cops recommendations and then when the guy behind the counter started asking us questions, I said \" I have no idea, just make it like you would eat it.\"  

Everything was so delicious! It was the best Mexican food I ever had.  I strongly recommend getting the spicy pork.  It was delicious.  I wish we got everything with spicy pork.  This is a place I will definitely visit when i go to vegas next time, and I know I will be craving their food in the near future!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, i just hated how you had to stand in different lines to order your food, that was just way too confusing. I am not really a big fan of mexican food, so my opinion might be biased. Would i be willing to drive all the way to the east side to eat their tacos? Probably not. If somebody brought tacos from there will i eat it? Sure will. So that pretty much sums up my review for this place. :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving authentic Mexican food and came across this place on yelp and lemme tell you, it was so worth going! It's right on the strip so it was quite busy throughout the night but we didn't even care because just the smell will make you go in! We got so amazing large carne asada fries ($13) and carne tacos (2.59 per) and I kid you not, if you guys don't go here, you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"It was around noon when I visited. Mind you I'm super hung over from Friday night and tacos sounded like the perfect fix. I read all the reviews on here so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about plus k was super super hungry. I think that the tacos were super basic. maybe I feel that way because I'm from LA, and tacos are our thing out there. I had two al pastor and two asasa tacos. The tacos de asada had some guac, I'll pass I didn't like it the tortilla was pretty greasy and the al pastor had a green sauce that wasn't good. Anywho, I guess for twenty bucks it was ok. I'll pass next time though."}
{"text":"Came here on my trip to Vegas to get these famous tacos! Me and my boyfriend were told by several locals on how great this place was and finally decided to give it a try and I'm so happy we did! These are defiantly the best tacos I've ever had, 100% authentic! The taco shells are made fresh right in front of you and the prices are so affordable! Defiantly coming back here on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had to eat here twice while in Vegas, cause George couldn't get enough of their tacos. Good tacos you wont be disappointed. Also, kind of weird order of things but, you order your food at the counter, then get in line at a register with your food to pay/buy drinks."}
{"text":"One of the best Taco places in Vegas. No matter what time you go there is always a line. However even though the wait may be long, it is totally worth it. My sister took me here since we were craving tacos on our last night in Vegas and I wished I knew of this place sooner. Their meats are perfectly seasoned and cooked. Honestly one of the best authentic tacos I've had in a long time. I plan to come back here if I'm ever in town again!"}
{"text":"Very chaotic place with other ordering. You need to get into several lines for the various tacos. It's divided up by preparation and toes of meat. I stood in the wrong line that I was directed to by staff. The person taking my order was a little rude about me ordering in the wrong line. After we ordered all our tacos you then go and pay. The place was packed which made it difficult to find a place to sit. We finally found a spot outside. My rating on this place in not due to poor food quality. The tacos were great. It is based more on the process of getting your food. We had the chorizo, carne asada, and the el pastor tacos. They were all great. We will probably try again on another trip back and maybe it will be a little better experience since we will know what the expect"}
{"text":"So the mission to find amazing authentic Mexican food in Vegas brought me here (as well as some rec's from other yelpers) and I gotta say- I was not disappointed. From the minute you walk in you're transported back to Mexico. They have different counters to place your order. I tried the carne asada fries and they were AMAZING!! They have 2 options- the $5 and the $10 fries- they're they same thing it's just a difference of size. The fries have carne asada, guacamole, cheese (mountains of it!! :D) and this amazing green sauce which I couldn't quite figure it out. It was pretty frickin awesome..I'll def be back to check out the other food."}
{"text":"I loved the new location on Losee is close to my house and it doesn't get as pack as the other locations. I loved their vampiros  and mulitas al pastor. My husband is a fan of their papas, not my favorite tho. now every time we want tacos we call to order and by the time we get there our food is ready!"}
{"text":"This Mexican place to eat is on the strip at the top. Its close to Encore hotel. 

Tried the Spicy pork and Asada tacos, and Asada Quesdadilla. They were all delicious! Best taco and quesadilla I've ever had! Very fresh and flavorful. We even ordered to-go for later late night munchies.

Fast service and inexpensive. You order first and then go to the cashier to pay."}
{"text":"I loved their Adobada tacos. When you take a bite of the taco the sauces they put on top of the taco makes it that much better. I only gave it a 3 star because there are ALOT, I mean ALOT, of flies. I was trying to swat away the flies as I was eating which made me so annoyed. If there were no flies I woulda gave it 5 star."}
{"text":"Seriously the best street tacos I've ever had in my life! The food is cheap and orgasmically delicious. Thankfully I don't live close enough to eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can anything new to all the other reviews. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the standing in line for 30 minutes to order and get food. The food worth the wait though and I'll be back. I had the Tacos Al Carbon, Carne Asada Taco, and Chorizo Taco. All were full of flavor and had fresh ingredients. Be aware that there is no chicken served at this restaurant and limited seating during the busy times of day, which on the Las Vegas strip is most of the day and evening. 

Skip the chain type Mexican restaurants over at the fashion mall food court or casino hotels and come here. I had 4 tacos for under $10 and walked out full. Its only a 5 or 10 minute walk from Wynn/Encore,Trump, Fashion Mall and the convention center area. 

Wish they would open a location at McCarran Airport D Concourse!"}
{"text":"Once I got over my shock that they didn't have chicken, I was ready to order!!  I picked the Mexican Shwarma ( as another Yelper called the pork).  So glad I did.  It was delicious.  Not spicy( I got the sauce on the side) and very moist.  The corn tortillas had the perfect corny tasty to them.  I only wish I would have discovered this joint sooner.  My wife waited on a different line and got the carne asada taco.  She thought they were really tasty too.  As good or better than a taco in Socal."}
{"text":"This place is THE BOMB!!!!  A MUST, WHEN IN VEGAS. ADOBADA AND LENGUA ARE MY FAVS. The asada is nothing special."}
{"text":"Tacos El Gordo were the best tacos I have ever had in Las Vegas. The prices for their food are reasonable. The staff is very friendly. There were no long lines and there was plenty of seating either indoors or outdoors. My favorite tacos were the Spicy Adobada. My sisters and I went to go eat there two days in a row. It hits the spot after a night of drinking. I will be eating here every time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Nevada! 

Everything about the al pastor tacos was perfect. They meat is freshly slices in front of you and the green sauce on the tacos is delicious. 

The asada tacos are also wonderful, but I prefer the al pastor.

Girlfriend got the steak fries, personally I didn't think there was anything special about them, but she loved it. Go for the smaller size, it's more than enough!"}
{"text":"Came here around 3 am and it was beyond packed! The line was wrapped outside of the building, but let me tell you, IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT! These are some of the best tacos I've ever eaten! Full of flavor, I got the carne asada, AMAZING! Very well priced as well!"}
{"text":"A must try. Line is long but so worth it. The meat is so tender. And the toppings are fresh."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place while staying in Vegas. The place is cheap and the tacos perfection. We ordered carne asada tacos and pork tacos. We were given grilled green onions and jalapeños on the side. The meat was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The salsa and gucamole were both delicious. 
It is a fast food style restaurant, so be prepared to order when reaching the counter. 
There is lots of seating but since it's so full it may be hard to find a table.
We took our tray outside and ate on the curb because it was so full. That didn't bother us one bit since we had a tray of heavenly tacos to eat. 

Highly recommended coming here."}
{"text":"I am a vegan and I only eat meat for this place! The most amazing tacos I have EVER eaten. Everything in comparison is mediocre and flavorless compared to these tacos. Lip smacking good adibada tacos!"}
{"text":"These tacos are the best.  They are pricey and sometimes the wait is long but for a treat it is worth it."}
{"text":"When I go on vacation, I'm always looking for a great place to eat. My boyfriend and I were having to use Uber to get around and this place was recommended more than once so we had to try it! We walked in and they were busy. My boyfriend ordered for me because I don't speak fluent Spanish. I got a quesadilla and it wasn't the look that I was used to but boy oh boy was it tasty! My boyfriend is really picky about the flavor of his food and he gave this place 5 stars! I did too! So definitely if you're in this area, check them out!!"}
{"text":"Quite honestly I'm not sure what the hype is all about unless you're really into eating lingua and all the interesting meats that this place is famous for. I really did enjoy the al pastor barbecued pork. Unfortunately they just don't really give you much to taste. There in the tiny little taco or a tiny little tostada.  They shave off like three or four thin slices of pork then they put in a little cilantro a little green guacamole cream sauce and a spicy kind of a red chili Chipotle kind of a sauce very spicy. Then the guy just kind of throws it together. They're worth probably maybe a dollar at the most. I've seen some pictures on Yelp when it looks like they're really getting their money's worth I don't know if it's because they're so busy that the guy just kind of slapped it together best he can and in the time period. I can tell you that the girl sitting next to me she had I guess pretty eyes and looked better than I did being a man of course. Her taco was probably twice the meat and literally looked more appealing. Unfortunately I got three tacos and it was really very little meat you figure for almost $7 come on folks, give me something to bite into! Then I got the carne asada half order of fries. I split with my girlfriend and it was really gristly the carne asada was tasty but so much gristle. Just a lot of frozen tasteless fries. Tiny very little splash of guacamole little splash of sour cream not enough cheese not melted enough.  I thought $7.50 for a half order of fries I'm not joking you folks $13 for an order of meat on fries my suggestion is pass on the asada even though some of the pictures is online look very appealing. Just get the pork that's what they're famous for if you're not into tongue and brains and eyeballs then that's what I would suggest. Unfortunately the line was probably 30-45 minutes standing outside,  yemps in low 50s. Only then you get inside you have to order in each line . The meats that you need there is a security guard in the beginning that will kind of host you right to where what line you need to be in which I thought was a really nice Personal Touch. Then you order your meats and you can order fries from any line and then I would suggest a sit-down start eating your food cuz it'll get cold fast and tables inside are few and far between.  Then wait for them to call out your name and your fries will be ready. I would suggest just unless you have more than two people to just stick with the half order it's really not worth $13 to save a little bit of money to get a bigger order of in my opinion nothing that great. Then it might give you an opportunity to have more of the al pastor that's what I would suggest."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The tacos are super cheap ($2.75) and super flavorful! I got 3 carne asada tacos, but there are plenty of choices to choose from. They even have carne asada FRIES. The service is great, just like the food. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"It has been ages since I have been back to Tacos El Gordo and I always wonder why I don't come more often. 

The tacos are delicious. I always end up with adobada, no matter how hard I try to order outside my comfort zone. Everything else looks amazing, but when I'm starving for tacos, this is my go to meat. Since there are separate lines for each meat, it's best to come in a group and plan your ordering accordingly so you and your dining companions can split up and tackle the lines more efficiently."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas! This is their new location in North Las Vegas. Their tacos and mulitas are delicious! Trust me it is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"i had such high hopes for Tacos El Gordo and i left extremely underwhelmed after my recent late night/early morning meal here :( with such high ratings and raves from friends, i knew that when we were at encore for nighttime festivities that a stop at tacos el gordo was a must! its a short walk from the encore and the strip mall is so brightly lit that you wont miss the place haha. came around 130ish and it was already packed with people! i wasnt feeling too adventurous so i didnt want to try any of the 'crazy' stuff like tongue haha...so i went with one of my all-time fave dishes - carne asada fries ($10)! these fries just didnt live up to the hype and i've definitely had better in OC and SD :( the carne asada tasted bland and the guacamole didnt seem fresh like it just came out of a package. i tried a bite of my friend's adobada taco and did enjoy that better since the spicy pork had more flavor. overall though i just left here disappointed...maybe i should give it another try when im drunker haha"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about.

Handmade tortillas are always a plus, but the asada meat had such a smoky taste from the grill and it overpowered the other flavors. Even the guacomole and salsa couldn't save it. 

The sope was good because they melted some cheese onto the sope itself. I'd forgo the tacos and get a sope."}
{"text":"as the Nature boy once said......\"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\"

this place is so freaking delicious. You can't lose with any choice of tacos. 

the set up is a little weird but hey it's vegas. Each different taco has a different line (which can be long as hell...but worth it) 

Perfect spot to go after a hard night out ....or morning after.

A definite stop each vegas trip!

if you go with a group of friend, split a box of carne asada fries!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best taco place we've ever been to! Great prices especially for Vegas. Lines are usually long but move pretty fast. The El Pastor is everything and is the best. The Carne is just ok. Will definitely be coming here as much as possible when we cm out to visit Las Vegas. Amazing Amazingly delicious!!!"}
{"text":"--------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTICE:
--------------------------------------------------

THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED DOWN. I just walked over an hour ago hoping to get an adobada (spicy pork with pineapple) taco, but l left empty-handed.

Go to the one in Downtown if you still wanna go!"}
{"text":"Our first experience here was awful.  Did not even get to try their tacos.  The place was just too chaotic and disorganized.  The place was packed with wall to wall people.  There were lines everywhere.  We stood in one of the lines for about 10 minutes.  The lines were going nowhere.  In fact, some of the lines were getting backed up because folks were letting others cut in front of them.  Very uncool!!

They should have a system in place to bring order to the madness whenever the place gets so freakin crowded!!  I enjoyed watching the disorganization for awhile, but after 10 minutes I had enough.  So we joined other people and simply left.

Would return based on their impressive Yelp rating and number of reviews.

I will just wait for a time when they are less chaotic.  Til then, just 1 star baby."}
{"text":"Love hate relationship here!!!!


Hate the 1 hour wait on charleston and 2 to 4 hours at the strip!

The stupid lines !!!

Love the food though!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are yummy.  The al pastor tacos are my favorites.  Service is painfully slow.  If you want a taco asada and taco al pastor, you have to stand in 2 lines.  You will easily spend an hour and a half in line.  So for that reason, this place fails.  Probably won't be coming back unless its at an unusual hour to avoid the lines. So the verdict?  Great tacos, but not good enough to spend hours standing in line."}
{"text":"Always a must when in Vegas or San Diego! The al pastor tacos (adobada) are too die for!"}
{"text":"I had HIGH expectations when I came but disappointed after trying the food. 

- Carne asada meat tasted way too smoky 
- Carne asada fries are not worth $10! Lacks pico de gallo. Albertos/Albatras/Alertos are way better! 

+ Only meat that was good was abodaba

Tips
*There are different lines for the meat 1) asada 2) adobada 3) lengua, cabeza, etc. 
*Grilled peppers & onions are free, just got to ask for it. 
*You might be able to order some carne asada tacos in the abodaba line (just ask the worker if you can add it to your order)"}
{"text":"No vegetables nor rice nor beans.  Abodabo was amazing. Too expensive for what you get.   $2.25 per taco, should be like $1.50 at most with the kind of place it is.  No explanation of how line works and with such long lines it is ridiculous process because you will not want to go in each line to try something different.  Could be so much better experience.  I got a tostado thinking there would be some lettuce but no that was the worse thing. Sopes was great though."}
{"text":"They would get 5 stars if they had a more effects ordering system. There's 3 different lines depending on what type of meat you prefer. So for example, if you want carne asada, tripa, and adobada then you'll have to stand in 3 different lines. So either don't be in a hurry or bring ppl with you to help you stand in line. That being said, I only come here for the Adobada (al pastor or spicy pork). This is by far my favorite taco that I've ever had. Make sure to get the fresh piña (pineapple) pieces on your taco. The sweet, savory and slightly spicy go well together. 

Avoid the Saturday lunch hours the lines are very long."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The food is the best classic Mexican food I have ever had. I wish we had more of these in vegas. I tip every time I come cause the food is great, the people there awesome and everything is jist great. 

I always always get the adobada tacos. Usually I get 8 just for myself hahah. Its really good stuff. I love tacos el gordo"}
{"text":"My favorite tacos in Las Vegas. This is a great location because it's bigger than there others. This place is always busy but I'm a strong believer that, that's always a good sign.. it means you're about to eat GOOD. Tacos are always loaded. Fries are good. Ask for grilled veggies and salsa otherwise they won't offer it. Sooo the only complaint is the set up to order. If you come alone, and want 3 different tacos expect to be in 3 different lines.. with the tacos from the first line cold. Plan for this. Split your party up & know how many each person needs to order to have fresh tacos."}
{"text":"I had such a fantastic experience the first time when it was on the strip near the Wynn that I crave it whenever I come to Vegas. I was very disappointed to find out after coming out of the XS that the location changed to somewhere far off strip. Finally when I had a car in Vegas, I took full advantage of it and drove over for a mid-afternoon snack. You definitely need to make the drive when you can to Tacos El Gordo. The Adobada fries are amazing!

The line system is kind of inconvenient. If you want Adobada/Al Pastor and Asada you have to wait in 2 different lines. If you want buche/lengua/tripa it's another line. So if you want a variety of meats, you could potentially be standing in 3 long lines. I recommend that you come with a group so you can split yourselves into each line. I wanted tripa tacos, but i decided against it because it meant I would have to wait an additional 30 minutes and I was on a time crunch."}
{"text":"After all my trips to Vegas, I always wanted to try something that I could only get in Vegas, so I've steered away from Tacos El Gordo. After my drunk friends kept talking about tacos ALL NIGHT at the club, we decided to leave the club early to eat here. After leaving Encore, some of us stumbled to Tacos El Gordo to grub on some Adobada (Spicy Pork) Fries and Asada tacos. The Adobada was very good although some pieces were dry. I've had better Asada, but when it's doused in guacamole and sour cream, it'll taste x times better."}
{"text":"OMg ... of course I had to visit them... I PREFer this one wayyyy better than San Diego ones......... Had Tacos de tripa..... yummy yummy      and al pastor...with a can coke... super deliciously Goooooood!!!!!!!!!

love it...   had them Saturday and Sunday... make sure to order a quesadilla only with cheese... super delicious"}
{"text":"They have a confusing system of ordering first at one of the two cooking stations then paying at one of the two cashier stations you hope have an employee at them so you know where to pay. I was so confused for the first 10 minutes I was there. That, and my arm got burned by a fleck of something that came off the grill across the way while I was just waiting for my food. I asked for a cup for water and was given one, but they didn't have a dispenser for water at either of their two drink fountains! I tried pulling the little tab under the Sprite that is normally water, but all I got was super flat and disgusting tasting Sprite. I  was super irritated!

Apart from that, the spicy pork tacos are epically amazing and deserve 5 stars alone. I wasn't a fan of any of the other tacos.

I soooo had wished my experience would've been better so I could justify going back here for more tacos. Make sure to ask for everything on them, cause the extra additions and sauces make the tacos taste so much better."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat tacos, Baja California style. This place is always packed, the food is deliciously great. Good parking space, music, and great food at a reasonable price. First time I tasted these tacos was almost ten years ago, in San Diego Ca. Finger locking good."}
{"text":"I love meat on a stick!  The adobada tacos are so juicy and delicious.  Odd selection of sodas - they have fountain horchata and whips along with the normal Coke products."}
{"text":"OK, so this place is my all time favorite taco place EVER! The food is amazing. Once you actually get it. The ONLY downfall is the HUGE ASS LONG LINE! There's one person cutting and serving the meats. Completely inefficient. It literally takes an hour to get your food if it's busy. Which I have never been there when it's not. The mulas are to die for though! The carne asada, cabeza, and lengue tacos are good, but the buche is amazing! So having to stand in line is definitely worth it, but aggravating none the less. And I'll definitely be back. Usually once a week. Yes, it's THAT good! Just wish it wasn't so aggravating standing in line forever and trying to get a table."}
{"text":"It was ok. Read all the hype on here but personally the meat and the salsa were way too salty, otherwise, I think it would've been great. The Mula was yummy (aside from the meat being too salty it was bearable because the guacamole and cheese kind of balanced it out I guess)! I'm glad the salsa wasn't too spicy. The horchata is delicious. Lines get pretty long. Read the signs... Don't get in the wrong line. We ate in the car because all the seats were occupied in the restaurant. I loved the tortillas, yellow corn tortillas - my fave! Very decent prices I must add!!"}
{"text":"Adobada! The tacos, but especially the fries. I heard this place gets really crowded but we came on a Saturday night after clubbing and there wasn't a wait. The set up means you order at the counters first (to be honest, was confused about where to line up because there are different sections), pick up your food, and then pay at the register (at an opposite corner of the restaurant). It's so very tempting to eat the food while you're in line to pay. 

As for the food, I got the tacos adobada (I believe this is their spicy pork), which was delicious. The slightly green sauce is really yummy and the standout is definitely the meat. However, one of my friends got the adobada fries and the portion is big and delicious. Love the combination of fries, cheese, sauce, and meat! Would definitely recommend this.

All in all, a pretty perfect place to eat after a night of drinking. The staff are friendly and work quickly to get your orders (though the set up is a little weird). And the adobada tacos and fries! The food is so yummy, our Lyft driver also stopped there to eat after dropping us off!"}
{"text":"Good food, don't let the line of people discourage you. Depending on the kind of meat you want. I had al pastor and my husband had asada. We formed two lines and the food was excellent. Don't forget you are in Vegas and you can bring your own BEER!!! Tacos were great and the mulitas were better."}
{"text":"Delicious food but stupid restaurant organization and layout. There are 4 different lines you have to get in depending on what protein you want. Doesn't make any sense after waiting 15-20 minutes in line just to be limited in what you can or can't get. Frustrating experience!

But damn it, the food is bomb. The tacos, quesadilla, and the cam-something fries all hit the spot. I would happily eat here again now that I know how to work this system."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos were on the docket for our Vegas trip, and Tacos El Gordo had been recommended to us by more than one person. We knew we had to make this a stop!

The tacos were really well priced, one of our cheapest meals in Vegas. But the quality was definitely high! The meats really shine, with deep flavors and spices. The toppings are bare, but that allowed for the pure flavors to come through. You can't go wrong with options, but I really liked my chorizo and carne asada tacos. Be sure to snag some limes and radishes by the door!

For a late lunch, each of us had 3 tacos. We arrived around 3/3:30pm, so there were minimal lines.

I like where this one is situated - at the top portion of the Strip. It's refreshing to see another part of the Strip (though I definitely suggest getting off the Strip entirely). It's much less hectic on this part."}
{"text":"Must have tacos! Wait is very very long but definitely worth it. I had the asada fries and they weren't all that, but the tacos were very delicious. They also give you a side of grilled pineapple, onions & jalapeños. Pure perfection #TeamAdobada  had more flavor than the asada. Lol"}
{"text":"AMAZING TACOS ALL DAY LONG! The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is due to the ridiculous wait times to get food and then you have to get in line again to pay. They need a better way to expedite."}
{"text":"Just how I remembered it tasting in Baja Mexico! Damn the line is freaking long though if you come during regular hours! The wait was 45 mins at 3am!!!

Bomb ass tacos, but I'm not sure I'm gonna wait for this again."}
{"text":"The only really worthwhile meat is the adobada but its great.  The sauce and toppings really complete the perfect package.  Love the crispy tostadas as alternative to tacos.  Asada is fair.  I've been to all 3 locations in Vegas many times.  Sometimes the cashiers make the process too long esp on Las Vegas Blvd.  I've had experiences of rude cashiers."}
{"text":"adobada fries.
amazing. 
adobada everything. you'll be surprised how good it is. 
A vegas trip isn't complete unless I stop here. 
If you tip, they often give you more meat. :)
adobada fries"}
