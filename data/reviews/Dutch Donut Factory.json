{"text":"The donuts here are amazing! My kids love to try different ones every time we go and they have never been disappointed. My husband also really likes their ham and cheese croissant."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The owners were so nice and very accommodating. We came right before it was going to close and they were still happy to serve us and let us sit here. Excellent service excellent food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"These are some seriously good donuts and the people that work there are always happy and smiling. Every time I go in the evening they throw in a few extras. I won't get donuts anywhere else."}
{"text":"Wide selection of delicious donuts. I tried the ham, egg and cheese sandwich today and it was awesome. I've been here many times and the donuts are always soft and fresh.
Staff is very friendly also"}
{"text":"This has become our new weekend tradition to grab some donuts and a boba tea. We found this place a couple months ago and have loved it everytime. The staff there is extremely friendly and welcoming and of course all the donuts are delicious! If you haven't stopped in before, definitely check it out and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The donuts here are fantastic.  Some of the best I've ever had.  On my first trip I got something that looked like a giant bear claw, but was filled with some cinnamon gooey stuff and apples.  It was divine.  We've also sampled the glaze, chocolate covered, cake, sugar.  All great."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts my family has ever had. Their glazed donuts are so so good. My husband loves cake donuts and finds it hard to find good ones and Dutch Donut Factory makes the best chocolate frosted cake donuts. The staff is always friendly and they almost always throw in an extra donut. When we have friends or family come to town we always get some donuts and everyone thinks they are awesome."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name, it is possible to eat healthy foods at this establishment. The manager was very nice and offered me a lot of drink choices that were both nondairy and fruit-based. I was able to put together a low carbohydrate soy coconut smoothie that was both delicious and healthy. I'm very happy to come here again knowing that this place caters to everyone."}
{"text":"Best Doughnuts in Mesa!!! The Owner is awesome as well great quality service. Go try it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Apparently we went here on an off day. We decided to stop in and try this new neighborhood donut shop. We ordered a berry smoothie, French Vanilla Iced Coffee and two old fashioned donuts. The smoothie was tasteless, the iced coffee was too sweet and the donuts were crunchy and tasted like grease dipped in sugar glaze. The boy (11 or 12 years old) that waited on us was very efficient and nice. Won't be back. We threw everything out, wasn't edible."}

TOASTED COCONUT CREAM FILLED 

Ok, I'll elaborate: I am a chocolate fan and my go-to anywhere else is a Boston Cream and if that's not an option, it is anything with chocolate. This coconut doughnut has me changing my ways, though.

The coconut adds those nutty and sweet flavors as well as another texture. The filling is actually like the custard filling of a Boston cream, not just whipped cream. It is heavy, so I pair it with a straight black coffee. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great local donut shop! I tried the fritter and a buttermilk....they were delicious. The other regular customers are known by name and even though we were newbies, we were treated like regulars. This is a great location and I will be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Donuts were very yummy! Nice small family owned place with a lot of options. Only negative is that they do not sell any actual Dutch desserts, ie Dutch letters"}
{"text":"Best donuts and closer to my house. I used to have to go all the way to krispy cream to get a decent donut, well not anymore.

I usually get the coconut donuts and they are the best plus usually they give you extra donuts here and there."}
{"text":"This place has the best donuts I've ever had, and I've tried a lot of donuts!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and always delicious- I'm never disappointed. Definitely the best place to get donuts"}
{"text":"This place is pretty small, but they have a lot of donut choices. They also sell boba (Asian drink). The place is cozy. My kids loves it. I'm not a big donut fan but they got good flavors. Definitely coming here next time.
Good customer service."}
{"text":"Wow most delicious donuts I have ever tasted! I recommend the Buttermilk or simple twisted glaze. Any donut you decide on you can't go wrong. If you like Bosa Donuts you will LOVE Dutch Donut Factory!"}
{"text":"Finally! We found a good donut place. Haven't had a decent donut since leaving California. Just tried the chocolate long john and cinnamon roll and both were tender with great flavor. My husband had the apple fritter and it was good too. Very fluffy,fresh and great flavor."}
{"text":"Extremely extremely delicious and WELL worth the drive from ANYWHERE!!!! I LOVE donuts and have tried many many different donut shops and have very rarely comes across any great donuts. This place WAY exceeded my expectations with the phenomenal taste of the donuts! I bought the Bear Claw and I wanted more! The Apple Fritter was the best fritter that I've had in YEARS as well! The jelly filled were also amazing! I'm visiting from Texas and I'm going to be sad when I no longer have access to this donut shop. If you love donuts, then you NEED to try this place out!"}
{"text":"They are super clean, friendly, and who doesn't like a good doughnut?  They also have iced coffee, tea's, and other beverage's to compliment their WARM and FRESH doughnuts!  Oh, price was very reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"Pretty good donut place. 

The reason it gets 4 stars is because the toasted coconut cream filled donut is really amazing....one of the best donuts ever and I have never seen it at another donut shop."}
{"text":"Great spot. They donate their donuts in the evening after close which I love. The employee even gave us some as we entered the shop a little bit before closing! The thai iced tea boba is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went in at noon to get a treat with the kids. The place smelled amazing when you walked in and they still had a great selection of doughnuts left. We bought a bakers dozen (for only $10!!) and devoured one each before we left. My kids all declared it better than the old doughnut store (Bosas) and that anytime we buy doughnuts we must come back here. I are a chocolate long john that still tasted fresh and was perfect in my opinion. Now to resist eating the remaining doughnuts before dinner time..."}
{"text":"Such a delicious donut shop! I ate the coconut glazed Bavarian Creme donut and my friend got the Cinnamon sugar donut. It tasted so fresh and scrumptious that I can't wait to come back and tryout the other donuts as well as the boba tea drinks as maybe the other breakfast items. The service was excellent and the shop was extremely clean. I'm so happy that there is finally an amazing donut shop in East Mesa!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since Mesa Donuts opened up.  Maybe 2 years. Went here today driving right past Mesa Donuts b/c I just haven't been thrilled. OMG. New owners and the Donuts are as fresh as they come. This place is better than Bosa. I am happy for Dutch Donut and I will be going there for now on."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Ordered two smoothies, with boba (mango, and taro), as well as a sausage egg&cheese croissant. It was delicious  . This is 5 mins from my house. I typicality go to Street, which is a 15 mins drive for me. I'm glad I tried this place out, I will definitely come again, and it may be my new boba spot"}
{"text":"After many many visits now (Every Saturday Siri puts \"8 minutes to Dutch Donut Factory\" right on my lock screen), I must amend: these are the best donuts I have had in my life. I eat a lot of donuts. Gonna give it to you straight. I'm hip with Voodoo and Psycho. I'm down with the Donut Man in Glendora. I know the hipster croissant business from New York. I've been to Hurts. I worked at a stinkin Krispy Kreme in high school. I. Know. Donuts. And Dutch Donut Factory is the best all-around donut place I have ever visited.

Some tells for really good donuts:
 The glaze doesn't start to decompose, and it breaks and cracks in a brittle, crystalline fashion. It's not gelatinous. It doesn't taste like shortening.
 The fry leaves the outside crisp -- that special brown texture only fried food has -- while the inside remains fluffy and not soggy with oil. This crispy outside layer is deeper for cake donuts, but again, is not accompanied by greasiness nor an undercooked middle. The magic is in getting temperatures and fry times just right
 Fritters still have some fluff to them
 Pink frosting is berry flavored!
 There's a little bit of chew to the yeast donuts. They don't just disintegrate into greasy nothingness like Krispy Kremes. They're not chewy. They are remarkably fluffy. But they've got this...I guess it's a slightly glutinous quality about them. Again, it's about getting your water/yeast/rise times/temps all exactly right. Not a magic ingredient thing so much as a precise process thing.

So anyway, I love this place."}
{"text":"Wow the cashier must have been 10 maybe 11 years old! I understand family owned business, when it comes to my money I would like an adult at the register. Upsets me when someone just hands you back a handful of money and doesn't know how to count it back!  Customer service 101 is smile thank the customer for the business and count your change back! furthermore I Arrived at 10 o'clock and are pretty much out of donuts!  Don't know if there be second chance for this establishment

March 2nd 2015 - Upgrading my 2 star review to a 3 Star.  Owner contacted me and asked me to come back in and reevaluate Dutch Donut Factory.  I'm a small business owner and with that said the Owner shows they care about customer service.   I will stop by one day and have another go at it, I'm all about small Business."}
{"text":"Was in the area and I just had to try their boba milk tea! They have many varies of milk tea including thai tea! I had the regular boba milk tea and it was absolutely awesome!!! I also grab some donuts while I was in, and they are amazingly good! The owner was so kind to even just give me a free sample of their donut holes (7 pieces) for free. They were so kind and present manners including their kids! I will have to stop by again if I come back to mesa! I recommend this place to all donut lovers!"}
{"text":"I just have to add a review just to give Dutch Donut Factory some love. I have been going here for about 4-5 months. Once you have these donuts there really isn't any reason for you to go anywhere else for your sweet bread fix. I myself love donuts, my wife however, LOVES donuts and she would agree these are by far the best donuts we have experienced in the East Valley. Do yourself a favor and don't waste the carbs and calories on mediocre donuts and get your DDF on!"}
{"text":"This donut shop was well worth the drive. I am on Val Vista & Baseline. After searching for a Donut shop, I settled on Dutch Donut. I went on Sunday morning around 6:45 or so. I ended up buying a Ham & Cheese Croissant, blueberry filled donut and a pumpkin donut. All three were wonderful. The blueberries tasted like real blueberries and not a filling or a puree. The Croissant was HUGE. Everything met my expectations. I will be returning on another early Sunday morning.

YUMMY, YUM, YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Aaaamazing!!  We got here at 10:30 am. And had the most delicious donuts, they were moist and flakey. The service was wonderful. My husband wanted a creme filled long John, they didn't make those, so she took one in back and  filled it for him.  On the spot!  I had the glazed donuts and one of the coconut creme filled!  It was absolutely wonderful!!"}
{"text":"By far the best donuts I've ever had. I love everyone I've tried. My new favorite are the buttermilk. I never really cared for them before. Also the fritters are delicious. Very friendly people. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh great...now I'm addicted! 

As I bit into my pink frosted doughnut I knew immediately this place is awesome!!! It was fresh and soft with the perfect amount of icing. We got glazed, white and pink frosted with sprinkles and donut holes. Not one tasted greasy or left that sugar film on the roof of your mouth you find at other doughnut stores!! The family is so nice! He even gave us free donut holes which was awesome!! I will be going back again and again. Thanks for making great doughnuts!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!  $10 for a \"baker's dozen\" of the best donuts we've ever had!!!  It's so nice when a friendly little mom and pop shop puts out such a great products.  We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"The donuts here are never a disappointment. Always fresh and tasty! The boba tea is always good as well. I've only had contact with one employee and she is always friendly. One aspect of the experience that seems less than stellar is the store environment. There is no music playing so there is nothing to help fill the silence inside the store. Overall the products and service are great and the experience could be enhanced with some music"}
{"text":"Donuts!! Who doesn't like them. 

Best yet, little mom and pop shops, even better. My family told me about this place a few times so when I was able to try it I did! 

The lady was super cute and nice, she was smiling all big. 

Donuts, croissant sandwiches, drinks, coffee....check them out!!"}
{"text":"Good, old fashioned donuts. Family owned. Simply yummy  better than the Winchels where I grew up . I can't say enough good things about these donuts."}
{"text":"BEST donuts I've ever had hands down. I drive 10 miles just for them. The owners are very nice too."}
{"text":"Donuts, Breakfast Sandwiches, Lunch Sandwiches, Drinks.  So many choices, try the croissant breakfast sandwiches, and coconut creme donut.  You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Love this little donut shop. The owners are so friendly and the donuts are some of the best I've ever had. Even their donut holes are delicious and so crazy inexpensive!"}
{"text":"The donut flavor selection is amazing. The coconut cream one is one of my favorites. The lady that usually works there is very nice and threw in a free little donut hole which was super nice. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Your donuts are the best donuts I have ever, ever ate from Illinois to Arizona. Your donuts are light and just melt in my mouth. You deserve a 10. I can't get over your delicious donuts!"}
{"text":"Amazing tasting donuts! Huge & delicious variety. Showed up @ 5 am and asked for a particular donut that wasnt ready yet n he hopped right on it. Gave us some donut holes while we waited. Great customer service. This guy is cool people. Had to hook him up w a nice $tip$ for his great hospitality. Definitely coming back a lot."}
{"text":"Smoothies are amazing here. I would recommend their strawberry and banana =) Their thai tea is good as well. Their boba though was a little firm and too chewy for my preference, but the lady did say that they just cooked them up for me, so perhaps they pulled them out of the pot a little prematurely."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Fourth of July to try out the new donut shop near me. I am easily going to return here and this will be my new stop for donuts. They are million times better than Dunkin' Donuts."}
{"text":"Don't know how but the donuts are awesome!! Breakfast sandwiches are pretty good as well. They definitely work to differentiate from the herd."}
{"text":"Love the Boba! Texture is right and the drinks are not drowned in sugar lol Try the pistachio milk tea! :D"}
{"text":"Best donut I have had in years. The glazed donuts are so light they almost float away. The filled donuts manage to be both light and densely filled. My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I asked for a jelly donut with powdered sugar. What she brought me was a hot freshly microwaved jelly donut that she put powdered snug at on that melted. Seriously WTF?"}
{"text":"These are not just the best donuts in the city, they're the best in the country. You can't just have one and you have to try the bear claws. The Apple filling is unlike anything I've had, cooked to perfection and filled to the brim.

The owners are friendly, the service is excellent you simply cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Great Donuts Period!  Maple flavored donut is very good."}
{"text":"Would give this place more stars, but I haven't tried my raspberry fritter yet. This review is for their drinks. Unfortunately, they use powdered flavoring a for their drinks. I was excited when she had said that they use \"real fruit\" in their fruit yogurt drinks. To my disappointment, even asking if she could add some extra blueberries, she poured in about 5-6 blueberries over about 2 ounces of a liquefied yogurt, added powdered flavoring a and ice and water, and there appeared my wonderful blueberry yogurt shake. No thanks.... Maybe I would come again for donuts."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS BOMB!!! Look, I'm not saying this place is necessarily a place I'd \"hang out\" at but everything they serve is simply awesome! You'll never want doughnuts from anywhere else again. Bubble Tea is here to if that's your deal!"}
{"text":"Expecting Dutch Donuts! These are ok but they are not Dutch donuts. There should be a notice that they are not what they claim. Couldn't ask questions because they didn't understand. Only had fat free half and half for coffee. Strange place to get so many raves."}
{"text":"The owner and his son stopped at my workplace with a box of samples earlier this week, along with a flier advertising 30% on May 30th...the samples were delicious, so I figured, what the heck?  I'm so glad I decided to go!  The store smells amazing even as you are walking up.  We were greeted kindly and offered samples.  We ended up walking out with a half dozen, very reasonably priced.  

These doughnuts are the absolute best I have had since I moved away from my hometown bakery 7 years ago.  Soft, incredibly flavorful, and so obviously made fresh and with care.  The lemon filling was lovely, sweet and zippy with actual zest in it; the blueberry filling had actual blueberries.  The apple fritter was delicious--the ones from the grocery store never seem to have quite enough cinnamon for my taste, but these were perfect.  They even have my favorite cinnamon-sugar cake doughnuts, that taste exactly like the ones I grew up getting from my small-town orchard bakery.

This place is a great addition to the neighborhood, and you can bet I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and gave this place a try this morning -- glad I did!  Nice selection of donuts.  The ones that I thought were especially good and/or interesting were:  raspberry fritter, toasted coconut topped with coconut cream filling, old-fashioned glazed with icing (I tried maple and berry), and glazed blueberry cake.  All the donuts I tried were great!  Reasonably priced at $9.49 for a baker's dozen."}
{"text":"Wanted to send my friend doughnuts and no one delivered to their location- so I called the Dutch doughnuts and they said they would go deliver the doughnuts!
LOL! They are awesome!"}
{"text":"Just one more obsession to have!  Dutch Donut Factory is a wonderful unexpected surprised tucked away in NE Mesa.  I stopped in out of curiosity.  What a wonderful place for a not so ordinary treat.  The donuts were amazing and Thai tea with boba in MESA?  I am hooked.  It is small with a little charm.  I hope they do great and cannot imagine why they won't! Check it out! (only thing I would change is the curtain thing going in the back, out of place!)"}
{"text":"Excellent donuts and service! Love the variety with smoothies and boba teas also offered.  And the price is very reasonable. Dutch Donuts Factory has become our new Saturday routine."}
{"text":"Some of the best donuts I've ever had! The buttermilk donut and glazed cake donut tasted like heaven. Also, you can get 12 donut holes for $1, which is an awesome deal and they are delicious. I have no problem driving 20 minutes to buy donuts from here!"}
{"text":"We go here every week for donuts! They have a wide variety to choose from and they are always fresh! I'm very picky about donuts and this is one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"This is a great local donut shop. Friendly staff and excellent donuts. Please, people, stop going to Dunkin Donuts and try this place. The fritters are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love donuts as do the rest of my bicycle riding group.  We love to plan our rides with a late stop at at Dutch Donuts.  Sometimes we add more calories than we burn, but thats what happens when you tast the best Donuts in the East Valley."}
{"text":"This donut shop is amazing.  I'm sure what kind of ingredients they use here, but the flavor and texture is waaaaaay better than any other donut shop.  Do yourself a favor and check this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best doughnut ever and service was friendly and great!  Needed this after a horrible experience next store at Chicagoland Hotdogs!"}
{"text":"Drove over from Apache yesterday afternoon really pumped to try this place  Arrived at 1:55pm but locked up tight with sign saying they would return by 3:55. Shelves full of delicious donuts inside but locked up tight. Arrggh. 
Went around the corner and bought a delicious cherry pie instead. 
Is this place closed every afternoon?"}
{"text":"Came here later in the evening one day and even though they were out of donut holes, the half dozen other donuts we got were soft and yummy! I like that even though we didn't get there first thing, the donuts didn't taste stale and the staff was patient while our kids took their time to pick out donuts. I'd definitely visit this donut place again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Their blended mocha boba was really good and they even gave samples of donuts out while we waited!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the owners are nice. We got 6 donuts consisting of maple bars, the apple crumble, jelly, and glazed. They were reasonably priced and pretty good. I have them four stars because they are good, but not as good as Bosa. I would rank them also slightly worse than Krispy kremes"}
{"text":"Looking for a new donut shop in Mesa? Look no further! Dutch Donut Factory makes donuts fresh in house and boy does it smell delicious when you walk in the door!

Their large case is filled with tons of donuts - you're guaranteed to find at least one (or 10) that you'll love! 

Not only do they have donuts they have a ham and cheese stuffed croissant - which are huge!

I tried the maple glazed, blueberry cake, apple fritter and toasted coconut cream filled - all of which were fresh! The maple glaze was so tasty and the blueberry cake was not overly sweet - they perfect donut if you're not a frosting fan.

I also order a Very Berry smoothy. It was made with whole fruits not a pre-made purée. It was smooth not icy - a great treat on a hot summer day

Dutch also has coffees, slush and Gelato!! 

Please give this great family owned shop a try - they owner Vee is a total sweetheart and put her heart into each donut she makes herself!!

Great addition to this strip mall :)"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the huge variety of donuts they had. The ladies that work there are wonderful and very attentive. This is a family favorite spot that we'll continue to keep going!"}
{"text":"Soooo good. We usually go here when we feel like donuts on Sunday morning. I love the wide variety. My 2-year-old LOVES getting a smoothie with boba. Even when it gets a little crowded service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Truly the best donuts I've ever had.  The quality of their donuts are miles above the chain restaurants.  However, the coffee and hot chocolate were  horrible.  If they could upgrade their hot beverage assortment, this is a one stop breakfast shop."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has such good reviews (in my opinion it deserves 5 stars). Every time I have gone, the owner always gives me a couple of donut holes, free of charge. I don't eat donuts often, but when I'm in the mood for one I'm fortunate enough to live just down the street from this place. Everyone in the Mesa area should come here at least once. Their coconut cream filled donuts are to die for. Their smoothies are amazing too. If I could write a million 5-star reviews for them, I absolutely would."}
{"text":"Wow!  I had these doughnuts several hours after my wife brought them home and they were stellar!  I am a fan of the kruellers or whatever they are called. They have the perfect blend of crispy and soft for me and seem to nearly melt in my mouth. 

I'm not sure how authentic this place is as far as Dutch bakery stuff goes but who cares?!  It's dang good!  I am giving my official Hansen (Dutch last name) stamp of approval.  What else do you need?

Oh yeah, you need a bag full of doughnuts from this place!"}
{"text":"Super fresh and super friendly family business. We had the peach black tea and taro tea, and several different donuts. Was a real treat!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after I saw some of the other reviews on Yelp.  Fantastic fritters & donuts.  Had a buttermilk donut which I had not had in forever.  It was was outstanding!  Raspberry Fritter & Boston creme were excellent.  Stop in and pick up your favorite.  Much much better than the chain donut shop or any supermarket bakery."}
{"text":"Maybe this place should be called \"Dangerous Doughnut Factory\" in lieu of their name due to the deliciousness of their goods. I bit into a strawberry glazed donut when I got home and it was so soft I swear it was like cotton candy. At that rate, I could probably consume the entire baker's dozen by myself. Great little shop with quite the selection to choose from. Hard to believe you can end up with a slightly crisp outside with a sugar floss like interior. I drove out of my way for these doughnuts and I can't say it wasn't worth it. Greeted immediately upon entry. I also ordered a pistachio smoothie with boba and that was the perfect drink to get me home."}
{"text":"If I wanted a fake smoothie made of powder with no fruit or flavor, I would go to McDonald's. Although, with that comparison, I feel like I'm giving McDonald's a disfavor. Also, rather slow service. Good donuts, though."}
{"text":"You're simply not going to settle for anything less than this place once you try it! To give you an idea: when my ex's dog died, I bought a dozen of assorted doughnuts from here for her. We are now great friends!!!!  It's in a really discreet location and very easy to drive past but it's definitely worth going out of your way for. Don't settle for the chain supermarket bakeries anymore, they just don't compare to Dutch Doughnut Factory."}
{"text":"My husband and I love getting our donut fix satisfied here. The donuts are delicious and not too sweet. They do not leave a film in your mouth. It is also nice to get a half dozen extra with the purchase of a dozen. I would make it 5 stars if there were more fritters available. :)"}
{"text":"Best donuts I have found in Mesa or AZ in the 28 years I've lived here! Excellent selection, Friendly people and YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I go here a lot I love the taro tea smoothie with  Boba there are days I crave it,the donuts are always fresh and tasty I gave 4 stars as they are short staffed on the weekends and sometimes I order smoothie and I get iced I tried to explain to her but the language barrier as well as her being the only one there gets in the way either way it's a great place"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The donuts are this perfect balance between soft and cake-like. Not as soft as Krispy Kreme but not as cake-like/doughy as Dunkin Donuts, Donut Peddler, Frys, etc. just perfect. The fillings and frosting are flavorful and delicious but typically not too sweet so you don't feel like you over did it. The fritters and bear claws and tiger tails are all amazing. Probably the best I've ever had and that includes all the delicious pastries I had while living in Boston. To top it off they often throw in an extra donut or two as a thank you. Couple that with the quality of donuts and I am a customer for life."}
{"text":"Yum. Need I say more. Boston creme. Twists coconut is to die for. Yumcan't wait,to get more later."}
{"text":"Very good. Just found this place..will be returning. Favorite is regular glaze. Yummy"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted a donut today, and usually I go to the grocery store and let her pick a donut or two from the bakery section. Today, my wife decided to look for a place that had fresh donuts and a great batter. (My wife is a big fan of raised donuts and has been to a number of other spots in the valley) we looked up best do it's and found DDF, and I must say my wife and daughters loved the donuts! The store was quaint and the family running the store were very friendly. The prices were very reasonable. The magic is in the donuts, VERY fresh and simple icings. 3 styles of donuts: raised, cake and old fashioned. Nice variety of icings. All in all a very pleasant trip to a donut shop. My girls will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here to try the boba milk tea and I got to say I'm glad that I found this new place closer to home. Not expensive at all either. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"Life is too short to eat bad doughnuts. 

I have eaten A LOT of doughnuts -- at least a dozen a week when I was in college -- and I tell you these are excellent!

Apple fritters? Check: just the right size and not greasy.

Old fashioned (no glaze)? Check: perfect for dunking in coffee.

Blueberry cake? Yes: looks like they use real blueberries and not a mix... Donuts are pinkish rather than the artificial purple at most shops.

Buttermilk? Nice: good buttermilk flavor.

Toasted coconut filled with coconut cream ... Never had that before, but it was very good, too.

All of the doughnuts we got were very fresh and the service was friendly and fast.

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Here you will find pretty much the best traditional donuts in the area. Dutch Donut Factory doesn't veer too far off the reservation as far as the types of donuts they offer. You wont find anything strange as they tend to stick to tried-and-true favorites - old fashioned, apple fritter, Boston creme, etc. But as far as those donuts go, they absolutely nail it. Their store is a bit far from my house but totally worth the trip and definitely better than grocery store donuts."}
{"text":"All of the excellent reviews are spot on. Toasted coconut creme and Boston creme were amazing. My wife prefers the sugar raised and cinnamon rolls and glazed (I'm not typically a fan of those types BUT they were also amazing) and she was very impressed. Service with a smile only makes it better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The atmosphere is bright and inviting,  the owner is very nice and friendly and the donuts are amazing! And just found out they selling hot breakfast sandwiches and pizza by the slice!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great Boba Tea drinks and their blueberry donut is one of my favorite treats. I also enjoy their apple and cherry fritters. Staff is always very friendly and helpful. I would recommend checking it out if you are looking for good quality donuts."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the east valley, period.  When I get a mad craving for a buttermilk bar, this is where I go, like a moth drawn to flame.  Their old-fashioned are to die for, too.  My kids like all different kinds of donuts, from cake to yeast to fritters, and my husband loves Boston creams.  We've never had anything that was less than amazing from this place.  And so fresh.  Stale is an unknown word here."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or lunch. The sandwich was fresh and loaded with meat. The dessert donuts were so fresh, so much to choose from. Bubble tea was good too."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING ! you will not be disappointed at all! Sometimes, they even hook it up with free donut holes"}
{"text":"This place has some great donuts and their breakfast sandwiches are also delish! They are always friendly and efficient. A great mom and pop shop which I am happy to support!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Donuts are always fluffy and delicious and they last longer than a couple hours before starting to harden."}
