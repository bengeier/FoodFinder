{"text":"Went with friends Friday night .Like the decor. Waited at bar and girl told us they did not a brand of scotch we asked for and luckily we insisted and what do you know they had it after all !!! The service was very slow and mediocre . The presentation of food was attractive but the food was very disappointing . Overall too expensive and not going to return there anytime soon ."}
{"text":"Great service for our large group on Saturday night. Good food, expensive but I thought worth it. Great atmosphere. Didn't stay for club portion of the night"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friends Birthday.  -our table wasn't ready on time  -the food is ridiculously overpriced (I had the lobster spaghetti)   -our table was by the kitchen entrance, so I was constantly being hit in the back.  -service was terrible for a fine dining restaurant (bottle service girls in denim skirts??)   Save your money."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but our errogant server made the experience poor.  It would have been better for him to keep his personal opinions and stories to himself."}
{"text":"Well located place in downtown.  The chill room is a nice idea and good to dine with a big group of friends. The room however needs more lighting and less speakers to make it more comfortable to eat and be able to converse.  The food and service are great.  Foie gras poutine was really good. Alaskan crab salad is delicious. Share a 1 kg t-bone with your friends, don't miss it.  A great place to dine and party afterwards."}
{"text":"Interesting design, the door almost looks like the place is under construction. The sub-basement locale is a bit strange, but the decor is interesting. We came for an early business dinner, the service was spot on. The bartender was very nice as well (and attractive, which doesn't hurt the eyes). The drinks were excellent. The food wasn't too great. They try to be too creative, and the result is interesting looking food with underwhelming taste. I ate here about 3 weeks ago, and I already forget what I ate it was so unmemorable."}
{"text":"Went there for my friend's bday and it was soooo much fun. The music is amazing, not 92.5 radio as in most clubs, the food was delicious and a very beautifully designed place."}
{"text":"At first impression I was surprised at the low rating bc of beautiful interior designing and nice atphsphere.  Then the food arrived and I understood why. Terrible effort.. Half cooked and flavourless. Impractical dishes (we had this tree that we literally had to stand up to cut) . Way too pricey for what it is worth."}
{"text":"I hadn't been in over 25 years since when it was the Peel Pub. The staff is super eager and continuously checking in to see how things are. We got there about 8 and it was ok but wait until 11ish and it really gets going. The food was good, we had the steak tartar and grilled steak dish. The salad was drenched in too much vinaigrette."}
{"text":"I went to Soubois on a Thursday evening with a group of friends, it was my first time going there in a context other than professional networking, so I was curious to see what would be different.  Soubois is easily accessible, very close to the Peel metro station. The entrance is very sober compared to the main room adorned with a beautiful indoor forest and gorgeous paintings.  Given that we were there for a 5 to 7, we were able to order from their $22 menu (2 choices), therefore, I ordered the spaghetti with lobster as well as grilled octopus, I've also added a bourbon cocktail, oysters and a bottle of white wine. The alcohols and oysters were perfect, however, I must admit that the rest of the dishes were quite bland ... really really bland.  Overall, there is a high probability that I will return to Soubois because the atmosphere is good and I always get very good service, however, I was disappointed with my food."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés un samedi soir (12.11) pour le resto + le club.  - Nous avions réservé pour 21h30 et on nous avait bien précisé qu'il fallait être à l'heure car sinon, si on avait plus de 5mn de retard, on donnait notre table à quelqu'un d'autre. Finalement, à 21h30, la table n'était pas prête, et nous avons du attendre jusqu'à 22h. - Pour s'excuser, on nous a offert 1 verre chacun, ce qui était apprécié - Une fois qu'on a eu notre table, le service a été trèèès long... Nous avons eu l'entrée vers 22h30 puis le plat principal vers 23h30 me semble.. vraiment long, nous n'en pouvions plus d'attendre.. - Pour s'excuser, on nous a offert 1 shooter chacun, ce qui était apprécié - Vers minuit et demi, nous avons terminé (enfin!) puis commencé à tester la piste de danse. Nous avons aimé l'ambiance, la configuration de l'endroit et la musique. Par contre, il n'y avait pas trop de place, les gens étaient tout le temps en train de circuler, les serveurs aussi, ce qui fait qu'on est tout le temps dérangé quand on est en train de danser.. à moins de prendre une table à 900$ la bouteille bien sûr.. Il y a aussi une 2e salle avec quelques plantes au plafond (j'étais un peu déçue, je m'attendais à plus de plantes que ça quand on m'avait dit qu'il y avait une super déco de plantes de type jungle). Cette salle fait seulement bar et endroit pour danser nous a t il semblé. Bonne musique aussi et les gens paraissaient un peu différent que dans la salle principale (en mieux..). Bref, avis mitigé, je sais que c'est LA place à la mode mais peut etre parce qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de choix non plus pour manger puis clubber dans le centre ville?! En tout cas, je n'ai pas été émerveillée..."}
{"text":"Soubois is excellent for its vibe and crowd. Soubois (as of September 2015) is the place to be seen, according to my Montreal based friends. On a Saturday night, the place was packed with great looking people. The cocktails were delicious and their wine offering was extensive. I easily found a few of my favorite reds on the list and devoured a bunch.  As for food, there are some dishes that seem to be better than others. I particularly enjoyed the decadent poutine (with foie gras, wild mushrooms, cheese curds and gravy). The seafood platter with oysters, crab cakes, mussles and clams were quite nice also. I was mixed on the charcuterie platter - while I thoroughly enjoyed the foie gras pate and cold cuts, I didn't enjoy the pickled peppers spread along the length of the platter - I felt like it detracted from the spread. I was also left mixed feeling about the mains. I had a mushroom spaghetti. The sauce, the mushrooms and spaghetti itself were pretty good. But the large dollop of mozzarella took away from the rest of the dish. The steaks that many others in my dining party ordered did not particularly look appealing to me either.   In any case, I would recommend this venue for a dinner and/or drinks for its very cool vibe!"}
{"text":"SOOO, reservation for 8 and got sat at 9 meanwhile there was no body else in the place.  The mr. Lagault appetizer was delish but not wildly good. My risotto was very very bland, no part of the dish was done right. Pretty upsetting for the price it was. The service was decent. The dessert platter was hilarious, everything tasted like refrigerator and like it was bought from a supermarket bakery. Others got the chicken and the steak and were also not impressed, the chicken was only a tad more special than the grocery store roasted chicken and the potatoes tasted like tap water."}
{"text":"Hands down amazing! From our server who was so sweet to the delicious warm bread and the food! We had venison and a cucumber roll and the lobster Mac and cheese. Will definitely be going back!  Also the restaurant has a \"forest\" type feel with wooden trees inside it also turns into a night club in the evening so you get dinner and a party!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette party. Food was GREAT!!!!  Service was TERRIBLE the waitress was such a B. I don't know what her problem was but if you can't handle the stress you shouldn't be working at a busy restaurant.   Moving on to the evening....Soubois turns into a night club. The music was TERRIBLE.   I believe the best moment of the night eating the seafood platter and of course the company."}
{"text":"Only good thing about it is the decor. Food is horrible. Once you finish dinner you have to leave your table to be seated at a different table for bottle service which is very disorganized. It took 45 minutes to get set up. Needless to say will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and great ambience.   The food is delicious, I had half dozen oysters to start off and the chicken. The chicken was fantastic as it was tender and juicy. Be sure to ask for bread to dip it in their sauce.  As for the service, it was friendly and attentive.  I highly recommend dining at Soubois if you haven't yet.  P.S their parties at night is a must if you enjoy nightlife. Best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Summary A largely empty but cozy restaurant that turns into a club subtly reminiscent of a middle school dance.  I'm sure Montreal has better places.  I wouldn't waste money here.  Food I'd have to say the food here is kinda subpar, especially for the prices they're charging.  I came here with a large party of 11 and we got a bunch of large samplers.  The seafood sampler was kind of okay except for the armored lobsters.  The claws were nearly impossible to crack, even for my large fore arm muscles.  The hard work wasn't even rewarded since the lobster pretty bland.  The main meat sampler was also not too great with several meats that were largely tasteless.  I'm pretty disappointed here.  Atmosphere During dinner and drinks this place has a cozy feel despite being largely devoid of other clientele.  Once the club bit started, it seemed a lot like a middle school dance.  Groups stayed largely to themselves.  I expected more out of this place.  Service The one bright spot was the service.  The server kept our waters refilled and didn't let me see the bottom of my wine glass."}
{"text":"Delicious and beautiful food, trendy location.    For a large group of guests (~10+) make sure to reserve the speakeasy room for a fun and intimate experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Soubois twice now and had high expectations for this new place in town.   The first time was for drinks (top tip is to call for guestlist or else you probably won't get in) and I found the decor to be really nice. The pros were that the drinks were good, ambiance nice. The crowd and dress code seemed a bit eclectic with a variety of nice dressed people in business chic attire and random hipster attire (when jeans are so ripped that they touch the ground are they shorts?). One big con was the limited space to navigate inside and literally no space to throw down a couple wiggles. Half a section was taken by some \"VIP event\" so could just be bad luck as well...  Second visit was for dinner with colleagues. I had a plate with assortments of meats and fois gras and lobster spaghetti. I found the service really great but I was left wanting more in the dish for the price. It was tasty, proportions average but not enough for me to want to go back there.   Overall, it is a nice place to bring a date for the ambiance and chic setting but I feel it is a bit overhyped and the food not worth the price bracket."}
{"text":"I had high hopes coming here due to the hype around this new place. I was impressed upon arriving due to the decor and cozy atmosphere, after that however it all went downhill. I had made a reservation a week prior for 9pm for dinner and was not seating until 10pm. I was also told that I had my table until 11:45 which I understood....... When I was supposed to be seated at 9. Immoderately at 11:45 we were told to leave our table. I said we would in 10 minutes when we finished our drinks. Apparently that wasn't good enough because 3 minutes later the waiter was back motioning us to another table to finish our drinks. We were at our new location for about 1 minute before another waitress came to us and told us we had to move (we still had not finished our drinks). Again I said give us 10 minutes to finish and we will leave, not happening. All to say the experience was mediocre at best although the waitress tending to our drinks was very sweet and so were the hostesses. The food: meh. I had the tuna special and it was bland and rough. Go here for the atmosphere. Nothing else. And don't forget to reserve way in advance."}
{"text":"We went there last Saturday and they told me it was full. Instead of telling us to come back another night, they decided to find a place for us tuck in a small spot in a corner of a bar away from the decoration. We went there for the decor and the ambiance, possibly the food. Needless to say, we left without ordering anything. The treatment from them toward us was terrible...  How could the hostesses put us in that spot when they know it is not a spot they, themselves, will choose for themselves?  I appreciate the effort to accommodate us, it is not a great first experience for us... We went to Firegrill instead and the customer service was superb!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst restaurant I have been to this year quality vs price wise!  Went there on Saturday for a friend's birthday. I read some bad reviews online already so I was already expecting overpriced mediocre food.   Ordered the lobster spaghetti and it came with a tiny lobster craw and that was it! The rose sauce was overly creamy and heavy without any actually flavour. Did I mention that he spaghetti cost $38?!?   Tried some of the fries and poutine others ordered and it wasn't any better.  The decor is nice but that's about it. The waiter didn't come once to ask if we were ok.  If you are going to spend over $60 on a meal, please do yourself a favour and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The club is real fun BUT awful line control and almost no respect. We had to wait for an hour and a half with no explanation even though we had a reservation and honestly no one helped. People with no reservations definitely got a spot way before we did. Also, after we got in we had to wait another good half an hour just to order. Go if you are really patient."}
{"text":"The good: the decor was nice.  The bad:   -Arrived at 8PM for our 8PM reservation. Was told the room wasn't ready yet (even though we were the only people in the restaurant. I guess they wanted us to buy drinks at the bar for an hour. We were seated at 9PM.   -paid 63$ before tip for a half roasted chicken and some mixed greens. The chicken was cooked fine. The potatoes it came with were bland as heck. It was supposed to come with fiddle heads there were none. Extremely disappointing meal.  My girlfriend ordered the mushroom and asparagus risotto which had no flavour and was inedible.   Overall it's overpriced and pretentious. It's not a place to go for dinner. It's a club if you're into club life. There are so many good restaurants in Montreal. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"My girlfriends wanted to try this place out for a Saturday night out.  First, the positive points: beautiful decor and atmosphere.  Now, the negative points: food was disappointing. Everything sounded delicious on paper, but flavours were not on point. My pear, endive and blue cheese salad was delish, but seriously, how can you mess up a salad? As for my main meal, the lobster spaghetti, besides the fact that it was served cold for me and two of my girlfriends, flavours were bland. It needed a heck of a lot more cheese. I must say though, that when we complained about everyone's plates being cold, the waitress sincerely apologized and offered to warm them up, but who wants reheated lobster..."}
{"text":"Lovely decor I would recommend to just come here to take that in and for drinks. Food was like mediocre but interesting."}
{"text":"The service is great since they constantly refill your water.  The atmosphere is very beautiful. This is the old Club Element. They did major renovations since then. The cell phone reception is still very poor since its underground.  The alcohol drink portions are tiny. The food portions are also on the small side. I came with a group of friends and I can say that about many different types of dishes. Although the food was quite delicious! And my friend's halibut looked amazing. I would probably get that if ever I came back.  This restaurant is on the expensive side.  Apparently the place turns into a club after."}
