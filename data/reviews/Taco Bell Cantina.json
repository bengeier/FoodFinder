{"text":"Right next to the new and improved Public Square, the Taco Bell Cantina goes above and beyond expectations. With the twisted freezers, you have the choice of spiked lemonade, margarita, and Baja blast with the choice of either rum, vodka, or tequila. For only $6, I was tempted to get one of each, but you're only allowed one at a time, which is understandable. Not only do you have the drinks, but the whole food menu at your disposal. The lines were long, but quick and the vibe was very upbeat and energetic. Workers were very friendly and by far the best Taco Bell service I've ever had. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"They don't have cinnamon twists, but you can get alcohol and beer that fills from the bottom so that's a plus. U ique take on taco Bell for sure."}
{"text":"If I could give you -100 stars, I would. We came here at 5:30pm when it was completely empty and my friends purse was stolen. Management didn't seem to care, no one lifted a finger, everyone stared at us with blank eyes, and the security guard tried to kick my friend out when she started crying (I had to stay and calm him down, of course she started crying her purse was just stolen!). Someone told me this happens a lot at this restaurant SO BEWARE. Honestly, it's just a taco bell that serves alcohol. When the purse was \"miraculously\" found by the security guard 20 minutes later in the men's bathroom trash can (of course the one place I couldn't look), the entire Taco Bell staff looked at us like we were diseased when we walked in, while the manager stared at us from the corner texting on his phone. Have you ever heard of customer service? Being apologetic? Don't waste your time coming here, and go to any of the other millions of Taco Bell locations. I am beyond appalled."}
{"text":"What a let down. I stopped in at 5:30 on a Saturday evening and every table was filthy, it was small and nothing like it looked online. I understand it's a Taco Bell, but at least clean the place. Hopefully it closes soon and something better goes in its place."}
{"text":"Omg. Absolutely the best and I brought my kids. Taco meat was different than the standard taco bell tacos so that was a plus. They had a DJ spinning with great hip hop music and a great vibe. They even have adult beverages such as Mountain Dew slushies with vodka or draft beer. What a fun place! I will be back the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, beautiful open kitchen, very nice workers and fun music. The alcohol didn't hurt either. Music was a bit loud, but it didn't bug me much. Food came out hot and perfect, not sloppy at all for how busy it was at 10pm on a weekend. Would definitely come back next trip!"}
{"text":"Big Taco Bell fan so when we went to Las Vegas the week of my Bday this was a must go to spot! Food was fresh and delicious. Slushy beverage was good but weak. Only complaint is the employees were more concerned about visiting with one another to bother to take my order or get it correct. :-/"}
{"text":"The food is fresh. The staff do decent work but they seem overworked and in need of more help. For a company to launch a \"hot and new\" store and understaff it is a little disheartening, especially since the lines were long and the demand was there.   Hopefully they hire more people and keep it around!   Prices are normal. Good deal. Just need more staff to support the demand."}
{"text":"This location was very small with hardly any seating and very packed. The service was lousy but the food was typical expected Taco Bell. I liked that there was outside seating so you were able to watch the people walk by on the strip while eating."}
{"text":"Bottemline, it's Taco Bell with alcohol!  FOOD: The food is exactly the same as you would buy it at any other Taco Bell. Only difference is the food is served in a tray instead of a bag. If you are as crazy about Taco Bell as me, then you now have a little fancier Taco Bell to hang out at.  DRINK: Have no fear, you can now enjoy your tacos with a nice beer. The beer here is really cool to watch them fill up. The beer cup is place on the dispenser and the beer will actually fill from the bottom up. A nice souvenir magnet is placed at the bottom of the cup to serve the beer. Even \"cooler,\" you can now get an array of Taco Bell Freezes with alcohol. Yes, Baja Blast with Bacardi is a thing! If you don't want alcohol, the freezes can be made virgin or you can get a drink from their unique sodas on tap fountain.  ATMOSPHERE: The counter where you order is where the magic happens. The freezes are in the Taco Bell sign behind the counter each representing a different letter. There is a sode blubbler above the counter that is mesmerizing to look at. They have Taco Bell merch in the place for you to show your Taco Bell spirit. There is seating outside on the patio or upstairs. They have large TVs so yes, you can eat Taco Bell, drink beer, and watch the game;)  Overall, it's not as special as everyone makes it. It's a little inconvenient to make your way here just for Taco Bell. It's a cool concept and definitely worth a try, but in the end, it's just eating Taco Bell food that you can get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Came here because it was new and I saw the video online about it lols I got the $5 craving box and it came with two tacos, a burrito, nachos, and a medium drink. I substituted the drink for one of their twisted alcoholic drinks. They have a bunch of frozen drinks in the machines and you can choose what kind of shots you want in them. These are $10, a bit steep cause the cups are that big. The cravings box was a very good deal, it came with a good amount of food. I shared with a friend and it was quite filling. I don't think I would've been able to finish one on my own."}
{"text":"Just went here yesterday and it was the highlight of my trip! first off, it is super easy to find and as soon as you walk in you feel like your in a club! there is colorful lights all over with music blasting. the baja blast with vodka is AMAZING! i never want a baja blast without alcohol again. my food was also so good. taco bell is always pretty good, but this food tasted really really fresh. it was  a really cool experience and place. i wish they would open one here in San Diego!"}
{"text":"At the end of the day, it's still Taco Bell so you can only expect so much.  I will say this though, probably the best Taco Bell I've ever eaten... and I was sober.  Cool experience. DJ booth while drinking a Baja freeze with rum. Gotta love it"}
{"text":"ordered food online (big mistake) the official taco bell website said they open at 6am, I got there at 10:39am and the doors were locked. I had to go back 20 minutes later to claim my food and the cashier ignored me for 2 minutes while he had a conversation with another cook. i finally got my food and it was cold. hands down the shittiest fast food place."}
{"text":"I went to this Taco Bell with someone else's wife.  What happens in Vegas, right?  We went there because I wanted three crunchy tacos and she wanted a cheesy gordita crunch and a crunch wrap supreme.  We didn't realize it was actually a night club!  Neither of us was disappointed at all.  There was a huge Persian influx this particular evening.  There were a lot of high slits and deep V's.  The aroma was perfect.  It was a great combo of seasoned beef and Acqua di Gio.  Romance was definitely in the air.  The other guy's wife and I danced the night away as we stuffed our faces with delicious Taco Bell fare and beer they ingeniously serve from the bottom of the cup at what is arguably the best after hours club on The Strip.  At the end of the night, we shared a long, intimate, dare I say, perfect, cab ride home as I dropped her off to her husband.  My only regret was not buying a shirt!"}
{"text":"What's one of the best things you can do when you're still lit after a night out in Vegas? Get TB! Taco Bell that is, but on a whole 'notha level.  Taco Bell is already like the go-to spot for drunk munchies (besides any Mexican spot with Carne Asada Fries) so of course it's bomb! It's cool how they have alcoholic frozen drinks like Margaritas and Piña Coladas plus beer on tap! The food menu is pretty much the same but maybe a bit more expensive. Weddings are on the menu as well for $600 if I remember correctly (hey it's Vegas right?!). There's also a bunch of TVs playing sports and a DJ mixing it up on the second floor.   Food was good and pretty much tastes the same as TBs elsewhere. The drinks were delicious but weak; couldn't taste the alcohol which could either be a good or dangerous thing. Not sure if it affected me personally as I was already a bit tipsy. The ambiance was cool tho and it's right on the strip (Planet Hollywood Hotel).   Dope Taco Bell to eat at at least once so check it out if you're ever in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came for the first day of the nacho fries during lunch hours. Opening day of nacho fries + lunch hour = super long line. Should have known better! Waited almost 20 minutes for our food. Side note*** The cashier did tell us it would take some time, as they were short staff with high demand. So we understood.   The nacho fries were alright. Thank god for the nacho cheese sauce, as that was it's saving grace. Each fry had a different taste. Some had more spice than others, and some fries were crispier than others. All in all, for $1 I would definitely give them another shot.  Our other food tasted great :) the inside was super clean and furniture wasn't beat up."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here. The nonalcoholic drinks suck. The employees are rude. And it's packed with people who stand in land for 20 mins and still don't know their order...  You might as well save your time and go to a normal Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Taco Bell and Booze. What more do you want?  We wanted to be pretty low-key our first night in Vegas, so we decided on Taco Bell and alcohol for dinner.   It's pretty much your standard Taco Bell, just with merchandise and alcohol.   There's a variety of drinks you can choose from and then you choose your alcohol: Vodka, Tequila, Rum or something else I can't remember :)  I decided on a Cherry Icee with 2 shots of vodka. It was glorious. Along side my crunch-wrap, it was pretty much the best taco bell dinner I've ever had."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't rate chain restaurants but after coming here and becoming severely disappointed, I just had to let the world know. For whatever reason, this Taco Bell doesn't live up to par as the ones back near my home. The proportions are a lot smaller and the soft drink bar makes you feel like you're in the old Wild West. Service wasn't great either because the lady behind the cash register made it seem like she hated her job. When we asked what alcohol shots go with the Baja blast, the lady couldn't tell us because she \"didn't know.\" She also didn't know how to have the right alcohol to Baja Blast ratio because when we got our $10 regular sized drink, it ended up tasting like straight tequila with no sort of Baja Blast remnants. We'll most likely stick to Fat Tuesdays if we want a alcoholic slushie drink."}
{"text":"So so, a lot of lettuce, too little meat on the taco's and music is too loud!  For the rest it's a okay spot to get some food!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great idea! I looove Taco Bell! So I was really excited when I heard about this new cantina. Located near Planet Hollywood, it is right in the middle of all the craziness that is the Las Vegas Strip. We had to walk there from Planet Hollywood. The food was great, as usual, no complains. The drinks were great!! My boyfriend got the Baja Blast with Skyy Vodka. I got the traditional margarita with tequila. I prefer these drinks over the ones at Fat Tuesday. What a pricy meal though, $36 for 2 meals with one large slushee upgrade and one small one."}
{"text":"We had a really good experience. Lines didn't take long, we ate upstairs where the DJ was. Great music. Typical Taco Bell food but with strip pricing. We ordered some drinks in the large refillable cup at $15 each. $10 refills. Best part is phone chargers at every seat. It was very clean and the workers were quick to clean up. This is important for the strip were its busy."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell cantina is brand new and is popular because it's 24 hours and has a prime location, however the process and service is pretty terrible. When you walk in, you might be a little impressed by the cool decor and the cool alcoholic freeze drinks they have, but once you order food you'll see how they really screwed up their process. Walking in, it's not clear how many lines there are. Although you may be quick to order food, a huge crowd forms waiting for their order. They have a screen that shows names of people who have ordered but the food is in the process of being made and then another list of people whose food is ready. It says it's ready but it's really not. The service looks chaotic. They have a clear glass so you can see them working and constructing your order but they do it out of order and they can't get their orders straight. They mess up orders and then are rude about it when you point out something is missing or that an order was made incorrectly. They write your name on the paper bag but when you go to accept it, they don't trust you and won't give it to you unless you have your receipt. We went late at night on Saturday after going out, and I understand everyone has the munchies and is a little unkind because of all the drinking but even at 3am, I'd like the level of service I expect during any other time of the day.   It's just disappointing to see a brand new place have such terrible processes in place, it just doesn't make sense and is unorganized. It's also frustrating for me to watch through the glass window all the chaos. Somebody should have thought through this better and I hope they change some processes, they'd get more business and profits that way. Sorry to say I am not coming back."}
{"text":"Ooookay. This place is a hot mess between the hours of 2AM and 3AM because everyone is thinking the same thing -- damn, I'm drunk. damn, I'm hungry. damn, Taco Bell sounds bomb.  And let's be real. You only really crave Taco Bell when you're not in a total state of consciousness.  This Taco Bell Cantina is open 24/7 and yes, they do have alcoholic slushies. I was pleasantly surprised that the prices at this place seem to be on par with other Taco Bells. No price gouging for late night munchies here! The boyfriend and I shared a cravings box (shhh, don't tell my diet) that cost about $5, and we were both totally stuffed.  We didn't try their alcoholic slushies, but the reaction that I'm hearing is that there's not much alcohol taste.   There's some space to sit and chill on the second floor and also some outdoor patio area to hang around. Music is thumping here, so if you're not looking for another place where you have to yell to have a conversation, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"So happy that this opened. It is so nice to be able to visit this location. It was busy and that is a great sign. I was very pleased with the food and service, I am typically pleased even at a manky drive thru at any taco bell but this made me feel the heat of high class society Taco Bell. Honestly though it is amazing, taco bell with great hours, booze, and taco bell food. Yummers."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this Taco Bell. The inside is extremely small, to the point where they don't have enough room for people waiting in line and those waiting for food. Speaking of waiting for food, it took nearly 30 minutes to get mine, and the system they use to alert people when their food is ready doesn't work properly. The food is the same price as a normal Taco Bell. The only special menu item they have is their alcoholic freezes, which will cost you $10 for a drink with 1 shot. Hardly any seating in this place. Definitely not worth going back."}
{"text":"This place is literally just another Taco Bell with alcoholic beverages. The coolest thing is the soda fountain...not your typical soda fountain but has handles so I feel like I'm pouring a beer out of a keg or something. But other than that, not very noteworthy other than it's in the middle of the strip."}
{"text":"The music is super loud in here, so get ready to shout your order to the cashier because you or them literally can't hear anyone if they're talking at a regular volume. This made it hard for us to ask questions about the drinks so we just ended up getting the same one that we got last time - mountain dew baja blast. It was a bit watery this time compared to last time but it tasted pretty much the same. The workers aren't that enthusiastic but I can tell that they're trying - everything is super loud all the time and it's super crowded at peak hours and half the people are drunk. We got our food within 15-20 minutes so it wasn't too bad considering they were pretty packed. The food tastes like any other taco bell, it's nothing special unless you get an alcoholic drink."}
{"text":"This taco bell is so cute. It is the perfect place to go to after walking around the strip and drinking. I know, you're thinking why would I want to go to a Taco Bell? Well, this one was Vegas style. It had a DJ playing (the music here was good), it had good alcoholic drinks, and good food. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"To say that I was excited when I found out there was going to be a Taco Bell within walking distance of my apartment might be an understatement.   Now that this Taco Bell Cantina is finally open and I walk by it every single day on my way to and from campus, I have to restrain myself and have consciously limited my Taco Bell intake to just once a week. But I make an exception for the spicy potato tacos. I mean they're only a dollar and vegetarian and even vegan if I get it fresco style (get it fresco style! they replace the cheese with pico and you get to feel a little bit better about stuffing your face with carbs) so they can't be that bad for me right?   This Taco Bell is clean, the employees are generally friendly, the food comes out fast, and they've got a bajillion TVs. The food is just as good as any other Taco Bell I've been to. They didn't end up getting their a liquor license so it's basically just a fancier Taco Bell but honestly I'd eat Taco Bell sober any time. Especially those spicy potato tacos."}
{"text":"When I heard about Taco Bell Cantina selling alcoholic slushies, I was like, uh, hello, let's get to one p r o n t o. Turns out that this location was the first and is still one of the very few to actually serve alcoholic slushies, which is something that I didn't find out until many miles, conceding non-alcoholic slushies, and months later. So, yeah, just added it to the list of places to try on my next Vegas trip.   My visit to this Taco Bell Cantina (TBC) was in August of last year (2017), and I wasn't expecting much. A tourist trap, at best. I assumed the slushies would be watered down, and that the food would be average, if not sub-par. I assumed heckin' w r o n g.  We pulled up to the club after a long day of eating and a long night of drinking, the club being TBC. Although we spent literally every moment of the day where we weren't walking, eating, we were still hungry for some Taco Bell. Not too much Taco Bell, tho.  The first thing we (and probably everyone else, too) noticed was the wall of slushies behind the registers. Basically they have all of their regular slush options with various kinds of alcohol (rum, vodka, tequila, etc.) I don't care if you're 5, 95, or Mormon, your eyes shoot straight to this wall when you come in.  I got the Baja blast with whatever alcohol it came with, and my friend got the cherry one with whatever alcohol it came with (sorry, can't remember). They were good, totally not watered down, though overpriced for Taco Bell...though not overpriced for blended alcoholic beverages on the Las Vegas Strip.   We also settled on eating the naked chicken chips and the potato-rito. We had never had the chips before, but we had heard a lot about them and seen many advertisements. Honestly, they were overhyped. Not bad, just not anything to get excited about. The burrito was just average.  One of the cool things about this location, aside from it being on the friggen Vegas Strip, is that it has a patio-ish room where you can sit in open air and watch/interact with the Strip tourists. No, it's not advertised that way, but you create your own destiny.  Although the service wasn't anything special in terms of friendliness, I give this place four stars and remember the experience as a good one not just because I was drunk (and they provided me with more alcohol), but because the place was extremely clean and they were serving a high quantity of customers fairly quickly.   Will I return on my next trip to Las Vegas? If they are still selling those slushies, you bet."}
{"text":"I mean, come on. Really?  It's Taco Bell. Yes, it sometimes hits the spot, but to add hip hop music and alcoholic slushies to make it 'Vegas-ified' does not warrant it more stars.  And why am I paying so much for a freaking taco?  Just because I'm in Vegas?  Screw that, if I'm overpaying it's for something unique and amazing, not something I can get at my local drive-thru.  We went here around 2am on a Sunday morning, because...obviously. Long lines, it moved slow, the music was loud, people were drunk...actually come to think of it, it's a lot like most Taco Bells normally are.  ;)  The staff was nice, the food came out at a good pace. They pulled all of the hot sauce trays so we couldn't get any which was a bummer. There is a big window where you can look in and see everyone in the kitchen making the orders which is cool.  Lots of alcohol slush drinks, pina colada, baja blast, cherry, etc.  That seems cool, though I didn't get any.  We sat outside in the covered patio, plenty of music still booming.  It was fun to eat Taco Bell in Vegas only because it seems so silly, is in fact, silly. But if everyone in the group wants to go, what are you gonna do?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm an avid fan of Taco Bell! It's the fuel that keeps this world turning. However.. this is the first time I went into this Taco Bell downtown and it's the grossest experience I've ever had. The place feels like a greyhound bus station ...homeless people wandering in and out, decor is dreadful and I've felt like I have to throw up since I left 2.5 hours ago. I will never...ever return to this location ever again!"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell Cantina on the strip. Alcohol is served with your fast food, unlike the typical Taco Bell locations. I ordered a bubbly libation with one crunchy taco on a busy Friday night. The cashier handed me my beer after ordering so I only had to wait a few minutes for the taco. My order came out quickly, but hey it was only one taco. Nothing exceptional. Clean and easily accessible location. I didn't notice the prices to be higher except for the fact that alcohol can make your bill high..."}
{"text":"I've never had so much fun at a Taco Bell before. Also the food wasn't slopped together like you expect from a regular fast food place. I'd rather hang out there than a Las Vegas club any day! Perfect place for fourth meal and a beer or sangria."}
{"text":"I love me some Taco Bell, but this was a bit of a step down from a standard location. Food came out slowly, it was fairly cramped, and there were hot sauce packets all over the floor. It also tasted a bit worse than a standard Taco Bell, which was a bit disappointing.   Tons of riff-raff, which I suppose it is expected, as it is right on the strip and, you know, it's a Taco Bell. At least they have a security guard."}
{"text":"Funnest Taco Bell I have ever been too. Besides the fact that this TB has better quality of food, the drinks are great! Not to mention the DJ blasting the tunes. Looking for some good quick food while on the strip? Stop by!"}
{"text":"I freaked out when I saw this. Vegas IS Disneyland for adults! Whether or not you think this is tacky, you have to admit it's a cool concept (Btw: I'm strictly reviewing the drinks here, I'll let you imagine how the food tastes and I guarantee you're spot on).  There is an array of frozen drinks you can chose from, flavors like blueberry, cherry, margarita, etc. etc. I didn't realize that the drinks already had alcohol in them, I just assumed you had to get one or two shots to get the party started (I asked for two).  Do I think it was worth $16? Kinda. I mean, when else am I going to get a freaking drink at Taco Bell? It's all good fun!  The drinks were strong, but mostly because I got those two shots. Both were sweet but not TOO sweet, I feel like these tasted a bit better than the Fat Tuesdays just because the amount of sugar they put in there drinks is astounding.  If you're looking to turn up I recommend asking for two, otherwise play it safe and get one."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe and seating area. The music was really good and so was the food! Didn't know what to expect with the baja blast with alcohol in it, but it was worth the experience. Not sure I'd try it again only because I think I prefer the taste of the baja blast freeze on its own"}
{"text":"What is wrong with this place? The music is so loud that you can not even order without yelling.  The cashiers get the order wrong. I can understand the need to appeal to young people but when you can't even hear your order is ready and you are hungry - makes sense to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I understand this Taco Bell is targeting to attract late night munchers, but no breakfast menu??"}
{"text":"Every taco bell should be a Cantina. In addidition the regular menu items, they offer beer, shots, and Margharitas. Nice upgrade to TB."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype! We went at 3AM and it was busy with loud music and everybody was having a good time. So much fun! It was packed and our food came out quick! Perfect drunk munchies spot. I'm happy we went!"}
{"text":"There is absolutely, positively no reason to ever go to this place. I understand that they're trying to \"rock the atmosphere\" on the Vegas Strip but the music at 8 o'clock in the morning was so loud in the place that you could not understand what the lady was saying when she was trying to take my order. I have no idea if the food was any good because I had to leave i could not order or understand what she was saying. When I complain to the manager he basically Shrugged his shoulders and said sorry. It is definitely a stay away from place."}
{"text":"Taco Bell Cantina is a Taco Bell lovers dream come true.  If you don't like Taco Bell, this isn't going to change your mind.  If you do, this place is amazing.    You walk in, greeted by a wall of Freeze.  Plenty of different flavors, alcohol mixed in if you would like as well.  You can buy Taco Bell merchandise, shirts, swimsuits, and other items for the true Taco Bell fan.  Music is pumping fairly loudly the entire time due to the DJ upstairs.  While that makes it a little hard to hear, it's unique and fun.  The menu is the same as it is everywhere, as far as I could tell.  Prices are too.  I went with a $5 BIG BOX.  That included a normal taco, Cheesy Gordita Crunch, Burrito Supreme, nachos, and a drink.  I had them sub the drink for a Baja Blast Freeze.  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure what that did to the overall price, but it wasn't much.  Then you get to wait for your food, listening to the music and browsing the merchandise.  You can also look through the window to the kitchen and watch people make your food five feet and a glass panel away from you.  This was actually pretty interesting and fun to see.  You can see your name on the order screen and watch it make its way up the the line until they start making it.    The food was Taco Bell.  We ate upstairs and enjoyed the people watching from on high.  It was also around 1 AM.  These guys are open 24 hours a day, which is perfect for a late night meal after being out late.  I will definitely come back and don't care if the people with me don't want Taco Bell."}
{"text":"The hype is definitely not real here... I was super stoked to finally try this special Taco Bell out, but it was just... Meh. ¯\_(?)_/¯   It's pretty cool that you can get alcohol with your Baja Freeze, but what's not cool is paying $27 for it.   The order line situation in this establishment is highly inefficient. There really is no natural flow of traffic-- just cashiers yelling on the top of their lungs \"NEXT NEXT I CAN HELP YOU HERE\" while flailing their limbs around.   From the videos I've seen online, they made it seem like this place was MASSIVE, but really a local Taco Bell in your neighborhood would probably be 3 times as big as this special one. It's always overly crowded because of the hype, and you can't really enjoy the ambiance with people surrounding breathing on your Crunch Wrap Supreme...   Never again... Maybe unless I'm super drunk and need Doritos Locos Taco ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here. The menu is different and so I had to try some new items. The jalapeño dippers were so flipping hot neither of us could choke them down. The alcohol part was cool. Service was ok and pretty unorganized.  Mountain Dew was out and we told them and was never refilled. Then as we're trying to eat all of a sudden the music went from ghetto tolerable to insane loud I don't know what the hell it was.  We couldn't even talk and we were right next to each other.  We left without finishing our food and got a different drink.  never again."}
{"text":"I stopped here with a large group and the taco shells tasted very bad. I don't like saying that it was gross because I usually enjoy eating at Taco Bell. However, this particular restaurant was simply awful.  My party ordered several items from the menu and everyone noticed the taste as less than satisfactory. When we told the workers that the food tasted strange, they told us that other customers returned a 10 or 12 value back of tacos today!  I feel that they should have looked into this situation before selling more tacos or tostadas. The issue is basically the taco shells. Even the taco shell on my friend's tostada did not taste good. I hope we do not get sick from eating here!  Overall we were disappointed. The restroom was disgusting as well."}
{"text":"OMG! So cool. Service was fun and so was the atmosphere, two story structure with cool views of the strip. Loved the food."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Taco Bell in general! Their food is always so delicious and innovative as well as incredibly affordable! I got their new chicken nachos. Though I was admittedly hesitant, I actually thoroughly enjoyed them, especially with their yummy nacho cheese dip. I always add in hot sauce to their cheese to add a bit of spice. I got their $5 cravings deal which is honestly such a steal, including a burrito, gordita, taco, nachos, and a drink! I also got a pepsi slushie (not with alcohol) which was amazing, especially amidst the Vegas heat. Everything was so good!  But what really makes this Taco Bell is the environment. With the DJ upstairs, the fun decor, the shining lights, the aura was amazing. It is definitely a place where you can jam to and just have a ton of fun without having to be 21 or having to be drunk. This is the place to go in Vegas in my opinion. Also the DJ that was there when I went was absolutely killing the game."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally go here! Though I did not get any alcohol it was still the Taco Bell I know and love but am inside location (no car needed) open late! They also had some fun merchandise in the store ( shirts, Taco hats)"}
{"text":"24/7 Taco Bell is what I need in my life. Came here 1 AM in the morning and this place was still super packed. I order the new double stacked tacos and it is probably the first time in my life where the item looked darn close to the picture. Taste wise, I couldn't really tell because I just needed food in my stomach. They had a bunch of alcoholic slushies which I didn't get to try but will get next time.   The restaurant has a very nice layout with outdoor seating and an upstairs. I was too messed up to get upstairs. So I just enjoyed the downstairs part. I love the soda station because it looks like the machines that dispenses beer but with all wooden handles.   The only knock is that the music is WAY TOO LOUD. It's very hard to talk even in the open door area. Never had I had to yell at the cashier to tell her what I wanted. I was exhausted from tell her my specifics so I just said ONE OF EACH FROM THAT MENU. Aside from that, this place is awesome and wish there was more like it everywhere else."}
{"text":"OK I am an avid Taco Bell groupie. I love love love Taco Bell.   I love how the food is the same. It still blows my mind that they manage to get their food to taste the same in all 1,000,000,000,000 locations. I don't remember quite exactly, but I think prices are a bit higher than normal TBellz but guys it's the strip and they need to pay rent too!  THE BAJA BLAST: HONEY LISTEN it is dangerously delicious. I got it with Bacardi and I could not taste the alcohol, just all delicious Baja Blast Freeze. I honestly thought they forgot the alcohol but I was content with a regular too, but the buzz was nice. The \"yard\" is actually fairly small because it's tall and really skinny. I am saving my yard cup for the next time I'm in Vegas to get a cheaper refill, and can't wait to try other flavors.  Job. Well. Done."}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell in the world . They got alcohol freezees and the tacos are bomb. Yeah they not your authentic tacos but still the crunchiness of the taco is so fresh. Same with the ingredients. Also the alcholic beverages aren't ridiculously priced. This is a must go spot for all you broke people like me."}
{"text":"It's a fun time, ok? Don't knock it 'til you try it. If you don't stop here during your friend's bachelorette party on the Las Vegas Strip, you're missing out. This is obviously class personified. Try not to be so jealous.  1 star for the second story lounge and DJ 1 star for the hip outdoor patio aka front row seat to primo early Vegas morning people watching 1 star for the ridiculous foam taco hats 1 star for the blended drinkies that were better than any other blended drinkies I've tried in my last 3 visits to Vegas  1 star for snappy service even with the Vegas hordes pouring in nonstop  The SF location will tide you over if you can't hop over to this one. We tried tacos, but none of the special appetizers I've only seen at these two locations. I'm somewhat of a Taco Bell enthusiast. What? You wish you were as cool as I am. ;-)"}
{"text":"While the decor was amazing as well as the beverage offering, one of my chalupa had bad sour cream and was definitely expired --- too much effort to go back in.  Same menu as regular Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Taco Bell Cantina = small but flashy taco bell that serves alcohol.  Although Taco bell is not of my one regular fast food picks, on NYE I decided to check out the \"upscale version\".  This taco bell has a standard menu plus tapas-style sharing plates of nachos, quesadillas, and chicken fingers.The cantina's \"Freeze Wall\" of customizable slushies includes flavors margarita, piña colada, berry blast and provide the option to add liquor: tequila, rum, vodka.  Atmosphere: Space is tight. Given on NYE they hosted an event on the upper level, seating was not available & it was standing room only. We managed to grab a standing spot right in front of the window that looks into the kitchen. It may have been because of NYE, but the music was very loud. Club loud..which is great, when you're at a club. However, the loud music made it extremely difficult to order and respond to the cashier.  Order: Decided to try the baja blast freeze with vodka...intending to just try it in their standard cup. As a local, i don't need the gimicky souvenir twist cups. Unfortunately, with the loud music and lack of clarification by the cashier, we ended up with their souvenir twist cups (and their additional cost).  Service: I spotted an employee carrying a tablet, but noticed that she skipped over me to ask another person ( 2 people behind me) if they wanted to place their order thru the tablet. I feel that the error with my drinks would not have been made if I had tablet ordered & saw it on the screen as opposed to attempting to lip read the cashier.  Delivery: Your name will appear on the TV screen when your order is ready. When I saw my name under the \"Ready\" side, I maneuvered up to the crowded counter, only to be told that my order was not ready. Standing back a bit, they called my name a few moments later & handed me a bag of food. Opened the bag...to find that it was NOT what I had ordered. We ordered 3 $5 Cravings boxes..My sister returned the bag with someone else's order and we were given our 3 boxes.   Taste: It's a Taco Bell & the cravings boxes are no different from the ones you get elsewhere."}
{"text":"This will be the most lit Taco Bell you'll ever experience. It's at the heart of the strip and perfect for friends to get together and continue the wild night with BOMB Nacho Fries Supreme.   You got a poppin dj that is sometimes even better than the club, you got a camera showcasing shenanigans from the deck above, and you got alcoholic Baja Blasts. What more can you ask for?   I stayed in Vegas for 2 nights, and we went there both nights. Push away authenticity and go for the fun!"}
{"text":"This is the Mecca of Taco Bell's in the World, and we loved the experience! Even for the flagship, it was well organized and clean! We sat down upstairs, ate, and watched tv. Surprisingly enough, the food was not overpriced like in a majority of Vegas!"}
{"text":"A Taco Bell with alcohol!? BEST CREATION EVER. I mixed the cherry with margarita and added tequila. They make their drinks strong! Only downside was that I expected the upstairs seating area to be a tiny bit bigger. Seating is the only downside, it felt like there was not much of it. Other than that, it was great! You also can see them making everything through a glass window which is a nice bonus. I can not wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"There's a Taco Bell on the Strip now? And they serve beer? It's like a 3am heaven. Seriously, what else is more perfect after a night of drinking than some Taco Bell? And bonus, at the TB Cantina, you can keep the drinking going too. It can get crowded, because well, there's lots of drunk people on the Strip. But the staff are friendly and efficient. And there's a decent amount of seating on their patio (which means optimum people watching). So yeah, next time you're drunk on the Strip, you don't have to travel to get a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"A Taco Bell with motherfuckin' alcohol.  You gotta be shittin' me.  Is this the first place I stopped in Vegas? Hell yes it is. Am I ashamed? God, no.  It's a Taco Bell.... BUT WITH ALCOHOL? I had a Baja Blast with vodka in it while eating a Beefy Five Layer, so yeah, my mind was blown.  Downsides: crazy ass birds outside that might divebomb you and very loud music."}
{"text":"James D at the Cantina. we love the cantina me and my honey pot. It is time for the summer and I had fresh cold beer with my chalupa. No reservations required ;) I watched the end of the baseball game on their jumbo fortified screen. Chalupps chalupa cha chalups chalupa chicken pepsi"}
{"text":"Taco Bell AND booze?  And they say dreams don't come true.  This might be the most beautiful and majestic thing that I have ever witnessed in my life.  I ordered a Baja Blast with rum.  Could have used more rum but it was super tasty.  They have a DJ on the 2nd floor which was pretty amusing and the food is your normal Taco Bell fare, with a few extras.  There are \"shareable\" items that you won't see on other Taco Bell menus, like the cheesy bacon taco rolls (or something of that nature).  They were pretty good.  I wish Taco Bells where I live served booze and had an atmosphere like this!  Fun times were had."}
{"text":"You know exactly what you're getting yourself into coming to the Taco Bell Cantina. If you're reading these reviews to decide whether or not to come because you're on the fence, you probably won't be impressed. If you love Taco Bell and you're super excited to try it and you're just reading reviews to get you more hyped, then GAME. ON.  This Taco Bell Cantina is two stories, has a few special menu items that can't be found at other Taco Bell locations plus all the standard options, a little shop with Taco Bell swag, AND slushies that you can add alcohol to (which, let's be honest, who hasn't had Baja Blast and thought about how much better it would be with vodka in it?).  All your favorite Taco Bell food right on the Strip in Vegas with alcohol on the menu. Plus apparently you can get married here now? So yeah, get outta here with that \"But Del Taco has fries\" trash. Taco Bell wins."}
{"text":"Every single person that works here has absolutely every reason in the world to be less than nice to people that frequent a Taco Bell that serves booze and yet every person that works here was the NICEST. Like, I want them to come to my house for thanksgiving nice.  I have tons of faith in the human condition already but if I did not this staff would have restored it with their wonderful demeanor. This is 100% not sarcasm. Everyone that works here is very warm.  Those little jalapeño rollers are just cheese and jalapeño peppers in cut up tortillas but hell if they're not fricking delightful. Not as delightful as the staff here, but still."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell sucked. Me and my friend were so upset because of all the hype that was advertised for this. Honestly the Taco Bell's back home are better."}
{"text":"Only in Las Vegas would you find a 24/7 Taco Bell that also sells alcoholic Freezes. We got the large Baja Blast freeze with Bacardi, which included handy strap to carry around as we walked around outside. They also sell merchandise at this store, including t-shirts and shot glasses.   We got the Mexican pizza, the crunchwrap supreme, and the apple empanada. The food that we had was like any other Taco Bell chain, but they do have additional \"share plates\" at this location.   There was ample seating downstairs on the patio and additional tables upstairs, most with a pretty good view of the strip. The employees were very friendly and provided great customer service, especially for just being open a few days. Worth the visit if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"***Alcoholic Baja Blasts and Cheesy Gordita Crunches****  If that doesn't get your attention, I don't know what will.   This Taco Bell lives in the heart of The Strip right by Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Shops. I visited during the summer so this was a perfect place to stop by and get some AC and refreshments.    The service was quick. They have a screen that displays all the orders and the order they are completing them in. A must-try are their frozen alcoholic drinks, they range from margaritas to pina coladas to Baja Blasts, and you can pick the type of alcohol you want. I got a Baja Blast with tequila. It's seriously a dream.   I recommend sitting either outside by the misters or upstairs by the DJ ;) I swear, this guy is mixing music at all times of the day like it's a nightclub. I've never seen a Taco Bell this bangin'.    Bathrooms are upstairs too. The restaurant is smaller than it looks like in the pictures but it gets the job done. Two thumbs up from me! Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Going to a Taco Bell after a concert can be a risky move, as the amount of drunk idiots increases as the night winds down. This was our first time and the staff was super friendly and helpful. The drinks were great and the food was tasty. I only didn't give it five stars because someone should have been on the overflowing garage. Definitely will be back the next time we are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The cantina offers a very unique T-Bell experience, and I am so glad that it has been brought to Las Vegas! You are greeted outside by a packet of hot sauce dancing to the blaring music. It's definitely Vegas party scene meets Taco Bell.   The twisted freezes are fun to try out but weren't anything special to me. Its just a shot of alcohol into a regular Taco Bell freeze, but the idea of drinking at Taco Bell makes it worth.    The food prices were not that bad for a restaurant on the strip! They offer the typical Taco Bell menu along with some plates meant to share with friends. They also had a really good $5 deal that came with a drink and 4 food items.   Overall, I think the T-Bell cantina is a unique experience if you are visiting the Las Vegas strip, but I wouldn't be coming back as a regular."}
{"text":"The total irony of my visits here is that it was way way way after partying hours over. We're talking \"the sun is already up and you are full of regrets about the night before\" kind of visits. In fact, I had no idea that the Taco Bell Cantina was in this area, I was actually heading to McDonald's and ended up stumbling on to here as it was right next door.  So as you can imagine, I had zero desire to get a spiked Baja Blast. A regular did fine for me, thank you very much. Aside from that, also happened to come here during the return of the Naked Chicken Chalupa (score!). Other stuff I managed to put down was a steak quesadilla, some tacos, and random other crap lol. Look when you're tired and starving, you don't really care what you put down as long as it's edible lol.  Staff here is friendly, but a bit slow in getting the food to you. With that said, I'm not gonna bitch too much considering this place is open 24/7 and I came here at 8 am each time. I'm just glad this is open 24/7, so I'll give them a pass. I'm sure it's better during regular hours.  Overall, I'm glad I found out about Taco Bell Cantina. It definitely adds to my post-partying food options of Earl's or McDonald's LOL."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a cool place to visit after a long night! All the margarita selections are fun and I feel like the food here is better than other Taco Bells! Wooden handles for the soft drinks, flat screen tvs for the menus, and wooden bar tables...this Taco Bell is FANN-CEEE! It helps that it's 24/7 so check it out when you get the chance!"}
{"text":"the idea of this place is super cute & cool. i love taco bell, so to see one that has a dj & alcoholic beverages was awesome. the layout was a bit weird and tight. but its also very very busy. music is loud & it's typical taco bell food. I'd recommend going at least once to get the feel."}
{"text":"The people there seemed like they were having a blast, and the food was godlike. Super nice interior too!"}
{"text":"they lied to me and told me they were closed at 3am even though their hours online say they are open 24/7 after we walked all the way over here. If i could give zero stars i would. Actually i take that back i would give NEGATIVE  5 stars if possible. I also heard the beer here is a rip off. They have zero respect for their customers.Save yourself the trouble and go to any of the dozrns of food courts at any hotel that are open late"}
{"text":"Im not exactly sure what the hype is all about. To me it is Taco Bell with a twist. (and alcohol)  Verdict: Someone show me something good."}
{"text":"This Vegas hot spot is pretty neat and a must see. The food was fresher than I have ever experienced at any other Taco Bell. It's pretty much the same menu as other restaurants with the exception of alcohol. The music is entirely too loud and I left with a headache. The staff was friend, the food was quick and good, and the seating would be difficult during peak hours."}
{"text":"The best taco bell I've ever had. They even serve alcoholic slushies. Woop!"}
{"text":"After roaming the strip, we decided to finally make a quick stop at this new Taco Bell!! I do love me some Taco Bell. We were all super excited and we were ready for some tacos. We had seen the promo video for this new taco bell. Unfortunately it didn't meet our expectations or maybe we were just expecting way more. This place was crowded AF and not just because it was busy but because the lay out of the place is just not that convenient. I thought they had a merchandise area but it was only really a small rack, then I thought they had new items on their menu but sadly it was only the slushie drinks which I heard were good but weak in the alcohol level. Big props for being open 24hrs and being in a great location but nothing new or awesome to rave about this particular taco bell. I say check it out for sure at least once or late at night when you're drunk and itching for some crunchy tacos."}
{"text":"Taco Bell has gotten very sloppy. It's turned to be very overrated and is no longer quality food."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this place out since I saw a video of it online a few months ago. My favorite part of this place was the Baja blast slushee (Baja blast with rum)! It was so good. There was also the usual food choices; however, I felt like everything wasn't super fresh. If I need some late night munchies in Vegas, I'd still drop by again."}
{"text":"It's a busy place, late night! But, if you are walking by or happen to be staying nearby, it fits the bill for late night eats! Please! You may not eat like this all the time but you are walking so much all day like us, go for it! Hello, it's 430am as we walk home! The staff are great fun and the wait is relatively quick. There is a seating area outside but most take it to go. They even have clothes for sale here! Hands down, the best, freshest Taco Bell I have ever been to but I am vouching for my fave, the  chicken burrito and then the nachos supreme that we tried. Great location. Cannot beat the price. Have fun!"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell done right, open 24/7 and serving up them alcoholic drinks. There's only a few of these Taco Bell Cantinas around and only the cool cities have them :)  Really though it's just your typical Taco Bell food, nothing fancy. Don't remember if they bumped the prices up cause it's on the Strip. They have beer and frozen drinks (alcoholic or non). Soft drinks on tap. And you can buy Taco Bell merchandise.   After you order your name shows up on a list on the wall. Pay attention cause someone might jack your food, yes it happened.   The environment was loud and crowded with music and big screens. Seemed small with a few seats inside, outside, and upstairs. Upstairs there's just one restroom so you can imagine the wait. There's electrical outlets along the counters overlooking everyone if you need to charge something. At the time the stairs wasn't wide enough to fit my group and another group walking in the opposite direction but there is an elevator lol. Outside there's a fan for when it's hot and a heater for when it's cold. Yea that heater seemed on but didn't heat up anything we were right underneath it but there were electrical outlets maybe bring your own heater."}
{"text":"Your typical Taco Bell, just very urban and downtown. Also, you can get alcohol here...  Menu is on the TV screens and you have three registers to choose from to order with a person. There is also a screen near the fountain drink telling you when your order is ready. A person will also call for your name! You can turn the corner after ordering and watch as they prepare your order too!   The interior is HUGE. It is very spacious with seating both inside and out. Everything is very modern and urban and PURPLE.   This location also sells Taco Bell merchandise if you're a huge fan!  Street parking is possible, but hard to come by. It's honestly better to just catch the RTA.   Service is quick and sweet!   Bathrooms are available!!! There is a code though."}
{"text":"They put half of my order with my brothers. they put half of my brothers order with mine. they didn't tell us the fryer was broken until 10 minutes after we ordered chalupas ... WHICH REQUIRES A FRYER. My grilled burrito was broken and oozing everywhere. almost impossible to pick up and eat. My buritto had tomatoes in it which I specifically asked to be left out.  They were slow, non responsive and not as helpful as I've come to expect.  The food tasted ok, so maybe everyone else here enjoyed it today, but this was not the best TB experience I've had."}
{"text":"Fun for a late night pick me up after a show. The frozen alcoholic \"icees\" are super sweet but don't have that much alcohol in them. Indoor and outdoor seating, and huge TVs broadcasting random stuff. We sat and watched adult swim cartoons while we munched on our junk food."}
{"text":"Went to this spot after the ball dropped on NYE. There was a good DJ, drinks and food and no cover charge!! The food also wasn't marked up (spent less than $18 for 3 Mexican pizzas with sour cream and 2 beefy grillers) which was surprising. People walking by seemed really confused about what they were looking at because at first glance it looks like a club or a bar especially with the music blasting."}
{"text":"OK where do I start. I had one of the worst customer service experiences on the strip that I've ever received ... the girl that was giving us our food not only was rude but she also shamed my disabled friend.  She needed a spork and the girl rolled her eyes at her and told the other employee \"it's one of those nights\" .. also we had a baby with us and he spilled a taco on the ground the girl came over to clean it up we said sorry and she again rolled her eyes and gave the baby the dirtiest look ever (he can't help that his mother is disabled)... all in all I was excited to come experience this Taco Bell cantina.. sadly im disappointed solely on the customer service..."}
{"text":"Do you like tacos? Are you in Vegas? Do you like slushees? Do you have a soul? If YES, then you HAVE to go to the Taco Bell Cantina.  Yes there's a lot of hype around it, but the hype is legit! Who wouldn't enjoy sitting on a shaded patio on a sunny day with great music playing on the speakers as you sip on a slushee infused with your favorite flavors & alcohol of your choice, and sink your teeth into one of Taco Bell's famous burritos?  Not to mention all the merch they have inside! 10/10 I would go here again. In fact, every time I go to Vegas from now on!"}
{"text":"Omg, the experience was ridiculous!!!! Let me begin. So this was the last choice to eat as the first place where we wanted to go, closed early. We arrived at Taco Bell around 3:40am. We placed our orders at 3:47am and 3:48am in different lines. The place was super busy so a wait was expected, however no more than 20mins. I received my food around 4:00am and my friend should have received her food shortly after. That did not happen. Politely, around 4:10a, we asked the status of her order. I said, \"Ma'am we place our orders relatively around the same time, my friends food should have been out by now.\" Rudely, the cashier said well everybody is waiting so just wait. I explained how close we ordered and she went to say, well food comes in different lines and different lines get the orders at different times. I was trying to explain that even so, over 6 ppl got their food after we ordered, but she wasn't trying to listen. Both the shift lead and the cashier just brushed the situation off. Mind you, it had already been over 20mins. The place was chaos. So we waited and it became around 4:25, the lady finally looks our receipt and makes this face and then told us that someone \"got her food accidentally\". We finally received her food after 4:30am, nearly close to an hour after we ordered. The place was horribly ran and needs better organization."}
{"text":"If you're trying to feel club vibes and eat Taco Bell...this is the spot. Loud music, alcoholic slushies (Baja Blast ftw), and chicken burritos. Is this real life? Only negative is that it's hard af to order cuz the music is so loud. You basically have to order your food exactly like at the bar, chest on the counter and yell into the ear of the cashier."}
{"text":"Taco Bell Cantina! Wanted to try out this place since a long time now! We stopped by here to grab a cantina. The decor is very colorful and slushy! The attendant was very friendly and gave us several flavors to try on before getting the cantina. We went for the large cantina - $16 and it was well worth it. Cantinas on the strip are almost the same price or higher and this experience is exciting since its Taco Bell! Nice music was playing and they also have some outdoor sitting in case you want to sit outside and enjoy your drink."}
{"text":"What can I say--I'm just glad this place exists. If you are a Taco Bell lover you'll get a kick out of stopping by the Cantina, even if you don't order one of their spiked slushies. When we visited it was under construction so the patio was pretty hot and there was only one bathroom but it looks like they are making some improvements and expanding.   Prices are comparable to regular Taco Bell prices and there were a couple of menu items that I haven't seen at regular TBs. The food is your standard Taco Bell fare so if you don't like TB then you can pass but if you do, or if you'd like to spend less than $5 on a meal in Vegas stop by!"}
{"text":"I don't like Taco Bell and only go there in protest cause my bf loves it lol this Taco Bell is totally different though and worth going just for the frozen drinks. Great, fast service and the food was good. Not your average Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Well, it's a normal Taco Bell with a few speciality items. The best part is the alcohol and the decor. The vibe is great and I enjoyed my time! Overall I think it's a tourist stop, one time thing. I would mostly likely go to a normal Taco Bell if I craved it and get beer at a bar. But overall enjoyed my experience!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is literally FIRE SAUCE! There is a legit club upstairs and DJ SANTOS is the sh!t!!! It's like a regular Taco Bell that turns Baja blast into a margarita! Like whaaaaat?! Upstairs has VIP tables and a DJ! FOR FREE! I will never go to another Taco Bell in my life...why would I? I'd give it 10 stars if there was the option! Lol think outside the box!"}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! The way they fill the beer was so cool and the employees were extremely welcoming. We got a huge Baja Blast freeze with Bacardi and that was delicious. The shareables menu was unique as well. All the merchandise was cool too and I hope they sell them online because they didn't have my size in the shorts. Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"How can you not walk into a place called \"Taco Bell Cantina?\"  My husband and I stopped in this place just to check it out and say we've been.  There is easy access off the strip if you're walking around.  The place is a little small, but there is some seating, with a patio and misters that allow you to watch the sights and sounds of the strip.    I can tell you that the most exciting thing for me was the \"slushy.\"  I actually don't know what they are called here, but they have a Slurpee-like frozen concoction in a variety of flavors that they will add alcohol to.  I wanted the Pepsi one with Captain Morgan.  It was awesome!  Great treat on a hot Vegas night.    My husband picked up some Taco Bell eats, including a taco with a Doritos shell.  It was interesting.  We are not Taco Bell aficionados and so the food was just OK.  But the fun factor, slushee factor, and sightseeing from their patio makes this a four-star location.  Do yourself a favor and stop by so you can say you did."}
{"text":"It's lit.   I got the Crunchwrap Supreme and one of each hot sauce. You give them your name and when the food is ready, your name will show up on the screen as ready to serve!!  My friends and I went upstairs where there was a dj playing popping music while we ate. Drunchies were the best and nah ragrets"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell and all their new creations they come up with in the lab. So they automatically get a minimum of 4 stars! :) Finally, visited this location a month ago while in Vegas with my wife. Location is smaller than I thought, but was steadily busy the entire time. They have an outdoor seating and also an upstairs dining area and a number of TVs as well. Seating can get limited. The menu is pretty much the same as any other Taco Bell.   As for the difference from any old Taco Bell is they have souvenirs, t shirts, hats etc for sale. And it wouldn't be a Vegas location if alcohol wasn't available. All their freezes/slushes can have shots added to them. I believe they have a live DJ there probably at night. And most importantly it's open 24 hours. If you're a Taco Bell enthusiast you gotta hit up the Cantina!"}
{"text":"Definitely not all that they crack it up to be. It is a fairly small place. We ordered the slushee drinks and they definitely skimped on the booze especially for the price. Big tvs but when we were there we didn't see any dj. The soda was made to look like a beer tap Machine which looks really cool but it also takes a good minute to fill your cups!!! It was cool to say I did it but can't say I'll ever feel the need to do it again!!!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed. Thought this would be a cool place with lots of seating and a lounge vibe.  Arrived and realized it was tiny and overhyped - it's just a glorified Taco Bell done up Vegas style that serves alcoholic mixed drinks.  Bf and I walked in, looked around, said to each other \"that's it?!\", then left to go eat/hang out somewhere else.  The place is decorated in lounge style, dim with colored lights, music booming loudly. Have to admit it looked kind of cool.  Size wise, it's tinyyyy. Literally like, a little corner shop tucked away on strip. We walked by and missed it the first time. It gets crowded lining up waiting to order, merchandise stands take up space. Cramped seating both inside and outside.  Nothing really special here, save your time in Vegas and go somewhere more unique and fun!   Bf and I love Taco Bell, but we weren't too impressed. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"This place is lit, loud music, neon lights, and vodka icy drinks.   The seating is small, and there is extra seating upstairs, but i think most people go their orders to go.  You can try the alcoholic drinks before buying as well!"}
{"text":"Okay so being a local and after seeing all the hype I had to try this place out. I honestly never thought I'd give a review for a Taco Bell since you pretty much know what you're getting when you go to Taco Bell. Taco Bell is pretty straight forward but like I said with all the hype I had to try this place out.   So the selling point of this place for me isn't even how futuristic and cool it looks. It's actually the price which for a college student like me is a great thing, I ate a nice meal, drink, and got a freeze for 10 bucks.   The food was also surprisingly delicious and well made. It did not taste like fast food at all and was really good for such a decent price. The only time this restaurant does get expensive is with the \"twisted\" freezes which is basically just a shot of alcohol into whatever flavor of freeze you want. The prices for the Twisted Freezes are very touristy and truth be told for what you get it's not worth it to me. The alcohol choices for your \"twisted\" freeze is kind of limited. It's basically vodka, rum, or tequila and it's really generic stuff like Bacardi.    They do have a ton of freeze flavors which I really like including some old classics like Baja Blast along with the new ones and the freezes are pretty cheap around 4 bucks (without alcohol). The biggest letdown to the Cantina though is actually the size, now it's not enough to warrant a star deduction but the place is small. It doesn't have downstairs indoor seating at all, the downstairs seating is actually on a patio outside which is heated and cooled though. The upstairs seating is really nice with plush chairs and booths along with massive flat screen tvs but the seating upstairs is limited. If the place is packed good luck getting a seat especially if you have a group with you.   All in all I really love the Taco Bell Cantina and will definitely be back especially if i'm on the strip. It's a nice and cheap place for locals and tourists to eat without breaking the bank and it's got a great atmosphere. The bubbling freeze tanks make me feel i'm in a cantina in a galaxy far far away which I really like and the plush seating upstairs is sick. I really love it and the food is really tasty, Taco Bell stepped up their game with their flagship restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was moderate. I felt like the place could have been a bit less strict because you need to show the receipt in order to receive your food. The workers are focused and the food comes fast. A huge issue is that they overprice everything here when it comes to the fresco menu which makes everything a tad bit healthier. It tastes fresh but not as good as regular. The line was long and a few people block the passage to get the food and the guy at the front has to talk thru the microphone to say your name out loud. That annoyed me the most. The interior though is unlike any other Taco Bell. Open 24/7."}
{"text":"Food was good! Music was fun! Space to sit and eat was limited though but would recommend!"}
{"text":"How does this place not have 5 stars? Taco bae and alcohol? Also, amazing music and they put a little extra love into the food. Although the beer was $9...the ambiance was completely worth it."}
{"text":"If you give this place less than four stars, well, I don't want to know you. YOU'RE DEAD TO ME!   Yes, this is a Taco Bell. If you don't like Taco Bell in the first place, you're not going to like this one either. If you're a Taco Bell fan like me and aren't one to piss on a good time, then this place is fast food heaven. All the processed TB classics with an atmosphere that screams \"VEGAS!\"   There's a DJ, there are cameras all around the restaurant capturing drunk antics and good times from the incoming customers and diners, there is alcohol, and the food is somehow better than other Taco Bell restaurants even though it's the same ol' slop - I love it.   What did you expect, people? Filet mignon tacos topped with caviar and one hundred dollar bills? Nah, brah. You stay away, more tacos for me."}
{"text":"The Taco Bell of my dreams! It's such a great atmosphere and hella fun. Valet is free in the shopping center directly behind the cantina which is nice too. Definitely a must stop place when in Vegas. The nightclub atmosphere and cheap food makes it a great late night spot. Definitely will be going back when I go see Britney in September."}
{"text":"TLDR: It's worth coming here just say you've been here. The food is no different from your neighborhood Taco Bell. Only difference is the alcohol beverages you can't get back home.   Initially came here to drink and eat Taco Bell in the middle of the night like everyone else who comes to Vegas.   I had higher expectations for my experience here, but was sadly disappointed. Someone ordered a bunch of food ahead of me, made some upgrades and then decided to remove items--this caused the one open register to freeze. Unfortunately, it took the staff a while to just open another till. It would have been convenient earlier to open more registers for the amount of staff they had and to notify the long line that there were issues with that one register. By the time I ordered I just wanted food. So, I can't say much about their speciality drinks! Maybe next time.  Also, I didn't like that I was able to see how they prepared food. Kitchen staff didn't put the wrap paper down on the countertops before making the food. I've worked food service before and had to deal with high volume orders, but I still managed to practice proper food handling protocols."}
{"text":"I had a great late night experience at Taco Bell Cantina after attending a downtown wedding. The line went pretty quickly and our cashier was extremely helpful and patient explaining the concept of the boozy drinks to first-timers like my boyfriend and I were. You can basically add liquor to any of the frozen drinks (which I know really isn't that complicated, but we had our share of drinks that night, so cut us some slack). The Doritos Taco Locos hit the spot, per usual, and was the perfect end cap to our night. As much as I would love one close to me in Cincy, I have a feeling it would be a little too convenient for those late night cravings."}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell that serves alcoholic slushies. It's exactly the sort of place that comes to mind when you think, \"I wonder what a Taco Bell would be like in Las Vegas\"; neon lights, towers of bubbling liquids, and racks of schlocky merch."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE! Myself and a friend had food poisoning about an hour after eating here. It was most likely from the meat because our other friend was fine and the only thing she didn't eat was the meat.   We were extremely ill and this caused us to miss out on our seminar for work. Why is that fact important? Because we paid hundreds of dollars to attend this seminar and whoever contacted me when I just wanted to share my experience so that they were aware and could take better measures to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else, wanted to insult me by offering me a refund of $12! NOT WHAT I WANTED AT ALL. A simple apology and being told they would follow up with the location and make sure food is being prepped and cooked properly is all that was needed. My friend also sent in her experience but no one contacted her. Clearly they also need to work on their customer service.   Side note: We were not drunk nor were we drinking so that's not why we were sick."}
{"text":"When you complain about no Diet Pepsi and they ignore you and you walk up 10 min later and they are like o yeah we don't have anymore"}
{"text":"Skip the night club and just head here! Came here for a late night snack after a long day of walking the strip / shopping. Walked into this place at 10:30-11 pm and there was not only a DJ playing music but the staff was happy and dancing. DID I MENTION YOU CAN GET LIQUOR IN YOUR FROZEN DRINKS! This place was awesome and I've never had such an great experience at a Taco Bell in my life. $4 for a shot of alcohol in a frozen drink is something you can't pass up."}
{"text":"Meh. It's a taco bell with spiked slushies. The overhead menu is so small you can barely read it. I mentioned this to the worker taking orders and her reply was, \"it's taco bell..it's basically taco bell stuff except the items on the right\". I asked for a chicken quesadilla and small drink and was charged for & given a medium sized drink. Not a big deal, just nothing special to see here. It's got it's niche and fits in with the daytime public square loungers and downtown late nighters. I'll stick to my local taco bell back home."}
{"text":"Ever since the Cantina opened on the strip I've made an effort to visit it every trip.   There's a special shareable menu, which includes the Naked Chicken Chips (pictured).  But let's be honest, everyone comes for the alcoholic drinks. I recommend the Mtn Dew Baja Blast with 3 shots of 1800 Tequila ($20)."}
{"text":"*DISCLAIMER*: This was a very drunk experience.  --LOCATION-- On the strip, near/ at Planet Hollywood. You can access the Taco Bell from the sidewalk. No need to go through the hotel.   --FOOD-- Same food as any other Taco Bell, although it seemed like a whole new world to me since I haven't stepped into one in ages.   Alcoholic slushees: Bomb. I got the Baja Blast with vodka. Other friends got the Baja Blast with tequila. You can taste the tequila more. The vodka one is way subtler, if not even noticeable. It's a little dangerous because it tastes like candy.   Fiery Doritos Locos Tacos: Pretty good. Dusty from the Dorito-ness powder.  Crunchwrap: Pretty darn good. Good amount of sauce and filling.   --EXPERIENCE-- Taco Bell did a good job. It's a brilliant idea since most people are going to be drunk AF and will get even drunker. Even if the food may have been the same as anywhere else, it pretty much is the perfect drunk experience. People with the munchies are going to go ham here.   --AESTHETICS-- It's nice a new. It is 2 stories and outside seating. The stairs leading upstairs is rather narrow. Outside seating is better and less claustrophobic. However, I went in the winter, so we went upstairs. If you're too drunk, the stairs may be a problem ):   Also, there's hella merchandise just sitting in front of the cash registers. This was disruptive and annoying. Line formation was a struggle. Overall too small and narrow for a popular spot."}
{"text":"What people have to remember is that it is still Taco Bell, the food hasn't changed even though it is on the strip. Difference being  a live DJ, see-thru glass for the kitchen, 160\" tv, ALCOHOL, 2 stories, outside seating...That said, the food is as good as it is at your local Taco Bell. But add the appetizers that are wonderful, the quick service that was surprising being on the strip, and the friendly staff that made a heck of a alcohol freeze!!! Willllll be back."}
{"text":"Vegas is the home of some of the most amazing restaurant concepts in the world... yet my husband was the most excited to try out the Taco Bell Cantina here. There's a full menu (they also serve breakfast!) in addition to shareable plates. As with most things in Vegas, it's open 24 hours a day and serves alcohol (beer and shots that go into their freeze drinks). Yup, go ahead and have that Baja Blast Freeze plus a shot of vodka along with your chalupa.  I'm not gonna lie, the quality of our food was super fresh for fast food! There's an open kitchen so you can see how everything is being cooked, the speakers are blasting top 40s music, and there's several tables upstairs to eat. They also have merchandise as hats, shirts, souvenir cups, and etc.  The restaurant is located outside of Planet Hollywood, across from the Cosmopolitan hotel. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell Cantina is located on the strip and is a fun upgrade to your usual Taco Bell run after a night drinking.  They keep the party going with a fun atmosphere they have neon lights, a DJ, and even alcoholic beverages.  It's a standard menu made to feel a little fancy because their presentation is sans wrapper.  Another fun twist are their Taco Bell souvenirs."}
{"text":"All right, it's Taco Bell, it's not that serious. However, I will say that paying 14.00 bucks for a cold burrito is RIDICULOUS. I have never felt so swindled in my life. Would definitely rate this negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't enjoy a more upscale Taco Bell where you can get a spiked freeze?? Yes, it's still a Taco Bell with our typical Taco Bell offerings but it's still a cool concept and enjoyable as drunchies . Got the chickstar which is basically a crunchwrap supreme with chicken nuggets. 10/10 would recommend. Also got a vodka spiked cherry Icee, definitely enjoyable in 90 degree weather. Music, friends, drinks, junk food, can't complain about that."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. It's loud and annoying, and the clientele here can get rowdy. The music is at like 10000 decibels.There is very little seating here so you might have to sit outside in the cold. You should only go here if you're super interested in their alcohol slushies.  Their menu is standard Taco Bell fare. Not much to write home about."}
{"text":"Normally you wouldn't go to Vegas and want to eat at Taco Bell right? This is a super unique Taco Bell that has two levels, a DJ and a killer sound system. There's also a huge TV screen with sports on multiple screen panels and rumor has it that you can even get married here! Did I mention that they serve Beer and alcoholic slushy drinks? The only reason it's a 4 star rating for me is that the music is a little too loud and they only have one single bathroom for men and women."}
{"text":"Never in my life did I think I would be reviewing a Taco Bell, but here we are. My friends and I came to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party. After spending the day at the pool, we were hungry so we decided to stop by this Taco Bell. It was probably the best taco bell I've ever had. The chicken and cheese quesadilla tasted so much better than ours at home. The best part? The baja blasts where you could choose which alcohol you wanted in your drink (awesome). I may or may not have gotten another baja blast to go because it was that good. Plenty of seating available and our food didn't take long at all. Naturally, it was more expensive compared to your normal taco bell cheap prices, but it was worth the experience."}
{"text":"Finally made it to TBC after all of the delays in opening over the past year. Sought a quick snack after a concert at the Q, and decided to check it out on my way back to the rapid. There was a line forming, to be expected on Friday night at 11pm. However, it moved quickly and the staff were very efficient. The place was getting pretty filthy--litter on the floor and garbage bins on the brink of overflowing.  This was my first time trying the Doritos Locos Taco and it was actually pretty tasty! After that though, it went downhill with my spicy tostada and spicy beef mini quesadilla that were not tasty, but rather nasty. I guess you get what you pay for--and I paid for the dollar value menu. The vibe was a bit more upscale and nice than your typical Taco Bell. The outdoor seating area seemed okay, but not worth a special trip at all. For late night munchies and something to soak up alcohol, it'll do the job; just don't expect a very different experience from your usual Taco Bell, except for the Edison bulbs."}
{"text":"Taco Bell Cantina is located next to Planet Hollywood. To be honest it's a cool idea if you finish hanging out with a group and feel like eating Taco Bell. Other than that it's nothing different. Yes there is a DJ and a lounge at the top to eat the food. Would I come out of my way again to eat there? Not at all. But it's fun to try out at least once!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell on the strip is a huge plus. Other than that your franchises across the city does a better job of basic operations . No clear distinct line to order food. Restroom for only one person male /female . Honestly Not worth the hype . Won't be able to handle the amount of business and stress of a typical summer day in vegas ."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! Their \"alcoholic slushies\" are a joke. I got the yard cherry slushie with rum. And I can't taste a single bit alcohol. My friend got a small Baja blast with Bacardi and you can barely BARELY taste the alcoholic.   I tried to see if I can get my money back. But they don't do refunds for drinks. The cashier told me there is 2 shots in the yard.  !?!?! Are you serious?! Just 2 shots?!! WHERE'S THE RUM THOUGH?!  Taco Bell Cantina, you're such a disappointment. I'll just stick with my Fat Tuesday. They never fail me!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell Cantina is just a bigger Taco Bell that serves alcohol. Its in a great location. I came here around midnight for a late night treat. If you're looking for cheap after club food that's not breakfast, look no further."}
{"text":"As a Taco Bell enthusiast, this has to be the best created since the Volcano burrito. The atmosphere is great for a quick stop on the Vegas strip. It's also really beneficial to those who are tired of spending all of their money on meals. For $14 dollars I was able to get a cravings deal and a baja blast with a shot of bacardi in it. I was also really excited to see that there is an upper level which has a live DJ. Aside from my allegiance and bias towards Taco Bell, I definitely think that this is more of a \"must\" than In-N-Out burger if you're visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Horrible service, credit card machines wont work, wont accept $100 bill, id'd my wife and I multiple times, and they were extremely rude and gave me attitude when I said we had already been id'd twice.  Definatly will never return"}
{"text":"Pretty sweet taco bell - I mean, if you want good tacos, hit up Tacos El Gordo. If you want that \"I gotta eat now and nothing will do but Taco Bell\" taco, then hit up this location for front row view of tacos being made, a variety of slushes, and fast service.  Also, open 24 hours, so no excuses, just go!"}
{"text":"The food, it's typical Taco Bell. I didn't get an alcohol drink, though my sister did and it was strong. But also 10 bucks. Though it was really loud and smaller then i expected. it fit the bill at 3am."}
{"text":"Let me start with the fact that I'm not a fan of Taco Bell. However, my husband loves Taco Bell and I was curious to see this one.  In addition to the regular menu you can order beer and alcohol. Also an option, if you really love Taco Bell, is to get married here!  We came here to check it out, ordered 2 boozy Baja Blasts and he got a double decker. Frozen Baja Blast was delicious but I could only drink about half of it, I think thats normal with the regular stuff too. Alcohol options include vodka, rum and tequila. There might be another option but off the top of my head, I cant remember. You can add any, multiple or none.  The decor of the place was awesome and the large wall of TV screens make this a fun place to go watch a game."}
{"text":"Place was better than I expected, loved the mixes with the blueberry drink. Definitely would make a stop here every time I'm out here in Vegas. I hope they make new flavors, tried about almost all of them....ALL GOOD!"}
{"text":"Not sure they got it together yet. I stopped in late night with a small order. Music was blasting and the workers behind the counter were having a hardcore dance party. I thought I was lost and had walked into \"da club\".  After a few minutes of waiting, customers began to lineup behind me. The dance party continued. The workers really didn't seem to realize they were at work.  After a little over 10 minutes, my 2 item order was ready. It was practically tossed at me over the counter from a worker who looked rather annoyed that I broke up her flow with my order."}
{"text":"Taco bell cantina is always great. Don't get steak nachos those are gross but everything else is good. This location is super popular for the late night bar crowd so be prepared to wait in line. They're normally pretty fast though."}
{"text":"Beautiful location & clean! Great staff! We ordered a lot and all of our food was correct and tasted great. If you visit or live downtown and like Taco Bell, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment with a party of 6 during a weekend evening.  Atmosphere: Poppin'! This is the most lively, colorful, engaging, and almost attractive Taco Bell you will ever go to. There was litter on the ground when I entered, but that's a quality shared with all of the places on the Las Vegas Strip. There are two levels to this Taco Bell, so you can eat inside, or looking down from above next to a giant television.  Service: Quick! There is a ticket system that calls you up when your order is ready. They were very fast with my order.  Food: It's definitely Taco Bell. So what do I mean when I say, \"It's definitely Taco Bell\"? Typical \"Mexican\"-inspired fast food with an American twist. Nothing special. But the chicken chalupas that were on the menu at the time were definitely something special! Also, they serve alcohol here.  Summary: A great experience for a fast food joint Want to see Taco Bell brought to another level? Go to this place! Definitely a Taco Bell of the future. I would not go for the food, but the establishment is something else."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Taco Bell. I have dreams of Mexican Pizza and cheesy burritos with fire sauce.  So when I saw that this location opened up and was serving alcohol, I had to check it out!  First of all, it's located in a little strip mall area by Planet Hollywood. It's right off the strip. We came here after we were at Marquee. It was freezing and made that made dash across the street!  This taco bell looks like a club.  There was actually a bouncer outside. It's got a really cool vibe and ambiance on the inside. It's two levels, but smaller than I had expected.  You order on the first floor and there's some seating on the second level.  It wasn't packed when we got there and didn't have to wait for that long.   The alcohol they serve is is slushy form and is not good. It was way too sweet and I love sweet. I was expecting this to be way better.   Overall, it's a cool place to check out.  Taco bell will always be taco bell and I love it. I was hoping for more booze wise though."}
{"text":"I love the Las Vegas Strip Taco Bell!!  What's not to love about having cheap tacos and spiked slushes?!   It's one of the first places that we visited on The Strip the first time that we came to Las Vegas, and it's a blast every single time!  It's open late, and is always full of people, and has music blasting at all hours!    The interior feels almost like a club, with colorful, bubbly water tanks above the different slush and alcohol dispensers, a dim ambience, loud club music, and an amazing upstairs loft area!  The main seating downstairs is the patio outside, which has a fun vibe and is good for people watching, but my favorite spot to sit is in one of the comfortable booths in the loft upstairs!  It feels more like a club than a Taco Bell!!    I love coming here and just sharing a huge plate of crunchy taco supreme's and getting one of the big slush drinks with vodka in it!  It's around $15 for the large, which is better value than most of the other places with similar drinks on The Strip!  So much fun!!  Not to mention the fact that you can get married here for $600, if you wanted to!!  I love the Taco Bell on the Vegas Strip!  It's such a blast, and I come here every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Sooooo i kinda see why this place has bad reviews already....from 1 taco bell lover to another im kinda disappointed and not with the food but with the service...i didnt even order when i was approached by a young lady who i am gonna assume is the manager...let be clear im on the strip and im drinking so i obviously have a drink in my hand and before i can order she say you need to chug your drinks or you cant sit in the restaurant its policy...like wtf its vegas everyone has a drink...guess what if my wife wasnt starving i would have took my money somewhere else...Guess i wont be back..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is the biggest Taco Bell fan in the entire world, let alone Las Vegas, so she HAD to go to this one.  She was in awe of everything.  She had a gigantic alcoholic slushy, which she loved, and of course, a taco.  It was typical tacos, but the atmosphere is awesome!! It was very nice inside with updated furniture and counters.  We didn't go upstairs because we were on the run, but it seems awesome, too.  Service was fast and my girlfriend had no problems with the food.  Viva la Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Say What?! Putting a place like Taco Bell Cantina on the strip AND making it 24 hours was one of the best ideas EVER... like seriously it's a Taco Bell on steroids! So I've known it's been open for a while but how often as a local do we really travel on down to the strip if it's not absolutely necessary? Anyways my niece flew out from Minneapolis for her bachelorette party and I somehow got talked into walking the strip and \"turning up\" with her and some of the bridesmaids. SO fun! Well after all that walking and drinking you know what happens after a while right? You get hungry! As we were headed down the escalators from Planet Hollywood we saw this HUGE billboard with Taco Bell featuring this new Doritos Chicken Nugget thing, sounds gross right, but it wasn't and I don't know if it was the alcohol or not but it looked pretty damn good to me. When you first arrive they have some security that is checking ID's for all those underage kids trying to be grown and drink. NOPE! This place was awesome once you are in they play some really good music and the vibes are just amazing. We had people dancing in the line with each other and just having a good time. Hell if I didn't know any better I would've thought that this was CLUB TACO BELL! I was all for it! The fact that they have a ton of different frozen mixed drinks to wash down your late night meal is even better! Did I mention that they also have some pretty awesome souvenirs and Taco Bell Apparel?! Dope! Once you place your order they actually take your name and have it put up on a screen so you know that your order is being worked on. Like many other places there is that once person that has the coolest job of calling out your name when it is ready... There is always that one person who like to give a funny name just so that when they scream it out it's redundant but FUNNY! Overall we had a blast here and I can honestly say I shall return!"}
{"text":"Most lively Taco Bell I've ever been to. Frozen drinks with alcohol mixed in,  cheap fast food,  live DJ blasting old school hip hop,  what more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"We travelled down to the new Taco Bell Cantina to see what the talk was about and came back disappointed. First off, it's way small. Not much in the way of seating and..it might hold half to a third as many people as a regular TB. Price-wise we knew it would be higher but it was nearly $30.00 for two trim adults and a small child. Since we paid that much for the food, I didn't think it would be a problem to ask for some water cups. Nope. Your option is buy the pricey bottled water (of course it is). One of the biggest turnoff was the loud clubby music...it wasn't very busy on a Thursday night but you still had to almost yell to hear the other person speak. Of course the place is on the strip so getting their requires you to park at a casino and walk it...not really a fault of the restaurant. The food is in baskets but they make them less convenient to eat out of (in some cases) than the regular taco bell paper dishes so the novelty of the dollar store dinnerware wears off in about 5 seconds. They do have a \"gift shop\" but it's really just a couple of tshirts and a hat or two.   We do enjoy Taco Bell but this place functions more as brand building ad space than as a place to eat. If you like Taco Bell but wish it were much more expensive, much louder and with poorer seating options, I guess this would be the best place. If you are on the strip already and aren't interested in trying anything new or unique, this might also be a great option.   Oh and I forgot the location's claim to fame...it serves alcohol. I guess THAT makes it unique but certainly not a reason to make the drive"}
{"text":"This place is everything.  Straight up the best alcoholic slushie I have ever had. I asked them to choose the flavour and the lady made one up on the spot by combining flavours!  Also. Might of had the best vegetarian cheese gordita crunch of me LIFE. LIKE GURL. THAT SHIT ROCKED MY CULINARY WORLD.  Thanks cantina. Ya did me a first trip to Vegas solid."}
{"text":"This place is not as good as the advertisements. It's just another Taco Bell with freezes that have alcohol. It also sucks because majority of the place is outside which would be okay in the summer but not around this time.  Needless to say I won't be back"}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes to get food from a fast food place. Not worth it.. tastes the same and overcrowded."}
{"text":"This place just opened up next to my work and I couldn't be happier. I'm not one for fast food at all but 24/7 with alcoholic freezes makes me excited. Place is always going to be busy but quick line because of quick service. I think most people think it's a big deal here, which it isn't because at the end of the day your still eating Taco Bell.....  If it's late or your drunk I'm sure this place will rock your world.  The steak quesadilla actually wasn't too bad. I mainly go there for the Baja Blast alone. Now I can spike it with vodka ;p"}
{"text":"UPDATE: 5/8 this Taco Bell continues to be comically bad. Here's a brief dialogue between me and the befuddled cashier this morning.  Me: I'd like a bacon crunch wrap please  Cashier: ok so uhhhhhhh... sausage crunch wrap?  Me: No, bacon please.   Cashier: ok....bacon...  Me: *goes over to wait at food pickup counter*  Cashier: Wait, you said sausage right?  Me: No, bacon.  Cashier: ok yeah bacon.  Can you guess what I unwrapped when I finally got my food and brought it to work? Ding ding ding! One poorly wrapped sausage crunch wrap. These guys have reached a new level of incompetence, it almost scares me. I miss Wendy's."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell in the world!!! Definitely a must see if you're in Vegas. Also, the food tastes extra good because it's served with a beer"}
{"text":"I saw the promotional video on Facebook that got a lot of attention, so I figured I should check it out. It was a \"classier\" Taco Bell in the sense that the decorations and food presentation was nicer - the food itself was standard. The unique thing about this Taco Bell is they serve the alcoholic slushy! I got the pina-colada with a tequila shot, which was about $10.... it was overpriced for sure because I would have gotten better value somewhere else. However, if you want an alcoholic Baja blast, then this is the only place. Overall, don't fall for the hype.. it's your standard Taco Bell, but more expensive and has alcohol."}
{"text":"I expected better from Taco bell, the restaurant that my family and I have worked at for 3 generations. The meat just wasn't seasoned the way they used to. Anyway, I got a beer and i felt too dizzy after and thats their fault. Love"}
{"text":"IT'S A TACO BELL WITH ALCOHOL AND HIP HOP! What is not to like?  This place was a lifesaver in Vegas as it allowed us to save so much on food when we were running over budget at the end of our trip. Heineken was under $6. A cravings deal was $5.99. We could get a complete and delicious meal, er, maybe not complete, but completely delicious, for about $15-$20 per person, including a beer.   They were blasting hip hop on the top floor where we sat on one visit. They also had some tvs showing various sporting competitions. On our next visit, we sat on the little outdoor patio. The seating here was a little cramped, but it made for great people watching of folks walking the Strip.  You can also get married here for very little $. The wedding in package includes a bunch of tacos and a hot sauce garter belt!   Staff was friendly on all our visits and I was very pleased when a chick agreed to serve me a beer even though I didn't have my license- had left it in a different bag at the hotel. I am so obviously over 21- I even showed her my grey hairs- so this was much appreciated!   They take cards. It was happy. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip!  Go here, eat tacos, drink beer!  Oh, they fill the beer from the bottom of the glass and then plug it with magnet. Don't remove the magnet or you will lose your beer! The magnet does make a great souvenir to bring home and throw on your fridge to remind you of the awesome time you had at this Taco Bell Cantina."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Service sucked and it was very unorganized my wait for just a chicken quesadilla took 30 mins there was no line people were just pushing around  I do not recommend going there. Should of just gone to the Taco Bell down the street from my house."}
{"text":"I've seen this place open up and I was always interested in stopping by and checking out the hype of this place. I'll be honest I was surprised! I was expecting the prices to be insane and the food to be gross but it was the opposite. It's like a normal Taco Bell except more hip ;). You're able to have fun at the same price as any other Taco Bell. They have a self serve soda machine that was pretty cool! They had a dj playing upstairs which fits in perfectly in Vegas!! I'll definitely stop by next time I'm in Vegas for reasonable prices and yummy Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Likes: Food, as always at Taco Bell, and cleanliness  Dislikes: Slow service (the workers were nice, but they needed an extra cashier and cook [the wait was 20 minutes]) and needed a bathroom key to use it (although I understand why.)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a no star rating I would. I work on the food service industry so I'm kinda bias. But this shit takes the cake I waited for 30 minutes for 2 tacos and a cheesy Gordita and it was made wrong. All I asked was for the damn beef to be sub out for black beans. I went back and it took them less than 3 minutes to make my food, this type of incompetence is obsurd. The second time they made it wrong again this place can't even make 3 items right and then the manager gives me my money back. I see why they are always hiring in this place they hire people who can't read \"SUB OUT BEEF FOR BLACK BEANS\""}
{"text":"I finally made my pilgrimage to the two story super deluxe taco bell and all my dreams came true. The cashier was not as thrilled as I was, but to be fair it was 4 in the morning. I recommend the cravings box for a bit of everything.  What else is there to say. It was a religious experience. I'd like to get married here."}
{"text":"Wouldn't imagine giving a 'fast food' joint 5 stars, ever! BUT it is literally 5 stars because I love their freakin' alcoholic Baja blast + they're open 24 hours + they have great service! The Baja blast was seriously 1000xs better than a Fat Tuesday. Also, they're not shady with their alcohol content! They'll make it as strong as you like and if you're crazy enough, you can even choose all the liquor you want! I was able to try their new naked chicken taco and it was just alright. The soda fountain is cool because it's similar to beer on draft. I wish we had a Taco Bell Cantina back home! I love it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just a normal Taco Bell but in a \"fancy\" setting. By fancy I mean just looks slightly nicer. Food is exactly the same as normal Taco Bells except with alcohol and overpriced merchandise. Price wise looks a little more expensive, I got the $5 meal box (the menu says limited time) so the price might only be for the grand opening, but it's on the strip so that's normal. Soda is on tap, same as normal fountain drinks but pours slower. Be careful topping off as they have a little burst when you first pull the the tap. Better food is available in the general area but if you want Taco Bell it's a neat little experience I suppose."}
{"text":"So the hype for this place was really big so when i went down to Vegas, my group and I decided to stop by Taco Bell Cantina (you can park at Planet Hollywood and exit to Las Vegas Blvd to your left hand side its right next to the subway by the elevators) the place was small, i mean its bigger than your usual Taco Bell but it was small and a bit crowded."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit to this location and I'm a fan! I live in the Flats and like to pick a place downtown to walk to for carry out dinner. I've been to many Taco Bells over the years. Love the Doritos loco taco supremes. Taco Bell is so random depending on the location you visit in terms of food quality and quantity and service. I go perhaps 3-4 times/ month at most.  This location is the best by far. I like that you can watch your meal being made as I always ask to add something, like sour cream or onions or whatever. Usually, I get home and find missing ingredients. This place had it down! And, they made the chicken chips fresh to order. Nice! I don't mind waiting a minute or two for fresh especially with fried food.  And, they apologized for the wait. No problem!! I prefer to wait and won't mind. The staff was awesome. I like that they have frozen alcoholic drinks and if we were dining in, definitely would have one. Yeah! I'm so glad this location opened up.   Yes, it's 2 doors down from Chipotle and there was a line there, which I totally don't get because I detest Chipotle! (prefer Moe's or Qdoba or any local places like Barrio, El Camino, Bakersfield, etc). Definitely, skip Chipotle and go here instead!"}
{"text":"Three words: spiked Baja Blast.  That's all I have to say about that.   FYI it's pretty tucked away so if you think you're going the wrong direction, you're probably going the right direction. It gets pretty crowded in there so make sure you know what you want right away."}
{"text":"Okay for real I saw this on Facebook when one of my friends shared this. The video showed Taco Bell and it had alcohol served. I thought it was a joke and I really couldn't believe that this actually existed. So what did I do, I went to go find it and holy mother of god IT EXISTS!!! Does it get busy folks. You better have a good wait time just for Taco Bell food and alcohol. Another thing beer and Taco Bell food goes well together. They also have like a viewing window to see how the employees make your food. There's an upstairs DJ Room but when I went it was closed bc they don't open up the room until 9 pm."}
{"text":"Let's first preface, that there is no Del Taco on the strip. There is a Taco Bell (Cantina!) though, and growing up in Northern California, I have an affinity to Taco Bell vs. Del Taco.  However, living in Southern California for the last 14 years, Del Taco has started to creep up and take over... mostly as drunk food, and mostly the Quesadilla... so that is why I YELP'd Del Taco, and found Taco Bell Cantina Instead.  Generally speaking, 24 hour Taco Bell.  Prices similar to off strip, and they serve Frozen Alcoholic beverages.  DJ Spins music upstairs, and the place is packed. Those workers are mad efficient too, they just be cranking out orders non-stop!  What more do you need to know?  Damn that music is loud too... people should just party here.  Beware the cameras upstairs, that display you on the big screen that everyone in the restaurant can see. So don't pass out, and don't do anything you don't want other people to see. LMAO."}
{"text":"Arriba, Arriba! ¡Ándale, Ándale!\"  I know I'm a dirty little whore for my taco bell addiction  and my short stature.  None the less Fiery Doritos locos tacos with spicy chipotle mayo and fire sauce are fit for all dirty whores of all colors, races, statures and differing sexes. Oh and you may or may not know they serve beer and frozen drinks. What could go wrong, downtown Cleveland, alcohol, 2am, and Taco Bell?   They have your typical cash register layout  where the fine and I'm  guessing infinitely patient workers take your order. The corporate  taco bell Execs came up with the ingenious idea of having a pick up area, so there is no awkward standing and foot taping while waiting for your order. The Taco Bellitas or Bellitos will simply call your name when the order is ready. THE service was polite and efficient."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Taco Bell and their drinks then you'll love the Cantina. If you don't care for Taco Bell then yeah it's just another Taco Bell. Just with a club scenery lol.  If you're like me and was on the fence to go.  If you like Taco Bell but especially their drinks the it's worth a try. Not gonna say it's better than a Fat Tuesday. But a Baja Blast with rum is a nice alternative. And I recommend rum cause it doesn't ruin the drink with the taste of cheap alchy."}
{"text":"This is a dream come true. You don't even have to get drunk before going to Taco Bell. They also seem to carry several special menu items that have been since discontinued at most other locations."}
{"text":"My wife ordered an alcoholic drink here. Before the employee was even done taking our order, another employee was already making the drink (which I commend). However the employee made the drink with vodka instead of tequila like she had asked the person at the register. When my wife advised her of the mistake she attempted to convince my wife to just accept the improperly prepared drink. My wife politely said she'd prefer tequila and the employee rolled her eyes and then made the drink. After employee handed her the drink without saying a word, my wife noticed the drink was overfilled and spilling, causing the container to be sticky and dripping. Overall it was a bad experience because of this particular employee who just had a bad attitude and wouldn't admit her mistake."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas celebrating a 21st birthday and one of the hot spots they wanted to go to was the Taco Bell Cantina, yep that were we went haha.  Yep it has 2 stories, but most of the seating is out on the patio, not much room upstairs, but upstairs is where the DJ is mixin it! That was a great DJ just spinin the hits!  The food, just like normal taco bell food, only thing different, you can buy ya some booze with them tacos, and that's what they did!   I can see how this is catchy, its perfect for Vegas. If looking for something different, go check it out!"}
{"text":"No joke while Iam mid sentence telling my order she turns away and talked to her friend who just walked in while I was taking my order. We were all just looking around totally in shock.  Then my order was wrong. So I take the food back and she asks me to open the rest of the burritos with my hands to see if there were correct inside. In shock I actually do it for a second. With just starting to open up the tortilla and Instantly get beans on my hands and it's a mess in general. I just look up and say \" can I please just get new food this is actually really gross.\" She rolled her eye and takes the food back. Obviously I watched them remake and made sure they didn't do anything to it. Such a number because I was really excited about checking this location out ."}
{"text":"Taco Bell with good music and drinks what more can you ask for when you are walking the strip. This isnt fine dinning but its fine with me."}
{"text":"Something about this place is so inviting. I mean it's basically just a \"fancy\" taco bell but all the employees are so full of energy and are very k ind and attentive. Atmosphere is just friendly overall. Food was well prepared unlike your typical taco bell"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place to go after midnight. Quick service as well! They have upper level seating along with the Dj as well as outside."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place less stars.   I am a vegetarian and ordered a bean burrito. I bit into a 5layer beafy burrito and when I told the staff I wanted it exchanged the manager Deandre took the burrito and receipt from me then I saw all the staff laughing at me including him. I then told them I didn't trust the new burrito they were going to give me so I asked for a refund. Deandre argued with me that I never gave him the reciept. A women employee brought me the reciept he took from me. He continues to argue I never gave it to him when obviously I did (proved by her bringing it back to me). Then he tried to have security ask me to leave which she apologized for and didn't because obviously he was in the wrong. He needs to be fired. I have never been so disappointed with any food place in my life. Completely unprofessional and this guy is not only a bully but also had a major ego problem for being a manager at a Taco Bell.... wrote this all in the tellthebell survey but doubt that will ever do anything.   Veggie buyers beware they will think it's funny to feed you meat, don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"This taco bell was so hyped on all these online articles and places to checkout websites. So of course, I was really excited to find this 24h spot on the strip that also serves alchol. To be honest, this place was such a disappointment. The drinks they served were good like their baja blast and some other stuff. Other than that the hype was just too real. The food was typical. Didn't really notice their specials that other taco bells don't have. The lines were super long and most importantly this place is small as hell. From pictures on Thrillist, I really expected to see a huge ass Taco Bell for their 1000 store, but nope small as shit. I for sure won't come back."}
{"text":"I was amazed at the pure sight of Taco Bell Cantina coming into Vegas, tucked on a nice portion right off the strip and very accessible. I went on a Wednesday night around 9PM to be blown away by their selection.  I am not a huge fan of fast food unless its the only option but I love Taco Bell in that sense, plus this one serves booze and who can turn that down? The store front hosts outdoor seating with a lit walkway, displaying the store in its glory. There is an upstairs with more seating as opposed to the ground floor which is mostly for ordering food/drink and buying Taco Bell merchandise. They showcase tons of drinks and the full menu with tons of liquor and beers.  I ended up getting a crunch wrap supreme with two hard tacos and a Margarita (Baja Blast with two shots of 1800). Honestly I couldn't have had a better time and think as minute as it may be, Taco Bell Cantina is a staple point to the classic Vegas Trip."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I actually came to this place sober.    It was kind of funny watching a buncha drunks being in a Taco Bell.   Anyways, Taco Bell is Taco Bell. Food tasted good as usual. Really cool spot to visit especially if your a huge Taco Bell fan like myself. It is kinda small here, so be prepared to wait and find a spot to eat. Definitely would come back here and try one of their mixed drinks.   There's also a Dj on the spot!"}
{"text":"This location is terrible! There was no merchandise as advertised, and the layout is totally wrong and non functional. The employees looked like they were having fun working there,  so that's good.  But that didn't make up for the huge let down this place is. The only place to sit is either on their patio that is blasting deafening music or upstairs, which is only accessible through a tiny, one person fire hazard staircase. Once upstairs, you realize this place was not well thought out. The whole place screams fire hazard as you are literally stepping over people's legs to get to a seat, I really felt like I was being pranked. The napkins and condiments were hidden away in some corner,  so we just ate without either of them because we didn't feel like crawling over people again. The music being played was annoyingly loud EDM, which I usually don't mind,  but when it's blaring like it was here, you can't help but want to get the hell out. I was so let down by this place because I am a HUGE Taco Bell fan. I wear my taco bell sweater with pride. Unfortunately,  I won't be returning and I recommend spending your time elsewhere."}
{"text":"As a fanatic of getting vegan Taco Bell-yes, you heard right, and it's really easy-I could not wait to get to this place because of everything I saw in a video about the drink selection and atmosphere. Super busy, which is to be expected, and quite the mix of patrons as one might also expect in Vegas. Seating is indeed limited but apparently we got there during a lull, so we were able to pick a spot out front with the fans that blow mist around. The staff looked a bit stressed but were handling themselves well, pushing out orders in a timely fashion. The young lady who handled our order was keeping cool under pressure and seemed relieved that we were patient and goofy, as we always are. It was awesome to get a Baja blast with tequila. I feel this place is a bit understaffed because the outdoor area was pretty dirty, but I'm sure that can be resolved."}
{"text":"Overratedd.   Getting to a Taco Bell Cantina was on my food bucket list because there are none in Michigan. I can now say that I've done it and it wasn't worth the time. This location had little to no merchandise like the company claims to have, the inside was big but still a Taco Bell, and although I had no intent to order drinks, the drink selection was far less than what the hype train made it seem.   You can do better."}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of taco bell but my kids are.   So we stopped by here for them to eat.   They have a nice place to sit and relax.  And they also have adult slushies.    Another plus was my kids wanted a non alcoholic slushie which was impossible to find in vegas but taco bell said absolutely.   They even had a ton of flavors to choose from.   So good for kids and adults.   Wish all taco bells could be like this."}
{"text":"I saw the hype of this place on TV and all my friends and family told me to check this place out on their behalf since I was going to LV.   We arrived at this place around lunch time on Monday, which was our last day in LV. We decided to grab lunch before heading to the airport. I will say the place is smaller than I expected. It looked bigger on tv. It was moderately busy around 12. It's two stories which is cool but the layout to thr counter is odd. Your mixed in with their Taco Bell souvenirs. Can be tight if people are just shopping for that.   The line moved pretty quickly as it does at any TB. I'm not much of a drinker so I got a slush drink virgin style. I got the blue one, totallt forgot the flavor but it was good and not too sweet at all, which was a plus. I ordered a simple soft taco with chips ans cheese too. I wasnt too hungry.   They have a nice seating area outside with heatlamps which came in handy when we came. We had our luggage so we didn't go upstairs.   I can imagine this place gets busy at night, if you're wanting to check it out I would during the day. Cool spot!"}
{"text":"Long lines, both to order and pick up. I customize menu items to be vegan, which is one of the things I love about Taco Bell (because it's so easy), but they managed to mess up our order. I understand it's new and they just opened so my boyfriend went up to tell them it was done completely wrong which they said they would redo. He went back up a second time and lo and behold it was WRONG again. If I were to go again it would just be for the alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"Perfect place to get a Twisted Freeze whenever you like and eat Taco Bell in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip at any hour.  It's open 24 hours and all the same food items you'd expect from any other Taco Bell is there.  The catch is you can get beer & Twisted Freezes.....  I wasn't interested in the food this time around and instead went with the Baja Blast Twisted Freeze with rum.  Highly recommend.  You also have the option to put tequila or vodka depending on your preference.   The Taco Bell pretty much has a mini bar/club vibe.  There's two floors, with the first floor for ordering/buying souvenirs and the top floor for seating.  The seating on the top floor is limited, but there's patio style seats with a view of the Strip. There are charging ports everywhere, which is cool  The other cool thing is that there is a ginormous screen containing 16 mini-TV screens to watch whatever you like.  If you like Taco Bell and you like Vegas, you can't go wrong coming here!"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: This is the most \"lit\" Taco Bell ever... literally. Don't come here in the daytime, come here at night- it's like a popping club. Skip the boozy drinks here, compared to other places on the strip they are SLACKING.  Food: It's Taco Bell- take it or leave it! Lol! It's your typical Taco Bell meal...  Service: They have a dope board that displays your name and when your good is ready- can you say helpful when you're boozed up?   Atmosphere: AT NIGHT - if they had a dance floor I'm pretty sure I would have been twerking. Correction- I am sure that I would have been twerking. The music is LIVE and the cool retro lights make it even more fun!  Not a fan of: The \"dining\" area is small so there isn't a lot of seating."}
{"text":"Better managed than at the previous business at this location (Wendy's) where street crud use to hang out and panhandle customers.  Sign on the restroom door says for paying customers only, staff will buzz you in.  Good move.  Efficient, friendly staff.  (Wendy's had attitude).  Piped in music is not too obnoxious.  Food OK.  Ordered three Supreme Tacos for $6.19, with drink $6.53.  Nothing special but it was alright.  Will visit here again."}
{"text":"If I paid $20 to get a lit frozen drink and a $5 cravings deal I wanted my food like duh. I'm sayin before 5 other people got their shit before me. Damn Americans are rude lol   They lost my ticket/receipt and they didn't even comp me for my time. I was wondering why the workers were standing around NOT making my order. After two people received their orders I went to the cash wrap to get ignored until someone asked me if I need help. Not to mention I came on a Monday and it was slow at 12:30am.   Long story short I got my meal after 20-25 minutes of waiting and my friends got their order and were finished. It was annoying.  Normally I give good reviews but this pissed me off. lol"}
{"text":"Definitely not what I was expecting. My date has been wanting to go here for some time, so we walked over here to see what all of the hype is about. It's pretty cool that they serve soda on tap, almost like beer. If I wasn't already drinking my Fat Tuesday, I wouldn't have minded self-serving my soda on tap or even their alcoholic slushies, but it seems like I was better off with my Fat Tuesday according to previous reviews on here. I definitely like the second floor, there's a lot of comfy couches for you to sit on, even a little DJ booth, I'm guessing there's live music here on certain nights. They were playing a lot of loud and hip music upstairs, it was pretty entertaining. Definitely quite an experience."}
{"text":"The pinnacle of my Taco Bell experiences. I feel that my journey with loving Taco Bell has culminated in this pilgrimage to the LV strip Taco Bell, the nicest and best-tasting Taco Bell I've ever been to.  There's two floors and alcoholic Fat Tuesday style drinks ($15 which seems about reasonable for the area) and merch! There's a bar and dj upstairs with lounge style seating. We parked at the planet Hollywood garage and it was a bit of a walk but entertaining nonetheless bc you can walk through a mall to get there. Service was really fast even tho it was crowded.  They have naked chicken chips ($5)! And fun apps like cheesy jalapeño dippers and little quesadilla bites. Probably not worth it but you can't get them anywhere else. The $ menu here is more expensive than other places, about $1.20-$1.40.   Also the cravings deal here comes with chips and cheese and not the gross cinnamon twists! Plus they grilled my burritos without me even asking.  This is the greatest Taco Bell I've ever been to. The food was the most nicely made of any Taco Bell I've ever been to, and I think anyone who loves Taco Bell has to make the trip here.   If you don't like Taco Bell you probably still won't like this Taco Bell LOL but it's entertaining nonetheless  Also when I came here there were a bunch of people eating chipotle inside, what's up with that"}
{"text":"I mean, its taco Bell haha there isn't much to say BUT the alcoholic freezes are sooo bomb! You would seriously never think there is alcohol in them!   The food tastes just like any taco Bell but it's expensive af! (Like most food in Vegas) I would say it's a good after the club meal tho. It didn't set well but again, just like any taco Bell lol   If you're staying near here, definitely go get a freeze!!"}
{"text":"I wish all Taco Bells were like this one. There's beer on tap, alcohol slushies, and of course the normal Taco Bell menu. But here's the kicker: this place has a freakin DJ. Yep. A good one too. It's fun just standing in line (and there will be a line). It's super loud and kinda hard to order cuz you have to yell, but the employees all seem like they're having fun."}
{"text":"I was really excited because Taco Bell + Alcohol, why would you not? YET, this is Vegas y'all.   Imagine is Taco Bell opened up on Frat Row , and this is what my experience was.  Came in on a Monday night after some time at Marquee across the ways and honestly, I'm glad we were close by because I don't think it would have been worth the effort otherwise.  It's a fancier/flashier version of Taco Bell. Took a while to get our food and the place was a mess. I'm pretty sure the girls standing in line were shoplifting the Taco Bell merchandise, and security did not care who cut in line as long as they were decent looking. Saw many girls without their shoes but ah well, this is Taco Bell on the Las Vegas Strip; anything goes.  Come for the Taco Bell, people watching, and drinks if you care and dare but prepare yourself."}
{"text":"I would give this 10 stars. TBC is the game changer for downtown Cleveland nightlife. Downtown Cleveland desperately needed a place to get cheap food late at night. Not only does TBC deliver that. It also serves alcohol. Don Julio. Legit alcohol. Go here."}
{"text":"INSANE Taco Bell!! I came on a Friday night and it was L-I-T!! I didn't know that there was a DJ that was upstairs, I just heard it as I was munchin' on my Crunch Wrap Supreme and enjoying my slushy!   It got pretty packed when I was in there, which makes it a little difficult to pick up your food because they have a screen that displays when you're order's ready, but apparently that's on it's own timer system and not actually accurate. Because I was standing there for 10 more minutes even after my name showed up on the screen because the lady said that the order wasn't ready yet. The nacho fries seem to be the hold up though because my friends that also ordered the fries were also lagging to get their food, but it was still all worth it in the end."}
{"text":"If you're not a Taco Bell fan you wont be amazed... However I LOVE Taco Bell and this is the coolest Taco Bell ever! All normal menu items plus a few added shareables and a huge line of slushes with the option to add booze! I got a Baja Blast with 2 shots of tequila and it was so expensive but so good, $9.99 for the regular size with a shot and $4.99 for the extra shot. There was also a fancy twisted cup for $14.99 but, I wanted less slush and more kick. Food was ready pretty quick for how busy it was. I recommend sitting on the second floor, they have comfy seats and there is even a DJ who was playing a pretty lit mix. Most I've ever spent at Taco Bell but, it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Steve (the manager) seems to be really miserable with his job and life.   He was extremely rude getting frustrated with people in the lobby.  It was more like he was herding cattle than welcoming people and kindly taking orders.  He seemed very impatient and when I needed to pay he kept repeating himself very rudely to which I responded that he didn't have to act so aggressively.  He replied that he wasn't which was a very arguementative reply.  This guy needs to take a customer service class immediately or find a different job if he is so unhappy."}
{"text":"This is by far the fanciest taco bell you will probably find! very busy! very cool  Food is the same as any other taco bell, nothing special  few complaints:  The cashiers here hate their job and they are hella rude and miserable. They have no hospitality, manners, no smile, just pure hatred for the job. The small asian girl working that night was legit screaming at customers and coworkers.  second, The margaritas have little to no alcohol. I know it's a fast food chain, but for $10 for the throw away cup for $16 for the souvenir cup (which is what I got) didn't even get me buzzed and i'm a light weight. (1.5 mike's hard lemonade will get me drunk) so extremely disappointed we drove 5 hours for this taco bell  but the piña colada was sure tasty and sugary!"}
{"text":"First off I LOVE Taco Bell like have it almost every day love it. So thanks to the internet/buzzfeed/Taco Bell's own snapchat I was pretty excited to go.  Result?  Underwhelming   It was just like any other Taco Bell menu wise except 3 items they only sell. Yes there's alcoholic drinks but I made mine better by adding a good amount with the mini bottles I had.  The merch online seemed like a store and it's just a small shelving unit once you walk in.  Employees were nice in answering my questions but we did lunch before the rush came so they weren't swamped yet.   As for music it's um...\"interesting\" to say the least. As in hop you like bad hip hop.   Basically if your a Taco Bell fan or just want food it's on a great location. But if you are expecting to be blown away I'm sure your local one can do the exact same job."}
{"text":"One of the first 100 in line at the new Tbell Cantina grand opening! What a celebration! Truly one of the happiest days of my life. I met the Fire Sauce mascot (my idol) and DJ inside played sexy back by JT. And of course, there was taco bell to be eaten.  The food menu at Cantina is exactly the same as normal Tbell. But the ambiance makes it taste better. I particularly liked the open kitchen that is in full view to customers - the ingredients actually look fresh contrary to typical fast food perception. With an ideal location off public square, I anticipate the food turnover to be quick and therefore will remain fresh.  Now to the new offerings of Cantina. BOOZY SLUSHIES. I got the twisted baja blast. They don't measure the alcohol and just dump in as much as possible to fill to top of cup. I saw reviews online of this drink being too sweet, but it hit the spot perfectly for me. Boozy baja blast and chicken chips go together like white on rice.  My new go to bar and restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"You can't come to Vegas without coming here. I mean, it's Taco Bell C A N T I N A. It was surprisingly small, which I didn't expect. There's two levels and they're both poppin. The Baja blast was great and the DJ was unexpected but awesome. I didn't stay long but from what I saw, it was cool."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell, what more can you say. They serve beer/alcohol ~ so what!!!! The music is so loud no one can hear when their names are called for food. If this is the \"flagship\" concept count me out for ever returning. I like to have a conversation with friends when eating, NOT a headache!"}
{"text":"I had to see for myself what the hype was about for this supposedly largest Taco Bell.   It's fun to stop by as a Vegas destination. They have a nice patio out front, with a security guard, and an upstairs space with a DJ. So you're in for a loud atmosphere. The inside area really didn't seem all that big to me but it's a cool space.   Sodas are served through taps which is cool and there's a huge array of different slushies, all of which you can order with alcohol. The food menu is the same, nothing fancier or unique. You can watch your food being prepared which may interest some.   For a late night cheap snack on the strip, I would choose the Cantina as my spot, but nothing more than that."}
{"text":"Interesting place.  Tacos and beer/margaritas. Very busy but great service.  Lines go quick.  Our order was complex and they made it right first tine"}
{"text":"How is this place allowed to not give you a cup of water when you order food.  Are you kidding me.  $42 in Taco Bell and I have to buy a cup for water.   YES.  no free water cup.   I will never ever come here again. What a joke"}
{"text":"Let's be real the only reason this is a big attraction in Vegas is the fact that it serves alcoholic slushies so when I went I didn't even bother with the food. It's the same everywhere!   We got a large slush in their taco bell cantina \"fat tuesday\" type cup/tower thing for $15. It is one dollar less than the original fat tuesday however I feel like it isn't as worth it because I'm not sure if they do refills here.   I think most people go here because you get some hints of nostalgia with the slushies combined with adult fun with the alcohol. I probably wouldn't return unless I was drunk and/or hungry at some odd hour of the night."}
{"text":"I wanted to pass by this place just to try their drinks and I finally got a chance to with my boyfriend. We ordered their baja blast freeze with a mix of whiskey and we added an extra shot. I think we made a mistake of putting whiskey instead of tequila because it tasted kind of weird and kind of strong. But I really liked the vibe inside because there was a DJ upstairs and they were playing really good music. So I'd recommend this place because their food is the same as any Taco Bell but they're open 24/7 with drinks and awesome music!"}
{"text":"Had a nice and pleasant experience here. Decided to stopped by here for awhile before returning home. I was with my brother and we each order our own. Food was actually good and I thought it was just an average one. Tasty burritos. Definitely worth the stop by."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell. The only difference is that they have slushes with your choice of alcohol. Personally I thought they were way to sweet, and not strong enough. Plus Taco Bell is my last choice to eat while in Vegas, but you do what you got to do with limited time and two preteens in tow.  If you've got a good buzz, and need drunk buzz food that is fast than obviously this is your place. But Vegas rocks when it comes to great food, so take your drunk or sober asses over to something that is more memorable."}
{"text":"This place is straight up GHETTO.  I love loud music but this was obnoxious.  Their sound system was absolutely horrendous.  The place was full of the trashiest people you'd ever see....just plain noped the eff outta there."}
{"text":"Tastes the same as normal Taco Bell except just more expensive since it's on the strip. The only bonus is that they have alcohol for those who like to drink. It is how ever convenient for those who are on the strip, and needing something familiar. But definitely not worth the trip if you just want to see what it looks like. There is no wow factor what so ever."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Taco Bell since maybe grade school but this new Taco Bell cantina in Vegas is giving me reasons to go to Taco Bell.  It's the first Taco Bell to serve alcohol!  Vegas is known for their Fat Tuesday's so Taco Bell Cantina jumped on that and made their own flavors of Fat Tuesday's!  The all famous Baja Blast has been made to an alcoholic Fat Tuesday in a fun long swirly cup and it's SO GOOD.  It's basically the regular Mountain Dew Baja Blast slushee mixed with your choice of alcohol!  I got Bacardi mixed in the drink and it was a very subtle but nice mixture.  The environment is very lively and fits in with its location on the strip.  They have a DJ on the second floor and he plays music 24/7, keeping the shop lively while enjoying your food and drinks.  They unfortunately have very limited space so it's hard to bring a big group of people in to eat.  The menu is the same as all the Taco Bell shops but it just seems like a more fun and enjoyable way to eat your Taco Bell.  I'm usually deterred from eating at Taco Bell due to the fact that it is a fast food shop but this place seems more like a place you would hang out after getting drunk and after a long night!"}
{"text":"The Taco Bell Cantina is a very cool concept, but definitely would only work in a party environment like Vegas. The space is very small and I can imagine it getting packed to capacity frequently. I did like that the price of the food was still relatively cheap, but the cost of the alcoholic slushes were around $10 each. It's very hard to see the menu until you get up to the counter, and at that point the employee rushed us to order and expected us to already know what we wanted. If you're in the city, check it out."}
{"text":"Taco bell regular menu + alcoholic drink only one restroom for two floors and lots of people and  not really a cantina more of a Taco Bell with loud music..no dance space.. I guess it's better since its 24 hours is a plus and regular Taco Bell prices not usually overpriced food places on the strip"}
{"text":"Been wanting to visit this place for a while since I've seen many reviews and news articles. Basically it's a club inside of a Taco Bell. Loud music everywhere and people MANY people. Good spot to socialize and grab a bite. The menu options are dirt cheap and I have no clue how YUM makes money with such cheap food. Dollar menu cheap burritos you name it they have it for fantastic drink food. Hey also have alcoholic slushes which are a PLUS."}
{"text":"If you looooove Taco Bell like I do, then this Cantina is something you'll enjoy during your stay in Sin City! The 2 story Cantina has alcoholic Baja Blasts, good music depending on who your DJ is, happy, dancing workers taking your order, and of course, the deliciousness of Taco Bell.  Food: prices will of course be a bit more than your local Taco Bell but you can't get the alcoholic Baja Blasts anywhere else! There's different flavors and you can pick from tequila, vodka, rum or whiskey.  Seating: there's outdoor seating on the first floor but if you take the stairs to the 2nd floor, you could eat and people watch or watch whatever they put on the big screen up top. If you forgot your hot sauces after you get your order, don't worry! There's a hot sauce area upstairs as well.  Ordering: after you order, you wait for your name to be called. If you're upstairs, there's a digital screen that'll let you know if your food is ready. You can watch your food being made through the giant glass screen as well."}
{"text":"If you're craving Taco Bell, or just want something cheap on the strip, then you need to come here. Coming from a family of Taco Bell aficionados' (my brother in particular) this place was a standout of our trip. Food is consistent with what you'd get at other Taco Bells, but there are some standout experiential aspects of the place.  Highlights are... - Taco Bell swag available for sale (we bought a sweatshirt and hat which have been great) - Open window into the kitchen (very cool if you've ever wanted to see the interworkings of a major foodservice chain up close and personal). - Outdoor seating (great for people watching on the strip) - Alcoholic freezes (fun but taste what you'd expect from a shot of tequila in a slushy)"}
{"text":"Great service, DJ has some great beats, food was above your average Taco Bell. Atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"Great new concept. Great fit for Vegas and the strip. Food is what you expect. Staff was friendly. Only reason I took one star away was music a bit too loud. Hard to have a conversation or take a food order."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole! This is the Taco Bell of Taco Bells!! This is literally the perfect place to stop after a night out on the Las Vegas Strip. You know, when you're sad because you lost all your money gambling or because you bought 50 drinks for 50 people you thought were into you and they all turned you down, or because you danced in a pool of your own tears that everyone else thought was just sweat, or because you're a normal person who loves a fucktastic greasy cheesy Mexi-American tortilla creation.   Go here. Buy yourself an alcoholic beverage, a Beefy 5 Layer, and sit in awe of the grandeur that is Taco Bell Cantina. I promise, you'll thank the universe. And if you don't, you did it wrong and you should try again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and first and second wife had an encounter here. It was terrible. Who knew all my wives and girlfriends love eating Taco Bell at midnight in Vegas. Anyways, the food was good. It was very similar to Ruth Chris Steakhouse in terms of fanciness. I haven't been to Ruth Chris steakhouse but even the quality of the steakhouse is the same here. Great gourmet food and great extravagant ambiance. I might be booking my wedding here. Watch out."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much just your average Taco Bell on the strip. The only biggest difference is they serve their typical Taco Bell slushies with alcohol. You can mix and match the slushies and comes with your choice of hard liquor (tequila, whiskey, vodka, rum). According to the server, mixed in whiskey is gross, vodka and rum if you don't want to taste the alcohol, and tequila if you want a good kick to it (although this just made it taste like a margarita). I know they also have additional items on the menu but it's your typical Taco Bell type bar food, nothing extraordinary.  It's a two story building with seating up top as well as a small shaded patio out front. I guess the cool thing is that you can pick up Taco Bell merchandise here (i.e. shot glasses, shirts, hats).  Probably a place to check out only once if you're a Taco Bell fan."}
{"text":"It's just Taco Bell ....sooooo yeah It's just Taco Bell  It's just Taco Bell  Like you can't get disgusting slushy drinks everywhere else and take them wherever you want   It's. just. Taco. Bell. Don't eat somewhere in Vegas that you can have at home"}
{"text":"Really cool place! I love Taco Bell and this was a really cool experience wish there were more of these concept ideas"}
{"text":"REALLY enjoyed this place because basically Las Vegas is expensive!! The twisted alcohol drinks are worth the money and mine lasted me the entire night! The food was delicious, and the service was fast. I loved it."}
{"text":"Dj Bell Grande was super lit playing all the top hits, taking requests and hyping up the diners. Their slushie drinks were delish 8/10. Food came out super fast and fresh. Staff was very friendly. Sit up stairs for the best lighting for selfies."}
{"text":"Ever had the undying urge to head-bob to club-bangerz while feasting on a crunchwrap? How about to slurp a Baja blast icee spiked with top shelf tequila? If so, venture to public square asap. Taco Bell Cantina, the weirdest fast food mashup since that Swiss Burger King installed a sauna in the back (I know, right), combines the binge-worthy noms we're all used to with upscale industrial chic decor...and the results are, well, pretty gosh darn awesome. On Friday night, the staff were laughing with guests as if everybody is in on the joke: this shouldn't work nearly half as well as it does. The DJ (you heard me right--a Taco Bell DJ!) was amiable and played bouncy jams til 12 at least. The food was your standard fare--\"fresh\", high-cal, and saucy. There were even armed guards out front in case anyone tried to abscond with their boozy Baja (the effect being one of Keep the Cantina Guarded, Men!). It's all very postmodern. And tasty too. Live Mas, mofos."}
{"text":"If you love \"The Bell\" as much as I do then you've got to make at least one stop (or in my case multiple stops) to the Taco Bell Cantina. Why you ask? Well, let me tell you.  First and foremost they have frozen Baja Blast featuring your favorite liquors: tequila or vodka. Your choice my friend, choose wisely. A cup of frozen Baja Blast will set you back $10, but worth every (insert which President is on that bill because honestly, at the moment, I can't remember).  The atmosphere here is much better than any other T. Bell you'll go to. It's got music playing, like fun club music, not boring muzak-type music. It's got two floors and features outdoor seating. It's got this lounge vibe, but really you're lounging with your gordita.  You can buy merchandise here! I mean, they have these taco hats and boxer shorts. Things you totally do not need, but when in Vegas and when the alcohol takes over your system, you just might buy it.  The pricing is still on brand. Being in Vegas, things can get rather expensive, but hey, Taco Bell is here for you. I may or may not have gotten a 5 dollar cravings box while in town, and yes, it was still 5 dollars and yes, it featured everything I know and love about the 5 dollar cravings box I get here at home. Who says Vegas rips you off? Well, at least not at the Taco Bell Cantina.  The staff was friendly. I mean, wouldn't you love to work here too? It's open 24 hours so I imagine they see some fun sites working the midnight shift.  Say what you want about Taco Bell, but this one is legit. It be its own type of tourist trap, but it works."}
{"text":"I'm glad I got to experience the hoopla of a Taco Bell Cantina.  It's a great concept with some additional food items you can't get at a regular Taco Bell and alcoholic frozen beverages.  This location looks a lot bigger in the pictures than it is, but there's plenty of room for the customers coming in and out of this place.  The store sells Taco Bell merchandise as well and offers a pretty loud/clubby vibe as music is pumped through the location.  If you haven't been to a Cantina location, this one's a good one to visit to get the overall idea of the concept."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am rating a Taco Bell, especially with so many stars, but this was a really fun place!  I got a rum lemonade/bluerasberry slushy and it was the best drink of our trip at a great price. It's a pretty fun vibe"}
{"text":"Super fun place to visit in Vegas... you don't see Taco Bells like these everywhere!  Come for the slushie drinks and cool environment - there's a live DJ that plays on the second floor!   Food is on par with your typical Taco Bell. I'm not a huge fast food eater, but I decided to go for it at this Taco Bell because well, Vegas.  Go for the experience and pina colada slushie!"}
{"text":"Why not all Taco Bell locations are like this!? This is amazing! Great vibes and baja blasts!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. No organization at all. There were two long lines that people kept cutting into. At one point one register went down  and they merged one line into another. When I finally got up to order my drink I ordered a \"twisted Baja blast\" which is exactly what it said on the menu. They are $9.99. She comes back with and charges me $15 because it's in a souvenir cup. I told her I didn't order the cup and she rolls her eyes at me and I just said forget it I'll just take it. I didn't feel like putting up a fight over the music that was way too loud and over the noise of the workers calling out the names of people who's orders were ready. Save your time and just go to a normal Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Aside from going here at 2 am when the service is slow and the service could be friendlier, this place rocks! If you are a Taco Bell Fan you'll be thrilled to discover mixed drinks to have with your taco! There is limited seating outside but that is it. Or what i also thought was great was the merch they sold inside. Who doesn't want to purchase a Taco Bell sweatshirt or towel?!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for pretty good  In the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, Taco Bell Cantina is the soul of the new Taco. Opened in the same time frame of the Taco Bell logo refresh on November 14, 2016; this has the honor of being the first flagship Taco Bell in addition to being the first Taco Bell with a gift shop. This is Taco Bell's CMO Maria Thalberg's take on the first flagship Taco Bell,  \"This flagship restaurant is our ultimate expression of the Taco Bell brand, and lifestyle.\"  The way I see it, the first flagship Taco Bell is likewise the ultimate expression of the Las Vegas brand, and lifestyle. First off, it serves booze. Second off it is open 24/7. Third, it is large and modern. If I am not mistaken this is one of the few if not the only two-floor Taco Bell. In Las Vegas style, it incorporates a VIP lounge and DJ booth. And in millennium fashion, it incorpatrs the aspects of a modern restaurant. Fronting the restaurant, which by the way is formerly a pizza place, is a patio. The patio is equipped with misters for cooling off in the brutal summer weather, coverings, and LED lighting. In addition to outside patio seating the second-floor mezzanine has sufficient seating overlooking a 16 screen television system. Below the mezzanine and in back of the patio is the modern lobby that includes the gift shop, open kitchen, and order counter with digital menu boards.  Taco Bell has a reputation as hangover food. However at the flagship Taco Bell, customers can drink alcohol prior to the hangover. This Taco Bell is all about drinking and eating. In reality it is a Taco Bell Cantina. In addition to being the first flagship and 7,000th Taco Bell, it is the fourth Taco Bell Cantina. Right where you order below the digital menu boards is the alcohol. The alcohol of choice are beer on tap and twisted freezes. The twisted freezes allow for some creativity. Customers can add vodka, tequila, or rum to any of the eight flavor bases. The customer can order the drink in two different sized souvenir cups.   It was on Christmas Day, 2017 when I stopped here for lunch. This was my first visit to a Taco Bell since June, 2013. With so many Christmas decorated hotels & attractions to see and work the next morning, I wanted something fast and inexpensive. In my opinion any meal less than $10 on the Strip is inexpensive. For approximately $8, I ordered the Nacho Bell Grande meal that included a Taco and 32 ounce drink. Paying little heed to the alcohol drinks in front of me, I headed to the caffeinated drinks in back of me. They were Pepsi beverages. After the meal the 32 ounce refill came to good use on my continued travels along the Strip. Back to the food. In my opinion it was filling and pretty good.  Generally speaking I was satisfied with the friendly customer service, atmosphere, selection and food. My one complaint is that the letter fonts on the menu boards are far too tiny. You shouldn't need 2020 vision to order fast food. In contrast to the conclusion of my last Taco Bell review, I will end this one by saying that, \"I will no longer run to the border before I return to a Taco Bell.\" The first flagship Taco Bell restaurant has changed my opinion of Taco Bell for the better. There is an 80 percent return factor."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Taco Bell Cantina, and I was really excited for the experience. Unfortunately, my experience quickly became really frustrating due to terrible customer service, specifically by Caitlin. I asked if there was any water to fill my cup at the fountain drink station, and Caitlin was quick to dismiss me, saying there was only bottled water several times and with attitude. Being from Arizona where it's illegal to not serve tap water for free, I was confused by this and tried to clarify why there wasn't any water. Caitlin demonstrated very little patience and was very dismissive. I am extremely disappointed in Caitlin and her customer service, and I won't be back because of her."}
{"text":"This place is really nice!!!! I love that I can go to taco bell and have alcohol w my food!!!! Such a good idea!!!! Price is pretty reasonable, our nacho bell grande was average if you were to buy elsewhere off the strip!! I love Their Mountain Dew Baja last so finally get to drink my fav drink w a touch of tequila! You can add an extra shot if you like just like any other places!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the negative reviews. The staff is super friendly. This is one of the most fun food experience that I've had in my life. If you are in Vegas you must check this out. Also the staff makes sure that the food is not just thrown together but prepared very well. This is the best Taco Bell on the planet in my opinion and I've lived around the world."}
{"text":"They need better merchandise!!!!!! I was so excited to finally see this place but was disappointed once I got there. It's not that spacious inside but the slushee wall is pretty cool. The merchandise is kind of basic and not that appealing enough to make me want to buy it. I just feel like the cantina has a lot of potential to be super poppin but it's not at that level yet:/"}
{"text":"24/7 Taco Bell with alcohol? Is this real life??? When in Vegas, you just have to come here because where else in the country can you get Taco Bell and alcohol at the same time ! I was super keen on coming here after seeing so many videos of it on Facebook and honestly I thought it was worth it.  Obviously the food is literally exactly the same that you would get in a normal taco bell and there's nothing special about it. But why change the food? That's exactly the food I go to taco bell for. If you change the food, it's no longer taco bell.   Inside there are these really cool lights and bubbly lit tubes going down on the menu over the cash registers. It's full of cool lights and there's a bunch of seating both inside and outside. It's basically a flashier version of Taco Bell that you would expect to see in Vegas. If you're a true taco bell fan, you can even buy souvenirs inside. The biggest con is the amount of people here and the line felt incredibly slow moving.   As far as the alcohol, you can pick from beer, wine, or the freezes which is basically the taco bell slushies with alcohol mixed in them. I would totally recommend the freezes since beer and wine you can get anywhere else. The baja blast freeze with bacardi was worth every ounce of sugar.   All in all, it's taco bell with alcohol so don't expect anything more then that. Not really sure why there are so many negative reviews of people having higher expectations. But to me, that combination alone totally makes it worth a visit and it's something you just have to experience when in Vegas even if it's just for the snapchat. The fact that it's open 24/7 makes it the prime spot to go to after a long night of clubbing and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Being the flag ship store I'm was not impressed.   Yes I get it's Vegas and you now have Alcohol drinks, yay but not worth the hype.   The menu is like any other Taco Bell, was expecting more an exclusive menu that is not served at other Taco Bell and it was just more flavor for the freeze and adding hard liquor to it and then 6 items that is not at any other Taco Bell which was shareable. But everything is served at another other Taco Bell the the 7 later deep jut now it's to share. Nothing big.   Service is good, decor is great. I guess if you want to go and say you been then yeah stop by but if not, it's not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. While the cashier was happy, she didn't make my freeze and handed me a cup.. Didn't order a drink. No worries that issue was fixed quickly. There was a group of people bunched together waiting for their order. One lady was calling ticket numbers and the other was calling names... Let's get on the same page people. Then it was this creepy lady standing off to the side \"observing\" the employees. The manager was helping and getting orders out. Not sure who this lady was.  They really should invest in a microphone you couldn't really hear names or numbers being called. And to top it all off there was barely any food in my soft taco. May have to go to Barrios next time."}
{"text":"I loved this place everyone had really good attitudes and food came out quick I'd definitely come back keep up the good work"}
{"text":"They will fuck up your order and send you to the back of the line like you don't matter"}
{"text":"Still having the cravings menu (dollar menu) on Las Vegas Blvd is phenomenal on their end. Good company"}
{"text":"What an interesting and fun Taco Bell that is located on the Strip.   I came here mid-morning and the place was busy, but not too busy. They have inside seating but it's upstairs and they also have outside seating on the covered porch. I always enjoy eating outdoors, so this was a very nice treat.   The guy at the register was very friendly and took my order quickly. I decided on the naked egg taco bundle that came with two tacos made of egg (the shell part) potatoes, bacon, cheese both shredded and nacho cheese sauce.  This was my first time trying this and it was surprisingly better then I expected. I would definitely order it again. This cost $3.49.  As I waited for my food to come out, I looked over the menu and saw that most of the items weren't much more than off the strip. This is a great thing for those that don't want to spend a lot of money on something quick.   This Taco Bell offers alcoholic drinks as well as clothing items. Not sure I'd ever buy any clothing items with taco bell on it, but if you're into stuff like that, they offer it here.   When you place an order, your order is displayed on a digital screen. This is a nice feature so you can see when your order is ready without having to listen to your number.   Would come back again."}
{"text":"Best place on the strip to get a frozen cocktail. I know it sounds weird from Tack Bell right!?! Good flavours, booze and $5-$10 cheaper than the other places along Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is probably the nicest looking Taco Bell I have ever been to. It was supposed to be one of the cantinas, but they didn't have a liquor license when I went, so at the time they were just like any other Taco Bell. Lots of seating, TVs along the wall, and very friendly staff made the experience better than most branches. The food was about the same as what you would get anywhere else, but it was a much nicer eating experience."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 7 people. Staff was disorganized got 5 of 7 orders wrong. Ordered drinks too, all double shots only saw them pour one. Maybe the staff was drinking the second ones...."}
{"text":"ITS SO LIT!!!!!!!!!!  look, I'm more of a del taco kind of gal but this place was amazing. i walked in and felt like i was in a club. though this place is smaller in person... but they blast loud hip-hop music (at least when i was there) where most of the shop is store merchandise for sale.  there is also a huge clear window where you can watch the wonderful taco makings of the staff for all your orders!  i didn't order the food... but i tried the blue raspberry with tequila and mountain dew blast with vodka and they were SOOO good... though i truly don't know if there was any alcohol in it because it didn't taste of any (aka delicious) and didn't get me drunk at all. but it was great because i enjoyed the taste and vibe of the location!  recommend you check it out! got me excited after being sluggish from a buffet just by walking in!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell.  It's my guilty pleasure.  So I had to stop by and try the new Cantina with the alcoholic drinks.  Amaze-balls.  The Baja Blast with rum goes great with all of the Taco Bell classics."}
{"text":"Its a cool and awesome place!! Not your ordinary Tacobell, but they play music too loud like you're in a club or something I don't think its really necessary to have the music super extra loud.  Other than that its a unique Tacobell."}
{"text":"My friends are super fans of Taco Bell, so they were super excited to visit Taco Bell Cantina. What's so special about the Taco Bell Cantina? Well, for one thing, they are open 24 hours a day. They also serve alcohol, which is a plus since Taco Bell is already drunk food.  Other than the chance to get a beer or alcoholic twisted freeze, the menu is the same as any other Taco Bell. But I do like that they display your name on a screen when your order is ready to be picked up."}
{"text":"Omg! Heaven on earth as Steve Aoki once said! I stepped in and you are in paradise. They have freezes with or with out alcohol which is family friendly. Ambience is out of this world and it makes me come back for more. Service is spot on and will definitely come back for more! Thank you Taco Bell staff for rocking my bell!"}
{"text":"Prices are same as a \"normal\" Taco Bell. They had the $5 box. Place is reallllyyy loud but to be expected, its Vegas. But it was hard to order because it was so loud and you can't hear the cashier. Also menu font is way to small, I couldn't read anything, so good thing I already know the Taco Bell menu."}
{"text":"Who doesn't LOVE Taco Bell!   It's so good it makes you gooooo :| LoL  So to be 100% honest I only have Taco Bell about once or twice a year. I do enjoy it but at the end of the day I always end up on the toilet (FaceSmack Emoji).   This is definitely one of the two visits this year for me. The best part about this Taco Bell is that it's located in Las Vegas and is a Cantina which means thy sell alcohol :) and they have a live DJ with club lights. Late night Taco Club LoL   Walking in the location definitely had a great live atmosphere. It had bright eye catching colors and lively welcoming music. It was still being a bit under construction but that didn't stop people from enjoying good comfort food and drinks. The place was packed, they offer indoor and outdoor seating. As I waited in line I got to talking to a couple of men about how awesome this place was to only find out they were the owners/investors (explained why they were in suites and ties) They gave me a bigger picture of the plans for the next couple of days and invited me to the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor was still being worked on, but it will also offer seating and people will be able to order food and drinks as well. It was coming together nicely and I can see this place being non stop busy.   Don't forget to check out the second floor, merchandise is sold on both floors as well.   Enjoy your taco bell and drinks!"}
{"text":"THE HUB FOR TACO BELL AWESOMENESS!  Came here for the second time during my time in Vegas and yet again, was blown away by the taste, atmosphere and love of this place.  Ordered the tequila Baja Blast drink and couldn't have asked for more.  I will definitely be back again, and will most likely purchase a hat or shirt to remember this awesome experience forever.  LIVE MAS!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell Cantina is The Real MVP!  Definitely not your average local Taco Bell.  Besides the food service, they had the frozen drinks which all spelled out \"Taco Bell\". Only a few were in service. They have a unique way of pouring draft drinks. Food is average. It seemed a bit disorganized but no major complaints. The music was great but a bit too loud. I didn't know they had a live DJ playing music up until we went upstairs. The upstairs section provides more seating and a view of the DJ. They also have TV's located upstairs which lets you see parts of the restaurant, including the DJ and some regular TV as well.  Come by and check it out!"}
{"text":"Grand opening night was not bad. We wait for an hours and half to 10:30pm to order ours food. They gave $5 gift card at the door. Most of food and combo still same price, Cinnamon delight is cheaper than regular tacobell 4pack only $2!!!! At this location you can watch the kitchen.  FYI: one shoot of Vodka will cost you $5"}
{"text":"i Never write a review when it comes to fast food restaurants, but since i love taco bell i just had to stop and see this place,  to begin with if you don't like taco bell, than this review isn't going to change your mind.  they have more items than your regular taco bell restaurant, and they serve alcoholic drinks. the staff can use a little more  smiles but than again its taco bell i only come here for the food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty small considering it's supposed to be a Flagship type store. They have some different options than a regular Taco Bell like sharable foods and alcoholic slushes but other than that, it's just another Taco Bell. Considering it's supposed to be an upscale Taco Bell, you would figure the service would be upscale as well. The employees that were there didn't seem like they wanted to be there.  With that said, the food was decent and the ambiance was great."}
{"text":"Apparently I didn't finish my review of this place back in November of 2017. Wow. The app is really buggy. But I'll go on.   The menu at this location is different from a regular TB. There's more finger food, and of course, the alcohol infused concoctions. My favorite is Jack Daniels in a frozen mountain dew Baja blast.   The regulars and favorites from any location, chalupas, bean burritos, tacos (naturally), are all available. Just some different styles of the quesadilla with better salsa which is really cool. Maybe we'll see the \"Cantina\" style TB expand to other cities, but it's fun to visit and people watch while eating. The later in the day and night, the more fun it gets. Oh, and I do believe this location is open 24/7."}
{"text":"This review is only for their freezie. It's essentially a normal Taco Bell with their version/rival to the famous Fat Tuesday.  We got the bigger cantina ($15). There was also the smaller one ($10) but it didn't seem worth at all. We got the mountain dew baja blast which I thought was just okay. They have different options for your base liquor between Skyy vodka, tequila, Jack Daniels whiskey, and Bacardi rum.  Overall it's pretty much the same as the Fat Tuesdays. The Fat Tuesdays might be more potent and bigger so you should probably just get those instead. The other cool thing is you can get married here if you're a Taco Bell enthusiast or super fan."}
{"text":"This may be the first time I have ever used \"lit\" non ironically. Taco Bell Cantina is lit af. Congress could unanimously pass a bipartisan budget if it included funding for a Taco Bell Cantina in every major city. The music pounds at just the right level where you could start to ramp up your night or bring it back down with a 3 AM fourth meal. There was a wedding reception upstairs and I wasn't mad about it. The outdoor patio has heaters for those chilly desert nights. Vegas' ubiquitous yardlong margarita is upstaged by yardlong boozy Baja Blasts."}
{"text":"This place is a must see when in Vegas. Where else can you find a Taco Bell with draft beer, Margaritas slushies, and a DJ? They also sell Taco Bell merchandise. The line was long but went by quick, they have an upstairs seating area along with outdoor patio area on the bottom floor. I wish all Taco Bells were this fun."}
{"text":"My first experience at Taco Bell Cantina was everything I could ask for.  F O O D It's got the same great food any other Taco Bell has. It had been a long time since I had Taco Bell and my time here reminded me how great it is. Come here expecting Taco Bell food and you won't be disappointed.  A L C O H O L They have hard alcohol, beer, and some sugary frozen drinks. We got some shots of Tito's to keep our buzz going. Niiiice.  A T M O S P H E R E It's right on the strip with party music blasting. Taco Bell, alcohol, and good vibes 24/7? Yes please. Perfect setting for a great time.   If you want some quick junk food while you're in the area I definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"DAY:  - Sunday for lunch.  LOCATION/INTERIOR:  - located next to Walgreens.  - It's a 2 story building with the order counter and patio seating area on the 1st and more seating area on the 2nd floor.  - The restroom is upstairs and there is ONLY one. This does not seem very effective, as there was a line when we were there.  - There is a refillable drink station.  ORDER & TASTE:  - Naked Chicken Chips ($6) - this was one of the menu items that is executive to this location.  Chicken chips was the same everywhere else.  The potato was plate was good.  - Chrispy Chicken Quesadilla - this was okay, I like the chicken chips alone not really in the quesadilla.  Definitely more disappointed, since my expectation was high from the flagship store video I saw.  The Freeze were good."}
{"text":"Taco Bell + Alcohol = Dream come true  At least that's what it looked like on the video that was going around on facebook. Maybe I just over hyped it to myself. But it's not bad for what it is.  It's located on the side of Planet Hollywood, across from the Cosmo. Really easy to find. There is the typically menu here, plus some 'shareable' plates. at various valued prices. Got the bacon  potatoes and the jalapeno dippers. Really yummy and they were decent sized too!   So I thought there would be a DJ or something, I thought I saw that in the video, but maybe it was just for the grand opening? But it's just loud speakers playing top 40; at least when my party was there. The alcohol situation is limited to beer and/or a shot in their freezes. $5 for the add shot though. Comes in a souvenir container. The one my friend got wasn't mixed up all the way so you got all the vodka first than the freeze after.   VERY limited seating. The upstairs holds a one stall bathroom (!!!!) and about 6/7 tables and some bar stools. There's also seating in their outside patios, but if the heaters aren't on, than yall freezing!   I don't like that you don't get a tray to carry your food when they call your name. Also they don't check numbers/receipt, just on the good faith that its your name they called because there happened to be TWO other Vivian's there at the same time I was. My order was called first and they were arguing with Vivian #2l who said that wasn't what she ordered. I had to fight the crowds to get up there and tell them I am also Vivian! Also I ordered 3 different things cause I was splitting with my boyfriend, and they were like \"you ordered ALL these?!\" And I'm like yes I did. Manager, \"are you sure?\" Yes here's my receipt \"So you ordered all this??\" YES CHECK MY RECEIPT!  I don't think he believed me though =T So without a tray, I had to do a very delicate balancing act through all the people to get back to my table.   So if you were looking for some sorta cheap food on the strip, especially late at night, it's worth it. But it's definitely not as cool as it seemed on the facebook marketing video."}
{"text":"Such a cool place! Loved all the alcoholic drinks. One of the best fast food places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Listen... this place isn't going to win any awards and it's not the end-all, be-all taco place in any city. But, the experience of coming here is incredibly fun and I would recommend it to just about anyone. The atmosphere is lively and the frozen margaritas are delicious (especially if you like a simultaneous alcohol/sugar buzz). If you're a fan of Taco Bell, this is the holy grail. If you're not, I'd still pop in for a visit if only for the experience of it all.   Taco Bell is swinging for the fences with this one and I think it's a complete success."}
{"text":"Omg do not come here they messed up our order and it took us over an hour for them to come up with another order because \"the system was backed up\" which it was not. I witnessed about 20 orders go in front of mine. PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE. They also just \"threw out\" the couples order in front of us and messed their order up too. Please avoid this place. WE JUST GOT A REFUND AND LEFT. Screw this place. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE"}
{"text":"So you're broke or drunk or both. This Taco Bell will light you up! More like a lounge with a a full bar, there's nothing like a taco/burrito combo meal with fire hot sauce to ring your bell.   Full salsa bar to enhance and embellish your hangover munchies.   Freeze Bar, for you that want a alcohol laced slurpy. Big screen TVs. If you were a winner or at least wanted to feel like one, there's a full section of Taco Bell gear.   You just have to see it. Viva Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Even at 6am on a Wednesday, the music is quite loud.  But all the employees were friendly, prices are fair for the strip & I'd go back just for the novelty of it."}
{"text":"\"I spent $40 at Taco Bell\" --me when I got home from Vegas.  I gotta admit. I LOVE the TB. It's definitely my guilty pleasure. So when a friend told me about the Taco Bell on the Strip, I made it a point to stop by. The location is pretty central and easy to get to.  They offer the normal menu, but they also have an added small plate menu, which can only be found at these Cantinas. Of the small plates, we tried the 7 Layer Dip and the Spicy Ranch Smothered Potatoes. If you ever tried the potato loaded griller, it's the same potatoes. They tasted just like loaded potatoes and were delicious. The seven layer dip was similar to that of the kind you'd make at home, but they were chinsy with the chips. Of course we obliged in the $10 vodka Baja Blast freezes, which was what made the check so expensive.  Was it amazing? I don't know. The food tasted good and it was a fun experience. I wanted to buy a taco shirt, but my husband wouldn't let me. He's like \"are you really going to wear a Taco Bell shirt\" UM YEAH."}
{"text":"Very small place, to busy and to crowded bc of the size. Hard to find a table food is normal Taco Bell food."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Taco Bell I have ever been to. And Im just talking food quality here, not even to mention the alcoholic/bar selection. I have been to this Taco Bell 6 Times since my trip here. This makes every Taco Bell seem like a c lister, It will never be the same for me! The quesadilla is stuffed to the brim with cheese, chicken and sauces; everything comes out fresh, you can see them cookin It up in the kitchen! Everything is hot, the tortillas are soft, and the sauce is flowin!!! Probably going to go there for dinner too. Now on to the service, the customer service is on point. Everyone is so kind and It majorly enhances the experience, whether I'm sober and starving, or wasted at 4 am, they are happy to have us there!! And at night the music is bangin! -Better than the club selection. I love you forever TBell."}
{"text":"Stopped by Taco Bell Cantina recently to try their unique menu items. I love Taco Bell! And I really like the Cantina concept. I don't see why these new menu items couldn't be rolled out to all Taco Bells, save the alcohol.  It was interesting to see a bottle of Bacardi Rum sitting on the counter behind the cash register as I placed my order. I ordered a 6 pack of naked chicken tenders, a chicken cantina bowl, and a Mountain Dew. My food was ready in under a minute and it was hot and tasty. I started off with the chicken tenders. They were thin, looked like Doritos, and were very tasty, especially when dipped in the warm cheese sauce. For $1.99, this is a nice filler. My chicken bowl was fresh and tasty too. I really liked it. I added some Diablo sauce for heat. The bowl cost less than $5.00 and my entire lunch was under $9.00. That made me happy because when I dine out for lunch, I don't like to spend more than $10. My Mountain Dew was the perfect drink to wash down my yummy lunch.  I liked that they don't shoot the guacamole into the bowl with a gun. Instead, they spoon it in. This was done per the chef that invented the new dishes.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"THAT SHIT IS LITTY!!! It gives u a good vibe immediately walking in .. it turns you up while u get your food .. the BEST part is u can order ur favorite combo or meal and a alcohol slushee  PLZZZZ GO"}
{"text":"Yup went here.  I'm ashamed I let my curiosity get the best of me.  It's a flippin' taco bell people.    Only difference is that it's open 24 hours, and you have to wait in a line of other idiots and listen to DJ Poopstains spin upstairs.  Dammit."}
{"text":"At first I thought the idea of this was really great. But I had some thoughts on improvement for Taco Bell Cantina. When you're order is finished, an employee yells out your order name. They also show if your order has been completed on a screen. I just wish it was more organized. The store itself looks really awesome but I wish it was bigger. Also they have merchandise downstairs but I feel like it makes the lobby even more cramped when trying to place your order. I ordered a blue  raspberry freezer with vodka. But it just didn't taste strong at all. I just think $10 for a small alcoholic freezer is too highly priced yet it should still taste like there's alcohol in it. I think it's a great spot to hang out and overall I enjoyed it. I just think this great idea could be improved."}
{"text":"I really loved the ambience of this place.  a little hard to see the menus, especially while under the influence but overall experience was nice here! I was surprised to see an upstairs dine in! Will definitely be back when I'm Vegas"}
{"text":"What a unique place this is! If I had to describe this place I'd say it was a Taco Bell with a little liquor and some good jams lol. Came here with my travel companions aka college friends after our day long trek through the Vegas streets and had a really fun time.  Basically this is a regular Taco Bell with a bar/lounge like feel offering typical menu items BUT alcohol additives to the drink options. You can choose from 4 different types of liquor to add to your drink of choice and it will be blended into a delicious slushie to your liking.  Also, this Taco Bell is open 24 hrs and has a DJ on the upper deck playing a variety of different hits and genres. This was a really unique Taco Bell and hey who doesn't like alcohol with their Mountain Dew Baja Blast and some good music too?!  Check it out y'all! It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Yoooooo This is one of the best Taco Bell's I've been too!  Sell fire drinks and they are all hyped.  Great music! Workers are super chill!"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends who were visiting. Its nothing special, just a regular taco bell with drinks. The cashiers were not friendly at all and were less than enthusiastic to answer any questions I had about the drinks. It seemed like such an inconvenience. Food was good, as always--being it is a taco bell. It was kind of empty. We went upstairs and they had a DJ, he was playing pretty old music, but not bad. There was one bathroom upstairs, and there was always a line. Drinks were expensive. Small one only had one shot, the size up had 2 shots and were about 10-20 price range--I can buy a bottle with that money. Nothing special, but if you love taco bell and want to hang out here, its pretty chill."}
{"text":"Such a fun concept. I love Taco Bell and the fact that they offer a DJ and alcohol I was sold. My friends and I came in late after attending a show near by you could hear the music from down the street. The atmosphere was real chill we ordered and headed upstairs to the lounge area to eat. The food was good the DJ was on point we had a great time. I would love for them to bring one of these to Dallas!"}
{"text":"They put the Food Pick up area in the corner where the people ordering are coughing breathing all over my food. Terrible idea! Don't want people breathing all over my food!"}
{"text":"So tasty and economical.  Don't like it? That's comical! Quasadilla so big to share with a friend Crunch wrap, gorditas.. there's really no end.. To the list of tasty treats for my mouth - mama mia! Although often inducing diarrhea."}
{"text":"This was the best Taco Bell I've ever been to. Whether you're high, drunk or completely sober, you're gonna have a one of a kind Taco Bell experience. There's outdoor and indoor seating which is nice. If you're looking for peace and quiet, don't come to this Taco Bell because once you walk in, it's a party. There's a live DJ playing music and giving random shoutouts. The interior was really nice and clean. Their soda machine was set up like a tap which was fun! The staff was really friendly and helpful.   Let's talk about the food. I usually get a shredded chicken burrito, which I did this time and it was hands down the best one I've EVER had out of like 1,000+. The quality of the meat was different and you could tell it was really freshly made. It had the right amount of sauce and cheese vs it being more dry at the other Taco Bells I've been to.   I didn't try the twisted freezes but they looked really good, would definitely try sometime in the summer! If you love Taco Bell, you HAVE to experience this one."}
{"text":"Okay. I was super excited to get there! I loved the club vibe and down to earth cashiers and my food was good. I got a Pepsi slushy with bacardi. I had 2 of my friends with me who I dragged with me and didn't understand why I really wanted to go to THIS taco bell. We order our food and I bought a shirt. My friends got combos but we're not told that the fountain drinks machine was down: maybe 2 drinks worked out of 7-10 like the Mt dew and tea... so my friends waiting after being told that they were going to \"fix\" it. After the long wait my friend has had enough.  No name tags on either \"upper management\" team that she spoke to. Finally one of them told her what the real issue was and that no one really complains about it.  He avoided giving a refund and didn't offer a slushy for guest satisfaction.  I hate to say this comment because I've heard it many times but as management in the food and ever age business you give the guest what they want or the alternative to make their experience a little better. This guy finally caved and gave my friend $1 from his own wallet.  Look again coming from food and beverage I know that guy was upset and just wanted this guest out of his face but to not even offer the alternative like a slushy  (minus the alcohol)  and to assume we would just brush it off because it's Vegas ... no"}
{"text":"All my friends know I'm a huge fan of Taco Bell, so when I heard there's a Taco Bell in Vegas that serves alcohol, you KNOW I had to check it out!  I love how this Taco Bell cantina is located in the middle of the trip, which makes it relatively easily accessible on the strip. I was a bit surprised at how small of a space it was inside compared to the huge sign they had on the building, but the lines move quick and there's some additional seating outside so no complaints here.   Since I just came from a buffet, all I wanted was some slushie booze. A regular cup is ~$10 and a yard container was ~$15. Definitely get the yard container :)   I had the cherry and the margarita flavors and both were delicious. So glad I got to come here and would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas with the late night munchies :)"}
{"text":"Yo if you love Taco Bell as much as I do, then this is A MUST for every Vegas trip!  First of all, the cantina is way more hyped on the commercials than it actually is. The cantina is really just a small shop with limited patio seating. However, it makes up for it with the retail and *alcoholic* beverage options.  RETAIL If you so choose, you can purchase taco trunks, taco bikinis, Taco Bell beach towels, sweaters, hats, and more. The pricing is pretty steep, about $30+ depending on what you get. The shot glasses themselves are $10 each but come in a cute variety of colors. I didn't end up buying anything this time but who knows, maybe I just might later on.   FOOD You'll get your typical Taco Bell menu here. From what I remember, their dollar menu doesn't exist here but I could be wrong.   DRINKS This is where the fun begins. To start, their soda fountains are made to look like beer taps. How adorable! Next, they have a much wider range of alcoholic freezes to choose from. Their ever so popular Mountain Dew Baja blast comes as a non-alcoholic and alcoholic option: if you choose the adult version you can get it in a regular size ($10), a yard size ($15--worth it considering size), with your choice of 1800 tequila, Captain Morgan rum, and Skyy Vodka. Any additional shots will cost you $2.  Overall, I enjoyed coming here and do plan on coming back. I didn't get to see if they had a refill option for the yard cups and I know that very few places that sell similar drinks will likely refill it, but you can always try out for yourself."}
{"text":"For something between a tourist gimmick and my one true love, it was great!! Paying $10 for a normal sized spiked Baja blast is a once in a life time thing for me. I could barely taste the alcohol. I got my food surprisingly fast on a bumpin' Friday night and the workers all looked happy to be there.   I only wish they had more merch in stock. They were running low on some sizes and had 3 styles to choose from. They sell things that can't be found online!"}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday nice place food prices are same as regular Taco Bell . The service was fast and friendly they had a gentlemen passing the food out calling your name when your order came up. The Margarita slush they sell is 2.19 without alcohol and 5.99 with Don Julio Tequila. They had a nice selection of beers but I was on duty at work so I couldnt endulge . They had a nice outdoor seated area."}
{"text":"This place was horrible... we walked in and the girl taking our order was so rude... it also took forever to get our food. I know this isn't a 5 star restaurant but when I went to the bathroom upstairs I seen 2 cockroaches running around and after that it was GAME OVER!! Never again will I go back there."}
{"text":"I get it---it's frigging Taco Bell, so why bother to pay for parking and come to this over-exaggerated mexican stand rather than going somewhere else?   BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME.   I took my cousin here on a Friday night. He hadn't been to vegas in about 2 years and wanted to come check this place out. He was 16 at the time and he felt like an absolute \"cool boy\", by staying out late on the strip and walking into the Cantina while the music was blasting. Food is regular, but that's not really what you pay for when you come here. It's the atmosphere. PLUS, alcoholic taco bell slushies, man!  I think we stayed for a good 1.5 hours, and half of that was just finishing our slushies and listening to the DJ play. My cousin loved it and so did I."}
{"text":"A couple of days ago we went to the Taco Bell Cantina that just opened in Las Vegas! My friend is a huge Taco Bell fan and said there were only four locations in the country. So we walked over there one night to check it out! The place was more like a club than a fast food restaurant. Bumping music playing and dark lighting added to the atmosphere. They had the regular menu, but you could add alcohol to the freezes. Seating was located upstairs or on the front patio.  They even had an exhibition window so you can see your food being prepared.  Food was the same, cheap and filling! The employees were having a great time, singing and dancing to the current jam being played! I counted that as another free show, lol!"}
{"text":"If you're a Taco Bell enthusiast like myself, swing by the Taco Bell Cantina. This Strip hot spot has all of your usual favorites and best of all, they serve frozen adult beverages AND they have a gift shop with branded Taco Bell swag. You can now finally buy that Taco Bell bikini you always wanted! I love this place so much I would get married here (look it up - it's a real thing!) but my boyfriend wouldn't go for that. Ha!"}
{"text":"Such a cool Taco Bell! I have been trying to make this a stop on every Vegas trip since discovering it. It is so cool with the huge slushie machines and cheap food (something to be thankful for in Vegas). For a Taco Bell it is pretty fancy with the electronic screen that displays when someones order is ready and the soda fountain set up like a beer tap. Love this place! Also, they do weddings, so that is hilarious."}
{"text":"Most lit Taco Bell of my life. Good vibes after coming in after the club...until they mess up on your food order But they have such high volume (expected) but the staff couldn't handle it! My order came out so late! And it took them so long to figure out to \"reprint\" my receipt after i gave them my original receipt (which they lost). All these people got their food. My friends who came over to meet meAFTER I ordered, they ordered and got their food BEFORE I did!  The expo did a terrible job at calling out names and did a terrible job trying to reassure me my food was coming.. because it obviously wasnt! They didn't offer for a refund instead in the end they gave me more food which i didn't need or want. I ended up giving my food to a homeless guy.."}
{"text":"I guess I didn't know what to expect when I walked in the door.  I expected a Taco Bell Bar that serves drinks at the bar and food off a menu.  Instead what I got was a standard Taco Bell with some light beers and some frozen drinks.  We also went for breakfast.  They either ran out of breakfast or stopped serving midway through our group of 9 guys.  The one perk is that it serves breakfast in downtown Cleveland, and can sit more than 6 people.  The breakfast wasn't bad, but I don't think it's anywhere near the top of anybody's choices.    Maybe this is all my fault.  Or maybe I have a better idea of what a Taco Bell Cantina should be."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great idea, good location for a cool spot to grab a Taco & slushees with lots of options for mixers! Club vibe Taco Bell, music is loud and fun, service was awesome, really nice servers! Wish all Taco Bell's were like this!"}
{"text":"This place has changed the way I look at Taco Bells! They have lots of food options (more than my hometown Taco Bell) as well as an extensive variety of slushy and drink options (with or without alcohol). The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious as usual, but this location is definitely worth a stop. One of a kind experience!"}
{"text":"2.49 for a cheap water bottle. Was literally ready to fall on the pavement dying. Thank god I had payment or this place would have been a lawsuit.  Service lacking and could have been way better. Extremely low tier."}
{"text":"It is still a Taco Bell. But when you're leaving a bar nothing sounds better than some greasy fast food. Also had a nightcap consisting of an alcoholic frozen Baja Blast. Can't get much better than that for a college student Same Taco Bell prices as well, but like I said, it is still a Taco Bell the third star is largely in part to the alcoholic beverage I was able to order with my meal. All under $15!"}
{"text":"I want to LOVE this Taco Bell because it's so pretty, but everything else really falls flat.   Can you still get (VERY) affordable cheap Mexican food that actually tastes decent? Yes. Is it reliable that you'll get the food you ordered in 10 minutes or less? Hardly.   I've been twice now: once for dinner on a weeknight and once for breakfast on a weekend.   When I went for dinner, the cashier had trouble understanding what I wanted, even though I was trying to order off their vegan menu that's posted online. When my food finally came out (20+ minutes later), it was missing a burrito, so I told them, and they brought that out 10 minutes after that. They did give me free cinnamon twists for the trouble since it had gone so poorly.   Recently, I stopped for breakfast and again had trouble ordering items that were on the menu online. The order came out correct this time, but again took about 20 minutes. I don't go to Taco Bell very often, but it's much quicker than that at ALL other locations. I half wonder if the fact that they don't have a drive-thru actually slows them down. Like other reviews mention, it was also not busy when I was there.   The nice part? The restaurant is REALLY nice and clean, brand new. There are tons of TVs on the wall and it's in a very convenient location.   My fingers are crossed that they get their alcohol license approved! It's a bit disappointing that a progressive town like Madison wouldn't want a one-of-a-kind Taco Bell in it."}
{"text":"I love the blueberry slushie mix with alcohol, not that strong so I recommend adding more of your own. It is expensive for a drink of that stuff is $10, when you can get one from Fat Tuesday that is well worth the price.   Food wise, awesome as always because i love taco bell. This is our go to when we are in vegas!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because it was hyped up through Facebook and everyone in my group was screaming TACO CANTINA!!! The only thing that's different between this location and all the other locations are their options of alcohol as well as music. Of course, it's located in the middle of the strip that's why.  Their alcohol tasted more like a slurpee than an actual alcoholic beverage. I would still rather get the Fat Tuesdays. We ordered tacos, soft tacos, and the double chalupa. They tasted just like any other location. The lines were long so I didn't find it worth It to wait in line."}
{"text":"Food is great, atmosphere is chill, they even have alcoholic baja blasts!! The lady who was serving us didnt seem to friendly but other than that, everything was amazing! Really wish we had a few of these in california!"}
{"text":"All I can say is-- YAAAASSSSS! I love Taco Bell. I love late night food. This place hits the spot when you're getting out of the club or even if you just walked down the strip and got a little hungry. They have alcoholic daiquiris on tap and a fairly large menu. Service is super quick so pay attention to the TV when your order gets done! Not too much space to sit downstairs but take a peek upstairs for available seating. Tables are cleaned up pretty quickly so shoutout to the staff for the good service/maintenance. I really don't even know if it was because I was starving after the club or if this place was just that amazing but...check it out! Nothing like some good Taco Bell to spice up the night."}
{"text":"Of course the most \"lit\" taco bell place has to be in Vegas.  Boyfriend and I bookmarked this place way before we both got to Vegas due to all the hype and the social media publicity it was getting. It's located behind Planet Hollywood Hotel and is situated near McDonald's as well.  After walking through the outside seating, the automatic door opens and 2016 hip hop music was blasting. There were some fixtures of merchandise and a security guard was closely standing by supervising the area.   I'm not going to lie when I say it looked a lot smaller than what it seemed to be however the taco bell ordering counter looks super cool with the lights and the different lighted liquid tubes. Boyfriend treated us to a pina colada with tequila along with a beefy fritos burrito for me and a taco for himself. Food was done not too long after because it's fast food. They had indoor seating on the second floor, but it was packed so we headed to the outdoor seating instead. The food is the same basic taco bell stuff, but the drink won for me. It was super good and satisfying for my midnight munchies.   They had a lot of flavors so I will definitely be back! Great place for cheap cravings."}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars just off the strength that this taco bell is unique. Nothing really special about the food but the atmosphere was amazing. Dine inside or outside while listening to music and sipping on an alcoholic slushy which was more like a spiked Slurpee, they also sell beer. What is there not to love about that?  People even get married in this taco bell lol Yes married with a taco bell food package that comes with it which is hilarious to me but hey its VEGAS. The customer service was great. The only thing I would say is add more alcohol to the slushy, it seemed more watery than anything then I will give 5 stars."}
{"text":"So I'd heard about a zany Taco Bell where they sold alcohol. Not 100% sure what to expect, while killing alot of time before a show, I found my way over there and decided to check it out. It's over by the Paris Casino, I took some photos of the Eiffel tower next to that big blue balloon while walking here.       Once you're in the area, it's not hard to find. Listen to the ridiculously loud thumping club music. There are a couple of 'fancy' restaurants over here. There's a Bubba Gumps nearby, and Gordon Ramsey also has a place nearby. There are also some fast food places here, there's a Mcdonalds, a Subway, a Krispy Kreme...and this place.     It's actually a pretty small space. Pretty much your standard Taco Bell sized place. But it surely throws a big aura. Loud thumping club music blares from their patio area. There's a great big swirling machine with flashing lights behind the cash registers and employees.       The menu is pretty standard, except you can get alcohol here. The big swirling lighted machines behind the registers are dispensing alcoholic slushies. Much like the kind you get at other places on the strip. After looking up and the menu board, I settled upon a quesadilla and a beer. Girl behind the counter was nice and friendly as she took my order.       She popped an empty cup on the counter and beer swirled up into it. From the Bottom. The cups are bottom fed. That's nutty. I think that wowed me more than the whole place. But ya. Alcohol. Taco Bell. Music. That's pretty much it. But it's really neat. You should go check it out if you're looking for the weird and wacky in Las Vegas.      There's an upper floor, but it was cordoned off on my visit because people were getting married up there. Ya. People get married at a Taco Bell. In Las Vegas. Man. With each discovery like this I kinda like this city more and more."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell....unless you're in Las Vegas. And then, well, it's still Taco Bell. You're still gonna get your staple cheesy gordita crunch and chalupas and all that jazz. But one thing that sets this Taco Bell apart from others (besides the name) are the drinks.   Yeah, you don't need a PHD in Taco-ology to figure out what I'm talking about here. You want a frozen drink? Sure. You want it with a little extra kick? Well now you're talkin'!   The females of my family heard about this not-so-ordinary T-Bell before our Vegas trip and after flying in late to Sin City, we made this our first stop for food. But again, it was more for the drinks.   I mean a frozen Baja Blast is good on its own, but when you add rum to the thing? Woah. And you could get it with said liquor or choose vodka, whiskey, or even tequila. Nice. Very nice. Beyond that it's basically nothing special (service was friendly though) outside of a pretty well-themed, contemporary-style Taco Bell complete with taco hats for purchase, of course....  Overall, Taco Bell Cantina is worthy of a stop, especially if you ever find yourself at your neighborhood T-Bell at 2:30 in the mornin' after a night of drinkin'. Instead, come here and get those drinks along with your \"fourth meal.\" Enjoy, mis amigos."}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes to get my food at a fast food restaurant that was a quarter full. I've gotten faster food at high-end farm to table restaurants."}
{"text":"The food is always prepared very fast and I've never had any issues there! The store is very large and is in a perfect location in the downtown area. For how busy it can get in there, the lines tend to move very fast and they seem to really know what they are doing. The staff is not always the friendliest which would be my only drawback to this location."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a party of 3 we wanted to check it out. We each ordered their $15 smoothie with alcohol. After going to their upstairs which is a cool environment with TVs we tried their mixer smoothie things. After completing them there wasn't nearly a lick of alcohol in them. As a local I would avoid having an incredibly overpriced drink here and would take my money to fat tuesdays.. they actually put alcohol in their drinks.."}
{"text":"Taco Bell late night! No difference in food! Best thing is the have drinks too! Genius to put on the strip for sure!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell served with frozen drinks while sitting on a patio with great music. Can't get any better than this!!!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell Cantina...it's literally that. The food is solid, like Taco Bell a few blocks from a nice residential area status. Service is Taco Bell in a small rural town status. Alcohol is small concert venue priced.   There's not much more to it. Pictures make it seem like it's bigger than it is, but even though it is 2 floors, combined they add up to be the size of your normal t-bell.   Beers available are going to be your average selection that you'd find at strip bars. Those Baja Blast daiquiri drinks are worth having, get the extra shot.   Taco Bell Cantina is cool, I expected a tiny bit more because of how mainstream this location is, but I was not necessarily disappointed. I wouldn't do it again, but you've got to do it at least once."}
{"text":"What a ridiculous service! I know it's 3am but if you are gonna work there no matter what, have a smile in your face and a good attitude. To start with the cashier (no name tag) that took my order rolled her at me when I was placing my order. Though that was very rude! Then the cooks yawning as they prepping my food and then smiling at me because I saw her yawning! Took about 30 minutes to get my food and it was only 4 items. Only 3 people in from of me. Works service ever."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Highly recommend the Baja Blast which is the most popular flavor. It's a cool twist on a traditional Taco Bell and the location is pretty good. Not to mention that all the margs have a variety of flavors and it's the only Taco Bell to serve alcohol.  Interesting fact - if you sit upstairs there is a camera that shows you on the big screen. ALSO, you can get married here if you've really got a thing for drunk Mexican food"}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of a fan of Taco Bell and I'm glad this place wasn't that far from my hote on the strip. It changes what I knew of Taco places by almost looking like a dance club. The drinks are poured like they come from beer taps, there's a second floor and you can even order from up there while you casually sit on the comfortable couches."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night before going out for a quick bite to eat, and to obviously say I was at THE Taco Bell cantina. It's nice on the outside-has outdoor seating for the warmer temps or for those who just want to be outside. When you walk in, you are immediately immersed in THE loudest music you will ever hear. Being in a club was quieter than that music. I had to yell at the cashier so they could hear my order. There were some merchandise racks that you could buy Taco Bell shirts, etc. A cool option at this place is alcoholic freezes, which are moderately expensive but not bad for Vegas price. The food itself is relatively cheap-I got two quesadillas and a medium drink for $11...and it was super good. There's an upstairs area with different seating arrangements and a live DJ. Overall it was definitely worth going to, but the only complaint is that the music was too loud!"}
{"text":"The coolest Taco Bell ever! Located in front of the cosmopolitan, near many night clubs and fun attractions!   Items ordered: 2 Doritos locos tacos, and a jack and coke slurpee!   This Taco Bell is hip and just so cool! It's has an outdoor patio with great views! The atmosphere is different than any other Taco Bell. Since it's considered a Catina they have alcoholic beverages available. They even carry some fun Taco Bell clothing items!   Overall, fun experience. The slurpee with alcohol was $20! Worth it in vegas!"}
{"text":"Who could pass up a chance at eating at a tavo bell that serves alcohol and offers weddings! The prices are great! They are just a few cents more than what I normally pay which is great when your spending elsewhere. And did I mention the ALCOHOL! We got a pina colada with rum! This was actually the best pinacolada I have ever had too! There are other flavors of slushies and alcohols you can choose from as well! Wanting to get hitched? Well theres and upstairs to this Cantina where the mood is set and after you tie the knot you can stuff your face with tacos. I mean sounds like a dream wedding right?!"}
{"text":"This is nice Taco Bell place, they sell alcohol, BUT the major pain and thing that needs to change is the music, I don't mind a DJ and all but do they have to blast the music so loud that you cant even have a conversation with someone sitting right next to you. I would suggestion maybe having music but don't blast it so loud, I cant imagine the employees who work there they must have ear plugs. Maybe they need to rethink this. Probably wont but still. The food is always good and the drinks are great too!"}
{"text":"40 minutes waiting for a burrito while watching drunk tourists stroll by and enduring an aural assault on my ears comprised of the worst possible pop music at the highest volumes. Some tourists occasionally wandered into the place to get food and got theirs before me - even though I ordered a standard burrito. Burrito was (when I eventually got it) regular old Taco Bell - tortilla somewhat dry and old. Don't bother. Get taken in by some other crappy tourist trap on the strip..."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell with booze. It's a fun gimmick. My issue with this place was the lack of professionalism. My cashier got my order wrong, which wasn't a big problem because I love Taco Bell and it was a slight error. What really put me off was the staff hanging out on the side with their manager (that's how it appeared) messing around. Just standing there I could tell that they've probably never worked in a high volume kitchen situation. Example, the girl doing the drink orders didn't get her ticket for my drink because the cashier had no idea she was supposed to print it and hand it off to her.   I know you guys are new, but you are also on the strip. I will be back because I have faith ya'll will get it together."}
{"text":"The overhype factor is definitely real.  This place is tiny and the food menu is nothing spectacular.  Food looks the same too, no special treatment here.  I do enjoy their frozen slush drinks though,  I got my hands on a free lemon slush which was a great treat but wish I could have tried the baja blast.  Unfortunately since there's hardly any space it gets crowded fast (with merchandise taking up the full middle of the storefront).  Overall fun novelty place, but I feel it had a lot more potential to be greater."}
{"text":"Great food, but way too loud music and not good cleaning. It's obviously very busy as it's on the Strip."}
{"text":"Um.... What else do you need! Beer, alcoholic slushes, DJ jamming some tunes, and TACO BELL! This 2 story taco bell beauty is a must for any drunk person at 3am wandering around Vegas! I stopped by and there really isn't much too say! This place is something you just have to see and experience! Nothing brings out the true beauty of a taco bell like the lights of Vegas on a dumb drunken night! This place was slammed, but all the employees were so nice and super fast.... Get yo grub on!"}
{"text":"When I first heard about some kind of \"Taco Bell World,\" I was immediately stoked and knew I had to go visit the next time I was in Vegas. I walked across the strip and found Taco Bell Cantina around Planet Hollywood, located right next to McDonald's, ironically. However, despite the hype it is just Taco Bell at the end of the day - with the addition of alcoholic beverages.   You can expect it to be extremely crowded, although I can assume this will somewhat die down when the initial excitement wears off. There is seating upstairs and downstairs and after you wait in one of the lines that stretch across downstairs, orders are called out from the counter. For how busy it is, the orders don't take too long - but they did run out of every hot sauce except mild. The staff are all friendly and helpful, especially for dealing with all of the drunk people and such a consistent amount of orders. Nothing bad about it other than how busy it is - it just isn't as touristy as you would expect it to be. Convenient if you have some Taco Bell munchies and want an alcoholic slushy!"}
{"text":"To you it may not be anything special, but to me this place has a hold of my heart. Taco Bell, although not good for you, is actually delicious to my little belly. I grew up on Taco Bell. I remember walking to the nearest one near school and getting tacos and burritos galore. Ever since I heard this one was opening at the planet hollywood and WITH alcohol I really wanted to check it out! Finally, cinco de mayo gave me an opportunity to try out what I've been missing. Because it was a special occasion, there was a DJ blasting music, GOOD music, making you wanna dance, and it lured us in. The girls were walking around selling tequila shots! It felt like a mini club! But with hella cheap food. The price is the same on the menu as it would be off the strip and that's what I love so much. They have all the different slushee drink flavors that you can choose from and have it with or without alcohol. We ordered two shots, a margarita slushee, a taco supreme, and a taco burrito. They have patio, inside, and upstairs seating. We went upstairs only to find the DJ and more condiments. It was an awesome experience, the place was clean, the people were full of energy, and it was just a lot of fun. Our food was ready, we took our shots, devoured our food, and I didn't want it to end. I never thought I would ever give a Taco Bell 5 stars, but for that night and experience, they deserved them all. Thank you for giving my boyfriend and I an amazing experience that we will always remember!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell Cantina is ALWAYS open and the perfect hangover cure for a crazy night in Vegas.  You'll find the same menu as any other Taco Bell, but they serve alcohol and blast dance music throughout.  They also sell kitchy apparel like taco hats.  The interior was clubby but still clean.  The staff are really friendly and obviously know how to deal with drunk people."}
{"text":"A Taco Bell that serves booze. 2 levels with a DJ. Fast and fun. Giving 5 stars because even though it was super packed and the guests were wasted, the staff was super pleasant and actually looked like they were having a good time."}
{"text":"This is an amazing adaptation for Taco Bell's everywhere! I loved the fact that they serve alcohol here! It's perfect for the strip and Las Vegas in general! My friends and I came here during the CES 2017 event and even met up with friends unexpectedly! This place was popular from the get-go! They have all the great flavors of Taco Bell's around the country plus more! I wish there were more Cantina's in more places! I'll definitely go back when I'm in LV again."}
{"text":"I was tired and my feet hurt last night, but when I walked into Taco Bell Cantina the vibe was amazing and gave me energy. DJ Tony Sinatra was the best DJ I have ever heard. Taco Bell Cantina was lit because of him. I'd come back to Taco Bell Cantina just to listen to him play. As always the food at Taco Bell was awesome. The drinks were AMAZIIIIING! The Lemonade Baja Blast with Tequila was delicious. It was a great combination. If you don't like Taco Bell, I urge you to try Taco Bell Cantina, if not for the food then for DJ Tony Sinatra. He was there when I went on Saturday night. Overall, it was a great first experience."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed, it's just a Taco Bell where they can add some vodka to their sickenly sweet drinks, and pay double for the food. If you're a Taco Bell fan I would recommend going at least once so you can say you've been, and get the experience, because it is a really neat layout, but I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"What's a Fat Tuesday ?   Tried this spot our last Vegas trip it's amazing!!! Wish they served belvedere or any top shelf vodka but the drinks are flavorful and delicious ! And after two or three I was leaning lol"}
