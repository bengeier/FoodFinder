{"text":"If you don't sit at the bar and choose to get a table, service can be pretty slow. Also, they have only ONE vegetarian option and it's an appetiser. Nice place to grab a beer If you have a lot of time to kill and don't mind the unfriendly service."}
{"text":"It's like an actual restaurant. In an airport--OMG!  Yeah, yeah, the staff aren't super enthusiastic about working here, but the food is good and the beers are cold. I've had everything from the Irish Boxty to the Club sandwich to breakfast, and I've never disliked anything. The prices are reasonable, and if you're waiting out a long layover, make your way to O'Brien's."}
{"text":"Arriving to the airport early on a Sunday morning after a crazy wedding the night before- requires a 10am breakfast for Kings. I have never in my life felt the urge to order the same breakfast twice. Maybe it was the waitresses in Steelers jerseys (Go Steelers!!) Or it could have been the hangover............ but the breakfast tasted like it was home-cooked just for me! Eggs over medium cooked perfectly, crispy hasbrowns, bacon (for added $$), warm buttered toast... excuse me as I wipe the drool off my keyboard. They kept refilling our coffee and we were able to relax until a few minutes before our flight. This will ALWAYS be the place I grab breakfast when flying out of PIT."}
{"text":"This little eatery would be a great addition to any airport! The pierogies are tasty bites and the horseradish sauce is a nice addition. Plenty of seating available, lots of tv to catch a game, and staff that is quick and friendly."}
