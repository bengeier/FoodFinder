{"text":"I went here for dinner with my fiance on Wednesday Nov 16. They advertise the place as a Nagoya style pasta restaurant (which I was totally excited about at first), but its not what they said at all. So most of the photos below are outdated since it appears the restaurant must have had a change of business plan since they opened? I should have been suspicious when we walked in and there was only one other table seated....  My two main problems with this place are: 1. there is actually NO pasta on the menu. It is a sukiyaki and udon joint and 2. I got food poisoning from whatever I had there and threw up everything I had that evening.   I had the chicken egg + udon \"8 bowl\" (Oyakodon). The udon broth was way too salty and had a funny twang to it - my bet is that it was loaded with preservatives and came from a bottle concentrate. And my guess is that the chicken or eggs were bad because I started feeling queasy almost as soon as we left the restaurant. The worst part is when my fiance went back to confront the manager and ask him what could have been wrong, he basically threw us out yelling that they have their certifications. No concern about our health, well being, or customer experience. He didn't even encourage us to try another dish, or come back to prove that their food was safe. A red flag that this person has zero pride in his food, service, or reputation.   My recommendation is: for your health's sake, avoid this place. There are so many better udon and japanese food restaurants on the exact same street just steps away (Don Don Izakaya, Sansotei Ramen, Kenzo...) that you can go get better food for a better experience."}
{"text":"I really liked the concept of a double bowl with half donburi half udon, so I tried Oyakodon+Udon. They were just okay - Oyakodon was too soggy and had little egg in it. I also tried the fried chicken side dish. It was not crispy and kept drilling oil. Seasoning was on the bland side. Corn salad was the worst of all. Corn tasted undercooked and the sauce was watery."}
{"text":"This is high school cafeteria standard...the bad ones..and at a price that doesn't make sense at all."}
{"text":"Tried their ebi tempura beef udon and it was pretty good. A bit too heavy on the tempura bits. Good amount of udon and beef in the bowl. The ebi tempura was so-so. Onsen egg was smooth and silky."}
{"text":"Imagine spaghetti that you tried to make with limited ingredients in your dorm room, way back when (or, perhaps for some, more recently.) Then reduce that by two, and you get Ken Oh.  My boyfriend and I were super excited to try this place because it had a cool logo and boasted of \"Japanese spaghetti,\" which we had been anticipating for months. We had read about some low ratings on YELP, but were giving it a try anyway, expecting that worst come to worst, it would be like Shiso Tree Café uptown. I ordered the okonomiyaki special on a sizzling plate and my boyfriend ordered the Hamberg.  No. The reviews are right - Ken Oh is so far from Japanese spaghetti. Hell, it's not even spaghetti. It's like someone took the watery leftover contents of a ketchup packet and poured it over half baked noodles and slapped a microwavable burger patty on it. I can't even begin to describe how unappetizing it was (in fact, it was so bad that my boyfriend and I still get goosebumps thinking about it.) Even when food is just so-so.we still try to finish everything on our plate, and this was the first place where neither of us could do it. It was just sickeningly bad. Don't be fooled by the \"house make ketchup sauce\" description - this place is crazy pricey and You can make something much better yourself at home (or from a Michelina's microwavable meal. I wish I was kidding.)  Save yourself the trouble and opt out of this place. Its decent customer service really doesn't make up for downright inedible food."}
{"text":"Excellent omelette curry. Flavourful, generous portions, fast service. Japanese classic done well, though overpriced in my opinion for a fairly simple dish. Would definitely come back though!"}
{"text":"half noodle and half rice is a great idea, but their food is not good.  I order the chicken nanban don, chicken was very oily and taste bland. the oil was dripping down while I try to eat the chicken.  on the other hand, the soup taste very salty. it's not flavoured, only taste like soy sauce.   their idea about 8 shape bowls is good, but nothing special about their food.  I don't think I'm gonna go back, for noodle I'll go sansotei, for beef I'll choose gyugyuya."}
{"text":"The sauce was too watery that every time someone tried to slurp their spaghetti, droplets would spew across the table into someone else's plate. It was also more sour than I would've liked.  The spaghetti was so slippery and hard to pick up. It would've been nice if we were given high fiction chopsticks, because I struggled hard with the metal fork.   We got the Gold Belt to share and it was quite worth it for $20. The meatball and fried chicken were very well done. However, there were pork cutlets, but no knife to cut them with.   The place is also extremely small and doesn't take reservation."}
{"text":"Visited opening week last year.  Found out about its opening via blogTO and counted down the days before it opened its doors on Dundas Street.  It did not disappoint!  Split a KEN OH Gold Belt Plate between my friend and I, consisting of hamburg steak, fried chicken, fried pork, salad, and fried egg on rice.  The portion was huge and had both rice and spaghetti, so we could switch up the carb flavours.  I'm a sucker for Hong Kong style baked spaghetti and this was a great (and better) alternative (imo!).  Haven't tried the other menu items, but this place is definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"This place is so good that it really worths 8 minutes waiting time. I am sure i can eat all the ramen with no any soup left.  The chicken above the noodle is also the best in Toronto DT!  Recommendation for couple to take a break or have a lunch or dinner when you is tired for DT walking.  BTW, the Japanese waitress is so cute!!!! :) although my wife don't like her."}
{"text":"Ken Oh specializes in Japanese Nagoya-style spaghetti.  What that basically means is that it's regular spaghetti with ankake (starch-thickened sauce) with your choice of meat. We chose \"Hamburg\" - essentially a hamburger patty, and the chicken cutlet spaghetti. The sauce has the consistency of a thick gravy with a bit of spice. Both meals were good and met expectations; it's spaghetti in a gravy - not too hard to mess up. The meat was tasty, well-seasoned, but the portion was noticeably smaller than the pictures in the menu. For $15 (with tax and tip) you're paying a bit much for pasta imo. Make the price more competitive, add some sides or a bigger patty, then it'd make more sense to me. It's worth a visit but I wouldn't wait in line or hype the place up."}
{"text":"Save your money, taste buds and stomach space!  I have eaten here twice - once with the old menu and then when they came out with their new menu. The food is not any much better. Not only was the oponomiyaki (fried udon) unappetizing but I found a hair in it.  The udon soup was tasteless. The omelet curry was a rip off - merely fried egg over white rice with their curry sauce for $14. The only dishes worth eating were the fried chicken and teppan butashogayaki (sliced pork skillet) but it still wasn't good enough to take the bad taste out of mouth from this place.  No more chances, this place is vetoed."}
{"text":"Fancy infinity plates for their $12 series menu. Got the chicken nanban. While it tasted good (love the sauce), it wasn't worth the wait + price. If you're health conscious, the other reviewers were all right, their food are very oily.   Decoration was very manga-y, you'll love what I'm talking about when you enter. Different from other Japanese places in Toronto for sure. Not a bad thing tho, everyone got their own style.  If you decide to come back, make sure to get their pamphlet that comes with 10% off coupon. Gotta save up for college funds yo."}
{"text":"Ken Oh! right away reminds me of Street Fighter upon entering.  Ken Oh mainly specializes in Udon and other Japanese dishes. The menu is pretty basic and tand also a special udon menu as well. My party ordered one of the 8-shape bowls with pork, beef udon and the chicken teppan set.   The food arrived quickly. The udon was just alright as there is nothing special in terms of taste and texture as it was just average. The meat of all the dishes were okay as well. Again, I would say the taste and texture is ok too. The chicken teppan set came on a hot plate but there was really nothing special or great about it either. It felt like they were going for more of a presentation look of the teppan.   Clearly, the food definitely needs improvement overall but if you want a Japanese dishes such as curry, udon, or omurice, you should definitely visit for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I had the omurice and it was actually not bad! Finally found a dish that I like here. The other dishes I've tried and disliked were the sukiyaki, 8bowl dishes and curry udon"}
{"text":"Tasty Japanese Nagoya spaghetti at affordable prices with generous portions. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Worst ever!!! Got sick after eating here. Went back to tell them and they didn't apologize, take any accountability, or feel even pretend to feel bad for what happened. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I was just visiting a friend who work close by the area.  Since he said this place is new, I thought giving this place a try would be a good idea.  The decor is a clean modern Japanese style like any other noodle place, not too fancy.  The server was really nice.  I ordered beef dish with rice and udon, and my friend ordered the plate with chicken,  a sunny side up egg and some vegetables with steamed rice and noodles.  I think there are too much carbohydrates in the dishes.  I could barely finish it since I was not too hungry to begin with.  My friend was only able to eat half the order only.  I think if they reconfigure the dish with the correct balance of carbs, protein and vegetables would make it taste much betrer.  I do like the thinly sliced beef with this sweet and salty sauce.  Not too bad overall."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night with two of my friends and the only reason why we came in was because Gyugyuya next door was closed and we (I) were hungry.  I ordered the Age Chicken Don in their fancy 8 bowls. I didn't realize it at the time, but this dish serves half chicken on rice and half udon noodle soup. I actually really like the concept of the dish. Sometimes I want to eat rice and noods at the same time and I usually have a hard time choosing. This is the first restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life that serves both noods and rice on the same plate.   I really liked the udon part of this dish, it tasted really good, but the age chicken don was sort of underwhelming. Unfortunately, the entire dish fell flat because the portion was really small for the price I was paying, 12 bucks? If the price decreased or the portion size increased, I think I would have enjoyed Ken Oh a lot more. My BF ordered the Age Taki Beef Udon and it was 2 dollars more than the Beef Udon. The only difference between the Age Taki Beef Udon and the Beef Udon was two pieces of chicken, the same chicken as my dish.   Ken Oh charged 2 dollars for 2 pieces of \"just plain ass chicken.\" At least my chicken had mayo on top, but the breading of the chicken really lacked seasoning apparently.   The three of us ended up finishing our meals within 30 minutes, and this included ordering, waiting for our food to come, and paying.   Unfortunately, I don't think I will be coming back here. But, if you're hungry for some noods and rice on the same dish, I would recommend coming here and grabbing a quick bite.   TLDR; If you can't decide between noodles and rice, come here! Udon noodle soup was tasty, but the portions are just way too small, expensive, and just underwhelming."}
{"text":"This place has ok customer service but the spaghetti was really disappointing. My friends and I all thought we could have made these at home. The sauce was nothing special. I am also biased though because I don't like spaghetti to begin with."}
{"text":"When I pass by this place and saw Ken Oh, I wondered if it had anything with Hokuto No Ken. Lol indeed it does.  Pretty tasty food but a little expensive. But at least it was very filling, as opposed to places where the food is expensive and you leave still hungry.   I ordered the gold belt. The fried chicken, pork, and Hamburg came nice and hot. I very much liked the sauce too.  Overall: 7/10 (not an average). Quality: 8/10. Service: 7/10. Value: 7/10."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for lunch and liked it so much that I had to come again. I ordered the Oyakodon (chicken and egg) and it was fantastic. Can't wait to have it again."}
{"text":"Ummmmm... it's a plate of spaghetti from a box and watery soupy sauce?  I really really really wanted to love this, but... I don't think it's my cup of tea.  I'd come back to try something else in the future just to try something else.. just not sure if it'll be any time too soon.  The service was good, and everything else was fine for what it was."}
{"text":"We ordered right away and it did take some time for the food to be served.    The bowl of Buta Don arrived first.  It was served in what the restaurant called an \"8-shape bowl\" which is really just a split bowl that's handy for containing two items.  It had thinly sliced pork cooked with homemade sauce and onions, topped with ginger, and served with udon soup with shredded seaweed and tenkasu.  I tried a slice of the pork meat and was indeed impressed with how flavourful the pork was.  I ordered the Chef's Recommended dish which was the Beef Sukiyaki Nabe.  It had thinly sliced beef, tofu, enoki mushroom, vegetables and udon cooked in nabe with homemade sukiyaki sauce.  It was also served with a bowl of rice and spring egg.  The Sukiyaki was served in a heated pot, so be careful when you first take a sip because it is super hot!  The beef were thinly sliced and as flavourful as the pork slices.  However, there wasn't a lot of it.  I didn't like how small quantity of the beef there were.  The soup was very, very sweet and intense.  The spring egg was delicious; so smooth and raw for you to place into the hot soup or to eat raw.  We had also ordered the Fried Chicken appetizer to share (hard for me to resist fried chicken..).  This had three pieces; a large piece and two smaller pieces so it was a bit more difficult to share evenly.  I wasn't a big fan of this fried chicken however.  I thought it wasn't fried crispy enough and tasted kind of bland.  I'm glad the meat inside was tender though.  By mid-meal, there were so many customers dining here that a small line had started to form outside!  I'm glad that I finally try this restaurant out.  They have Japanese characters on the walls which fits in with the \"Ken\" theme."}
{"text":"Update : Decided to try the place a second time they did improve since last time i feel the portion more generous than last time and just as tasty :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Udon and they make it right! Really close to the udon in Japan. For sure the udon in Japan is a lot better but we are in Toronto and nothing lose. Make try!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the curry udon.. it tasted alright but it was pretty disappointing for a foodie that's had a lot of curry udons in her life. If you are familiar with Japanese curries I would say skip this place. My coworkers also thought it was only mediocre. The curry was very watery and thickened without much depth in the flavour. It was okay for lunch but unfortunately I won't be back. Maybe some of their other dishes are better though!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, once when they first opened and again just a week ago. Portions are huge but there are only a few options to realistically choose from in their new menu (there used to be more choices, but now it is basically just udon, cutlet, and omelette rice). Service, food quality, and the atmosphere is alright for downtown standards. If you are looking for something japanese and filling and you don't mind eating the same dishes, check this place out."}
{"text":"I went there on Saturday night. The price and taste both good. Recommend Shogayaki Don."}
{"text":"DO NOT go here. I ordered omelette curry dish, and could not believe that the rice inside was just plain white rice.  The whole point of omurice is having fried rice under the egg. The price of  $13.89 is definitely not fair for the sad dish which I was served. Not worth the visit."}
{"text":"I feel this place is heavily underrated - great udon noodle for a great price. Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Quite a tasty meal on a cold day! Service was quick, however it does feel like they're trying to get you in and out. Which is understandable because of how busy they are... but it was a tad offputting."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot for their 8-bowl noodle and rice bowls--half rice bowl and half udon. Both sides were delicious but the portion was quite small in my opinion. Their beef udon is delicious and has a generous portion.   I came here again yesterday and ordered the beef nabe (Hotpot). There was udon and rice and an extra egg on the side. The broth was SUPER sweet and salty and so were the udon, the veggies, and the beef.   When I got the bill, I was informed that they added a 12% tip to it already. I was quite confused since I went alone and there was no sign or note that said tips would be added automatically. The service was great (I was the only one at the store) so I was going to tip them 15%, but adding tips to the bill was quite odd to me.   tl;dr good rice and udon, Hotpot broth too sweet and salty, they will add a 12% tip to your bill by default."}
{"text":"What is an 8 shaped bowl? Best of both worlds. Its 2 bowls that share a wall.   Options here are fitting for those cravings when you are  utterly indecisive.    Meat atop rice in one bowl + udon soup in another.   There's sukiyaki and teppanyaki style options as well.   Had the tofu option. Decent 3/5 The udon noodle and soup is yummy 4/5  Service is friendly and window seat affords a view of the silly lineup outside and other general Dundas street happenings."}
{"text":"Large portions and an amazing deal considering their low prices. Staff are friendly but service is on the simple end. It's a quick sit-down place, so don't really expect to linger during or after your lunch/dinner meal. Their curry is lackluster and bland, not at all like how Japanese curry should be done. As well, food is quite salty and will leave you very thirsty afterwards. My favourite though is their 8-dishes, where you get a choice of a noodle and rice, so you end up with bowls that look like an 8, and you get to try 2 dishes for a single meal."}
{"text":"They recently changed their menus, so there is no more nayoga pastas, but tons of flavourful curries and noodle soups.  I went for an early dinner with my boyfriend and sister because we wanted to try a different place on Dundas West (ie. not Sansotei or the curry place beside it).  The portion sizes for their curries are decent. I had the omelette curry, which is your classic Japanese curry with an omelette wrapping a pile of white rice. The omelette was perfectly seasoned  and fried thinly without being burnt. There was a bit too much sauce compared to the amount of rice. Also, the curry was slightly salty (it could have been because there was not enough rice).  I'm not sure if I will return again, but this is a good joint for a quick bite. The service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I see that a lot of these reviews are 2-3 stars and that people have complained about their previous \"spaghetti heavy\" menu and are more impressed with their udon/beef/pork bowl combos. I haven't dined here in the era of spaghetti-hood but I really enjoyed their new menu! I had the the beef bowl with side udon soup and my husband had the fried chicken with tartar sauce hot plate. Both were really yummy!!!!! I see that some people complained that the udon was too plain but I thought it was a nice light side dish for the beef and rice heavy bowl. I also hate chicken with a passion but their fried chicken was really delicious; it was very moist and tender. Portion sizes were great and the price isn't too bad considering a) the location b) the fact that my regular place Manpuku closes at 8 and this is a good second best.   Great efficient service and cool \"Fist of the North Star\" anime theme with my boy Ken Oh (Raioh). Will definitely be back! Super place for a quick lunch if you work at one of the hospitals near by."}
{"text":"Good authentic sukiyaki and udon noodle and nice service. It reminds me of home. The restaurant is quiet small so need to go there at right time."}
{"text":"Great improvement! The first time I visited was a disaster. I heard they changed their menu so I went last week, and glad to say I will definitely go back again. It's relieving that they got rid of the pasta thingie. They did not taste good at all. The pasta noodles was saggy and tomato sauce was super salty. The menu is replaced with 8-shape bowls that basically are the best of  both worlds - you get to try one noodle dish and one rice dish at the same time! I tried beef yakki and udon combination. Both dishes were right portions and they were pretty authentic. The other choices look very appealing too. Ken ho has put a lot effort on improving their menu. It's worth the effort"}
{"text":"Objectively terrible. Food was drenched in black pepper (caused stomach problems for our entire group) + croquettes/veggies were soggy on a Saturday night (7:30pm) so it wasn't the last dregs of supplies! Food doesn't look much like the menu options! Service was alright but can't balance out the terrible food :( also quite overpriced for such low quality!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday dinner with my family. I was really impressed with the service and friendly staff! They gave me a drink for free for my birthday! And the food was ready in about 10 minutes which was really fast!   I ordered a combo with ramen and don. I will definitely recommend it to everyone who wants to taste everything a little bit. The price is very reasonable for the food and services they offered!  MUST TRY IT!"}
{"text":"So I am going to start off by saying I enjoy their noodles - I enjoy the double butt or boob or \"eight\" bowl they serve in and the anime murals on the wall. I would say the presentation isn't anything special and the price isn't unreasonable for downtown Toronto; I have been here several times to enjoy many of their dishes, particularly the hot spring eggs. The portions are good , food is well flavoured and it's not overly decorative which, for me, has the nostalgic value of having these dishes on the streets of Korea. Their service has never been spectacular; while they are quick to deliver the bill, they don't necessarily come to offer you any sort of refill or if you want anything after they deliver food. If you are crunched for time, this is not the place to go because service is not a thing here. SO why the low rating? Because at some point they started adding service charges in the bill itself; for the FANTASTIC service you receive here. You can't even make eye contact(because there is nobody to make eye contact with) to get a refill on a tiny glass of water. I realize this is a trend in the neighbourhood but at least provide some minimal service. Tips/gratuity comes from word GRATIS which means free, and as we know nothing in the world is FREE. I have no problem giving tips as I know how hard it is to work in  hospitality and depended on tips; but, as a result I smiled a little more and checked on the guest one extra time.  To sit at a cramped table that barely fits the bowls and lackluster \"service\" they provide I find it offensive to pay anything more than the food price (which is overpriced to start with). This alone made me frequent less to this spot as a result. BUT hey that's just me being a cheap foodie."}
{"text":"One of the best udon soups I've had.  We shared the curry udon with beef.  It was delicious.  It took slightly longer to cook but the flavor and the texture of the noodles were so perfect that we didn't mind the wait.  5*. Must try."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night after walking down Yonge St trying to decide where to eat for a large group. We were seated right away. The staff is Japanese. I ordered the Chef's recommendation: beef sukiyaki nabe $13.89.  It comes with a bowl of rice & semi-cooked egg.  The dish consists of thick udon noodles, beef, napa cabbage, & tofu.  Didn't see any enoki mushrooms in it.  The taste was quite sweet.  The portions were a generous size.  It's strange it came with both noodles & rice.  Maybe it's like that.  I was really full at the end."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't try this place earlier!   At first glance from the outside, this place didn't look appealing to me at all. Which is probably why I haven't tried it until now and if you're thinking the same thing then believe me this place is worth !!  I ordered the chicken don (udon + chicken with tartar sauce) and 100% it's 5 star worthy. It's such an interesting concept to serve the don with udon noodle soup- I love it!!! The chicken was amazing, the perfect amount of crispy and flavour. The udon soup wasn't lacking either, it was equally good. The portions were good enough for me, I couldn't even finish all the rice after the udon. My boyfriend ordered just an udon and that seemed pretty small but it still filled him.  I had a great experience here and would definitely recommend others to come! There's tons on the menu that I look forward to trying"}
{"text":"On the outside, Ken Oh looked very promising- Japanese spaghetti, a restaurant practically bursting with customers, and some funky concept revolving around some buff martial arts dudes? How unique and fun! The food, however, was very... disappointing.  Honestly the spaghetti reminds me of the very first time I tried cooking- premade spaghetti sauce and a ton of black pepper to desperately add some flavor into the dish. The katsu got soggy immediately from the sauce, and the tiny flecks of ham and mushroom was almost laughable.   The waitresses are really nice and the music features top 40 hits, but the food is so painfully average and overpriced that there is really no merit in ever dropping by. Please don't even bother coming here.   On the bright side, the hamburger steak was pretty yummy, so if you only order that as a side dish I'm sure it'll be a decent experience."}
{"text":"For a new place, I would've thought they would put a little more oomph into their food. The spaghetti pasta itself wasn't great and the sauce was salty with no depth (kind of like a mildly spicy instant gravy); and the dish was drowning in it. It's not a good sign when you find yourself trying to avoid the sauce with your food. The meatloaf/hamburger was overseasoned for my taste, and the cutlet was mediocre. The salad came in a teensy bowl which was disappointing as there were no other veggies.  A saving grace is the fried chicken which was delicious and well-made. Service and decor were also nice which is worth a couple stars. But the price point, quality, and portion sizes are just not aligned well here."}
{"text":"The best, worst 3 star rating and here's why:   - 1 star for the great taste and flavor  - 2nd star for value relative to size and cost and,  - 3rd star for good service/overall atmosphere    Based on the above you're probably wondering why I didn't give KenOh a full five stars. Well, despite the good taste and flavor, there was nothing else particularly noteworthy about any of the dishes. Sure you can get a udon/rice combo in a funky dish but, there was no technicality or ingenuity to the food. While it all tasted pretty good, I feel like you could probably make the exact same dish at home. Not to say I wouldn't come back here but, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. If you're in the area and craving some decent ramen or simple Japanese rice dish, hit it up. Otherwise, there is a lot more in and around this area."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the updated menu. I feel they really stepped up to give you food items that you find everywhere in Japan and the offerings are not that common in Toronto. I still find portions on the larger side with prices that are good for the portion. I would appreciate  lower priced smaller portion menu items. I had the shrimp tempura gyu udon. The beef was tasty and worked well with the soup. The poached egg also had the soup rich and creamy. I wasn't huge on how the shrimp was soggy or that the egg was cold before you push it down for long enough. Overall, I'm very happy with their changes and look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"The chicken nanban curry was great. The chicken was juicy and the white sauce was flavourful. The rice and the curry went pretty well together.   Both of us who had the curry dishes didn't feel so good afterwards though and had to make several trips to the washroom the next day....  Service was great."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for over 4 times in the past. Have always been getting the same thing - teppan butashogayaki. It is always overly salty, cabbage is undercooked and flavorless, but it's an ok option to avoid the crowd in the other restaurants nearby during lunch hour.   However, when I returned today they automatically charged 12% gratitude to the bill without any options. I do not enjoy to be told what to pay for gratitude as it should be based on the service received - which I don't have any - will not return again."}
{"text":"This is spaghetti that I would make at home. It's not worth the price. Next time I want to eat this, I will just make it at home."}
{"text":"Absolutely over priced I had just plain udon in a tiny miso soup bowl and they charged me $5. When I got the bill tip was included at 12%. I also had the buta don and total was $16 was not full at all. Tons of rice for the don and hardly any udon. It was totally not worth the money I rather go to manpuku where they charge 1$ for extra udon and they give you tons while this place is ripping off customers. Food was average nothing special."}
{"text":"Small restaurant specializing in Nagoya style spaghetti with ankake sauce (a tomato base thickened with potato starch). We came for dinner during the opening day where there was 10% off. There was a short wait but staff were accommodating and service was good. They even gave the two of us a table for four to seat us faster. We got the Mirakan and the Cream Croquette spaghettis (~$13). With a mix of basic ingredients like ham, bacon, mushroom, green pepper, and spinach in a slightly peppery, mild sauce, they seemed like eclectic, no-frills dishes you could get at a Hong Kong style diner for at least half the price - I don't think I'll be back but it was filling at least."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner.  Gyu beef don ($9.99) - This was okay, the beef were very thinly sliced and small, felt like it wasn't enough meat. The best part of this don was probably the egg - runny and tasted great mixing it with the beef and rice. If you want just the don and no udon it was $9.99 - so essentially adding an extra $3 gets you a bowl of udon.   $12.95 for the two bowl set - a bowl of udon and a bowl of rice don. I got the oyakodon, which is chicken and egg don. This was good, decent amount of chicken with the rice. The udon soup was average, nothing special.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Ken-oh used to specialize in Nagoya pasta, but it seems they've changed their specialty to nabe, donburi and udon. I never went when they serve Nagoya pasta for I've seen the pictures, and it didn't inspire me.  Today I went there for lunch with my friend seeing that they no longer served spaghetti. We shared an order of their fried chicken with tartar sauce (you can skip it), omurice with curry, and ginger pork on rice + udon.  Omurice with curry - portion is huge, and the curry has a nice distinct flavour. The rice is nice and chewy. However the rice is not ketchup fried rice, but it was still good.  Ginger pork on rice paired with udon - it comes in duo container. So half portion is pork with rice, and the other half is udon. My friend and I agree that the udon is a big overdone (not chewy), but the ginger pork on rice was really gingery and flavorful!  I would go back to try their nabe and more donburi!"}
{"text":"the dish was very tasty and the waitress was nice and polite, also it was served very promptly. this one was s good value, however, I feel like other dishes are a bit steep for me at the moment being in the vicinity of $13-14 plus tax and tip. might try them someday!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, because the food isn't bad tasting but they've changed their offering from pasta to udons & donburis for way too much considering that Manpuku is only a 10 minute walk away for half the price. I do enjoy the novelty of their Figure 8 bowls to get a variety but again, I think I rather go to Manpuku."}
{"text":"Came looking for the Nagoya spaghetti but apparently they abandoned that concept. Had chicken nanban curry, was pretty good: nanban nice and juicy and served with tartar sauce. Curry itself was a bit mediocre, but came with a couple of fukujinzuke.  $13 or so is slightly steep. $10-11 would be better, less than 10 would be a good deal."}
