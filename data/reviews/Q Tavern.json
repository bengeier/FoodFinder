{"text":"Originally ordered the chicken and dumplings... Big mistake, tasteless, and definitely not what you would think of as a traditional dish... It was more like a thick soup with bone chicken mixed in with a small dumpling (as in singular)  awful dish and should definitely be looked into and tweaked a bit or taken off the menu. 

On a better note the service was great and friendly. The manager was quick to fix the order and get me something more appealing and appetizing. I ended up gettin a burger instead and was much better. Mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese are great sides as well."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but we had to wait forever throughout the meal for service. A lunch ended up lasting 2 hours"}
{"text":"I ate it for lunch twice while serving on jury duty and the food was amazing. I had the pork tacos the first time and man were those good. Then I ordered a burger and it was great as well. It was so good the second day we went back we brought more people with us. They had the tuna wrap and said it was the best they have ever had. I hope more people go here as the food is great. The service was good as well and the staff seemed very friendly. They had a pasta buffet for lunch where they make it right in front of you. I will be back forsure."}
{"text":"Had a chance to stay at the Fairfield Inn on a Wednesday night. The Q Tavern is located in the bottom floor of this hotel. After traveling for 3 hours, we were ready for a relaxing evening starting with a beer. 
The bar area is where we decided to start and ordered a local Charlotte beer starting with an IPA from Triple C Brewery. The choices of drafts and bottles were amazing! There were several people at the bar when we arrived but had no problems getting a seat. All were friendly folks with whom we exchanged some stories with.
We had intended on eating at the Q Tavern from the get go but thought we had to go around the corner to the dining area. But our bartender quickly told us that we were already seated in the Q Tavern! We decided we wanted a salad and ordered the Carolina Salad with the pulled pork. Chef Joseph Deal is spot on with this idea! (Unfortunately for Q Tavern, he is leaving to join his brother in another restaurant so we learned!)
The salad was piled high with delicious pulled pork and came with red onions, diced tomato and dill pickles with Ranch Dressing on the side. Whoever would have thought that this combo would work, but work it did!
Even my husband who does not like Dill Pickles, cleaned his plate! Our bartender/server brought us out a sample of 2 of their sauces and we hardly touched our Ranch Dressing. It was not needed. 
It was a wonderful and memorable meal in a Charlotte well kept secret. Folks, you need to come here. The service is fast, friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"11/27/17 - Stopped in for lunch while on business duties because it was my only option in the vicinity. I ordered the mahi mahi sandwich. The service and the food were horrible. The fish was overcooked. It made my bread soggy. They didn't have any paper napkins. They waitress brought out paper towels from the dispenser. They had the nerve to charge me for tartar sauce. I do not recommend this place for any of your dining options."}
{"text":"Terrible service once, I'll give you another chance.  Worse service a second time, I'm done.
Our party of 4 was completely ignored for lunch from the time we sat down and had to find our own silverware to having to hunt down the server to give him our checks to cash out.
No one really seemed to care that we were there and we should have just walked out without paying.  3 of us left zero tip.  As we were leaving, another poor soul was searching the hostess stand for either menus or setups.  And all this while they were NOT busy. Props to the kitchen staff.. that one star is for you.  The food was very good."}
{"text":"Sub par food. Lousy service. Waited fifteen minutes for silverware after waiting an extremely long time for our food. I'm shocked at the amount of good reviews this place has. It's was empty and I understand why. Lousy."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place. The pulled park sandwich was great, but I wouldn't recommend the Mac and cheese as a side. The service was very quick too"}
{"text":"The food is sub par but the service is five star. I had the pleasure of speaking with Lindsey who is friendly, courteous and clearly amazing at what she does. Unfortunately, the flavor of the food was nowhere near the quality of the service. I took my order to my room and although it looked okay (always remember that looks can be deceiving), it smelled and tasted the exact opposite of what good is."}
{"text":"I'm a traveler so all I do is eat out. Q tavern has the goods just not the service. 
Great beer selection and my pulled pork sandwich was tasty. But the two chicks working the place are huge downers. You feel like you're trying to cheer them up instead of the other way around. Good luck getting any warmth or a smile.  They give the place a bad vibe."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work. They had a great craft beer selection. Shauna was my bartender, she was very knowledgeable about the offerings.

I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service from our bartender,Shauna.  She actually, made my night enjoyable, with her pleasant  personality."}
{"text":"I chose here because I didn't want to leave the hotel, and I'm sad I grossly underestimated this place. Not only did they bring the food pool side, it may have been the best NC food I've ever had in my life. We started out with the NC poutine, which was excellent. I had fish and chips (flounder and sweet potato fries) and my friend had the burger with onion rings and BBQ sauce and we're both about to die because we're so happy."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of great places in Charlotte, but this was not it. Waited a long time to have our order taken, waitress could give a crap less about us, and we didn't get our half price appetizer because she waited until 6 to even take our order when we got there at 5:45. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been very pleased with this restaurant inside the Fairfield Inn.  I have eaten here about a dozen times.
Recently I had their lunch buffet.  I was impressed!  Their meats were tender and juicy, their greens were flavorful, and the mac & cheese is very good too!
At lunch for $10, you get the lunch buffet and a coke or tea.  That's a pretty good deal, considering how many times you can go back and fill up.  I also saw a lot of folks come by and pay for a meal, get a to go container, and just fill up their box and head back over to the courthouse.  That's a good way to go too!
They also have a decent salad bar and a dessert to boot!  
I will be back.
Get there early though, as this is one of the few places (right now) that are near the courthouse.  It gets very busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a co-worker while on a business trip. The place was roomy than I expected and was surprisingly empty for a Saturday. I got the Mahi-Mahi sandwich and my co-worker got some wings. Our waitress was diligent in refilling our waters. The food came out in a decent amount of time. My sandwich was large and very filling, the aioli was perfect with the fish. The sweet potato fires were great too.The serving was perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Kenah makes the most awesome shot. It's called the \"Breakfast Shot\" it's amazing!!!! The French fries taste home made and the burgers are the best in the city!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a coworker for lunch. I noticed that the place had been remodeled and I was hopeful that it would be better than the previous incarnation. My coworker had been there recently and raved about the new lunch menu. I skipped the sparse buffet and ordered a veggie wrap with fries. It was not good. The wrap came with hummus and grilled veggies. The amount of cooking oil that seeped from my grilled vegetables was amazing, it literally gushed into my mouth and all over the plate. No flavor whatsoever. The fries were okay, nothing to rave about here. Our service was good but it took forever for the food to come out and by that time I needed to head back to work. My lunch date said that her chicken sandwich was dry. I won't be returning to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"Once again, the diverse Yelpers are either 1 or 2 stars or 4 or 5 stars.   This is a solid 3 star joint.   I gave them a 4th star for their support of local craft breweries.   They have several very good craft beers on tap and sell growlers.

I had jury duty.  The courthouse has really awful food and Q Tavern gives a 20% discount for jury duty!   Yes.  Score.   They have a buffet that is actually pretty descent.  The salad bar has all the essentials, The place was rather busy, therefore the turnover was quick, ensuring fresh stuff --- the lettuce and romaine bowls were green not pink :-).

They also had a chicken fajita bar, chicken noodle soup (it was yummy) and a nacho bar.  Check out my nacho photo.....   Good stuff.

The service was hard core 2 star, I agree with the other Yelpers, the service is terrible.  I had to ask for silverware and drink refills.   The server was just slow and in her own little world, it was almost a bother for her to actually service the tables.  Whatever!  I guess for an $8 AYCE w/drink - what do you expect?  To be fair, the manager was great.  He had a smile on his face, talked to customers and was going around behind the servers cleaning up tables and helping out."}
{"text":"There's no reason for a customer to have to ask for food to be microwaved. It is also crazy that they really had a microwave in the kitchen and reheated the same dry wings without the chef being worried about pushing out cold wings. I'm very disappointed and will only stick to ordering drinks when i stay here. Thank goodness it was during their happy hour. Avoid!!"}
{"text":"the wait staff is so slowwwww i want to die. the food was ok. i still want to die. please help me."}
{"text":"the flounder and sweet potato fries were delicious (so often chefs over cook or make fried food soggy - these were lightly fried....perfect. ) Being from NC,  the collards were the test...they measure up well and are worth recommending.   Farm to table is evident with how fresh everything tasted.  So much food...no room for the dessert! (but there's enough to tempt!)"}
{"text":"This is a typical B scale hotel lobby restaurant. Nothing special.

At lunch, they have a \"flatbread buffet\". It sounded good, but since I was the only person that was eating lunch at the restaurant, the flatbread was over an hour old and dried up under the heat lamps. They were not going to put fresh out since I was the only customer.

The salad bar was ok, but VERY limited (14 items total)."}
{"text":"We've had a few dinners here and the food can't be beat! This last one they gave us a cocktail hour poolside - which is probably the best pool side atmosphere in Charlotte. Doesn't feel at all like I'm in Charlotte. More along the lines of New York. And great specials every night in the bar. Always something new."}
{"text":"15 minutes so far, 5 people at the bar and 1 table. Been walked by 3 times so far. Bartender didn't know what was in bottles or on tap. Do I need to waste any more time on this review?  Service is sub average by far. Update: got my beer request in, 8 minutes till it was delivered to me."}
{"text":"When you check in to the Fairfield, they give you a $5 voucher for Q Tavern. I was HANGRY! Also, I have been writing a ton of 5 star review. I really wanted to be more critical. And then here comes Lynsey...

I ordered a Manhattan expecting poor service and a sub par cocktail. (To be honest, Lynsey and I later discussed the intricacies of the perfect Manhattan). She was busy but got me my drink quickly and it was great. She found me a charger for my phone and was completely attentive thereafter. Most importantly, not being from Charlotte or familiar with the area, her expertise of nightlife and neighborhoods were impeccable and spot on to what I was looking for. Her personality and professionalism was disarming and made me forget my hunger and desire to write a mediocre review. She made it impossible. 

Thank you to the restaurant but mostly to Lynsey for making my experience wonderful and the rest of my evening very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ever heard of an avacado grilled cheese sandwich? With 3 different cheeses even? OMG! How about Mac and Cheese with Pimento Cheese in it? GET OUT OF HERE!!!!!!!!
A must try place! Yes it's located in Fairfield Suites Uptown Charlotte, however, it's worth the visit at least for lunch if nothing else. Pleasantly pleased and overly impressed."}
{"text":"Waited about 10 minutes and never saw an actual restaurant employee. No one in the dining area, no one at the bar. There were other people waiting at tables obviously getting impatient. The place seemed nice enough for a hotel restaurant, decent menu, good beer selection but the service was non-existent."}
{"text":"Don't know what was worse the food or the service. I was seated by hostess. Never got a server or a menu. I was only told of a buffet by the hostess who had to get my drink and that had a small salad bar,  pulled pork ,beans corn and vegetarian lasagna. As the food  choices.  I will never stay at as Fairfield hotel just based off of this horrible  experience"}
