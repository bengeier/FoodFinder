{"text":"Amazing tasting grilled cheese with bacon and tomatoes! Tomato soup is good too! Got the combo for $6 and it was such a good deal! Going back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Had the Mac and cheese melt. Oozing with creamy Mac and cheese still solid enough to eat like a sandwich. My wife enjoyed the flying Pig melt and also enjoyed the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo.   We are intrigued by the grilled cheese donut but will save that for the next visit.  Coke products for those that need to know.  I recommend this rad a \"cheap and cheerful \" restaurant  great for a date before a movie or for a family of 5 or more"}
{"text":"I was about to give this place 4 stars, but I couldn't really think of a reason why, so I decided on 5 stars. Great addition to Strongsville, for brunch or lunch, or even a quick bite (because they have half sandwich options). I love the fact you can order half of sandwiches, that way you can try a couple. service was great, d√©cor was a bit childish, but whatever, they had TVs for sports games which was a nice plus. everything was delicious, and will be going back for more to try some other sandwich options."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food. Simple menu & ordering, with a great variety of options. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the make your own grilled cheese with gluten free bread and mozzarella and a cup of creamy tomato basil soup. Grilled cheese was a little too greasy for my liking, and the soup a little too flavorless. To me, the restaurant is a pale imitation of Melt. Ordered the peanut butter and banana on a fried donut to go for a friend, but was told it was even that it tasted more like someone dumped too much peanut butter on a bagel the hand cut in half. On the plus side, the service was excellent, very friendly and helpful. Overall, if I needed a quick, cheap place to get a grilled cheese, I might stop here, but I probably wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"If you want fat... It's all here. 
Donuts with grilled cheese? 
Yes. 
But it's not tasty...overwhelming
Seriously. 
Get a regular grilled cheese put bacon and dip it Blue Cheese Dressing. 
That will taste alot better then this grossness
And BTW how can you have Coleslaw without refrigerators???
Mayo is super perishable."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here once out of sheer curiosity and have no need to go back again.  It's a cute idea for kids but the sandwiches are a pile of goo.  And don't get me started.  Cheese on a glazed donut?  Somebody notify the FDA!"}
{"text":"I stopped in April 1 , 2017 around 230.  The soup was cold, sandwiches greasy, watered down ranch dressing. Middle school cafeteria quality food.   Thought it was a bad April fools joke. Definitely a one and done place for our family."}
{"text":"I ordered Italian sub and was presented with the most noxious sandwich imaginable. Two bites was it. They offered to replace it but I passed. 
Great majority of customers like the place. Too much grease for my taste"}
{"text":"Horrible and tasteless. Way over priced for grilled cheese and a slice of meat in the middle. The tomato soup tasted like it was out of an old can . Cashier did not even smile ."}
{"text":"Delicious! The location is so cute inside and the decor is great."}
{"text":"First time trying you guys last night.  I had the mac and cheese grilled cheese with bacon and tomato basil soup.  It was delicious and I'll definitely be coming back again.  And let's not forget the grilled donut bites with the mascarpone cheese dipping sauces.  Outstanding."}
{"text":"Definitely not all it's was made to be by watching the show shark tank . I was disappointed very bland . But great staff really friendly and clean establishment"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. It's great when your having that craving, but don't have the money for Melt or the time. Though it is nothing like Melt when it comes to taste. This is the fast food version of the idea. I'd come back, but it's nothing I'd rave about. The original tomato soup tastes like chef boyardee without the noodles or pizza sauce."}
{"text":"For a grilled cheese place, this joint is outstanding!

Came in for lunch shortly after they opened. Once they figured out how to get the doors unlocked, I was enthusiastically greeted and placed my order. 

Seeing as this was lunch, and wanting to watch my girlish figure, I opted for a simple lunch combo of a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup and a soft drink for $6. There are 8 different cheeses and 5 different breads, including gluten free for those so inclined. I chose cheddar on sourdough.  

I was very impressed with the sandwich. Nice sized and lots of cheese. The tomato soup was tasty, but could have used a shot of Franks to jazz it up.   They don't have a fryer, so ixnay on the French fries which isn't a bad thing. Matter in fact, they have a poster up by the register promoting \"No fryers, No freezers, No microwaves.\"  Everything is fresh and prepared as you wait. 

I was surprised to run into the owner, a real class act and a restaurant veteran in Strongsville and Medina. Always gives back to the community and runs a great ship!  Can't wait to come back with an appetite to take on the 13 grilled cheese donuts challenge!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this after seeing it on Shark Tank. My sister and I went hoping it would be a new favorite. 

My sister ordered the tomato soup and a vegan grilled cheese. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and the Ma Ma Meatloaf.   I also ordered a pickle and a side of Mac and cheese. Yay! Coke products. 

As we sat down at our (dirty) table, I had a sinking feeling. The people in line in front of us had some sort of trouble in line. They were near us and didn't look too pleased. 

Our food came out and looked good, but I could tell the soups and Mac and cheese were cold. My sister took all of it up to the registers and asked if they could heat them up. The boy at the counter relayed the info to Katie ( she seemed to be in charge). She looked at my sister and rolled her eyes. She told my sister the food was heated to a certain temperature and it SEEMED cold to us because it was cold in the dining room. 

When Katie brought our food out (heated on the stove, they don't have microwaves), she told us about food temperatures and our soups were supposedly 180 degrees. I told her that there was no way that they were because after tasting my soup, I stuck my finger in it to see if maybe I was crazy. 

The reheated sides were definitely warmer. The chicken tortilla had good flavor but I didn't finish it. My sister's tomato soup tasted like canned tomato sauce. The Mac and cheese was ok but nothing special. The pickle was kind of boring. 

However, both sandwiches were served hot and were very tasty. 

I'll give it another shot once they've been open longer. My sister works near the mall and would have stopped in for a meal pretty regularly, but after our experience tonight, she probably will not. 

My sister is 28. I'm 41. We both are clean and professional looking. We weren't there to cause trouble or to complain. My sister certainly didn't feel like her request to warm the food deserved an eye roll. 

Disappointed, but I'll try again in a few months."}
{"text":"Great experience at a very reasonable price.

I have been here twice now, and both times we had really excellent food and good service.  My first meal consisted of a combo meal which comes with a sandwich, side (one of their in-house made soups or a side dish) and an unlimited fountain drink.  I chose the grilled mac-n-cheese and the creamy basil tomato soup.  The soup had just a hint of basil and garlic and was of course creamy and tomatoe-y.  The sandwich itself was rock star...bread perfectly grilled stuffed with a combination of creamy mac-n-cheese, two other cheese on top, crumbled bacon and fried onions.  Man, that was yummers!

On our second trip, I could not resist the same grilled mac-n-cheese sandwich, but my daughter and I went halvsies and we also ordered the West of Philly melt which ad smoked beef brisket, mozzarella cheese, onions, mushrooms, banana peppers and garlic aioli.  Gotta say that the banana peppers totally made the sandwich for us...we both loved it!  As a \"splurge\", we all split an order of their famous grilled cheese donut desserts going with the S'mores version.  This thing was a grilled donut filled with chocolate, graham crackers and marshmallow mascarpone...how decadent is that?!?!?  One order was plenty for the three of us to share as it was very rich.

I'm a big fan of this place...will sure to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I didn't find it a comfortable dining experience.  Maybe not their fault, but the setup was weird. Didn't care for the food either. They completely messed up our order.... no food was marked... just could make better at home."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to one of these franchises since seeing them on Shark Tank. Stopped for lunch at 1:00 pm. Nobody in line and staff was friendly and pro idea suggestions when I told them it was first time. 

Had the mac & cheese on sourdough and it was delicious. Served hit and melty perfectly toasted. Combo w side & drink was 9.00.

Got the grilled cheese donut to go and it was also great. I will be back soon. 

Note to Owner please add a LARGE drink size to the menu."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very lively and service is fast and the food is good. The creamy tomato soup is absolutely fantastic. However my one and only complaint is that for a grilled cheese with bacon and macaroni and cheese inside, tomato soup, and drink I paid just over $12. I don't think the price is worth what you get. I don't think ill come back unless I have a gift card but my experience was overall enjoyable."}
{"text":"I got Tom + Chee for the first time today for lunch.  It was not very good in my opinion.  The sandwich was poorly constructed with some items on only 1/2 of the sandwich, and tomato soup has a very odd taste.  Maybe it's just my taste, but I will not be a regular of Tom + Chee."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, and we were pleasantly surprised. Fresh food, fast service, and very clean restaurant. The soup is wonderful, I loved my salad and my husband loved his grilled cheese. We will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but I was getting it to go and it took 40 minutes for me to get a cup of soup, 1.5 sandwiches, and the s'mores donut. Didn't even get anything for waiting that long. If I hadn't paid already, then I would have left.  The lady before me flipped out due to waiting so long and she got something for complaining, but they should have just noticed it was taking longer than normal and gave everyone something.  I surely hope it doesn't take 40 minutes all the time, because I would have rather gone to a sit down restaurant at that point. 

Like I said though at the beginning. The food truly was good. I went with the hammy whammy, and my girlfriend got the grilled mac+chew and a cup of the creamy basil tomato. I would recommend trying the s'more donut as well if you have time to kill."}
{"text":"Fresh and made to order.  Flying pig is out of this world.  Homemade pickles too .  If you don't like tomato soup the chicken noodle is legit.  And finished with the recommended buckeye grilled donut is crazy good.  Staff and cleanliness A++."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to trying this place and it did not disappoint! 

Menu- Great selection, love that they had gluten free options available. We also really appreciated that they had half, normal and double selections. 

Seating - nice, clean large space.

Service- 5/5. Very friendly staff who made an effort to talk with us more than just getting our order. 


Meal - We tried the West of philly, mac+chee, tomato soups and side Mac and cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious, fresh tasting and had great flavor. The mac and cheese was slightly cold, but not bad. Still delicious. We dug in & conquered so fast we didn't have time to take any pictures. 

Cannot wait to go back and try more! Grab your friends, grab your wife and head over to Tom+Chee!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday early afternoon. We were in the area and just wanted to try because we like Shark Tank. Experience was just ok. 

We were the only customers. Girl at the counter was very meh. We asked her some questions because it was our first time. She answered them but seemed annoyed. 

We ordered the Tom + chee combo with grilled cheese and cup of soup. The soup is a cup not very big. I got the regular tomato and it's very tomato like. I am used to Campbells and progresso so it wasn't bad just different. My friend got the tomato basil and that looked more like what I am use to. The grilled cheese was okay too. Be careful the balsamic dressing dripped everywhere. 

The manager came over to check on us. That was nice. But the whole think was just okay. Not sure what I expected. Maybe a bit more food. Not sure but the whole experience was just meh/ok. 

Might try again just to see if it's any better."}
{"text":"Great food! Had several different types of sandwiches and all were good.  The Italian was the favorite from our group. The Tomato Basil soup was yummy too.  Our service was great as well.  If you haven't gone before I definitely recommend checking this place out.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit strongsville we have to stop by.  The food is fresh and so affordable.  My kids just love the grilled cheese and Mac and cheese combo.     I enjoy the half soup and sandwich a perfect lunch!!!
The staff is friendly and quick.  I highly recommend a visit to this hip restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to try T&C, it was on shark tank and their menu looks fantastic. At the time of this visit, I was working as the GM of an area competitor, which is why I waited to review (I am no longer employed there). I walked in toward the end of dinner (maybe 7:30pm), and there was no one in line, although there was a girl at the register who looked like a manager, working on something. I wasn't greeted, and stood in front of the counter looking over the menu for a few minutes without as much as an acknowledging glance. I said hello and asked what their most popular item was. The girl said she didn't know, and went back to her task. So I rephrased and asked what was good, and she said, and I quote, \"everything\". And went back to her task. I let out an audible \"hmmmmm\", which prompted a small amount of elaboration. \"Well, a lot of people get the grilled cheese donuts\". 

Progress.

I ordered a grilled cheese donut, a small side of Mac & cheese and a drink. I thanked her for taking my order, she did not reciprocate. The wait wasn't bad, around 5-6 minutes. I received my food to go and took it literally around the corner to my home.

Overall, the food was adequate. The grilled cheese donut was good, but the taste was nowhere near proportionate to the amount of artery blocking fat and grease being put into my body, not to mention the sugar. This was a glazed donut after all, and to be fair, I knew what I was ordering. The Mac & cheese tasted old, and reminded me a LOT of when you make Mac & cheese and stick the leftovers in the fridge for a few days and then microwave them. Like almost to a tee. The noodles were overcooked, the whole thing was bland, like the flavor and creamy consistency had been cooked right out of it.

The only thing giving this a 2 star and not 1 star is that the grilled cheese donut was tasty, and it gave me hope that the rest of my experience had been the result of an off-night for the staff. Honestly though, I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"We were so exited to try this restaurant out! Soup was average but I fell in love with the Mac & Cheese sandwich!! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Normally prefer local originals, especially for out-of-town guests, but my SIL wanted more grilled cheese and had been to Melt 2 Days earlier, so...we hit the Tom & Chee in Broadview Heights. What a pleasant surprise! First, I learned from their wall that the biz was founded by two guys from Cincy. Not the CLE, but keep in' it in-state.   Second, the  staff (sorry - didn't catch names!) was very nice and patient with us 4 first-timers. Third, great options and good food. I love that you can order 1/2 sizes or go double-decker. The gals among us order halves, the dude ordered a double. One of us is gluten-free and she was happy with the GF bread. 
I went with the West of Philly and it was good. Seriously not skimping on the meat here - and it was identifiable beef, not mystery shreds. I also got pickles on the side which were tasty and the perfect counterpoint to balance out my meal.
They also have salads, and soup - including a dipper portion when you want to dunk but don't need much more. Self-serve fountain drinks or bottled water. Pay at the counter when you order, but they bring the food to your table.
Definitely not another Melt - but a good, super casual, affordable place to get a grilled cheese. I'm sure I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars for the food and service but I do have an issue with their website.
Walked in and was kindly greeted by the cashier. The lady in line in front of me had a bunch of questions and the cashier was able to answer all of them. I reviewed the menu online before I walked in, as I was there on opening day and wanted to be fast and not hold up the line while making my choice, but they didn't offer the same options that are listed on the online menu! 
My 3rd choice was on the menu and I ordered it to go since I live within walking distance. The soup was fantastic and the sandwich was delicious! 
I have recommended this place to 3 others and they have all tried it and had rave reviews!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try it .... extremely disappointing . 
Very poor quality .... not worth the money.
I will not go back even if it's free."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Tom + Chee today, neither one of us could finish our food.  The sandwiches were so greasy that the bread was soaked when she set it on our table, you couldn't even pick it up, it was just slop!!  We ordered the Italian sandwich and the West of Philly sandwich.  The soups were terrible, the tomato basil soup did NOT taste like it had basil in it at all more of a tarragon flavor, almost like they grabbed the wrong jar.  The chicken noodle had the same flavor only way stronger, the menu says chicken breast but there was clearly dark meat in there too!!  

On a positive note... the girl taking orders was very friendly and looked like hard worker, as she was doing everything and put gloves on after taking money!!"}
{"text":"Came here and tried the \"Tom & Chee\" and \"Flying Pig\". Both were great, and well worth the price. Glad 2 of these are opening in NEO."}
{"text":"Well my soup was only Luke warm and my grilled cheese had cheese that was that kind that is hard to chew .... you know like plastic...... but the worst was the ice machine......it was covered in green and brown stuff! I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Tom and Chee for the first time the other day.  I was clean and not overly crowded.  The food was okay - but I felt a little expensive - let's face it, it's bread and cheese.  The bill for two was approximately $16.50, two sandwiches, one soup and two drinks.  I do like the fact you can get a half sandwich and a soup or salad.  So there are positives here.  My husband is a huge fan of toasted cheese so I really wanted to try it for him."}
{"text":"Okay, I admit that I made fun of this place before I tried it.  I mean come on a restaurant that sells the quickest dinner to make at home?  To my surprise they have the best reasonably priced salad in Strongsville!  Salad was not just iceberg salad out of a bag!  And the crucial thing for me - homemade salad dressing!  Yes, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and food on both trips. Management check to make sure everything was Good! Definitely a place I will frequent"}
{"text":"Food very good. Kids like it too. Service a little slow but I wouldn't hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"Not only was our food delicious the service was amazing!  I went with my 4 year old and 10 month old so my hands were full. We were checked on repeatedly and even told to leave our stuff to be cleaned up. This means so much when you are trying to keep it together while juggling two kids!  I had the mac and chee which was delicious. The bread is perfectly grilled!  My daughter had the kids meal and actually ate the whole thing!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome concept with delicious comfort food offerings!  The sandwich was well prepared & the tomato soup was hot & hearty! Going back again soon (maybe today)"}
{"text":"The tomato soup was flavorless. All I could taste was garlic. I had the mac and cheese grilled cheese which was very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch.  I had the West of Philly sandwich and a bowl of Creamy Tomato Basil Soup and my wife had a Chicken Bacon Ranch Sandwich.  Both sandwiches and the soup was delicious.  It was so good that I went back the next day for the same sandwich.  The food is legit.  The service was exceptional and it was delivered fast.  I cannot wait to go back and try their grilled doughnuts.  It's not like The Melt where you get ginormous sandwiches and fries (I love The Melt but their portions are ridiculous), the sandwiches here are a reasonable size but oh, so good."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally pass one of these places to try it. I was surprised to see the variety in the menu, didn't know there were salads and stuff. 

Food: Flying pig grilled cheese was SO good. What a unique blend of flavors, not greasy at all like I would have imagine. Glad I got 1/2 though-would have been too much to do whole! Got a salad-obviously not their main seller here, but wasn't too bad. Lettuce was kinda tired but otherwise good.

The staff was so friendly and made suggestions for me after telling them it was my first time. Also-I like a place that sticks to a theme. The colors and signage matched throughout-even in the chairs, I thought that was cool. Like everyone else said-reasonable pricing too!"}
{"text":"I got the tomato cheese combo and loved it. The balsamic dressing made it and Joe liked the horseradish dressing made his salad. We had to try the grilled cheese doughnut..... Fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual lunch or dinner. Food is fresh and service is fast. They have a wide variety of options, not many healthy, but all that we tried was delicious. Can't wait to try the donut grilled cheese!!!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. I got a simple cheese sandwich with two cheeses and tomato soup. Both were delicious, but the tomato soup has a weird spice in it that greatly takes away from the tomato flavor. Otherwise it was great. I tried one of the donuts, which was great (and sinful) again except for some kind of fake tasting chocolate cream sauce. I also got the beer cheese soup which I thought was delicious while my husband wasn't as impressed. A few tweaks on the embellishments and this place will go far. I love the concept, and I loved the tomato and cheese colored decor!"}
{"text":"Like millions of others I waited for my store to open. What a disgrace! Very poor quality meat.
First employee came around to ask if everything was great. When I said no, he didnt know what to do and merely walked away. Manager came around and was sorry to hear that.
He also confessed to having received no training as to food allergies whatsoever.
The tomato soup is pretty good on a cold day. If you like garlic that is."}
{"text":"Really great food! Not really sure why it has bad reviews. grilled cheeses are with a variety really good cheeses and not terrible kraft cheese singles. The Tom Che with balsamic and tomatoe was amazing and so was the Mac and cheese. My husband made himself a healthier option with wheat bread and vegetables and he really enjoyed it. When we've gone before service was kind of slow but this time around it was much faster. The best part is the price! It's so cheap with really good portions."}
{"text":"Sunday at 11:45 AM, One other party had already been served. We waited while 3 of the staff finished their conversation before acknowledging we were waiting at the counter. We placed our order with the employee we appeared to he bothering. We went to get our diet coke and it was mostly clear. I told the same employee that this was not correct. She went and pulled a sample and agreed. Next we saw her cleaning the  nozzle of the dispenser. Then she disappeared until she brought our food. I asked if she had gotten the diet coke worrking and she said I think so??? What kind of an answer was that? My husband went to check and it was as clear as water. We left without a drink or offer of refund. Great food, management needs to do better training. This was our second visit and both times staff was lacking customer service."}
{"text":"This a good place. Great concept! May eat here again. Food was yummy. Soup great. A lil pricey though!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Food is great and staff seemed extremely hard working. They seemed a little understaffed based upon how much running around they were doing but the manager was just as involved as the employees to help things move smoothly. We were checked on a few minutes after receiving our food and the manger stopped by to clear our places/ do a clean sweep of the whole dining room. The food is super yummy, and not as greasy as I was expecting. I got the classic and the balsamic on it was to die for."}
{"text":"Vegan cheese, yay! But they covered the sandwich in butter......oh. Good idea, poorly executed. I felt like I could make better food at home, obviously for cheaper. I got the vegan grilled cheese with pasta salad and a tomato soup dipper. I'm not a strict vegan, so I was okay with the butter and creamy pasta salad. But for strict vegans, pretty much a flop. The food was very average in my opinion. My mom got a sandwich with chicken and bacon, and she said it had a weird taste. We fed it to our dog. The decor in this place is weird, McDonald's colors all over the place, but not as nice as a McDonald's. ( yes, a McDonald's has better decor) Tvs with sports on them, as if we're at Bw3. So confusing. I love this idea, but just go to melt."}
{"text":"Looked forward to this place since seeing them get a deal on shark tank. Was surprised to see one here in Ohio when visiting my mom. They did not disappoint !
Try the donut grilled cheese with tomato soup or the flying pig was awesome as well! Like to see one of these open in the Harrisburg pa area!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!! The food is delicious!! I'm not sure how many people want this kind of food in the summer, but WOW in the fall, winter and spring I'm sure it's a real winner!! No matter what season it is, it's yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"first tom i went there today  12/09/2016,and what a junk place in my opinon  the so called half sanwich with philly steak no meat on their and very skimmpy  and greasy   ,might as you the sandwich to wax your car  in the summertime  and the so called homemade tomato soup ,is not homemade (tastes like  very cambell ish  ,except they added white pepper  real homemade soup is not so puree that looks like cambelles and taste like it ,i made real homomade tomato soup is a little chunkierand better color then there whicj i strongly belive it higher end cambell soup made just for the restaurant,if you like greeasy 1/32 of meat on your sandwich then this is the place for you ,i never ever go back  the girl  cant even add the menu  glasses with brown hair"}
{"text":"Not bad. Food was tasty, wait was short, staff was friendly. Didn't give five stars because I guess I'm getting sick of the $12 lunch. A small grill cheese and a smaller cup of soup left me hungry. Good stuff just not enough of it for what they charge."}
{"text":"I expected to love the classic tomato soup, but didn't like it at all. None of the 4 of us liked it. It tasted more like tomato sauce. I suspect it was tomatoes and spices and nothing else. No milk or cream added. The grilled cheese was fantastic. The sandwiches were also great. In this restaurant you order at the counter and then sit down; they bring it to your table. While you're waiting, there is a area for small area for young kids to play. The price was right - $6 for a cup of soup, a grilled cheese sandwich, and a drink. We will go back, I'll just get a different kind of soup."}
{"text":"Seriously yummy! Tomato soup and veggie grilled cheese ( designed my own) Service was awesome too. Comfort food is an American staple. This changes m featured on Shark Tank gets it!  
Ambiance is cheerful and comfortable .
I appreciated the quality ingredients. Sourdough was thick, Swiss was very flavorful. Grilled veggies had crunch. I am visiting Cleveland and hope this chain reaches Chicago soon!"}
{"text":"This place really surprised me with every point. This was my first experience here and we ordered carry out of 2 grilled cheeses(flying pig and a create your own), kids meal(soup, Mac n cheese, banana & strawberry sliced fruit cup and a juice), 1 cup of tomato basil soup and a fountain drink for 21.00! The order said it would take 15 minutes and I got there in 12 and they handed it to me immediately. The service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere was very similar to the fast casual usuals like firehouse or penn station. Our order was accurate and hot and the kid's meal was perfect for my 1yr old! Five stars. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I had a fun first experience at Tom + Chee! My Mom and I were in the area and wanted a quick bite to-go. My trusty Yelp app led us to Tom + Chee, a restaurant I had heard had been featured on Shark Tank.

I forget his name (darn), but the young guy who took our order was SO helpful. We really took our time looking over the menu, and he gave us tons of great suggestions. I had the Pep+Chee, which is essentially marinara, pepperoni and mozzarella. The next time I return, I'll probably order something different. The sandwich was made fine, but it just wasn't my favorite. I didn't find it very filling (but hey, that's my own fault, I ordered it). However, I had a bite of my Mom's Chicken Bacon Ranch, and it was SO GOOD! I loved the flavor combo!

The interior has a colorful vibe with tons of open seating. Tom + Chee is a cool place, and I won't hesitate to stop by again if I'm in the area! An ooey, gooey grilled cheese is hard to find these days. I love their unique take on this classic sandwich!"}
{"text":"They have vegan grilled cheese! They're signature soup is also vegan! They also offer GF opinions."}
{"text":"Why isn't this place full all the time? They always have at least one great soup and lots of very tasty grown-up (and kid friendly) grilled-cheese sandwiches. I especially like the one with tomato and balsamic. We've been several times and have enjoyed ourselves. If you're feeling really naughty, try the s'mores donut grilled cheese. It has a subtle cheese chocolate combo that is tempered and smoothed out by the marshmallow. Very naughty, and very good."}
{"text":"One of my best friends took me here because she thought I would like it and low and behold, she was RIGHT! The food was really good. I'm not a fan of tomato soup (though my kids and husband love it! ~ I feel like I'm just eating spaghetti sauce, anyone else? haha) so I tried it and it was tasty, just not my thing. 
We got the Tom + Chee with bacon and that was really good but I think my favorite was the Flying Pig, which we got on Gluten Free bread, due to my friends food issues. AND they said, if she wanted they have a place to make it in the back, totally GF, away from all traces of gluten, but it does take awhile. So, handy to know. 
We also shared the Chicken Caesar salad which was tasty AND (hold your hungry horses) has grilled cheese croutons! I know, right?! It was pretty rad. 
All in all a tasty spot for a bite and I think I will bring the kids and husband back some time. 
Oh, and I guess they have grilled cheese donuts and whatnot too lol"}
{"text":"I had the Grilled Mac + Chee which is macaroni, cheese, bacon and crispy onion on white.  Combo'd it to add a drink and a side of pasta salad for a total of $9.  My 12 year old had a simple gilled cheese with bacon and a bag chips. Overall the lunch was good- service was great!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place since I saw it on shark tank a few years ago. I have been twice and sampled 4 different sandwiches and none (including what they are known for) have been overly impressive. The bread wasn't what I would expect from a sandwich restaurant - it wasn't overly fresh or special.  The atmosphere is casual, open, and loud. There were not many options for the fountain pop but they did have unsweetened & sweet tea.  

3 stars because you pretty much have to try a grilled cheese donut once in your life but not so sure you need to try it multiple times!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The soup isn't anything extraordinary but the sandwiches are! I got the mac + chee and it was delicious"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the place since I heard so much about it. You should just go to Melt. The grilled cheeses are simple and ones you can make at home. The tomato soup is basically spaghetti sauce. None of the employees seem to want to be there (which makes sense, I get it.) Prices are good though."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! I thought the menu options were very creative!"}
{"text":"I'm writing a revision on my Tom + Chee review from back in February because a member of management reached out to me to right the wrong. A much appreciated and professional gesture! We've already been back to Tom + Chee since, must have been a flukey day the day we received our mediocre order at work."}
{"text":"Loveeee this place! Every time I go in here the food is always perfect. I also like that they try new specials, keeps me coming back! Fast food but nothing frozen so its delicious!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab lunch for a quick break! They had awesome deals every day of the week, like $2 grilled cheeses on Tuesday, and half price doughnuts on Wednesday. 

I ordered the wheat berry grilled cheese with vegan cheese, and added bacon and tomato. I also had a cup of the classic tomato soup. My meal came with a soft drink and was $8, a great price! It was also delicious, and perfectly hot until the last bite. 

The menu was creative, and my coworker got a philly style grilled cheese. The big hit looked to be a grilled cheese doughnut, but I don't think I would be up to trying that just yet! 

There was a lifesize connect 4 and another game for kids in the corner to keep them busy. 

The employee who helped us was very friendly, and even checked on us after we finished our meal to clear our plates and ask how it was! Nothing but positive reviews. Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"The butter is a soy butter, so I have raised my rating to 2. It is still terrible. Whoever replied, thank you, but I just don't like your employees, your food, and the floors and decor."}
{"text":"I could not get to the restaurant fast enough, as soon as I saw they had vegan cheese I was there! I ordered a vegan grilled cheese and it was perfect. I ordered pickles, which was one pickle cut in half, lol. The pickle was soggy and kinda gross. None of us were impressed by them.
My sister said the tomato soup with basil cream was amazing. I hope they get more vegan options in the future cause I will be there lots.
I got a vegan grilled cheese, chips, pop and pickle for only $7, that is really cheap. Oh and the staff were really friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Tom and Chee was terrific. When looking at the menu, they have tons of options including 1/2, full and double decker sandwiches. Wanting to try a few different things I split 3 1/2 sandwiches with a friend. All were good, but the original tom and Chee was definitely the best. In additional to the sandwiches, we tried 2 grilled cheese donuts - a smores and a peanut butter banana. These are what they are known for and they did not disappoint. They were gooey and super delicious!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a fast casual stop for our ride back home on Memorial Day weekend and this was a great stop!  I'm a sucker for grilled cheese and love different and inventive combos.   I would have tried the grilled donuts if we wouldn't have had a long a$$ car ride home.  Hubby made his own grilled cheese, I had the pesto turkey which was yummy and my little guy had a mac + cheese kids meal that was well worth the special price on a Monday.  Only drawback is there is peanut butter on the menu & my oldest has an allergy but we always come prepared with his own food just in case.  Also big props to the staff who were both friendly and accommodating on a very quiet day on Memorial Day.  Highly recommend you check them out if you are a kid at heart and love grilled cheese like me."}
{"text":"I have been craving grilled cheese and tomato soup lately!!! But I can't have dairy or wheat...Tom & Chee has vegan cheese and gluten free bread!! I made my own grilled cheese with the vegan cheese and gluten free bread and added a bowl or the tomato soup to dip my sandwich in.  The outside of my grilled cheese was crisp and delicious and the inside was thick, gooey, and cheesy! I loved it!! The perfect meal for a cold winters day, but I would eat this any day! There are also pre-designed options with different vegetables, meats, sauces, and cheeses. There are 3-4 different soups to pick from. Salads, sides, grilled cheese donuts. This place is great and reasonably priced!!! Can't wait to bring my dad who also cannot have dairy."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed. I order the half pesto turkey sandwich, mac n cheese, and tomato basil soup. I paid around $10 for everything. I liked the sandwich, but it was very small and greasy. The soup didn't have much flavor, but it went well with the sandwich. They do not fill the soup (to-go) container all the way. The mac n cheese was not good at all. Very greasy and chunky."}
{"text":"I have been in retail/customer service management 10 years .. and I'm AMAZED your GM Katie Torres even has kept a job this long.  We went to pick up an order we called in..(7:30pm 3/29/18). she showed me she burnt something and asked if i wanted her to make a new one.  I said yes,  she Slammed the old one in the trashed and was so rude i couldn't believe it.  Then she said i was rude to her on the phone?! I never spoke to her,  my fiance did.. he was nothing but polite.  After i said I'm a manager and i Can't believe your customer service, she said \"good for you, get the fuck out of the store\" I said ok but OBVIOUSLY wanted my money back.. she said Why your foods right there... 
 Cause I'm a paying customer and your attitude was unbelievable. She finally refunded the card.     That place will be out of business in a few months tops with ppl like her in charge.  
By the way the young boy working was sweet, had no idea what to do while she acted like a crazy person and he whispered he's sorry.  WHISPERED ( cause he was scared of her screaming for keeping customers happy?)
    oh and she refused to give me any # or higher up names than hers!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but pretty expensive. We paid $24 for two meals and drinks. It took about 14 minutes to get our food, after waiting in line for 6 minutes. 
It was very noisy and provided no 'atmosphere'. I was expensive slow fast food. 

I liked my Tom + Chee sandwich with balsamic reduction and Parmesan sourdough. The Mac and cheese was tasty, but Barely warm. I didn't care for the tomato soup, it was more like a basil-y pasta sauce. 
The fella said it wasn't quite enough food for him, so I had to feed him again later.

Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here,and it was delicious!!!! Just what was needed for a blustery cold day!  And you serve Luzianne tea, which I feel is the very best!  Got a grilled cheese w bacon & mac n cheese on it, SO good!!! The chicken tortilla soup was delicious as well.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!! The Flying Pig and Italian Stallion sandwiches were amazing!!! Super clean and great staff. Will be soon!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Shark Tank and gave it a go. I was a little skeptical given all the negative reviews but my experience here was quite good. The food was very good and affordable as well (a grilled cheese, a doughnut, a soup, a dipper and two drinks for $14). 

Perhaps the only drawback is the portion sizes being a little small but otherwise it really hit the spot after a dark rainy day."}
{"text":"Nice staff and clean large place. Not much for vegans here but they have a vegan cheese and a few vegan breads. We  just tried the wheatberry bread with vegan cheese. I am not a vegan cheese fan but its decent. For $4.29 its not my choice, but non vegans have more choices."}
{"text":"As a Shark Tank fan I had high hopes. At best it was average. To be fair I ordered a simple grilled cheese and tomato soup. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Just average. I know there are more creative menus choices and I'm sure they're good. Service and staff were friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this store a couple weeks ago stood at the counter for a probably 5 minutes and not one person in the back approached or welcomed us, so we eventually just left, on the way out, the floor was wet and my husband slipped and fell still not one person said one word to us , will not be back horrible customer service. I have worked in restaurants my whole life and have always welcomed people at least with a hello when they come in to the restaurant.  I have never felt so unwelcome !!! And then for no one to ask if my husband was ok was in believable!!!"}
