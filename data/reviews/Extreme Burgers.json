{"text":"Do it...small mom and pop shop. Excellent quality burgers and toppings. I would like to see fresh cut fries instead of the typical frozen tats.  Had the banquet burger which was super duper :-)"}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews and was nearby.  I had the extreme burger and poutine.  The burger was decent. The patty seemed fresh was overall the price wasn't very expensive. Could have used more flavour and the toppings overpowered the meat.  The poutine was not good. Grated mozzarella cheese and salty gravy.  Good for a cheap, decent burger, stay away from poutine. Good value overall."}
{"text":"I stopped in tonight after driving by this place daily for years. Grabbed a mardi gras burger combo- for just over $10, it's a steal. Big, juicy patty with a bunch of great toppings. Best not-fresh-cut fries I've had as long as I can remember. Great service. You should stop in and check this place out."}
{"text":"Good home-made burgers, should get more traffic.  decor and pricing low-scale. but nothing wrong with that.  I live nearby and often opt for a quick burger here than on the Danforth.   fries are so-so"}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall almost by definition, I'd recommend takeout.   Had the extreme burger combo. The amazing part was that the combo which was reasonably priced at 8.50 included a poutine which was massive.   Downside was the \"blue cheese\" on it was a sauce not the real thing.  Other than that no complaints!  Still a delicious burger though and I'd go back if in the area"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and its a shame there's just two reviews,  and I don't know why I've taken this long to review it.  It's easy to miss this place despite its bizarre green sign, but you're missing out if you don't go in.  The burgers here are big and juicy, homemade and actually seasoned, perfectly at that.  Burger to bun ratio is perfect as well.  Fries are out of the bag, so not hand cut, but they fry them perfect and salt them just right, they are delicious.  The souvlaki dinner here is also great, you get 3 skewers of pork or chicken that's very juicy and cooked just right.  But the potato's are the real star of the dish, out of this world moist and lemony.  I recommend this place to anybody, everything I've had has been outstanding and the prices are just right(you wont be paying $14 bucks for a burger and fries)."}
{"text":"Great place, awesome burger deal! Burger + fries + pop = 7$! Also they have a bar! Cool place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"Small place, hidden  gem on Pape ave.  Seem to be family owned, one lady was working thou.   I went with smokey bacon burger and let me tell you, it was good,  pently  of favour  from the sauce to the bacon to coleslaw  like topping. The patty was juicy and size was good.  Pricing  is reasonably  fair 7 buck for a burger, 10.50 for the combo and the fries were good too.  Portions  were definitely worth the price.  Cook time was a bit slow (10 mins) but I cut her some slack, she was alone and there was one guy ahead of me. As well as delivery  order  too.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Our burger place next door! Lovely family owns this little shop where burgers are home made,juicy and deliciously prepared! Good price as well! Excellent cook, warm and friendly service! We're going every week."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Got the Extreme Burger combo and it was great, a must try for sure!  Family run establishments are the best, that actually care that you're happy."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I try new places in search of - a new (to me) restaurant run by people who care and make great food. :)  I had the mushroom melt burger. It was freshly made for me (I was the only one there for a slow weekday lunch) and had tasty mushrooms as well as bits of shredded lettuce as well as sauce but no other toppings... but the important part was the juicy patty and the melted cheese! Yum!   The daily special price ($10.50) included fries and a drink, with gravy costing another $0.75 on the fries. The prices have gone up since they were posted on Yelp by another user.  They also serve a number of other dishes.... gyros, souvlaki, fillets, etc. Excited to go again some time and try more!"}
{"text":"Speedy delivery. We ordered the Greek burger, no flavour, almost a metallic taste. The fat mac also fell flat, bland, and fairly difficult to mess up a burger with these ingredients (couldn't tell the difference between each ingredient)."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers ,small place. Excellent flavour and good size. Taste like a good homemade burger."}
{"text":"This without a doubt my favourite burger joint in Toronto! I always get the Extreme Burger combo and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Nice Mom and Pop style 'hole in the wall'. The food was prepared to order with fresh ingredients and priced fairly.   Recommend for any foody who wants to explore further than the Danforth, will go again."}
