{"text":"Summer's coming fast! This town has a lack of good ice cream shops, which is baffling since we live in the desert. Yes, there's DQ and Cold Stone if you want to go broke trying to stay cool. Thrifty is great, but still too expensive. La Flor de Michoacan is an awesome alternative for the adventurous spirit! Lots of tasty options to choose from. Shaved ice and frozen bananas to unique snacks foreign to the American palate. I've been to several of the locations for this business and this is my favorite. (Doesn't hurt that it's two miles from my house). If you don't speak Spanish it can be difficult to order, but this location has knowledgeable and bilingual employees who are eager to help and encourage you to be daring. They have basic ice creams of course, but some flavor combinations will force you to try something new because your curiosity will get the best of you! Mexican candies and sodas also. Take a chance if you want to be adventurous, but I warn you, the amazing flavors and reasonable prices will have you coming back again and again! Heads up though, if you order the Tostilocos, those rubbery things on the top are pickled pork skin! Not kidding...."}
{"text":"Best place to get Aguas Frescas, and Ice Cream. Place super clean, and the staff very friendly. This is our go to place when we need to satisfy our sweet tooth."}

{"text":"Everything is fresh, home made and delicious. Also, super affordable! There's a young lady that works there and she is the sweetest!! Wish I had her name, but she was super patient, communicated with my husband (who speaks only English) very well. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Cali, and in Cali you could get a raspado on almost every corner. Over here in vegas this is the first place we tried to get a taste of good ol Mexican sweets like back home and we were not disappointed. The auga frescas are all amazing and the staff was delightful and kind! Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The Chamango is my favorite! The customer service is great. You can try all their flavors and it is always soo clean!"}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream. We'll definitely be back. Great service from the young girl behind the counter. I highly recommended this place to my friends Spanish speaking or not. Plus they have corn!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing.

The flavors are PHENOMENAL. 
Coconut has fresh coconut shreds in it.
Pistachio has fine chopped Pistachios.
Coffee...real coffee deliciousness taste.
Eggnog is sooooooo good.
Triple chocolate chip has white chips, milk chocolate chips and butterscotch.

{"text":"This authentic paleteria/ice cream vendor shop is a HUGE deal and popular with the Latino community, celebrities and even Hillary Clinton! So popular the family business has grown to 7 locations, with now one here in Henderson! Corner of Whitney Ranch / Russell, it's been open since February 2016

Here's a quick rundown

-Both milk and water based ice creams, along with paletas (ice pops with real fruit), agua frescas are all scratch made.  All natural ingredients, none of the mixes or powder packs. Tried and true family recipes.

-Popular: Gansitos (reminiscent of strawberry jelly roll snack cakes) 
-Personal Fave: Rose Petals (floral note is prominent) 
-Unique: Cheese ...yeah, cheese! Cheese and fruits Cheese and corn etc.
-Healthy: Dragon Fruit (non dairy, naturally sweet)
-Price: Pretty affordable. I dont think I spent more than $10 here yet.
~Must try: everything!  Awesome and friendly staff encouraged me to sample everything. 

The shop is well lit AND clean. Better record with SNHD than places over on Spring Mountain, just sayin.

The downside, space is small, only limited to have tables outside, but their shop is packed and stocked with all kinds of snacks and desserts popular in Mexico. Plenty of parking though! 

Service is welcoming and friendly.  Even with a language barrier (mostly Spanish speaking), communication was not a problem.

Can't believe that this place has been here almost a year and I missed it! Ahh! Adding both LA Flor De Michoacan Ice Cream shops to my list of local  and family run places to patronize. Especially for Dragon Fruit and Rose Petals ice cream!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! So many different yummy flavors.. cherry is my favorite so far! Def coming back"}
{"text":"love this place! ice cream of all manners -salty, fruity, tangy! aquas frescas, fresh fruit mixes! A MUST !"}
{"text":"They have the best flavors. There's a lot to choose from too. My favorite is the Guava mix and chilli mango. Oh, and how could I forget...the Chamango!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy very authentic so many flavors to choose from made me happy since there isn't a lot of good Mexican places around here I got the crepes and I got a tamale for later both very tasty and the price was great my new go to spot for ice cream and desserts in Vegas"}
{"text":"Finally an authentic Mexican dessert place near home! After moving here it was one of the things i missed about LA but now I'm all set!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for elote since I moved to vegas a year ago (admittedly not very hard since this place is right next to my house). But I was disappointed by some places not having it. Finally got some herBut I also sampled some of their pineapple/tajin and cucumber/lime/chile ice creams and my world has been turned upside down it was SO GOOD. I will literally update this review tomorrow because I am going back every day now"}
{"text":"Being from L.A. I am so happy to have found this place. Finally, a place I can get all the delicious treats I grew up with in L.A. Everyone there is super friendly and helpful. You can ask for samples on the different ice creams if you can't make up your mind. They have a wide selection of everything from elotes to chamango. The only problem you will have  coming here to picking the one item you want because I can't just pick one, I want everything. Everything is freshly made and tastes great!"}
{"text":"I always get the cheesecake ice cream, I love it here. They have plenty of varieties of flavors of ice cream etc. everything is made from scratch here. And everything taste amazing. I love their chamoy apples as well omgggggg it's delicious! The staff is very friendly too."}
{"text":"Mexican style ice cream place for great prices. Glad to hear they are opening  one closer to where I live."}
{"text":"None of the ice cream flavors were labeled. I asked for a churro and the girl asked \"what do you mean\"?  When I explained what a churro was she said \"oh yes it will be a 20 minute wait\".  When we asked what paleta flavors they had (none were labeled) she went on to tell us and one of them was \"a different kind of cherry\". When I asked what that was she had no idea. I was looking forward to this place but it was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend and I went to check this place out because we're new to the area and the second we walked in.. it was hot. Like hotter than outside.. maybe the AC wasn't on at the time but it was super uncomfortable.
No body acknowledged us when we walked in either.. so, we left."}
{"text":"So much selection to choose from. All the ice cream is homemade! Just had the coconut and Mexican chocolate  will be coming back!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMMYY!! They have some great flavors and they are creamy and delicious. Great prices and lots of options besides just their ice cream. Be daring you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Why am I just now discovering La Flor de Michoacan? It may be both a good thing and a bad thing that this place is so close to home!

It was my family's first time visiting and the staff was very welcoming and helpful when it came to choosing what to order. The employee encouraged us to sample the sorbets and ice cream, but I had my mind set on the Chamango. I think the best part about La Flor de Michoacan is that everything is made from scratch with fresh ingredients! It's rare to find ice cream shops that make their own flavors from scratch, so this really stood out to me. Another thing that really impressed me was the cleanliness of the shop. This establishment is extremely clean and well kept. It's very organized and it's easy to tell that they take pride in their work!

The Chamango was absolutely amazing and tasted just as I had imagined. Sweet and spicy all in one! It was extremely refreshing, especially after spending the afternoon in the sun. My sister enjoyed the Chamango so much that she came back the following day to get another one!

I'm so happy to have found a place that offers authentic Mexican desserts. We'll definitely be back for more! The agua fresca selection looks great and the elote is definitely calling my name!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great desserts. Great service. A++ so glad they opened a location on eastern. Agua Frescas are to die for!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was super impressed! I will say I did not like the Chamango, too spicy and not sweet enough. However...the quality of the products is too notch. Everything is clearly made in house!!!!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream flavors around. The Chamango is amazing! I get it with some guava ice cream. They have a ton of flavors and lots of other snack options too."}
{"text":"I always go to this place whenever I have a craving for biónico, Aqua fresca, or some chamango! Their ice cream is good as well."}
{"text":"Very good selection and very good tasting, only issue I have is the ice cream case is not labeled so you have ask what each flavor is."}
{"text":"Simple shop but amazing ice cream!! Chamango with mango and pineapple sorbet is my go to. There was like 8 of us for under $25....will be back every trip."}
{"text":"Amazing selection wonderful customer service. The ice cream is absolutely delicious and creamy! All of the Mexican sweets and specialties are authentic and to die for! I come here so much and when I do I can never decide!!"}
{"text":"Always so good and unique!! Prefer it over any other I've cream. Service is also friendly and quick. Needs more sears though."}
{"text":"I am so happy to find this place so close to home! So many delicious and exotic flavors to choose from. It is well maintained and clean. There were several customers but the service was quick and courteous! Chamango!!! delish! Perhaps  a little too much salt, but still enjoyed it. Going back to taste the Rose Petals next!"}
{"text":"Oh my god yes. Best ice cream, horchatas, sorbets, you name it. Even melted corn with butter, cheese and pepper. It's all amazing!

Super affordable prices, very kind staff, and plenty of options to choose from.

Makes baskin robins look like a joke in comparison!

Just make sure to go when it's not too busy or you may be waiting for a while. Heads up. Otherwise enjoy because it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Elote and chamango!!! When I have my Mexican street food cravings this is the spot to be!! I have to hold myself back from going every day.  My kids also love their array of ice cream selections!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! I was driving looking for a new place to try and see ICE CREAM on the sign so I pulled in. Close to the 95 near Whitney ranch this place is a gem. They have all kinds of ice cream and desserts even popsicles. I tried the guava and the pina colada WOW. I needed them both on a cone. Check this place out for some truly taste bud popping dessert."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so clean and they have everything at reasonable prices i love the chamango the corn and the aguas de fresa y mamey its everything i was looking for a place like this for 2 years didn't know i had one in my back yard lol love it !!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best I cream shop in Henderson...family owned and they have great service...not to mention they can help you with your elote craving"}
{"text":"Have been looking for Mexican antojitos in Henderson and finally a place has opened up!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this family owned ice cream shop. Tons of different flavors! The woman working was super patient as she listed off every single flavor for us and then let us sample a bunch. She also told us that they make all the ice cream there!

Definitely will be coming back to try more of the flavors."}
{"text":"Soo many selections of ice cream! they had a green apple and chamoy, looking forward to that one! they have alot of the typical hispanic \"churcheria\" \"junk food\". the only thing is there is no where to sit and stay and eat, there is some seating outside but the place inside is rather small."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican ice cream shop that I've been to in Vegas! The menu has endless, delicious items and the staff is very friendly. The place is also very clean."}
{"text":"The real deal holy field 

Delicious, nutritious absolutely hands down best in las Vegas!!!!
Love how clean and organize this place is. 
My go to spot from now on. Puts zero degrees to shame compared to their mangoneada!
Can't wait to come back for more goodies."}
{"text":"Everything looked delicious, but I went with the pineapple and tajin ice cream. It was delicious!! Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Tasty ice cream that's said to be homemade.  
Nice fresh squeezed juices and smoothies. 
Plus some new style street foods found in Mexico. 
From Doritos Loco's to Corn on a stick or cup etc etc. 

The location in Henderson on Whitney Ranch dr 
the only one I've been to but from what I can see this place is very clean,good customer service (besides the young girl that helped last week) the young man is a
super nice and offers any sample! They have a ton of options!! 

TRY La Flor de Michoacan ice cream."}
{"text":"I'm sure this amazing place has not blown up yet due to the lack of menu photos. So here they are! 

This is a must try for the following reasons:

-One of the few mom and pop (food) stores in this area. So go out and support local business!
-Menu is immensely robust. Where else can you get 50+ flavor options in one place?
-They let you sample a lot of the items. I'm pretty sure I tried 10+ flavors last time and all they did was explain the menu and meet every request with a genuine smile.
-They have more than frozen items. Elotes! Choco-flan! Crepes! And more!
-Reasonable pricing. Got 2 elotes, choco-flan, 2 agua frescas (strawberry and melon), and pineapple ice cream for only $16.

Seriously though, there really isn't many choices on this side of town to satisfy your sweet tooth, but that doesn't mean this place wins by default. I would even go as far to say that you should make a special trip to try all of their interesting flavors.

Try it out!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here to try the eloté...I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical but this place is baaaanngggin'. They even have chamango, shaved ice, and ice cream. Definitely try it out on a warm day with your family and friends, or even alone! They're super friendly and the store is so cute!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, everything's soo good I've tried almost every single item on the menu, never disappointed, the staff is a 5 star, always friendly, so helpful and they keep the place super clean."}
{"text":"Errrrthang hella good af. Homemade popsicles and ice cream. Hella conveniently located right next to a lil mariscos spot that has iiiiite ceviche."}
