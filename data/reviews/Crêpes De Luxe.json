{"text":"I was shocked when I came here to write a review and saw all of the negativity surrounding the customer service. I had a very different experience! Yes the line was long. Yes there was some confusion as to whether people were in line for coffee or crepes. But that aside, the crepe I ordered was delicious and the gentleman working the counter was quite pleasant!  After some deliberation (because let's face it, everything they serve looks amazing), I ordered their special \"Sweet Crepe\" not usually on the menu, containing lemon chèvre, strawberries, and honey. I was not disappointed! The crepe came out toasty and delicious, with the sweet cheese melting into every little crepe crevice. And coming from Columbus where crepes like this usually cost a pretty penny, I thought $5 was a steal.  The line was a little long, but I did come on a Saturday. Expect to wait around 30 minutes; the crepes are worth it though!"}
{"text":"I CALL THESE GUYS THE \"CREPE NAZIS\"...because even though the crepes are delicious and worth the wait in line, their customer service is thumbs down.  On the day that I was there, my son asked a question and the answer was cold as ice...if you're looking for a feel-good experience from a smiling crepe maker, go somewhere else.  There is no courtesy or customer service, however, since we waited in line for over 30 minutes, they're not hurting for business and maybe the don't have to be friendly, I don't know, judge for yourself."}
{"text":"I had the Florence (egg, spinach, gruyere) and it was delicious!  I liked the fact that they were using freshly ground pepper and (what seemed to be) pink rock salt. I'm not too fond of sweet crepes but I would like to try one from this place next time."}
{"text":"The Florence makes an exquisite breakfast.  Add salt, pepper and sriracha. Get there early and be prepared to wait a bit, but the payoff is always worth it.  If you hit the line just right you have a 5 minute wait while the craftsmen make your crepe.  During busy hours, expect to wait 30 to 40 minutes, but it is still worth it!!!  A unique experience in Cleveland.  I live nearby and stop as often as I can for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip to the Westside Market,  it was a beautiful but busy Saturday morning.   Lines were long but everyone was patient and the food was worth the wait.   We ordered 3 different savory crepes and they were all superb.   The complete did have some leakage issues but other than being messy it was still very good."}
{"text":"The crepes here are FABULOUS!!! we got here just before the line got too crazy but I still would've waited."}
{"text":"Slow process, not worth the 20 min wait. I recommend only if there is no line or just a short one. The lady making the food did not do a good job. Very complacent. My impression is that she worked there for a while or perhaps may even run the establishment but her heart was definitely not in it. She messed up our order as well."}
{"text":"This is usually a great place to eat but when I went today my crepe was burnt, and I found a fly in it. The service is always subpar but this took me over the edge."}
{"text":"Savory crepe was delicious. Sweet crepe was overmixed and tough like a quesadilla. Such a shame because the attitude was authentically French but the food was not. I would not recommend waiting 45 minutes like we did."}
{"text":"I was here Saturday morning at 8 am and as usual the wait is so long.  I actually don't mind waiting my turn but I just want to say the guy that makes the crepes is a jerk!  He stands there all day pouring the batter on the griddle with a stupid face and wore a stupid hat and he is extremely rude.  Maybe I would hate my job too if I had to do that all day but I would not be as rude as he is.  This is my third time back and even though I love these crepes, I am not sure I am going back.  Hey crepe maker . . . get a real job or put a smile on your face because you are hurting business.   I hope you are not the owner of this business.  If you are the owner then have you ever heard of customer service? If you are not the owner then someone needs to fire you.  And if I do come back then I will make sure  my husband comes and tells you in person that you are a jerk!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pear dessert crepe listed on the menu.  YUK!  The rock hard pear was put put in the crepe unpeeled.   Two bites and thew the mess out. YUK!"}
{"text":"Very slow customer service. The lady wasn't the most pleasant person. With the line , you can tell such a high demand however very slow in getting crepe. You ll need 45-50 min to get your crepe"}
{"text":"Finally bit the bullet and got in line for the crepes.  I've been to the market countless times and always pass it by because I don't want to wait in line (same for the gyros).  I purposely didn't check the time because I didn't want to know how long it would take, but the line moved pretty slowly.  All I could think the whole time was how much the coffee place next door must hate them because I heard so many people say \"wow look at the line for coffee!\" and keep walking, which I myself did several times before I realized the line was for crepes only.  I don't know if the crepe people have much control over the layout of their stand, but I would think they should consider swapping where the prep area and cook areas are if they can.  It would make ordering a lot easier, and probably faster since the guy taking orders wouldn't be shouting over 10 people \"who's next?  what did you say?!\" repeatedly, because as it's currently set up he's trying to take orders while standing about as far away as possible from the person who is next up to give their order.  Anyway, the crepes themselves were really good, and I enjoyed watching them make them.  They were a good value for $6-7.  I got the Florence for myself (spinach, egg, gruyere), and a peanut butter and banana for my son.  I ended up eating most of his, and actually liked it better than my own.    Without a line, I'd definitely be back.  With the line, probably not."}
{"text":"I stopped in today, a Monday and barley the clientele they are use to like they would be on a Saturday when the market is open. However, there were a group of people in line. I waited behind a couple people waiting for food and 2 people who still needed to order. During peak hours they have you stand to the right to order (closest to the coffee stand) and pay/pick up food towards the right. As it was close to being my turn another patron walked over to the way left of me looking at the menu, the people in front of me got their food and left it was now just myself and the woman that walked up to read the menu. The patron said \"my turn!\" and the middle aged blonde woman working ended up taking her order not acknowledging me standing, now directly at her counter until I started walking away. Their crepes are delicious but unfortunately the service is just terrible. I rather have the moody bearded guy, he may not make small talk with you but he at least acknowledges everyone."}
{"text":"Despite the line and somewhat awkward location within the market, this was a great choice. The Classic (banana, whipped cream, and nutella) was very tasty, although maybe 1.5 bananas would have been better as the size of the crepe is quite large. The Florence (egg, spinach, gruyere), was awesome, watching the egg cook in front of you was also cool. I was very impressed with the efficiency of the crepe production, despite the number of employees and the space of the cooking space. Also, the quality of the crepe itself is commendable- good texture, thickness and taste."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff.  Super rude.  My friend behind me didn't even order after she saw how rude they are.  Plus the crepe was so bad I threw it out.  I won't ever waste my time or money here."}
{"text":"I haven't tried any of the dessert crepes, and I'll save that last star until I do, until now, the focus is on the savory crepes which have been very good.  First time I went I hade a ham, gruyere, and basil crepe, and to this day its one of my favorite go-to flavor combinations for a \"what do i want to have for lunch today?\" kind of day. savory ham, excellently pungent gruyere, and crushed whole leaf basil.  Second time was flank steak and swiss, which was a bit less stellar.  The service is usually good, but theres occasionally a point where the crepes are cooking and there really just isn't anything for the guy to do despite having two hot plates running, so its a bit of a built in handicap which makes the lines a bit of a wait occasionally."}
{"text":"great crepe selection and a great menu..staff looks a bit overwhelmed because it's busy.. fresh crepes and a must try..worth the wait and will be back soon.."}
{"text":"Pretty good savory crepe.  Service was quick and easy.  I ordered the maple glazed apple with walnuts.  I really liked it.  They are open to suggestions as they make it if you want a little more on the crepe.  Now I went at 4 pm so there were only 2 other people which might have helped in my service.  Decent deal and I would stop back here and try another crepe in time."}
{"text":"Best crepe I've had.  This was a good way to be welcomed to Cleveland - visiting this stand inside the West Side Market.  Originally, I thought it was a sit down restaurant, but it wasn't an issue.   Service was quick. It's fun to watch them make your crepe. I recommend the chicken bacon ranch!"}
{"text":"I have heard amazing things about this place and I had my order already in my head before I even walked into the market.  I was going to order a sweet crepe with marscapone and apples and caramel. It was going to be amazing I just knew it. But then we went very early in the morning and since I have been trying to be a better eater (yeah I know, I know, West Side Market is NOT the place to give up eating sweets ha ha ha) Anyway I was very good and even offered to share one with my husband.  He agreed to and we opted for the Complete.  It has egg, ham and Gruyere cheese.  It is simple and savory and i found it as amazing as everyone had said they would be.  What I really was surprised by was how filling it was.  My husband - who is a big eater and myself both were full after eating it. And for only $6. My day of eating fun new things was under way with a huge gold star!  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because they did not offer any napkins and the paper cone type holder leaks -- and I ended up with grease on one of my favorite blouses. That kinda sucked having a spot on my shirt for the rest of the day but next time I'll know to be extra careful and make sure I grab napkins because there is certainly no way I cannot stop here again!  Next time Sweet crepe...next time!"}
{"text":"I went to the West Side Market stood patiently in line got a cold unfriendly feeling from the staff then the crepes were poured and their seemed to be words exchanged with the coffee place next door about the music they were playing so the crepe worker climbed up on a step stool and fiddled with the stereo for a good 3-4 minutes while our crepes were turning to stone on the griddle, and mind you there must have been at least 8-10 people in this line yet to be waited on. She then proceeded to continue to prepare the brittle WAY OVER DONE crepe as if nothing were wrong with it and serve it to me. I could not believe it. She must have known it was beyond repair as she had trouble even getting it to fold to put it in its wrapper. Such rude unprofessionalism should not be tolerated but the owners. The crepes aren't cheap and I really should have not accepted it but I had already paid and tipped and I didn't want to hold up the line any longer than it had already been held up. As predicted it was brittle and awful. Needless to say I will NEVER spend my hard earned money or my time here again. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Crepes de Luxe consistently knocks it out of the park.  To me the savory crepes taste just like the ones of Paris food carts.   The line is ridiculously divided yes - however I get the wait time is because each is cooked fresh.    Now as for the \"rudeness\" really I think it's just to keep the line moving! I mean think about it if you are talking on ur phone during the wait fine but at the top of the counter, at Mecca, IN the end zone just order - you aren't supposed to make the chef your new best friend!   Honestly the King, the lemon, the dark chocolate strawberry or the Nutella & banana are all fabulous.  Savory wise I've only had one and it was ok just not as good as the sweets to me.   I start every market day waiting in this line - I know they are worth it -- and to me that's all that matters."}
{"text":"After waiting in line for almost an hour,  the woman behind the counter ignores my 12 yr old who is clearly standing there waiting to order with money in her hand, and rudely yells at me to \"get off my phone and order\". I point out that she ignored these person trying to order .. not even an apology for rudeness.   We travel to Cleveland every year for the summer and west side market is one of our face places to visit and shop will definitely not be getting any return business from me. Worst customer service period.  They are only getting a 1 star since Yelp requires I select at least 1"}
{"text":"Not worthy at all! I waited more than 30 minutes in line, the service is veeeery bad, the whole crew doesn't know how to treat their customers. The crêpe is good and not that expensive but the trade-off wasn't good to me!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes!! I tried the savory Montreal crepe with beef brisket and swiss cheese. The brisket was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The portion size was also generous for only $6! Best yet, Crepe De Luxe is very efficient with take orders and making crepes, so the line moves fairly quickly :)"}
{"text":"On a Saturday at 8am there was about a 20minute wait. Did not expect that. Then the crepe was just ok. I got a La Chevre and friends got the salmon and the florentine and all thought they didn't mix expectations. The problem was not enough filling, mostly just the crepe."}
{"text":"West side market has the whole world within it.   This place is small and is always busy when I walk by or am in line. It's a bit of a wait since they can only make so many at once, but they do work as quick as they can. Service is decent, they are pretty short wit customers since it's unlikely they'll see them again and they are busy with getting orders/making orders. Fresh material is used, you can watch as they make it in front of you.   Personally I believe that the price set in place is decent, it's a big piece of crepe that they're making from scratch. They have to make profit somehow.   Anyway, this is most definitely my sweet little treat that I indulge in every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is unfriendly because the owner doesn't ask the \"chef\" to nicely interact with customers unless he feels like it or has time to do so.  He says the \"chef's\" job in a traditional restaurant is to make quality food.  Horrible attitude and won't go back there."}
{"text":"I love that the crepes my husband and I enjoyed were made fresh, and that the ingredients were fresh as well. The lemon curd in my crepe was bursting with zest and was not too sweet. The strawberries in my husband's crepe were ripe and blended wonderfully with the dark chocolate that he selected.   Only thing I didn't like was the location of this place. People were bumping into us trying to get around, and it seemed chaotic."}
{"text":"I was at the market with my family and had (admittedly, very stupidly) boasted about this place without ever trying it, based solely on the reviews.   We won't ever try \"De Luxe\" again or recommend friends here. The man behind the counter belongs at a bar, not a crepe stand. He was rude, very unfriendly and unhelpful. You would think he could direct some traffic or tell us where to stand as there is no organization whatsoever - with the coffee stand right next door, the merging three-pronged lines facing every direction, and costumers asking, \"I'm sorry, you're in line? For coffee or crepes?\" I didn't realize there was a difference! He doesn't even look up to register customers as they stop by, and barely acknowledges your order with a grunt. Doesn't thank you for your business. Doesn't tell you how long it's going to be. Doesn't answer questions without an annoyed tilt in his voice. How do people keep coming back?   In addition, he has one burly hand ungloved to accept dirty cash, then quickly swats his fingers together with alcohol to 'sanitize.' Before medical school, I worked in the food service industry - and I can tell you, with experience from BOTH places, that this is not an effective sanitation method if you're dealing with filthy cash and fresh fruit.   Poor, questionable service aside, I was excited for the crepes, and I'm forced to pose the question: what is all this fuss! There is nothing exciting or experimental about the menu. \"De Luxe\" serves run-of-the-mill nutella & banana variations. Our bananas were not ripe despite the stand's (literal) two-minute distance from fresh fruit at the market next door. The batter, once cooked, reeked of eggs.  I've had better. MUCH, much better, both in terms of service and product. Maybe the guy was off his game. Maybe I just have higher standards for a simple dish. Maybe I shouldn't be comparing New York or Beirut to Cleveland. Frankly, if this place wasn't in Cleveland, - where it is the only place to get 'good crepes' within a fifteen mile radius - I doubt it'd still be in business.   Never again."}
{"text":"Walking through the west side market we notice a long line in front a stand so we decided to see what the line was for. Well everyone was in line for crepes. The stand is called Crepes De Luxe and they specialize in Parisian style street crepes. They have a nice selection of sweet and savory crepes from The King (banana, peanut butter and chocolate) to the les Maritimes (salmon, spinach, capers and creme fraiche). We decided to try the Monkey (banana, nutella and powdered sugar). And the Goat (goat cheese, spinach and tomato).  They were both delicious! I would say they are worth the twenty minute wait."}
{"text":"Had smoked salmon savory crepe here. It was really plain, lack of ingredients, and not really worth the 30 minutes wait. Line was moving very slowly that's why it took so long. I unfortunately would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Why oh why didn't I look at Yelp before coming here. Perhaps because the smell off freshly made crepes was enticing. We stood on a fairly long line with a gal, bun in hair, ring through nose and a nasty attitude. Not ,\"may I help the next person?\", but what do you want and move down. Doughy tasteless crepe with green bananas. You can't mess up nutella so that saved it. She put the topping two inches away from edge so you just had one mouthful of dough after the other. No and No save yourself the trouble and go get something tasty from a bakery."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Crêpes De Luxe, I was intent on giving it a bad review.   Sure! The crepe I received then was just as delicious as the one I recently got, Nutella, strawberries, and bananas on a fresh warm crepe.   But that attitude was a killer. The men behind the counter seemed angry and cold, with a nasty look on their faces that I would dare come to their stand in the West Side Market on a busy day! It was worse than the Soup Nazi- at least he had an established set of rules to follow.   But in a way, they were right. I did sort of ask for that treatment. On my recent trip, someone in their earlier twenties took care of me on a fairly steady Wednesday morning and his demeanor was much more engaging. He was even patient enough to serve the six middle school girls on a field trip with a smile.   It's my best advice for hitting up Crêpes De Luxe. Try to avoid going when everyone is at the market. The crepes will always be delicious, but they taste a little better with great service."}
{"text":"Things to do while in the long line: update your linked-in profile, check e-mails, check in to yelp of course, and so on until you've exhausted all manner of social networks, you finally arrive at the end of the line and wait as crepe goodness is created.  Finally, you end up with crepe in hand nestled on a cardboard box that can enable you to it eat this large thing as if it was an ice cream on a cone. On first bite, the texture of the pancake is warm, soft and nutty, although firm enough to hold the thing together, definitely not paper thin. All worth the wait.  Most people head up to the mezzanine to finish off this thing that could fill you up enough to qualitfy as lunch. I'd recommend sharing, but the only downside is that it is very hard to do so unless one had a place to sit.  Overall, very delicious and another legendary food item to try in the famed westside market."}
{"text":"The crepe was pretty good, a little expensive but good, the customer service was awful though, the lady behind the counter seemed annoyed and was quite rude."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, one time getting a ham & swiss crepe and the other a strawberry, banana, & nutella. Both were EXCELLENT! You can't go wrong with your choice, it just depends on your mood. It's pretty cool standing right there and seeing your crepe being made too!"}
{"text":"The Crepe deserves 10 stars - it's as good as street crepes in Paris. It's the only one in North America which is.  The service deserves minus 10. They're about as joyous as Thom Yorke Radiohead trapped in a Medieval Torture Device during a family bereavement.  \"Crepes\" by Radiohead  When you were here before The servers wouldn't look you in the eye They don't act like angels And they make you cry They ruffle your feathers They live in a gloomy world They think they're so special They're so f***ing special  But they have crepes! And you're a weirdo! That's why you keep coming here! Even though they treat you wrong here  I sang that out loud last time I was here. You should have seen the dirty Luxe I got.  I'm giving them a 5 star rating despite them having the worst service - perhaps that I've ever experienced. And if you have a problem with that, I don't give a crepe.  It's one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but it's also the best crepe in North America, so I'm giving it a 5 when they deserve a huge 0 (a zero, not an O, no way) for the enormity of their attitude problems.  What to get: Crepe with sugar and lemon. That's it. Nothing fancy. Trust me bae. What not to get: Angry when they treat you like a pile of horse sh**.  These kind of Luxe might not be for Lorde, but they're absolutely for me. I'd say (and there is some decent competition in Philly and Indy among other places) that this is the best Crepe I've had in the USA. It's the most similar to France. Shame about the sh** service though.  What a contradiction. We're talking about probably the best crepe and found in North America. I would know. I love this sh**. I go to France for this sh**. I know which alley in Paris the very best and most moist (moistmost) can be found in. I am the sh** when it comes to knowing sh** about which crepes are the sh**. Most Americans (I'm British, and we like talking sh**) grow up on sh** bland sh** crepes so they wouldn't know the sh**ting difference, would they? Like sh** they would.  So these are the most authentic and traditional and true to the style of France. I think whoever started making these must have visited France a good number of times because this is almost the way they taste on the streets of Paris. Get it with nothing but sugar and lemon. That's the French way. In addition to being hairy and thin and making out a lot. With more than church tongue.  On the other hand, we're talking about some of the worst service imaginable. I mean I've had so many bad service experiences here I don't even want to go into most of them. I can think of 5. I'll just tell you about one.  Most recently I stood in line for about 10 minutes - about 5 minutes before closing - and they refused to give me a crepe. They weren't remotely nice or apologetic. I explained I was only in town from Buffalo once every 6 months, and that I'd just stood in line for 10 min, and there were still 5 mins to go. And they were passively aggressively complaining about people being in their line close to closing time and saying things like (loudly) such as \"I hope those people don't think they're actually going to get served\" and \"don't you just love when people feel entitled to get served after we're closed.\"  It wasn't just one or two comments. They were loudly giving sarcastic crap to their customers (particularly me) for a good few minutes, all the way not actually telling me directly, sorry, we're closed, come back tomorrow. They waited until the clock had ticked to closing time for that. Hmm, how convenient.  I've written what, 5,000 reviews? Near enough. I don't think I've ever been served by people quite this rude. And consistently so. It's definitely in my 5 most offensive and ugly customer service experiences.  So They get -5 stars for massive customer service problems and horrendous attitudes and treating their customers like sh**.  On the other hand I'm basing my actual rating only on the taste of the wonderful Crepes so it gets 5 Stars although I do so with a heavy heart because they are absolutely awful to their customers particularly me but it's happened so often that it probably happens to others too and I bet they'd have way better ratings if they were even remotely nice or fair to the people paying for their products run on sentences ftw amirite.  Anyway if you read this far, thanks for giving a crepe."}
{"text":"Why only one person working on a Saturday? Came down early afternoon to avoid the morning crowd but waited 45 minutes because I drove all the way to the market and survived the parking lot."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to do on a Saturday morning in Cleveland is to go to the West Side Market, get a crepe, and sit up on the balcony and people watch.  It's heaven for me and 95% of that bliss comes from the crepe.  I'm a savory gal all the way, so i can only speak for those but no matter your toppings, they're all delicious so order whatever you have a taste for!  I think they are very filling and pretty inexpensive.  If you need proof on how good these are, just go look at the line at their stand.  By 10am, people are waiting a half hour plus just for one.  But it is well worth it.  And props to the guys in the stand.  They work hard and do a great job."}
{"text":"Like all of the other reviews states, the crepes are good but the service is horrid!! Expect to wait a while because everything is made to order. I do appreciate this, but there is no sense of urgency in the staff. The bald dude making the Crêpes was working soooo slow taking his good ole time. He was mumbling under his breath and rolling his eyes every 5 seconds. It was 9am, how could you be THAT miserable THAT early in the morning??? I love crepes, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Not until the staff gets an attitude adjustment anyways."}
{"text":"Jan 2017 Update:  This place continues to impress.  The food is always good, and the worst thing I can say is that they run out of stuff - when I inquired about this, they said they only buy items from certain purveyors (specifically, they will only buy beef brisket from one other stand).  Seems indicative of good quality control.  And their hygiene is outstanding - I recently saw a customer (who appeared to be a West SIde Market employee, making this especially gross) throw her food order back onto their skillet because she was annoyed that she didn't receive a discount.  They thew away the offending item and then tore down, cleaned, and reheated that skillet even though it took an extra few minutes on a busy day.  Great job.  For those people that complain about the long lines and customer service, this is a kiosk in a bustling city market!!!  If you don't want to wait in the line, then skip it.  The stand is very obviously meant to function, and not meant to replace the experience of a sit down venue with a doting waiter.   Previous review from Aug 2015:  The crepes are always amazing, although the line is quite long during busy times.  Just calm down and wait for the goodness!"}
{"text":"Crêpes De Luxe is located in West Side Market and I decided to try it out for lunch. I split a make your own crepe with my mom; we ordered chicken, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms. It took about 5 minutes for our food around 1:30pm, so service was quick. The crepe was humongous and just the right amount. I would have liked there to be some sauce on it to add more flavor, but it was still good; the chicken cubes were kind of big. It's a little expensive to make your own because the base is $4 and each topping is an extra $1 and protein is $1.50. The pre-fixe crepes are about $8 which is probably the better deal. Service was alright."}
{"text":"quality crepes, but served in bulky plastic boxes.   If you're going to serve something french or japanese street style, just wrap that thing in a paper cone and let your customers go to town!"}
{"text":"I tried this because it had such a good review on Yelp. Found it otherwise. Maybe I ordered the wrong crepes, but am really not impressed!"}
{"text":"Once you're inside the West Side Market, I know how it can be if you don't have a game plan. You have long lines, big decisions to make with vendors, and a need to shop with purpose before the lines get longer. So where do you go first? Let me make it easy: Crêpes De Luxe.  I hear people get a little salty that the staff doesn't always come off as sunshine and rainbows. Um, hi! These saints are making hundreds of crepes per day and taking ultra picky requests from visitors, all while shouting over loud noises and trying to provide fast service.  I'm normally not a fan of savory crepes, but both the savory and sweet options are superb. The Le Roi (bananas, peanut butter and chocolate) and the Florence (spinach, egg and gruyere cheese) are my favorite odd combo to get together. I don't normally stick around to eat it (I shop with purpose!), so I get it to-go. While they may not always say it explicitly, you can get a box! Just ask and they'll pack it up for you.  Be advised: there's a line and its a slow process! Every crepe is handmade. You are waiting for quality, and its worth every second for these flavorful crepes. I swear, they are addicting."}
{"text":"Crepe + Nutella + bananas + powdered sugar = LUNCH OF CHAMPIONS."}
{"text":"Crepe was really nice. It was nice and thin. I had the Nutella and strawberry. The only downside was the service...was really slow. The crepes could of had a bit more flavour."}
{"text":"There's nothing finer than a dessert crepe when you're looking for something sweet. While the pre-made options are incredible (I'm looking at you, Pears Caramel) my personal favorite is a make-your-own crepe with bananas, nutella, and marscapone. Wow.  Haven't tried one of their savory crepes yet but they all look delicious. If you're at the West Side Market you absolutely should stop in for a crepe. Cash only unless you spend $10."}
{"text":"Located in the Westside Market. (One of the cleve's most wonderful spots.)Ohhhhh.  Yummmmmmm.  The crepes are divine.  Delicate dessert crepes, buckwheat crepes for the savory entree crepes.  But is it enough?  Noooooooope.  Now comes the \"Liege Waffle\".  A type of street food waffle, dense, filling, not at all like a belgian waffle.  This bit of heaven has coarse sugar in the dough that melts into little molten rivers of sweetness in the dough.  Sweet Baby Jesus.  It's stuff like this that makes Cleveland winters tolerable.  Eat waffles.  They rock."}
{"text":"Yep, these are yummy. One of my market traditions. Authentic crepes here, people. Savory and sweet, both delish! They use really high quality ingredients and are very reasonably priced. It's a must-stop for us whenever we're at WSM. Nothing better than getting a hot, delicious crepe to accompany you as you walk around the market.  Get one next time you're at WSM."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't given this place a chance before. Now I'm kicking myself for all the crepe goodness I've missed out on over the years of shopping at the westside market. The Nutella and banana crepe was one of the best I've ever had. I will have to add this to my lunch/breakfast rotation when I'm There (this currently includes noodle cat, frank's bratwurst, gyros, and veras). Even watching them make the crepes is in art in itself, brave the like because it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday as we were leaving Cleveland. There was no line and we got our order pretty quick. We ordered the Smoke Salmon crepe and loved it! Too bad we don't live in the area. Otherwise, we would be returning to try items on the menu! Guy was friendly. Love the place!"}
{"text":"These are far from a Paris Street Crêpes  ... call it like it is, it's a Cleveland Pancake that has about .89 cents worth of ingredients but they charge you $8.00 ... Like others have said the Hipsters offer up the worst Service and the bearded ones don't wear gloves or beard nets (pubic crepe) ... I'd skip this place ... I hear Holy Crêpes from Columbus is opening soon inside the market and I hope that's true... more crepe less crap and a lot cheaper!"}
{"text":"Nicely constructed, fun to watch them being made. Lots of variety and creative choices. Makes a great light, yet fulfilling meal that you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"The crepes are very good, but their customer service skills needs a lot of work!  They need to learn how to be friendly to their customers."}
{"text":"Dessert crepes!!!  What more can I say.  I couldn't believe that while walking around aimlessly in Cleveland that I would find my little \"crepe\" of heaven.  They make the crepes while you wait.  You can customize a sweet crepe or a salty crepe.  It's $3 for a just the crepe and $1 for each individual topping you add to it.  I had dark chocolate with strawberries to go for $5.  Oh yum yum yum!  They also have a \"passport\" where if you fill up 6 of either sandwiches, crepes, salads, etc, you get the 7th for free.  What a deal.  I wish we had a crepe place in Indy :("}
{"text":"After the way the \"cook\" spoke to my daughter today I will never be back.  My 13 old tried to snap a picture of her crepe being made.  Big blonde guy behind the counter snapped at her and called her rude.  When I stepped up to see the problem he continued the comments to me.   I don't care what they taste like-- will never stop again."}
{"text":"Had Been wanting to try these crepes for a while, when I finally did last monday I was soo surprised about the rudeness of the cook with the beard!! What a douche!! I mean this guy was so rude from the get go, just out of the blue, with no previous conversation of any kind, I had brought some folks from out of the country to try the crepes and only thing i could imagine that got him angry was that we were speaking another language, the cherry on top was the throwing of the finished crepe on the little metal basket they have without any word, after we got our order, everyone just stayed there for a few seconds just looking at each other in disbelief of how that dude was so rude for nothing. The crepe was good  but come on!! Worst thing is that there were ZERO people in line, so you can't even write it down to being stressed out for being swamped, it was monday around 11 am."}
