{"text":"4 stars  Taste is pretty good, comparable to the average HK style restaurants in Markham, Richmond Hill and Scarborough.  Price is a bit higher than those areas, but probably due to lower competition in the Aurora area(which seems to be increasing slowly)  Will come back to try breakfast menu!  Food Tried: Curry Fish Fillet Rice Chicken Fillet with Red/White Sauce  Service: Friendlier than the average HK style restaurant. No complaints."}
{"text":"I am from Markham and I usually am not a big fan of HK style cafe because of the quality of the food. I was driving by to visit an old friend that has moved to Aurora and saw this restaurant. As I entered the service was 5 star! The lady was super nice. I ordered the curry beef tongue rice. The food was above average then what I have ate anywhere in Canada. Keep up the good!"}
{"text":"overall 3.5 stars  Visited this place today and looks like this place is a HK style restaurant. It looks new and clean so far. Just want to make it clear, my ratings is based only on one dish that I ordered - Mixed Grill on Hot sizzling pan.   Food (4 stars) - As mentioned, ordered the Mixed grill on hot sizzling pan. It include a sausage, pork chop, piece of thin steak, a chicken wing, tomato and broccoli, egg (sunny side up) and choice of rice or pasta. It also included a soup and a drink, which is typical for HK style restaurant. The soup that came with it is ok, but ok because it came with it, but not a big deal as it's included. The meal itself, the pan is sizzling hot, which is good so when the sauces is poured on top, it's start sizzling and smell quite nice. The meat is pretty much what you would expect from other HK style restaurant in Markham/Richmond hill. It's good I'd say.  Price and Portion (3 stars) -  for $18.99 (not including tax) for this dish, the portion is abit small for me and I am not a big eater. If you look at the pic, the sausage is pretty much half the portion of the meat on the dish already and I dont like having too much sausages, so a bit disappointed on the portion based on the price. But maybe other dishes are better in price, lets see what other reviewer thinks.  Location (4 stars) - I think this is probably the first restaurant in the area for these kinds of restaurant so the convenient factor (for me) is a big plus for me.  All in all, it's a restaurant I will definitely go again based on its location and the food quality is good and comparable to other Richmond Hill/Market restaurants as well. I think this restaurant is new but seems their operations are quite smooth already.   Oh, they take credit cards as well, which is a plus for me. Lots of HK style restaurants are cash only. :)  One last note, when I leave the restaurant after dinner (~7pm Sunday night), it's jammed packed so they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"It's the only other Hong Kong style Chinese restaurant in Aurora besides New fusion restaurant. Prior to change in ownership and new name, my wife and I would enjoy the well balanced, delicate flavors of each dish, even if it was on the small side. All of this is gone now as the food is more akin to the rougher, salty flavors of cheap Chinese food.  To keep prices low while offering enough carbs to satisfy consumers, you can definitely tell costs are cut by using cheaper cuts of meat and less meat and veggies per dish. Whether it's fried rice, noodles, or traditional dishes with sauce / meat / rice, you'll likely get big servings of carb with less of everything else.  This place is suited for those who want cheap Chinese food and don't mind lower quality. Nothing wrong with this! It certainly has a place in this town."}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in the area, then the daily question popped up: what's good to eat around here? Our local friends mentioned that there was a HK caf√© in Aurora, and I was rather... shocked. Because: Aurora. So in sticking with our native food, we decided to give this place a try.  New & clean, we all found something on the menu to our liking. The dinner menu included a variety of HK dishes including baked, pan fried & sizzling plates. All dishes come with a soup & HK drink to create a set meal.   On this night, there was one lonely guy working the front, and probably another guy working the back. Slowly but steadily, he managed a house of more than a dozen people, all while maintaining apologies and smiles, so being an understanding customer, I was quite impressed.   Overall, the food was made very well. No one at my table had any complaints. I ordered an ox tongue tomato sauce rice, which I was very nervous about because not many places can make the ox tongue soft and tender. For that reason, I haven't ordered any ox tongue dish in a while, but I thought I would this day, and it came out exactly the way I liked it. Special mention to all the sizzling plates that kept coming out too; the entire table of 8 next to us all ordered them and they looked and smelled amazing. Portions are fair. Again, I was impressed.  The HK milk tea (iced) was maybe one notch sweeter than I liked, so I might ask for less sweet next time, but the flavour's good - its tea-milk ratio is balanced, creating a \"full\" (creamy, not watered down) flavour.   It's a very HK decent establishment in Aurora, I hope they're here to stay until Aurora becomes a fully populated town or city. If I'm ever in Aurora again, I would return :)"}
{"text":"Nice to see authentic Chinese food moving north of Richmond Hill and deeper into York region. This is a small restaurant with a rather small menu: a snack menu and a single page of the main menu.  I stopped in for a quick meal. It started with a choice between a cream corn soup, or a tomato soup. Quite a contrast here. The corn soup was nearly flavorless, but the tomato soup had lots of bold flavor, and chunks of cabbage.   This was followed by an authentic beef brisket on rice dish. Overall, good flavour and a decent portion. There are a couple other items on the menu I want to check out, but I could see myself running out of options quickly.  This restaurant has a great starting point, and if they add to the menu, I'm sure it will become quite popular. The service was good, and overall a great experience. Let's see where it goes from here!"}
{"text":"Finally an HK-styled cafe opened in Aurora!! Marvelous Asian Cuisine replaced what used to be J&S Asian Cuisine (the latter served westernized Chinese food like spring rolls and chicken balls, etc).  Located in the same plaza as Sobeys Extra, TD Bank and Second Cup, this cafe is now one of my go-to dining spots in the neighbourhood.  This place is seriously legit. Food, drinks, and service are very good. I appreciate that the server speaks perfect English...  it really helps the previous western clientele, who used to frequent J&S, to easily transition over.   The price is a tad more than I'm used to but the portion is certainly decent. You definitely get the quantity AND the quality.  Just like any HK- styled cafe, you can get your milk tea fix, popular snacks, and meal combos here - the combo comes with a complimentary bowl of soup (cream or veggie) and a choice of a small drink from a selected few on the beverage menu. You can also add a dollar or 2 for upgrades!  I would recommend the Baked Ox Tongue in Tomato sauce on Rice. If you add $1, you can change the rice to fried rice. I also really enjoyed the Basa Fillet with Gravy on hot sizzling plate! Very tasty and the plate keeps the food hot throughout your meal.  I'll definitely be coming back often to satisfy my Chinese food cravings! I hope you will have more specials and deals coming out. I truly think you guys will do very well. Keep up the great work :)"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of HK cafe as it doesn't offer any healthy food choices but once in a while, I'll stop by for a quick meal at a cheap price.  We dropped in at Marvelous around 1pm in a Saturday and it was packed! This is a small resto that probability seat about 50 people and the traffic is non stop! Rest assure the food comes out quickly and the service is swift with 3 servers making the wait no longer that 15 minutes.     The choices on the menu is abundant, and at really cheap prices.  I ordered the chicken fillet with vermicelli $6.99 and the hubby ordered the baked pork chop $8.99. All entrees are served with a complimentary drink and a soup. I really liked my chicken vermicelli soup, the chicken was very flavourful as it is with the soup.  I was afraid the soup tasted so good because it's loaded with MSG but I wasn't that thirsty after. The texture of the vermicelli was perfect. The hubby didn't like his baked pork chop unfortunately. The meat had a lot of fat and the sauce wasn't the best.   We will still come back tho."}
{"text":"There are now a couple of HK style restaurants in the Aurora area and I had yet to try this one out. My mom and I came on a Sunday night just before 7 PM. It didn't take long before the restaurant filled up with walk ins and a reservation.   We ordered the fried chicken wings and fries and a Portuguese style chicken with rice. The dishes came out fairly quick. I will say it is not the best Portuguese rice I've ever had but it wasn't bad. In regards to the prices they are on the higher side that I'm used to in Richmond Hill but it's understandable since we are not in Richmond Hill.   The couple at the table next to us were having a bit of difficulty deciding on dishes and what was in each item listed on the menu. The server was very patient in explaining what each dish consisted of and tried to discern what the customer would like best.  I'm sure I'll be back another time."}
