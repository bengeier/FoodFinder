{"text":"The food never disappoints the staff are attentive helpful and sincere. Had the pastrami sliders. Decadent!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try somewhere new and chose this place because It seemed to have good food and looked cool. We arrived at the end of lunch/beginning of dinner. Long story short: Really poor service - bar tender was waitress was bartender. Had to ask someone else to go get her a couple times. No water provided or offered. Bread that was promised came with dinner.  Food was so so. - we got short ribs and pork chops. Never told about the special!  Short ribs have creamy sauce which we didn't expect and pork chop sauce was watery.  The restaurant seems confused about the type of restaurant they are- meaning fancy or not. If fancy, I'd expect a lot more!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and fantastic staff.  My favorite is the pasta w/chicken, spinach, and cheese.   We really enjoy the desserts too!  Brownie dessert is awesome!  Love supporting local businesses!  We enjoy dining here often."}
{"text":"Wow...my wife and I had a short window to eat and I have driven by mad jacks so many times in downtown aurora, I picked it.  Could not have been better...we were greeted at the door by a familiar face and taken to a high top in the bar.  Service was right on top of it.  The cocktails had a healthy pour and large enough glasses to actually quench a thirst.  No appetizers today but the table of two ladies next to us got calamari and raved about it...I had a lamb shank special that was unbelievable...fall off the bone tender and juicy with oversized carrots and potatoes in a flavorful broth...my wife go a short rib sandwiche served on a pretzel bun with fantastic homemade relish and great pickles....the atmosphere is cozy and cottage like...very similar to the way Gamekeepers in chagrin was like ten years ago...we were also told of an additional room for parties of 12 or more...what a perfect place this would be for a small party or just a bunch of friends getting together..last but not least...I will quote my wife and agree with her....\"my new favorite restaurant...\""}
{"text":"Driving by and tried it. Flavorful burger and fresh salad with grilled chicken. Good value."}
{"text":"In aurora for a conference with husband. After an afternoon of hiking at cuyahoga valley national park we came to mad jacks for dinner.  Server and hostess were excellent, they even offered to move us when they ended up sitting a large noisy party beside us.  Food was excellent.  Both of us had soup- husband had creamy chicken and I had lobster bisque.  Both seemed homemade and were good and meaty. Husband had jacked up burger and fresh cut fries.  I had steak and arugula salad.  All was prepared well and tasted fantastic! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Patio is great, even though it is in front of the restaurant , you don't realize that you are on a main road . Although it is not a really large menu, something for everyone. Highly recommend the salad with salmon; nicely dressed and the salmon was perfectly grilled. Will be heading back!"}
{"text":"Great food and a cool relaxed atmosphere.  Mad Jacks is a nice mix of restaurant, bar, and patio."}
{"text":"Great cozy atmosphere, pizzas were fantastic and came out extremely fast, nice beer and wine list, service was prompt and friendly.  Definitely check it out if your in Aurora, especially on a nice day and take advantage of the patio."}
{"text":"This place had great tasting food and excellent service. Our waiter jack was great. To top it off the wonderful chef gave us desert for free because we asked our waiter to thank them for us!"}
{"text":"Went in on a whim leaving the Aurora outlets, definitely glad we did. My girlfriend and I had a great time here. The staff was friendly and helpful when trying to decide what to get. The spinach and artichoke dip was very creamy and a perfect match for their in house pita chips. I got the snapper and she got the paprikash, both were delicious. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"So glad we found Mad Jack's on Yelp!  Right up the road but had not been there before.  Even though they were quite busy Saturday evening, the service was still very good.  And the food was plentiful and delicious!  Overall a good night out with friends!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place in Aurora to grab lunch or dinner. Quality and service is consistent. Place is really small and has great character. The outdoor patio is awesome. Drinks are very good and they have a solid beer selection. Their burger is best in town. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Very comfortable and nice setting in a century home. Has beautiful outdoor patio. Food was good not great. Service was excellent. Wish there was a place like this in my town."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Great burger, halibut with strawberry salsa and risotto was amazing. The service, however, was awful. Inattentive to the extreme. Not overly busy, just didn't seem to care about anything but turning the table. Bad enough to think twice about going back. For shame to have that bad of service for that price of a check. Good food, though."}
{"text":"Omg incredible!!!!    Spiced bread pudding is huge and so fresh with bourbon raisins,ice cream, whip cream and fresh strawberries.  The short ribs are truly incredible as well."}
{"text":"John J.   Went with a  party of four on a Saturday evening. Get there early if you don't have a reservation. Cozy dining room in an old white house. All of our food was fantastic. Out server-I regret I don't remember his name-was equally fantastic. Very attentive and patient with us first timers. Try the tater   tots appetizers. Nice beer list also,  as I am not a wine drinker. Only wish I had saved room for dessert. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"My first visit to Mad Jack's was two years ago when in town for a festival.  I was part of a large party and we sat in the \"garage\" separate building dining area.  The staff, food, and atmosphere is/was great.  Our group has made this an annual dinner and or lunch visit every year (year three and still in love!). Our appetizers ranged from House Guacamole, Warm Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Scotch Egg, and Pecan Crusted Goat Cheese.  Entrees ranged from Steak Arugula Salad, Crispy Chicken Marsala, Slow Braised Short Rib, Aged White Cheddar Mac & Cheese, Pan Seared Lake Erie Walleye, Chargrilled Pork Chop, and the special of the day Meatloaf.  Everything was perfect!  Sometimes a large group order(s) can go very wrong and to date, every time I have been to Mad Jack's it is with a party of 12 to 20 and there has never been a mistake.  My only regret?  I have never had room for dessert!  I am going to make sure next year I will order the Spiced Bread Pudding first and worry about what to eat after I have enjoyed the pudding!  Whether you live in the area or visiting make a point to stop in, you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"I was the only person in our group of four that liked this place.  for appetizers, my sister and her boyfriend got the crabmeat over the tater tots. We thought it would be crabmeat over the tater tots. Instead it was potato mush with crabmeat in a coating. They ate two and left the rest sitting there. They tried to pawn the remaining food on my husband and I.  My husband and I got the calamari. It was about the size of two babies fists. We were highly disappointed in the price versus the amount of food that you got. That said, the calamari was good.  My sister and her boyfriend both got sandwiches, the husband got the short ribs, and I got what I believe was the Mad Jack burger.  Neither my sister nor her birth boyfriend liked the sandwiches. I believe after mixing sauces back-and-forth and adding some stuff they ended up eating the entire sandwiches. I believe the biggest complaints is that they didn't like the sauces available for the sandwiches.  And for them, the sandwiches were a bit dry.  My husband's short ribs seem to be a very small portion for the $20 price tag. And he was disappointed that they put green beans on the plate instead of something upscale like asparagus. he did like the short ribs though.  My burger had to be one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life! It was juicy, cooked the way I ordered it, had just the right amount of crunch on it with the toppings, and the sauce was delicious! The bun even added to it! I couldn't have been happier, except it was a little expensive.  I would like to go back someday but I don't think my sister her boyfriend will be willing to join us.  ;)"}
{"text":"While driving on I-80, we decided to skip the fast food places and find a nice local restaurant.  Based on reviews from Yelp and other sites, we selected Mad Jack's Grill & Pub.  It was a 10-minute drive off the freeway, but well worth the trip.  We had a cup of rice and bean soup and half a smoked turkey/applewood bacon sandwich.  That, along with their chips, was actually more than enough for lunch.  And everything was perfectly prepared.  They have so many selections on their menu; even the pickiest eaters will find something they like.  The only reason I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars is that the service was too efficient.  The second my husband finished his meal, the waitress whisked his plate away, while I was still eating.  And she took my plate away just as I picked up the last bite of my sandwich.  She was very friendly but it did make me feel rushed.  Don't hesitate to take a side trip if you're tired of the fast food options on the Interstate.  You will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! They have a nice atmosphere and the waitress was great! I can't wait to go back when it is warmer out and sit on their patio. Everything my group got was extremely tasty. Especially the fried mozzarella!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get.  I started with French Onion Soup.  $6 for the soup and no crock and no cheese over the soup.  Just onions, broth and some marble rye bread tossed in.  Disappointing.  Next was the entree size Goat Cheese Salad with grilled chicken added.  $17 for a salad that was not that large or impressive!!!!  Service was okay but bartender never asked how the food was."}
{"text":"I stopped in after seeing a cute little building, while driving by.  Friendly service, great food.  Try the salmon salad, it is delicious!"}
{"text":"I like local eateries and have have eaten here several times - but no more after two orders of braised short ribs were so tasteless as rendering the beef inedible. The only redeeming element of the dish was the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"The food was great and I love that they offered a new item I have never had out before! Scottish eggs with chorizo breading!!! Wow cool stuff, the service was good, the bartender was a jokester which is ok with us but very friendly! Check it out.... value was average and great for a date night."}
{"text":"Oh, Mad Jack's, thank you for such a refreshing lunch!!  First - this is the white building set back from the road.  There is parking in front, on the side, and on the south side via another lot.   The entrance is next to their patio.    The jalapeno poppers - FRESH peppers with the right amount of cream cheese AND goat cheese (swoon), in a delicious,crumbless batter fried to perfection!  The dill sauce is fantastic paired with these babies and I would go back just for them.    The veggie burger - I can't believe it's not meat!  Am I right?! LOL But really, this is a black bean/pinto bean/barley concoction made in-house that is JUICY and DELICIOUS.  It is seriously the best house-made veggie burger I've had yet.  Messy, but I'll take messy over dry and flavorless.   The pickles, however, are freaking fantastic.  My ONLY suggestion would be to put MORE THAN TWO on this burger and I will ask for more next time.  These are let your tongue smack your lips good and compliment the dill sauce.  I would make even more versions of burger with this amazin' patty!  Add some jalapenos and pickled tomatoes for this girl! :)  The house chips were good but I was full by then, so I'm glad I didn't ask for fries.    The spicy pizza - uh, HUGE.  Very cheesy.  I enjoyed it, it wasn't my favorite pizza ever but tasty as far as pizzas go and my husband raved over it (he should, he ordered it).    The environment is colonial so it was kind of like we were still in Gettysburg but eating fine, fresh food....      So excited for this shiny little gem!"}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted!  My husband and I went to Mad Jack's last night for the first time. It's a cute place.  We were seated and had prompt service.  I took advantage of their happy hour and got a $4 house wine and we got the warm brie appetizer which was half price for happy hour.  The brie came out and not more than a minute later, our entrees did too.  The server was very apologetic which I appreciated but it wasn't the best way to enjoy our appetizer since we were at a small table for two with a bread basket, appetizer plates, our appetizer and now two entrees and drinks so it was a wee bit crowded.  That being said, while the brie and chutney were tasty, the toast to brie/chutney ratio was way off.  We left three pieces of toast on the plate.  My husband had the ribeye special and enjoyed it.  I had the chicken paprikash and I definitely wouldn't recommend it.  It had spinach with it which I have never had on chicken paprikash but the spinach wasn't very cooked so it was still rather crunchy which wasn't appealing.  I pushed it off to the side and even then, the paprikash wasn't terribly flavorful.  The service was prompt and attentive.  She brought our bill and when she brought back the credit card after being charged it was about $10 less than the original bill so I don't know if they did that intentionally because of the appetizer mishap or what...but nothing was said to us.  Because of the good reviews, we do look forward to returning again and hopefully it's a better experience next time."}
{"text":"I've lived in Aurora for almost 4 years. Moved from the heights and miss the wide range of ethnic restaurants. Really do appreciate the growing awareness of alternative diets; dairy free, vegetarian verses vegan, gluten Jacks has demonstrated. patio is great.  Most vegetarian dishes are heavy on the spice.  I usually eat at bar and staff is awesome so gracious and friendly.  I look forward to a dairy free soup."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Madjacks sports bar and grille and me and my guest had a very nice time . Enjoyed some good wines and the food was excellent. Nice friendly cosy environment and everyone was very friendly . Met John the owner who is a pleasant guy. Overall experience was excellent . Special thanks to Jordan. Will definately recommend the place. Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"First time visit was lunch with my mom on a Saturday...  We both had the house-made veggie burger served with their house-made chips and pickles.   Atmosphere was nice. Clean, bright, cute decor. Our service wasn't better than average. Getting in and out of parking in front can be difficult, but not a real deterrent, I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I go here a lot when I am in town. This time I got the beautiful summer salad with mango dressing which I posted in the pictures."}
{"text":"Very nice experience. Service was top notch. They really made us feel special.   Dinner was perfect. The short ribs were so tender you could eat them with a spoon. Green beans were grilled and crispy. Seasoning was spot on. Everything just right.   Dining area is a bit tight for space (and parking too), but don't let that keep you away. This place is where you want to be with your special someone or close group for a nice night out."}
{"text":"This place is truly a foodie's delight. The menu rotates each season, and I always struggle to choose an entree because it's hard to choose just one. They also make excellent cocktails, which is an especially strong compliment coming from someone who lived in the South for nearly 10 years.   On our latest visit, we sat on the patio. There are two patios - one large one in the front under a tent and a smaller courtyard patio in the back. It was private and quiet, perfect for a date night.   We ordered the pecan-crusted goat cheese with blueberry compote, and it was delicious. For my entrée, I selected the Lake Erie Walleye, and my husband got the salmon. Both were perfectly cooked. To drink, we tried the spicy old fashioneds. In a word - AMAZING.   I'll definitely frequent this place. The inside is also quaint as it appears to be an old house, but the dining rooms can get a little loud in the winter when there's a large crowd. There also appears to be an inexpensive bar menu that I'm anxious to try on a future visit."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out and was not disappointed! Excellent selection on the menu. And the prices are reasonable. Plus you have to love a place that has indoor and outdoor seating. We don't get to eat outside very often in Cleveland, right? Met the owner, and his personality reflects the restaurant. Just seems like a nice guy. We just had a salad and pizza, but it was very tasty and served promptly. Very good service!"}
{"text":"Attentive service. Good atmosphere. Spinach dip appetizer very good. Entrees did not live up to description in menu nor the spinach dip. I had the fish fry (it was Friday). It was more fry then fish- very crisp to the point of not tasting very good. Emmy daughter had a kebob which was so so. Steak cubes were undercooked not that flavorful. I think my wife had a caesars salad which was ok.  Basically a reasonable dining experience but the nice ambiance is not enough to make me rush back."}
{"text":"We has a wonderful dinner.  The staff was friendly.  The timing of the dinner was just right.  We did not feel rushed.  If you like spicy, try the Gumbo.  It is a winner.  My husband enjoyed the Chicken Marsala.  I had the house salad and he had the soup of the day.  We will definitely visit again!  I would have rated 5 stars except the inside dining room is very loud.  When we arrived there were only a few tables and the noise level was fine.  By the time we finished dinner, the dining room filled up and the noise level went up to an uncomfortable level."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  I had the Parmesan crusted chicken over pasta with roasted tomatoes and a balsamic glaze.  My friend had the Pan seared Salmon salad, he really wanted the Short ribs but they were out. Everything came out looking and tasting excellent.  We sat inside because we wanted A/C but there's a large patio area as well.  The menu is a little small but everything is unique.  Pricing was right on in my opinion."}
{"text":"Really cute place and food not bad.  Little pricey.  Unfortunately we were a big group of 12, so they put us in this little sparse looking room and had to sit at a table right by the bathroom.  Very unappetizing!  It was quite gross to be looking at a toilet at times, and  not to mention the smells.  I wish they would have thought more about their set up!"}
{"text":"Scotch Egg was delicious! Jacked up burger, my husband said was good. The short rib sandwich I had was okay. I would come back for the wine and scotch egg. We sat in the tiny bar. The noise level in that tiny bar was RUDE! My husband and I sat at a high top table and couldn't hear each other.  We should've sat outside."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with some work colleagues.  Great setting in a Victorian house with a well lit dinning area and a neat little bar.  Ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer which was very good and came with seasoned and lightly fried pita chips. They also brought out a wonderful basket of fresh baked bread.  For my lunch entrée I opted to get the special soup and half sandwich which was cream of tomato with basil and a meatloaf sandwich on ciabatta. The soup was excellent, just creamy enough without being overly unctuous and with the right amount of basil to compliment the preparation.   The sandwich was also very good as the meatloaf was moist and flavorful and was topped with frizzled onions, homemade slaw and melted cheese on a toothsome ciabatta roll. It came with some seasoned, house made chips which were excellent.  I would certainly return and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Unfortunately our nightly special appetizer came out with our entree. Would have loved to enjoy it with our drinks but instead we had to eat it all at once. Job well done to the chef!!! Sub par to the res"}
{"text":"I admit I was a little hesitant opening up my Yelp app on the way to Aurora Farms Premium Outlets to look for a bite to eat. But several pioneering Yelpers had recommended this classy yet cozy grill conveniently located off the main road, so it was definitely worth a shot.  A few minutes after parking and walking the stone path to the door, we were the first ones seated on the covered patio out front. Looking around, you'll notice there's also a side patio strung with lights for those extra crowded summer nights. Though the hostesses greeting us were pretty casually dressed, the waiters were dressed in spiffy black and whites and well-mannered.   The lunch menu is filled with all manner of meaty sandwiches, salads, and soups. One of the daily specials was a spinach wrap with a more tropical seafood bent. We ordered the Calamari to start, and even though the kitchen forgot the capers, this is some of the best calamari I've ever had. A light but crispy shell around tender squid and octopus morsels. Drizzled with aoili for extra creaminess. None of the tough, leathery bites that pass for calamari at other pubs! As we found out later though, this is an appetizer you should try to finish in-house... Unless you enjoy the potent perfume of seafood in your car on a warm day.   Next we split a Short Rib Sandwich, which we asked them to slice in half and came out presented open faced on a pretzel bun with a side of shoestring fries. The horseradish relish cuts down the heaviness of the juicy meat, and you can never go wrong with a pretzel bun! I realized in the middle of conversing that I had been talking with my mouth full because I couldn't stop eating the fries. They look like your average thin-cut, salted breed at first glance, but something about them brings out the addictive personality in me.   Were I to live in the area, I could see this becoming a regular spot to enjoy a patio lunch. Dinner prices would probably keep me away unless for a special occasion. The brief glimpse of the inside on my way to the bathroom leads me to believe the cute interior is no less enjoyable."}
{"text":"Really great food, nice menu, great wait staff, we had a great birthday for my Grandfather here and really enjoyed the semi private room."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Restaurant is nice and staff friendly, BUT neither my wife or my food was anything to brag about. My wife got the chicken florentine and the chicken was dry and flavorless though pasta was good. I got the special which was a hand cut and selected ribeye (selection must have been pretty poor) which was suppose to be 13 oz. - over half of it was fat and gristle, cheese mashed potatoes were good but dry and vegetables were a kale like green that they steamed and put a vinaigrette on it which was awful. Felt place is very over rated and not worth what they charge. Will not go back and don't recommend! I usually only post positive reviews but felt people need to be warned as this is a pricey restaurant and I expected better!"}
{"text":"Since my first experience I have been back a few times with mixed experiences. Twice I have had great food, and three times have been very very mediocre. I stopped risking it after my last trip."}
{"text":"Really fresh delicious lunch. I had come for the harvest chicken salad on their website. Turned out it was seasonal and not available, super disappointed until he offered for the kitchen to put something together as close as they could to the dish, man did they impress. Delicious salad and so nice for them to accommodate that way. Chicken was warm, fresh, and perfectly cooked. Another at the table got the salmon salad, I think it's safe to say all the salads are heavenly. Get them undressed cause my moms was over dressed. Burger was also great according to others at the table. Service was great, atmosphere casual but cute, I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We would definitely bring friends and family from out of town to this place to show it off. The food was great. The patio is amazing. Beer selection awesome.  We tried the hummus, gazpacho, ribs, meatloaf, pizza and three desserts. The chocolate mousse was good, the fried dough was better and if you like bread pudding it was truly great.   If you are wondering what you should try, don't miss the ribs. Exactly as good and tender as ribs should be. Great sauce too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp for a lunch spot for me and my mom as we made our yearly summer trip to Aurora Farms and some other shopping spots this side of Cleveland from Western NY. We came by at 2pm on a Monday on a beautiful day and had a great lunch.  We opted to sit out on the patio and were under the huge covered tent area. Nice, higher end metal furniture. We got a table right in the middle and we said we could have stayed there all afternoon sipping iced tea, it was so comfortable. Our server was very friendly and nice, got us quick refills, and was not a hoverer.  My mom is a vegetarian and there were some, but not a ton, of options. Even something like the beet salad had a bacon dressing.  She opted for the Veggie Burger. It was house made with black beans and rice and some veggies.  She liked the tzatziki topping and veggies.  I had the Jacked Up burger which was cooked nicely, and had fried onion straws, a mayo-type pub sauce, bacon, and I got cheddar cheese on it too.  The buns for both burgers were soft and fresh.  Both burgers were pretty messy even after we cut them in half to eat them, but tasty. They had cloth napkins and we probably should have asked if they had any extras because we both had to keep wiping our hands/mouth. Yum!  We both loved what looked liked to be house-made pickles. My mom's burger came with house made chips and I had fresh cut fries. They were good, but I think the oil was ready for a change.   The parking situation was sort of crazy and I had to go by 3 times to find the right area and I still wasn't sure.  Either way, we enjoyed our lunch and were refueled for the rest of our day of shopping and I would definitely come back if I was in the area in the future."}
{"text":"Aurora is a quiet suburb in the southeastern outskirts of Cleveland. So no, this ain't Tremont or Ohio City. But out of this farmland crops up this place that offers food that would be, in my view, the best you can get that's similar to a downtown foodie spot. Not at par with being adventurous or eclectic, but very good enough to intrigue the palate. I'm giving in 5-stars just for being the only such place with imagination in the whole town.  Patio seats are plenty! And... more importantly it is NOT located in an architectural monstrosity we call a strip mall -- but in some strip that resembles a refurbished \"old\" barn town. Charming feel.  The calamari passed what I call the rubber band test, it was soft and extremely tender. The rib-eye steak was cooked to the correct temperature and was tastily combined with their own horseradish sauce (although without the dark charred crust you'd see in them fancy steakhouses which I feel is the best way to have steak). Bottom line though -- it's what I'd call a great steak for the price. All food was served hot. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in one Saturday afternoon, after shopping at the Aurora Farms Outlet. It was recommended by another shopper I met. My cousin and I stopped in, and were seated without a wait. The food was delicious. They make there own fresh chips. I will definitely be going back. The price I paid was well with it."}
{"text":"This place is great in an old house. Outside seating is really pretty and relaxing. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my friend had the turkey burger. Both were fantastic. House fries are amazing. Yum."}
{"text":"This place has grown on me, so my review gets an update and an upgrade.  After eating here multiple times, for lunch and dinner, outside in the summer and inside in the winter, I have never had a bad experience.  I like independent restaurants like this.  I like seasonal menus that feature fresh, local produce.  Having lunch on a summer day here is wonderful.  Having lunch on a winter day with the fireplace ablaze is cozy.  Service has always been spot on - interested, knowledgeable about the menu and dedicated to service.  Nice domestic and international wine list.  Most of the customers seem to be locals (I am not), but I have always felt welcome here.  The food features seasonal salads and soups.  There are a variety of sandwiches for lunch and proteins for dinner.  Most portions are very generous, especially for the price.  Although this is not an easy place to get to, being in downtown Aurora, Ohio, it is worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. We got the blackened chicken sandwich and chicken paprikash. Enjoyed both"}
{"text":"What do they have in Aurora Ohio, Outlets and lots of white people. Apparently they have at least one good pub with some great food from what i saw.   It was me vs the world and outlet.  I was going to take on a formidable opponent being Michel Kor's. Boy did I need some grub before this match.   A very nice couple at the bar told me to go with the short rib sammy. It was fanstatic. Great bread, tender, flavorful. and it came with so good fries. Thank  you Mad Jacks."}
{"text":"food never disappoints! Lovely patio for nice days!   Frequent this place for lunch it can be extremely busy and service tends to slow down. I'd definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very good food. I had a pizza that was very good. My wife had the seafood paste. She liked it but it was very spicy. She is not a spice fan. They did tell her that but she missed it.  She said it was very good but spicy hot. Without asking and we told then they shouldn't have they took it off the bill. We made it up in a big tip. Bread pudding for dessert is out if this world. Enough for two."}
{"text":"Food was great.... try the crab ragoons! So good! 2 huge ragoons and you could actually see the crab meat in them.... none of that canned stuff with the fake red chunks. Ew.   Had the goat cheese side salad.... very fresh and good. And the lobster bisque. I did wish there was more lobster...I almost feel like I got the top of a fresh batch which isn't bad but you can't go wrong with more lobster. A bit price for just a cup though.... 6.  Service was mediocre. Server seemed to be just going through the motions. Very polite and nice but she was acknowledged a couple of times and just walked off. My sister and I wanted a glass of wine and asked a few questions and she left us without taking our order! Maybe we gave the wrong impression but we both looked at each other a bit confused. We also think our wine was switched but by the time we saw her again to ask our food had bee.n delivered by others and we liked what we had anyway. Would have been nice to know though. We switched halfway through just to be fair!   Overall I'd give them another chance. It was a lazy Tuesday after all and we can't expect everyone to be on top of their game all the time! Or maybe my sister and mom and I are just..... awkward."}
{"text":"Tried this place before shopping at the outlets...it's a charming place but a tad bit packed in.  We came at lunch time they really don't have a lunch menu, prices are very high for a half a sandwich and a soup it is 10+ and if you get lobster bisque it's an up charge of 1.50.  I opted for the short rib sandwich on pretzel bun with fries and a cup of lobster bisque.  Let me just say lobster bisque is my favorite soup so when I see it on the menu I have to try it...two bites in and not so happy, way to salty amd a super thick texture more like pudding.  They did take the soup of the bill so that was nice.  The sandwich lacked any real flavor the meat had no seasoning. They fries where great tho...my mother in law got a grilled chicken sandwich so not much to judge there!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I had the walleye dish that's grilled. I'll be back to try their other specials."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and it did not disappoint!  Shaded Patio and service were great.  Salads with pears and goat cheese, and turkey wrap were good portions, and very fresh.  Homemade potato chips a plus! The menu had a bunch of things that I wanted!  My daughter also had the tomato basil soup. This was the only thing we didn't love as it was very chunky.  The parking lot was very difficult to get in and out of but the quaintness of the place made up for it.  I went for lunch but would go back for lunch or dinner.  I would go with or without kids!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Mad Jack's twice and have had two very different experiences each time. The first time, pretty much everything was perfect. They had a delicious scallop special that was right up my alley and kept me stuffed for HOURS. The only downside was the hummus appetizer my friend and I split--I thought it was pretty good. Some nice roasted red pepper flavors and some unique zing, but it was a way to spicy for her. Might be useful to indicate on the menu that it's spicy because while I thought it was tasty, it was definitely very different from what I was expecting.  The second time was... less excellent. The server was still very nice but service was very slow and the restaurant was totally out of bread. Every type of bread. Hamburger buns, rolls, sandwich stuff, you name it. Which meant we didn't get bread as a nibble when we were seated and half of the food was no longer an option. I understand that their delivery truck was late, but Heinen's is right down the road. How can you seriously be out of bread? My pizza was good--a little oily--but good. I just wish they had had bread!  After that second experience, I've been a bit reluctant to go back. Either way, it's a bit normal and predictable, but sometimes it's nice to have a predictable lunch place. It seemed like a nice, consistent staple, but now I\"m not so sure. Guess I'll have to go back a third time as a tie-breaker?"}
{"text":"This is a cozy, friendly local grille with great service, homemade potato chips, and solid food.  My harvest salad was full of apples, candied pecans, fresh strawberries, and craisins, topped with a generously sized piece of marinated chicken.  The champagne vinaigrette was delish: not too tart with just the perfect amount of sweetness. The black bean soup was flavorful and filling but not heavy and I really liked the small, perfectly portioned multigrain rolls in the bread basket. Coffee was hot and fresh too. Our server was friendly and the food came out in less than 10 minutes. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"In my mind, Aurora always had a bad reputation for not having many good restaurants. I think I feel differently now.  Mad Jack's is tucked away in an old house right before the main stretch of Aurora Farms. You probably wouldn't find it unless you were looking for it--it blends in so well, and has but a small outdoor sign!  This place is really cute. Because it's in an old house, the inside is quaint and cozy. The tables, chairs and décor remind me of being at a relative's house. The walls have paintings of dogs in proper black tie, and the main indoor seating looks like it could be closed to be a private room. They also have an outdoor patio, and a tented patio with additional seating. The acoustics indoors are a little odd, so just be prepared that it can be pretty loud inside.  The menu at Mad Jack's was really enticing. My Mom and I both had salads (I had the salmon salad, she had the harvest chicken), and both were huge. All the ingredients were fresh, the portion was super generous, and the salmon was cooked well. I'm not normally a person who craves a salad, but I would come back here again just for the salad. Mad Jack's was a really excellent choice for a quick lunch en route to Aurora Farms!"}
{"text":"Was there for lunch, had the gazpacho, and the salmon salad with capers, roasted peppers, and dill dressing. Now They KNOW how to make gazpacho! yum! And the salad was amazing too. Both were served as some of the largest portions I've ever seen for dinner, let alone lunch! Coming back soon to try dinner - cant wait!"}
{"text":"Meal was o.k.  Ribs were mediocre and overpriced.  Other parties enjoyed their meals.  I'll go back, but will make a wiser choice.  Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, sharp service, nice atmosphere - in a centennial home. It's in the center of aurora and easy to get to and get in. They take reservations, they have a nice bar and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Not bad but ostentatious and overpriced. It's not that the food is bad, but again, the quality just doesn't jive with the cost. This place reminds me of most restaurants in Chagrin Falls - it can charge more because of the higher concentration of wealthier people in the area (and to be fair they probably have to due to higher overhead costs), but when you get beyond the pretension it's just \"ok\" at best."}
{"text":"The hubs and I decided to go on a quick getaway and stumbled on to this small town. Usually small towns don't have a lot of good dining choices but here in Aurora they do. Decisions. Decisions. We chose Mad Jack's because the description started out with craft beer. It ended up being a great choice. Their beer selection was solid and included a few regional beers that we could not try at home.  I ordered a cup of Lobster Bisque and a Simple pizza. The bisque came out at a great temperature-not too hot, not room temperature. It was creamy and had the perfect texture/thickness. There were small pieces of lobster. I would have preferred a little bit more lobster. The flavor of Bisque was nice but seemed to be missing something-maybe a pinch of salt?  It was good but slightly missed the mark. My pizza came out right out of the oven. It was cheesy and the tomatoes burst when you bit into them. Lots of flavor. It was finished with a white balsamic. The touch of fruitiness was nice but just a smidge too sweet. The edges were crispy which was nice. Our servers were very friendly and took great care of us.  This is a great place to dine. Just a few tweaks and they would be five stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a very late lunch on a Friday and had the place to ourselves. Parking is near the street and you take the walkway straight back to the door past the patio. Snowing today so no outdoor seating for this visit. The hostess sat us at a table in the corner and took our drink order. There were no napkins brought for the drinks and it appears my wine was spilled so I really needed a couple. My fav went to the bar and grabbed a handful which came in handy.  The calamari arrived without a serving spoon which is odd for a family style appetizer but was very well cooked, tasty, crunchy and accompanied by pickled onions that were mild and crunchy.  My fav got the shortribs which were fork tender with crunchy cooked carrots, mashed potatoes, onion strings and gravy. A nice size portion that he ate every bite of.  I got a goat cheese salad that I very much enjoyed and the 'shroom' pizza which is a tomato free pizza. Also very tasty. I took half of it home: definitely enough for two.  Our dining companions got the sausage pizza and almond crusted chicken entree. The sausage pizza was 'not too spicy' in a good way. The chicken came with pasta and steamed brocolli. All in all we very much enjoyed our meal. The waitress was friendly and just attentive enough to not be instrusive. (Very important!) The background music was a variety of styles so if you don't like one style it only lasts one song. (Also important!) The atmosphere is relaxed. Around $30/person including app and 5 beverages from the bar."}
{"text":"About as middle-of-the-road as it gets. A massive take-it-or-leave-it vibe to the service. Food as good as the average Applebees"}
{"text":"Great for lunch! Cozy old home feel with great wait staff and really enjoyed the southwest black bean soup and the black veggie burger!! So good!! Everyone I was with enjoyed their lunch and I'd come back  for sure!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and great service.  Food was exceptional.  Extensive selection of craft brews as well as great cocktails.  Really enjoyed our meal.  Salmon and chicken paprikash were fabulous!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Always a food meal here- nice ambience. One of our go-to restaurants  when we have a night out."}
{"text":"A real jam.  But definitely a kind of place a passing traveler would never find if not for yelp and 4square.  Great food, great drinks, great service great ambiance.  Would recommend it to anyone. Everything me, my wife and my toddler had was delicious."}
{"text":"I had the chicken paprikash and my mom had the steak arugula salad. We both loved our meals! The portions were filling and the service was great. Our server Chuck was very knowledgeable and helpful. We decided to grab dinner here tonight after finding the great reviews on Yelp and we will definitely be back! Great little place with good drink selections!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight and while the food was out of this world, service was not. We ordered short ribs, cedar plank salmon and the goat cheese appetizer. All the food was great. But our waitress ordered the wrong thing from the kitchen, didn't get us bread, wasn't very good at getting refills and she just seemed very spacey. We'd go back just for the food and just hoped we'd get another server."}
{"text":"Fair  food and very over priced. Atmosphere gets an A. Looks like a Williamsburg Inn, but the food does not stand out.I will give it a second chance, if I can get into the lot to park. This used to be Nolas china shoppe, and I still cannot believe this old building is now a restaurant. I will go back again to give a second opinion."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 different times and can stamp a solid 4 stars on Mad Jack's.  It's appealing enough to bring me back, but doesn't have that 5 star spark.  The place: small, homely joint off one of the main drag in Aurora offers as much seating outdoor as it does indoor.  This is great in the summer, but our Ohio summers are only 2 months long now so the main building itself is relatively small and cozy.  The outdoor has an uncovered area and a covered area.  Parking is at a premium, as well.  The staff: overall, the staff is very friendly and typically everything is done in a timely manner and done right.  The food: Mad Jack's does a good job of making everything seem appealing and appetizing.  The menu is diverse and easy to read.  The burgers are solid, the entrees are solid, and the Gyro is just OK (the lack of Tzatziki is a big problem).  The fries are typically good, but they were a little over seasoned the last time around; someone must have gotten spice-happy.  The atmosphere:  Great!  Whether you are coming for food or drinks, the crowd is a typical family restaurant and not a \"pub\" or anything like it."}
{"text":"We got two cocktails, both good. Chicken paprikash and chargrilled ribeye were both fantastic. The steak was perfectly cooked. Bread pudding for dessert. All fantastic. Slightly pricey, but well worth it based on the quality. Unique atmosphere. Overall, couldn't have been more pleased.   Update:  On our third trip, we found they took off our favorite dinners. We weren't nearly as pleased with the food we did try instead. This forced a drop from 5 to 4."}
{"text":"Great food and vibe. Parking can be a pain, but its worth the trip."}
{"text":"Excellent. Mushrrom soup and house salad. Very cute atmosphere.  Great outdoor seating and reasonable prices.  Great lunch before going to aurora farms."}
{"text":"The turkey burger was awesome and my love had the  salmon salad. She loved it and the service was great! We will definitely be back to try dinner!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, most recent times was top notch. Great service, good drafts and steak was superb."}
