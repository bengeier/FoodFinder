{"text":"Food is good bar food. Service is generally good. The bar manager, well, she is a bit of a grouch so I prefer the other bar tenders."}
{"text":"Great wings, good beer specials. Try the pizza rolls or Huge nachos with pulled pork. Nice friendly neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"We really enjoy DB's! The food is solid, service is great and always can see your favorite game on the TV. The veggie pizza roll is my favorite and I wish they would add the fried banana peppers to the menu permanently - they are a hit!   I would love to see them do a special martini or cocktail menu for those of us who aren't into beer. That would be a complete slam dunk in terms of revenue I would think!"}
{"text":"This is a great bar to watch the games and have good food and drinks.  The changes they made from the previous bar have made it more family friendly, but also were you can go and just have beers.  Good live music and the staff is awesome.  Make sure you stop by."}
{"text":"Very good!! Nice place, obviously experienced wait staff and a well rounded menu. I had a pizza roll and it was outstanding! Good portion and not too \"heavy\". Enjoyed dinner there very much. Will return!"}
{"text":"Food is ok for bar food.  They need more selections.  I ordered Kendall Jackson Chardonnay.  I was served something else.  I drink this at home and it is easy to tell the difference.  They said they opened another bottle and brought me a new glass.  Still wasn't KJ Chardonnay.  They probably should have opened the bottle at my table if they were opening KJ.  I am thinking that they were serving KJ Avanti which is not the same and much less expensive.  Finally,  I just drank a prosecco.  I don't want to pay 9 dollars for a glass of wine that is not what they say it is."}
{"text":"Been a few times. Plenty of TVs and a nice whiskey list.  Friendly service and a great selection of food round out the experience."}
{"text":"One of the best new restaurants and bars in the Ballantyne area! Their paninis are amazing! And their pizza rolls are home made everyday! So good!!"}
{"text":"Everything we have had here is great.  Top bar food and nothing like it after a tough day or for the big game, etc.  Wings, Loaded Tater Tots, Salads, Chicken tenders, pizza rolls, onion rings, sandwiches, nachos, etc.  Some of the best bar food in town.  The only downside?  If you get your order to go, triple check it."}
{"text":"Wow! Love this place :) This is the home of the BamaCharlotte now. Very happy with this new place.   Food: 2 page menu with the sports bar fare to be expected. But the expected is done very well! We've tried their Panther Burger, Tavern Burger,  DB'S Angus Salad, Blue Cheese Chips, and have been really pleased.  There are great food specials to try and always beer and drink specials every day.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are very good.   Seating: About 150 or so with seating at the bar, at high top bar tables, and many regular short top tables with padded,  wooden chairs. So can stay for a short time or a long time.  DB's has been very accommodating to our family and goes above and beyond to make sure everything is right.  They are friendly and all the staff are smiling.  Highly recommended for watching a game with friends (large groups or small) or just a stop off for a quick bite. Families are welcome as well as adult groups.   Thanks DB's for great times and ROLL TIDE!"}
{"text":"I'm just glad this place is staying open! I love having somewhere close to home to grab a beer. I've heard the food is great here but I stick to the liquids. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the crowd at the bar isn't as warm and friendly as it seemed when it was Stadium...I've gone 3 times and just casually said 'hey' to the person sitting next to me and it's turned out to be a weirdo. Not the restaurant's fault."}
{"text":"This has been a long time coming. We've enjoyed the food here for quite some time. But, every single time we enter this restaurant there is NEVER anyone at the front to seat you and give you menus. So you stand there and wonder why servers and other employees see you walk in but don't bother to help you. Since we enjoyed the food, we let it slide. The last time we were there we sat ourselves and waited for someone to help us. We waited and waited and waited. I finally asked a server walking by if she was our server. She said no and kept walking. My husband was so angry and said in a loud voice that we will never return again. And we haven't. I wonder how many others have encountered being ignored at this restaurant. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Maybe I overestimate what I can get from a bar. Burger is not impressive at all. I will try pizza rolls next time."}
{"text":"As pretty much a regular, i can say for what it is, its about as good as it gets especially in this area!  Food and drinks are a good value.  Some of the food is surprisingly good such as the 'salt and pepper' wings and pizza rolls.  The mainstay waiters/waitresses are generally attentive, however can be some issues with the new help, but Maggie seems to get them in line!!  This is about the 3rd or 4th place in that location since I've been here and hopefully it will continue to be successful."}
{"text":"I pass this place daily so I decided to stop thru and I like it. It's kid friendly yet still a nice bar. I have tried the steak panini, house salad, wings, tater tots and a few drinks and everything is delish. Simple, yet consistently good. Service at times can be a little slow but I think they are trying to keep overhead down since it's really not a crowded place....which I can understand. Staff is always friendly and they remember you.  I really love the neighborhood bar/eatery feel. Hope they last!"}
{"text":"Well it's a very solid place. Nice service, nice prices and great food. They ask me and my friend how was dinner and then got us around of beers on the house. Awesome !  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from DB's. Very disappointed! Ordered wings ...requested extra crispy but they were extra slimy...I guess they ignored our request to make them crispy!  We threw the wings in trash! The pizza roll we ordered was not very good either. Also ordered O-rings but they failed to include the jalapeño ranch which is listed on the menu.  Definitely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Thanks to DBS for helping Sun Valley NJROTC with the 3rd annual 5k to help raise money for their trip to Hawaii for the Pearl Harbor parade 12/7/2017"}
{"text":"Great first visit. We were looking for something simple but not your standard bar fare and this delivered. Pizza rolls were great but the true winner was the pulled pork flatbread. We will be back"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday. The place wasn't that busy. Service was slow. Our waiter took our drink order then came back with drinks after he had a quick smoke break...  Last time we were here our waiter wasn't wearing a winter hat inside. Hipster I guess? Maybe they go thru employees quickly?"}
{"text":"Love this place! The pizza rolls are a must! I usually go for the buffalo chicken rolls and they are always delish!   Tim is a great bartender and always super friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow what an awful experience and poor quality of food. I write this from a family experience so this may not apply to all those interested in going. Even though the restaurant offers a kids menu, the place is not kid friendly. The place is probably decent if you are looking for a sports pub but as a family destination, not a good choice whatsoever. The restaurant has many TVs, about 20ish or so and the beer selection is good. As for food, the quality is really poor. Besides the kids meals which were your basic items you will find at other \"sports bars\", nothing special. I got a burger which not only lacked flavor but the onion rings were a huge disappointment, the coating was laced in soggy oil and not worth even looking at. The service was rushed and the place was way too loud, even for a sports bar. Maybe we were placed under a speaker but our server couldn't hear us place our order. There are so many other choices for a sports bar experience and DBs would be the LAST place I would even consider going. Save you time and money and go elsewhere. Hickory Tavern, Bradshaws or Ducksworth which are within a few miles away would be better choices."}
{"text":"If you are ordering wings or burgers, you're in great shape.  Stay away from the flatbreads , nachos, or anything on which they can put undesignated cheese. They use something related to velveeta, but it's sloppier and has less flavor.  Also, don't go if you're in a hurry.  Each time I've been there (by myself or with a group of four) it took 30-40 minutes to get the food. I have really tried to like this place but I'm pretty much over it. Charlotte has a lot of other options."}
{"text":"I have now been to DB's Tavern on three different occasions for food.  The new layout is really nice.  They basically gutted the front of the house and started over.  WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT!  A great variety of seating and really love the large high top tables in the middle.  Perfect for big groups or a gathering of friends from the neighborhood.  A few outdoor tables are another great option.  On our first visit the place was busy and the only negative I noticed was the chairs.  They were cheap and kind of flimsy.  But on my next visit they had all new chairs that were really great.   Glad they made the investment in the new furniture.  Its so much more inviting and comfortable.  Each time the food was excellent.  Went in with my kids and they had burgers.  Large fresh patty with a really nice bun.  I had Spinach Salad with Grilled Chicken and other fixins.  Just what my doctor ordered.    On later visits we had wings, flatbread, and recently the PIZZA ROLLS!, Everything was really tasty, cooked properly and served hot and ready to eat.  The Pizza Roll was a really big hit.  Service is how it should be.  Its is a great improvement from Stadium and certainly better than Beantown that was here before that.  Really glad to have the neighborhood bar back and thrilled they have great food.  They should do well."}
{"text":"Great place for a game and some food Plenty of tvs and more than just your usual bar food"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the Panther's first pre-season game. Plenty of TV's visible from everywhere with the game volume on (yay). Place was packed, Kirstin took care of us and was a fantastic server. Drinks and food were a bit inconsistent, but overall good. Will give them another try as it's close to home and will def be looking for Kirstin to serve us again."}
{"text":"Food is great...Pulled POrk Flat bread delicious and loved the hush puppies on kids meals.  The place looks also very nice compared to its previous owner.  Only hope is that they lower the lights at night some since its too bright to go for just drinks..But the drinks themselves were great!"}
{"text":"Good sports bar but the service continues to be painfully slow.  Decent tasting food but shouldn't take near 45 minutes each time we go there and order. Not sure if it is the kitchen or servers but this is going to turn into a drinks only sports bar. Shame since I live in the neighborhood that backs up to this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to DB's tonight. This was our 5th time going. I'm not sure if they were having an off night, but my wings were terrible. We have not had problems the times we've dined here before. The teriyaki wing sauce was not glazed and did not coat the wings. The sauce was like water and the wings had no taste because the sauce wouldn't stick to the wings. My wing chips were burned and had an after taste. What made it even worse is I told our waitress about the food and all she said was ,\"I'm sorry.\" She didn't offer a reduction on the bill or ask me if I would like anything else in place of what I had. I thought that was pretty sad. I'll be finding a new place to go for wings the next time."}
{"text":"Great local tavern. Love the pretzels and Ruben. Kids all everything on the kids menu. Usually have a good selection of beer including some local options. Good place to watch the game. Only giving 4 stars because at times staff is hit or miss and this can ruin the whole experience"}
{"text":"This has become my go-to local sports bar (when I can get out). It's tucked away in a quiet local retail area called the fountains. They have a ton of TVs with all live sports, the drinks feature local craft beers and the food is sneaky good. I even bring the kids from time to time because they like the burgers. It's also only 1/2 from my house which is helpful."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a coworker for lunch. Seeing the great reviews and location I knew we had to try out something than our usual Penn Station or Red Bowl. When you walk in it was seat yourself, but most people were at the bar. We decided to sit near the bar and were given menus by the one and only waitress working.   It was mid-day but I think we were the only ones there not drinking wine or beer. This must be a local watering hole because the waitress was basically pushing food instead of drinks to those who were probably there since opening.   I ordered the pizza rolls which is one of DBs specialties. It was well worth it, and easily eaten. My coworker had food-envy and took home my leftovers.   I would definitely bring  my husband here. I imagine it gets really crowded for dinner and weekends as it was pretty busy on a weekday. The food was great and so was the waitress. The only request is actually having another waitress. She was swamped so lunch took a little long."}
{"text":"Much better than the prior bar \"Stadium\".  Clean and open restaurant.  Great use of floor space.  Love the paninis.  Friendly and accommodating staff.  Great place to kick back and relax with a beer, sports, food, and friends."}
{"text":"Good place to catch a game.  Nice atmosphere, beer specials,  good service and tasty food.   Carnivore Pizza Roll is yummy and filing.  Favorite wing sauce is Teriyaki (I like to order them crispy)"}
{"text":"Can't wait until Friday to hear the music of Thom Crompton.  Should be a blast.  Good food, good music. it don't get much better"}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying this is the 2nd time we went there, and the first time we went for dinner on Friday night and had a great all around experience. However, we went for lunch a few months later and it was a disaster. We stood at the door for 10 min before the hostess acknowledged us, and there were only 3-4 other tables so it wasn't crowded. When we went to order beers, the waitress said they took away the beer list and hadn't printed new ones yet, and she couldn't remember them off the top of her head. It took a good 15 min to get our first round of drinks, and then over an hour to get our food for 2 adults and 2 kids. The waitress kept apologizing and said other servers keep calling out, so maybe there's a management issue there. The food was good and it's a good atmosphere, but the slow service was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Any vegetarian will tell you that being vegetarian in any new state is difficult. For a few days my husband and I ate salads and sides at other restaurants on our visit. We were relieved when we saw that there were not only great beer options for my husband, but also a couple vegetarian options here.  After making our order we were told by the hostess that everything was made from scratch! Finally! A homemade black bean burger! I ordered it with the sweet potato fries which had a sauce that was sweet and paired perfectly with the sweet potatoes! The black bean burger was smoky and defiantly freshly made. If there's one thing I wish I could have brought back with me to Florida it was DB's chef!  Thank you DB's for offering vegetarian options that are fresh, not frozen! I would recommend to other vegetarians looking for a sports bar atmosphere to go with meat eater friends!"}
{"text":"We were craving wings early this evening and went to \"old reliable\" (YELP) for a recommendation in our hood. Up popped DB's Tavern AND Monday's they have wing specials. Off we go..... DB's is a nice neighborhood tavern with lots of room, lots of TV's and a great bar. Unfortunately they no longer offer wing specials on Monday's but, no worries, we wanted wings.  Although a first time guest and somewhat unsure with the menu, our server worked hard to answers a plethora of questions. We tried 3 different types of wings. The wings were large and meaty but very dry as in over cooked. The wings were ordered three ways;  medium sauce (not a Buffalo sauce), Honey Chipotle and Lucifer's Own (charred).   The medium sauce wings were tasteless and very dry. We asked for additional sauce ($1) which can best be described as a bottled hot sauce but not a traditional wing sauce. The onion rings that came with the wing order were greasy and also over cooked.   The Honey Chipotle wings were covered in a flavorful sauce with enough spice but couldn't rescue the dreadfully over cooked wings. Lucifer's Own were anything but devilish. Not very spicy, dry wings that had a decent char that was a different twist.  Note to self re. DB's: no wing specials, wings are anything but special, avoid wings on Mondays, there are 7 different $1 up charge choices relating to wings and the Blue Cheese is blue cheese less! If you're craving wings crave them somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Food is very good - particularly the burgers which I can get medium rare.  Staff is super friendly and the TV screens are good.  Home of the Alabama Crimson Tide."}
{"text":"Service was ehh. Food was ehh. Prices were ehh. Place was overall ehh. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Evan the bartender is a great bartender and he is on top of it. Never let's you hanging, and is always dialed in with his customer base. Friendly and spot on for his bartending skills. Also recognizes tables in the the dining area even when there not his tables.  A plus service!! And great food to boot"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight with the hubby and enjoyed a nice dinner.  Came in last Saturday night around 11pm and it was DEAD. Chugged a couple cheap drinks then headed out.  Tonight I got a delicious burger and tater tots. Nothing unique but still good. It wasn't that busy but it was enough to not be awkward.  The best part about this bar is the new design. It is MUCH better than Stadium. The bar is awesome and the restaurant is nice and open. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game, any game! They had every TV tuned to different games so you could watch them all! I highly recommend the pizza roll! Super tasty!"}
{"text":"So glad to see this spot In the Fountains opening up again!!  And, What a terrific job they've done with the place.  (Read Ian's review for details!) It was one of my fav spots before.. and with this face-lift and with the great track record of the owners (The owner of Picasso's opened DB's!!) in other sister entities, we're off to a great start!  I've been enjoying chicken wings at Picasso's downtown for quite a long time!  In my opinion, they are some of the very best in town.  AND NOW, they are right here in The Fountains at DB's Tavern!  But, you MUST also try the Pizza Rolls!!  They are really good.  On our first visit to DB's we found the wait staff to be friendly and quite attentive!  Notably, other waiters would swing by and pick up/drop off when our primary was busy.  Good job!  I hope that attentiveness continues!  Oh, and they DO serve OMB Copper in addition to several other local brews!!  Several to choose from and a wine list too!  Several TVs located around the restaurant so the chances are that you can catch the sporting event of your choice while dining!  So welcome to The Fountains DB's!  We're glad to have you here!!"}
{"text":"There are so many sport bar type restaurants or so called \"Taverns\" around here where my dining experience has been disappointing for the most part. Sure, they all have TVs all around and decent beer selection, but the food has been mediocre at best. That is not the case here. The food is good with big portions and very decent prices, even on local beers where you are likely to pay a premium anywhere else. The atmosphere here is more of a local spot and it's a good change from the overpriced and over done places around here."}
{"text":"Good food, drinks and place to hang-out.  Really enjoyed brunch with the family as well.  Have been back several times and will several more."}
{"text":"Don has done an amazing job of bringing your neighborhood pub to Ballantyne! Great food  ( you have to have the jalapeño poppers) atmosphere and staff! If you're looking for that neighborhood bar/restaurant this is your place.  I have meet several clients for lunch and dinner and felt like family.  I have also enjoyed many Sundays with football on all the TVs and of course watching the Tar Heels play basketball.  If you're looking for great food and drinks with people who treat you like family this is your place !! Side note - every year DBs does a charity event to raise money for Wounded warriors . This place not only gives great service to his patrons they also give back to the community !! Make sure if your in town to stop by !!"}
{"text":"The perfect bar... great whiskey selection and they have shuffle board. Reasonably priced and a good place to watch a game."}
{"text":"We just stopped by for a quick drink. We did not order any food. Because of the pleasant and professional service, we'll be back. Kirsten, our server, was attentive and engaging and proves the impact an employee can have on the the customer experience.   Beer selection was okay, need to add more local brew in my opinion. Wine selection was fairly limited. Given the area demographics, I would think a wider selection would be a smart move.   One thing I didn't like were the tall benches. Very cumbersome and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. Good food and a nice ambience as well. Big improvement to the previous tenant. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to give this 5 Star Review, mostly because we kind of love this place because we feel like it's almost our hidden little secret and I kind of want to keep it that way!  But I can't in good faith not give them a great review - They keep a great updated Beer List including good local beers, we're about 10 for 10 on items we've eaten there which are consistently delicious.  The wait staff is always super nice, and we bring along our little one who can be a handful to eat out, but every employee in the place has been absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"What a great local spot to catch a game, good \"bar\" eats, and a cold drink. My husband and I were in the area and decided to find a place with decent burgers. This place came up on the Yelp app. We decided to head here.  It was early afternoon on a Thursday. There was no one to greet us upon entering. The crowd seemed to be seated towards the front of bar area. No server in sight to tell us where to sit. We just asked the guy at bar and pointed were we seated ourselves. He said he will send a server our way. We waited just a few minutes.  Server was super nice and was attentive during out time there. I ordered the wings basket and my husband ordered the bacon burger. Food did not take long to come out. All of it was great!  The atmosphere is very laid back and has great vibes. TV screens at every angle showing a variety of sports games. It is somewhat dark inside but this is a \"tavern\".  Overall, we loved it! We look forward to coming here more often for tavern grub, cold drinks, and a game or two."}
{"text":"I tried out this restaurant last Saturday night for the 1st time and I was very impressed. Our table had the loaded tater tots and blue cheese chips as appetizers and they were both very tasty! They had jambalaya on the menu as a special for the night and it was DELICIOUS! My friends were very pleased with their choices, as well.   The atmosphere was great. I don't think there was one direction you could look without seeing a TV, which made it great to watch the football game.   As far as service goes, it was excellent! It was our server's first day working at DB's Tavern. Our table had a number of questions about menu items. She knew the answer to most of them, but if she didn't then she quickly found out and reported back to us and she had nothing but a smile on her face the entire night! She was on top of everything throughout our dining experience. Our glasses never got empty before she asked if we needed more. It may sound strange, but that is an important factor to me when I am dining somewhere. I don't like having an empty glass. Nikki took very good care of us. Oh, and did I mention she did this while the restaurant was absolutely full of people?!  Top notch service and food! Me and a 'few\" of my friends are going back today! Check this place out...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here late last night for some drinks. Sat outside. Servers were very friendly and didn't keep coming back to the table every 2 mins. Great vibe"}
{"text":"Rating DB's against every other sports bar in the area and it is great! There's a great vibe, bartenders and servers are very attentive and sweet, and the food is awesome. We came for dinner on a Thursday night and ordered the pizza roll ups (so good!) and sandwiches. I ordered the veggie sandwich with fries and everything was great. Lots of TVs and some games. This is an excellent choice to hang out or get some food, I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great little Sports Bar in Charlotte! Great food and drinks served by some of the friendliest staff in the Queen City! Best place to watch the Alabama Crimson Tide on football Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Good 'ol fashioned pub 'where everybody knows your name'. Great wings, cold beer and good vibe. Live music...give it a whirl!  You'll be glad to have your own little spot!"}
{"text":"This area has had a void of a neighborhood bar for quite some time now and DB's takes care of that and then some. Friendly bartenders and a delicious selection of food, all at reasonable prices. The new owners did a complete redesign of the bar area and it's really well done. If it's been some time since you were last here do yourself a favor and go check DB's out."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game and the best wings in this area. They did an awesome job when they renowed this place. Knowledgable staff."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday.  Atmosphere is open and friendly with many TV's playing different sporting events.  Server James was great!  Chicken wings are crispy and the available flavors are wonderful.  Ordered a couple different wings and burgers.  Burgers were tasty and juicy without being overwhelmingly greasy.  We'll be back to try some different menu items!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there last night to watch some Monday night football and grab a bit to eat after reading all the positive reviews.  Wow what a disappointment!  We split a burger, which was cooked properly at medium-rare.  Fries were decent.  So all good there.  Then we ordered some wings and one of their sides, which happened to be the onion rings.  The first set of 6 wings were garlic-parmesan, which were fried nicely but had very little flavor.  If I didn't know they were garlic-parmesan, I would have not guessed that.  The 2nd set of 6 wings were honey bbq and they were horrible. They were under-fried and literally had no sauce on them.  It was like eating a fatty wing with nothing on them.  Very disappointing.  The onion rings came out of the kitchen luke-warm at best and were very greasy.  Not a good combination.    Overall bill was like 38$ with a tip and we didn't even have a drop of alcohol.  We will definitely not be going back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Jimi is the best bartender!! Always makes you feel like a regular. Best wings I've ever had, in Charlotte and elsewhere!!!  The owner is so friendly and always makes a point to stop to say hello and make sure all is perfect."}
{"text":"DB's did a fresh update to the atmosphere of a previous bar that was already really neat.  The servers are cool, the place is spotless, and they have the best daily specials on this side of town.  We're going to make this our go-to spot in S. Charlotte."}
{"text":"DB's is the perfect place to go if you want the sports bar atmosphere. The food was fairly average, nothing to write home about, but not bad or of poor quality. They had a decent bar and there were plenty of screens to watch any game you wanted on. The service was good and overall the experience made for a great Friday night!"}
{"text":"I am going to be as objective as possible and not just trash this place:  The good:   -The new design/layout is 9000x better than The Stadium.  They did a great job with the remodel. -The onion rings - phenomenal.  Nuclear hot when served, in a neat-looking stack. -Wings - No complaints.  A-OK.  The bad: -My girlfriend's burger.  She ordered it cooked medium.  It was served exactly as requested.  She gave me a little piece to try (2-3 bites).  The burger would have been great except the meat tasted funny, and it was not seasoned in any way.  Later we both got sick.  The meat tasted funny because it was bad.  I shouldn't have to get my burger well-done to kill the bacteria because the kitchen is not storing and handling it correctly.  I will NOT return to this place; you make me sick, you're done."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite recently because it was open late and wanted to try it because I was in the area with nothing really open late, so I figured I try it. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She told us to get the wings and the pizza rolls and they both were good. We got the honey chipotle wings ( which are not spicy they just have a kick to it) , lemon pepper, and salt and pepper wings. The pizza rolls were a good snack as well. The onion rings we got were over cooked and the sweet potato fries were just okay but when you dipped them in the sauce they provided it helped. Will be back if I need something to eat late at night because they are open until usually 1 and 2 am."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza rolls - they're almost like \"egg rolls\" in terms of thickness but really tasty. The mini loved the kids chicken fingers and the service was good - I can see how this would be a big football watching joint during panthers season!"}
{"text":"BEST BAR FOOD!! I always go and eat here the pizza rolls are DANK!! They have the best side salads and you literally can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Went to this place by accident.  Stupid GPS!  But oh my great awesome stupendous.  Had a burger even though I wasn't really in mood for burger......ate the whole thing. So full now hurts.  I had been to Red Robin a week ago and this was better.  The fries were great the prices so good.  Will so be back here again.  The kids loved it.  It was clean, wait staff good to fair, atmosphere I had three kids with me there was no atmosphere except they better like their food and leave me in peace to eat mine!  Was great will return with bells on!"}
{"text":"We come here for the awesome cold beer and the best wings around. This is a sports bar vibe with lots of tvs and nice spacious dining room. Friendly staff. Great pizza rolls. Come here often."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since the first visit and its much better. Many people get their pizza rolls, I don't find them amazing like others do but I like them as probably the best value on the menu (best ordered with a side salad in my opinion). Their wings are probably my favorite tasting item overall."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar tucked away off Ardrey Kell and Tom Short Rd. I come here for the wings!! Not too many places in Charlotte, that I've experienced, that allow you to go \"all drums\" or \"all flaps/flats\". I've heard it both ways! :) Really dig the honey chipotle sauce for the wings. Sweet and spicy! Tip: if you get your wings to go, ask for the celery and sauce in a separate container so they don't get all warmed up (gross)."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch & dinner here over the past month.  Wing special is 6 wings & a side for under $8.   Wings are crispy, tasty, and not floating in sauce.   Waitresses are friendly, check on you often, and remember your name.  Daily beer & drink specials.  Haven't had a bad meal yet!"}
{"text":"Second visit and definitely better than the first time. Still think the establishment is going through some growing pains. First visit had the oven not working. It was working the second time. I tried the bourbon pork BBQ flatbread. Friends had the pizza rolls which was what was recommended. I tried a bite and I'll be coming back for that. While the flatbread was good, wished I had ordered that."}
{"text":"Welcome to The Fountains shopping center!  DB's is brand new to the Ballantyne area and they have a tough road of ahead them.  When it comes to competing with Stonecrest and Blakeney for business, the pickens are pretty rare.  Having said that, I think DB's is the place to do it.  I'm definitely pulling for them and I will be out supporting.  First of all, because the place is excellent, but it definitely doesn't hurt that the place is walking distance from my house.    Absolutely love the new design of the place compared to how the Stadium bar had things setup because it just so much more welcoming.  The bar is now down on the lower level and is massive.  Plenty of space to sit or slip in to grab a drink.  They used the elevated section as an expanded area for sitting and it really works!  Overall, simply love the new setup.  Food wise, the menu has some nice variety and it will take a few more drop-ins to find that WOW item.  But overall, I really like the selection.  We had the loaded tots and wings.  Well, my friend ordered the wings but he raved about them.  Multiple flavors to choose from and they had \"a perfect mixture of crunchiness on the outside.\"  Monday nights are Wing Night and they offer 25% on their wings.  See you next Monday!  Specials -  It seems that they have a special running for every day.  Check online on their facebook page for updates.  Wing Mondays, Taco Tuesday, half price wine Wednesdays, etc.  Oh yeah... Live music on Wednesdays, too."}

{"text":"Interesting place and very similar to Hickey Tavren  but here more humble friendly and will definitely come back here again!! P.S  I'm deaf  and they were very easy to communicate with and our service was amazing!    I highly recommend this place! Will definitely bring more people here!"}
{"text":"Worst experience. Asked to be seated with a large party. There were plenty of seats available. We offered to be split up into two parties The hostess refused to split us up - into 2 four tops! Could not believe it as there were at least 4 tables empty that could accommodate us. No respect for who the customer is!"}
{"text":"Good food good beer fun environment! Maggie is by far the best thing this place has goin on! She made me feel like I was at home Enjoying the game while being served but a fun loving and attentive server! I will be goin back thanks to her!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.... honestly had more flavorful cheesesteak out of a box at Costco.   Not worth $9.99..."}
{"text":"Great, reasonably priced food in a laid back atmosphere. Good beer selection without being overwhelming. One of our favorite local spots."}
{"text":"I cannot stress to you enough how great their service is. We've eaten here several times, I've had a salad and flatbread among other things.  Honestly the food doesn't stand out to me although it was good; the atmosphere and the service is what made our visits memorable.  We are far from being regulars (3 visits) but the bartender remembered us the 2nd & 3rd visits.  Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area."}
