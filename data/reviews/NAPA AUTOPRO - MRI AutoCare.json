{"text":"I love MRI, the customer service is always great and they are always my first choice.  Peter is always very helpful and friendly and they do a great job,  very very honest mechanics here!   I will continue to bring my vehicle here with anything I need done."}
{"text":"I had to join this app just so i could  give this review. 

I was having no end of trouble with my Chevy blazer and between some shoddy work at another shop and doing a lot of work and diagnostics myself, i finally had enough. 

I looked around for other shops in my area and MRI had some good reviews. I bit.  

I never even met Peter before i paid my bill. Between having to take transit to and from work, i did everything over the phone. I asked them to get my vehicle towed from home, and they got it in right away. Had a diagnostic done within a few hours of me getting them everything they needed (had to drop off my old ECU for them to double check). 

The communication between us was phenomenal and they were able to track down an issue that i would have never found myself. They made me aware of everything they were going to do before they did it and the service was just beyond what i could have hoped for. 

So yeah. Had to create an account to rave about these guys. Quality service, honest/fast work, and i didn't lose an arm for it."}
