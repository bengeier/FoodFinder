{"text":"You know you getting a good gyro at Mike & Tonys..  They have an excellent reputation in the Burg.  We visited this location over the weekend.   Perhaps 3rd time is charm for this building and M&T is here to stay (Ground Round & Buford Kitchen in the past). There was no hostess we were told to seat ourselves.  Our server came over pretty fast.   The menu has something for everyone with a Greek flair.   As soon as I saw the feta and olive plate.. I knew I had to get for a snack (and to bring to work the next day too).   $2.95 for the plate - plus $0.75 for the pitas.. not bad.  Could have used a few more pitas.. there was a lot of olives and feta.

The gyro of course was amazing.. and unforgettable.  The fries were ok - seemed fresh cut but were meh.. little greasy not too flavorful.

My boyfriend ordered the \"Helen Mak\" which was a bacon cheesburger topped with lamb meat.. and of course I had to sample.. was very good.. different $10.95. 

Burgers and gyros come with fries.. which I loved.. because I am more down with fries than chips as a side but wasn't too impressed with the fries.  

NOTE: I tried to find this location on my yelp app when I was there to check in but it wasn't found.. the other locations came up.   

This location is in the moon plaza on University Blvd.   Nice selection of beers at the bar too. 

It was a decent visit.. we will be back Mike and Tony's !"}
{"text":"This new place in Moon is DISGUSTING!!!! Ordered take out, floors were slippery, a safety hazard. They had tables open, but were making people wait because they did not have enough staffing to serve people to sit down. Lemon chicken rice soup was watery, a spoon of rice, 3 chunks of chicken& no seasoning. Pitas were burnt, fries were burnt, & gyro sauce was so garlicky & looked & tasted like I ordered a gyro sauce pita, instead of a chicken pita. Portions were very small & overpriced. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good! Lamb was very flavorful! Everyone was very nice. The only thing was the bakalava was dry but that was minor. Thank you mike and tonys!"}
{"text":"Mike and Tonys is a Pittsburgh staple! My family and I couldn't wait to eat here once we found out there was one opening near us in Moon. We've been here several times now despite reading the negative posts online so I felt it necessary to share our positive experiences. My kids are always full and have leftovers after they eat. My wife and I have tried multiple things on the menu, all of which aimed to please. My favorite is the Athena plate along with of course the original Gyro- flavorful, decent price, and quite large. My wife's favorite is the Greek chicken wrap, onions rings, and salads (which are massive by the way!) Such fresh ingredients! Service is always great and staff has been nothing but friendly thus far. Great drink specials during Happy hour too!
--Now, I could not help but laugh and shake my head reading some of the reviews. To me, complaining that a restaurant did not allow you to bring in McDonalds is absolutely hilarious and ridiculous. In what world do you live where you can bring outside food into a restaurant?? I mean, if everyone did that they would not have a business, right? Seems like a simple concept but I guess it's not. And as for Robert complaining he couldn't have his tomatoes on the side...you either want the gosh darn tomatoes or you don't, why do you need them on the side? Seems like you're doing them a favor not returning. I'm sure they don't need to be judged for being sweaty. God forbid people perspire a little while working hard to serve entitled dummies like these people. Have you been to the original locations? Do you realize it's evolved from a hole in the wall? It's not fine dining by any means but geez people chill out. On behalf of us who love and support Mike and Tonys thank you for not returning! It makes for a better environment for those of us who understand the real world. Everyone who is not Robert and Christina, Do yourselves a favor and get yourself some great Mediterranean cuisine! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is terribly run and unorganized. Unless you have hours to spend waiting for you food, go somewhere else. I tried to place an order over the phone but there was no answer, which should have been a sign. I walked into the restaurant and placed a take out order. After about thirty minutes, I asked the friendly bartender to check on my order. She came back and said my order was being bagged. After another ten minutes, I walked over to the take out packaging area, where the owner told me my food was being bagged. I told her I wanted my money back. I also said that someone came in fifteen minutes after me and already received his food. The owner told me that I ordered chicken so it would take longer. She said it was a family owned business and couldn't afford to waste food. I insisted on my money back because I could not wait any longer for my food.  Forty minutes is a long time to wait on a take out order of a gyro, chicken wrap, and a chicken salad!"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed especially with all the hype everyone was giviving them.  I had a grilled shrimp wrap which was decent but the shrimp wasn't grilled too much.  Fresh cut fries were extremely greasy that none of us would eat them.  Husband loves reubens but said it was not that great and he only ate half.  Took the other half home to a family member, and they didn't like it either.  I've tried the gyro, which isn't bad but was extremely seasoned and the sauce was very runny. Lemon rice soup was good. Will probably give them one more chance."}
{"text":"The food was average at best. Got a standard gyro (what they're know for) and it was super salty. The pita was stale. I also had an appetizer that was also extremely salty. Terrible. Don't wast your money"}
{"text":"Great variety of food for a picky family. Nadine was great. My only complaint would be soggy fries..."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to check out the newest location. I'd heard such great things about the other locations. 
The restaurant is spacious & there is also a full bar. 
The service is fast & friendly. I had my meal within 10 minutes of ordering. 
The food...
loved it. 
I had the gyro served with fries. Generous portions, full of flavor & a nice presentation. 
You will not leave hungry. 
I look forward to my next visit already."}
{"text":"Recently I visited this new establishment in Moon. They are working through issues of being new but in all things are going well. It is clean, spacious, light, friendly staff, a good selection on the menu, generous portion for the gyro, fries were ok but not like Kennywood's but few places have fries that good. 

It took a while for the food to come out but they're new so hopefully it will change. We only ordered two gyro's and one order of fries. The serving staff did apologized even though we didn't say anything, nice. 

The selection in Moon is very limited to this is a positive addition."}
{"text":"Oh my God I got sick every time I ate ate this place. Tasty Gyros that made me sick 3 times. I tried. Sorry."}
{"text":"Always love Mike and Tony's.  They continue their great food and service in Moon Township.  Gyro got have and a great bar selection."}
{"text":"I grew up very close to the original Mike and Tony's spot in South Side, so once I heard they were opening up a location in Moon -- I was very excited. I went on opening day, as well as a few times after. From my experience so far..the gyros are exactly the same as the original location --which is great!  However, the wait for a simple gyro and fries has been unusually long. I understand that they are still getting adjusted into their new location..so management and service could be lacking because of that.  I'm here for the food -- not so much the service though.  If you're looking for a casual place to eat -- I recommend!  It's family owned as well."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night  Our waitress, Coco, made some great recommendations.  The M&T fries were awesome and the steak Gyro was yummy.  Drinks and food prices are reasonable, food portions are generous.  Service was fantastic!!  We will def be back soon!"}
{"text":"The three rating is an average - - - Five for the food - - - One for the atmosphere. Can't beat the gyro or the gyro salad;  but it has the ambiance of a mall food court. Will be ordering take out, but avoiding it for an evening out."}
{"text":"We went a week after they opened and service was decent but not the best. We decided to give them another opportunity since it was opening weekend. This time we sat down, got beers and food. We were out by 30 minutes! Our waitress was new but she was great! The food is always excellent. Would continue to go back!"}
{"text":"We don't eat at many local places, but thought we would give this a try. We waited a long time for a gyro and wings. The place was a little busy but not packed. The pita was soggy and my mild wings were so hot, my gums were burning. This was unfortunate for me as the waitress never came over to ask how our food was or to refill my drink. The wings were cooked the way I like, but the mild sauce is definitely not mild. Nothing I hate more than crappy service. We tried it but won't be back."}
{"text":"Today was our second time here and we had a horrible experience. My boyfriend ordered wings and a gyro with sauce on the side and and I also ordered a gyro with no tomato and no sauce.  The waitress came and brought our appetizer out and explained to us that our gyros would be coming out soon, they had remake my boyfriend's gyro because they made it with sauce on it (not on the side like he asked).  So a few minutes go by and our waitress came out with our food.  I noticed my gyro had the cucumber sauce on it and I nicely asked her if they would remake me a new one since I don't like the sauce and didn't want it on there. Again, a few minutes go by and she comes back almost speechless and embarassed and says \"You're actually not gonna believe this and I can't even believe I'm saying this to you but since it was not written down when I took the order they said they would not remake a new one for you.\"  My boyfriend and I we're utterly shocked and couldn't believe they sent the same gyro back to us and refused to make me a new one. I never in my life heard of such a thing!! I immediately asked the waitress for a manager and she sincerely apologized and said yes no problem.  It seemed like it took forever for a manager to come over but eventually she did.  When she came over we explained what happened and that they remade my boyfriend's gyro after they realized they put sauce on it not on the side but wouldn't remake mine when I asked because it wasn't written down on the waitress' note pad. I simply said if they are not going to make me a new one then it needs taken off the bill.  The manager didn't even apologize after I explained everything and just rolled her eyes, said ok, and took the gyro back to the kitchen along with her attitude. Eventually they brought me a new one without any sauce.  Our waitress came back and checked on us and apologized again.  I questioned myself a few times thinking \"did I say no sauce or did I think I said no sauce\" so I kinda felt bad..but regardless..the point is I have never heard of a restaurant sending back the food and refusing what the customer wants only because it wasn't written down on the order. The waitress was very sorry and continued to apologize.. we understood it was a simple mistake.  She then told us \"they are making me pay for the gyro so you shouldn't be charged.\"  I was disgusted at this point and just  couldn't believe what a horrible place and horrible management here. She came back and gave us the check and both gyros were on there..we didn't mind paying for it since I eventually got what I wanted so I pointed out to her and made sure she also doesn't pay for it. We will never go back again! And I will be calling corporate on the manager with the attitude! Totally unprofessional!"}
{"text":"The food and service were good.   I only had one complaint.  My wife's gyro had onions, but they were VERY THICKLY CUT.  The fries were great.  I am a sucker for a fresh cut fry, but they had no salt on them.  I put it on, but it wasn't a big deal.  

I would go there again, but it isn't someplace I would go to often."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Ordered the suvlaki platter for lunch - carry out - and it was awesome!  Generous portion, fresh, tender and tasty!  Great price too.  Ordered for several in the office and everyone was happy.  Reserving the 5th star for the dine in experience."}
