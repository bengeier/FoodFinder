{"text":"I dont think I have ever left a place with such mixed feelings. I liked Markaz. Actually no, I didnt really. No but I kinda did. Meh, not really. See what I mean?

Lets start with the Do's first:

DO: soundproof that ceiling! Exposed brick and hardwood floors make for an echoing mess in this cozy but chilly atmosphere. If I wanted strangers to hear my every thought, I would walk around with a microphone stuck to my neck. Ya dig?

DO: whisper to your friends because all the tables and staff are going to eavesdrop on your convos. Have I proved my point yet?

DO: Order the sheesha. No tobacco, no nicotine but tastes the same as the one thats bad for you. Good deal. Read Sameer D.'s review for the inside scoop on this concoction.

DO: order the masala chai. A bit on the unconventional side, its a pleaser nonetheless.

DO: check this place out once. The decor is traditional and upscale. The staff knowledgeable.

Now to the DONT's:

DONT: go here with just a $20 in your pocket. This place is NOT cheap. $14 for a regular sheesha. $22 for \"specialty mixes\". Insanity.

DONT: look shocked if the owner brings your tea, points to the miniature french press and chimes \"do you know what this is\".. Umm..do i know what a french press is? Would that be a place where newspapers are printed? 

DONT: get milk with your masala chai. You will be adviced against it and just listen to the guy making all the suggestions and teaching you the mechanisms of the french press.

I like this place but something was wrong during my first visit there. Once the upstairs patio opens and I have another wednesday night to spare, I will re-try the Markaz Cafe and Shisha Lounge.

p.s. they are fully Halal and do not serve alcohol. 

p.p.s they are open till 3am on weekends."}
{"text":"I don't know much about shisha, but the staff was helpful and cordial. Food was good too."}
{"text":"Please read the owner's response to some of the negative feedback on Yelp!!

Yes.....I was extremely ecstatic when I found out that Markaz shut down and jumped with joy. But my happiness was short-lived....Markaz is moving to Mississauga instead. 

However, a failed operation in one city will not turn things around for the owner in a different city. The main problem with Markaz is its ownership. As you can already see from his comments, providing good service is not a part of their establishment. The staff has the same attitude as the owner and refuse to acknowledge your presence for at least a half hour after you have been waiting to place an order. 

We went to Markaz last summer for the last time.....it took them over 40 mins to bring out 2 shishas.....now I know for sure it doesn't take that long to make shishas. This place is always under-staffed and the owner is rude if you ask for anything. We have always received a rude response from him and his staff is not far behind with that attitude. Service and shishas are so bad that for the 40 minutes we were waiting, the couple on the table next to us started chatting with us about how they have been waiting for their shisha for over an hour now and will never come back to Markaz. 

Markaz leaves you with a bad after taste on what could have been a great night elsewhere...nothing else!"}
{"text":"Okay me and some gal pals had a blast here - we love the ambience and ohhhh sooo many cuties to occupy our eyes.

The ambience was just perfect the night we made our way here - cocktails were mixed and made the way cocktails should be made.

Just thinking about my evening here brings a smile to my face - I felt I was worlds away from Toronto...was it Markaz or other influences..not sure...just know it was a great evening."}
{"text":"Me and some friends decided to come here before a movie for some food and some shisha to use up our Groupon vouchers. We allowed for 2 hours for our entire experience.

We ordered some appetizers/shared dishes and asked if we should order the shisha at that point or after the meal. The waitress said they weren't very busy so it should be pretty fast (~5 minutes) to get the shisha so she suggested we order it after the meal. The food took about an hour to arrive.. and the place wasn't busy AT ALL. Unacceptable. When the food arrived, it was pretty tasty but nothing that special.

After dinner, we ordered the shisha but after 15 minutes of it not arriving, we cancelled as we had to leave for the movie.

During this first experience, the waitress was very attentive and pleasant and in her defense, it wasn't her fault for the slow service (likely the fault of the kitchen and people preparing the shisha).

We went back a second time (as we didn't use up all the Groupon vouchers and they were about to expire) and went to experience the shisha. The shisha was nice and this time, service for the shisha was pretty quick. However, getting the bill was a nightmare.

The waitress asked if we wanted to split our bills and we said sure. We paid for the bill using the Groupon and put in some extra cash to make up the difference and needed change. It took 25 minutes and me asking the waitress 4 times for the change before we were able to get out of there. By the 4th time, I had to go up to her at the counter, and ask what was taking so long. She had the nerve to say that we didn't put in enough money because the voucher could only be applied to one bill (remember, she asked if we wanted to split the bill)..  which the manager confirmed was NOT the case and THAT was why she spent  25 minutes to resolve our bill. Unacceptable.

Overall, the food and shisha is decent, the patio is great and the atmosphere is pretty nice (although I agree with the user that says the view of the CN tower is pretty much just the needle and half the dome) and the location is great. The waitresses overall were friendly and attentive.. but it's such a shame that all of this is overshadowed by some of the slowest service I've encountered at a restaurant.

Generally, I am fairly patient at food establishments for slow service if they offer amazing food or have a great atmosphere. Their food/shisha was OK/mediocre and did not compensate for their incredibly slow speed of service and hence, I will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've only smoked shisha here, haven't eaten or drank anything. $14 for melon dew shisha. Lasted us a while, and was a great new flavour that I'd never seen offered anywhere else. Music was authentic-sounding but nothing too crazy, and the place was decorated pretty nicely. Woohoo, a decent shisha place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great location, delicious meals and I really liked the portion sizes. The tea was great and as a big time Shisha (hookah / nargile) smoker I have never tasted a better one anywhere in the GTA. The Shisha's where very clean and stylish. The staff was very friendl. I'll be defiantly one of their regular customers from now on..."}
{"text":"While I didn't love the food or the sheesha, I'd still go back for more and here's why:

- the sheesha isn't great, but hella good compared to any other sheesha joints downtown,
- the food is good...but binocular distance far from great. The fact that it comes with sheesha and a rockin morrocan green tea makes it a little more worth while.
- the ambience! To me, this was the selling point and the main reason I'd return to this place. Cozy booths and a nice decour count for something. While I was there, there was a live musician playing the bongo along with the soft background music which completely turned my frown upside down n actually helped me enjoy this place for what it is!

I'm a Pakistani with a sheesha in my family room...So keep in mind I'm a very harsh critic for both the food and the wacky tobaccy. What makes this place a real winner though is the fact that it's got a lil sumfin for everyone: food that's eatable, sheesha that smokes well and a cozy place to take it all in.

If you're looking for a unique night out, check this place out...the owner is real nice and the city of Toronto needs to do what it can to keep an enjoyable place like this from going under."}
{"text":"This is based on the initial impression!
After reading some encouraging reviews on Yelp, we decided to give Markaz a try last Sat. It was around 1:30 and were quickly running out of viable options in the theater/entertainment district (King W. area) so we jumped in a cab to Richmond, dodged cops and sketch crowd of Richmond (when did this St. get so trashy), and walked towards the shining star that is Markaz...
Alas, it is closed. Owner or manager is just chilling in the back and comes to the door to answer our concerns.
\"Aren't you open 'till 3?\"
\"Do you guys really need to smoke that bad?\"
\"it's not even that, we just rushed here because you're supposed to be open\"
\"Well, I feel like going home early tonight, sorry guys\"

Saturday night. Not even 2 am.....and this is why I'm sad to say Toronto sucks at night.

Thank you

edit after owner's comments:
1-I remember our group pleading with you that we traveled across to get to a place that's open late, and we even had out of town guests. You didn't care. After that point we mentioned if you care if you get a bad review. You also said you don't care. Your integrity depends on how you treat your customers, whether at 2pm or 2am. I wish I could have tried what you had to offer and gave a better review but unfortunately this was not the case and it should be easy to see that this is not the way to treat people who take interest in your establishment. All the best with improving your business; the idea is a good one and perhaps a welcomed change in Toronto.
2-It was barely 2(if even) and not 2:23:54!! Thanks for logging our visit!"}
{"text":"Great location!
Its right beside Yuk Yuks and near Scotiabank Theatre!

I came here last week on wednesday with my friend. The place was empty. . There was another group of 3 ppl..and it was 6pm. We grabbed a seat on their couches and ordered the 2 for 20$ Shisha and some food.

The food was AMAZING for around 10$ you get a big plate full of rice,potatoes,meat,bread,sauses. It was DELICIOUS!!

The sishsa was good too!
We ordered Mango - which is apparently the most popular flavour.
It tasted amazing, nothing like we've ever had!

It started to get a little busier as the night went on. But we didnt realize till after we left that they had a rooftop patio for smoking too!!
So many people were sitting on the roof that is why it wasn't busy! We didnt clue in till we paid our bill!
Next time we are going back to sit on the roof.

We also ordered a Mango smoothie which was SOOOOOOOOOO good!!!

Im deffinitly going back soon!
The music was funky and the atmosphere was VERY Cool and Relaxeed!

The service was excellent too!"}
