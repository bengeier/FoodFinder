{"text":"This restaurant replaced \"I Love Tacos\" in the old Branch Street Retreat building.  Food is okay, nothing special.  There are far better places right in Middleton.  I'm not sure this is even a new restaurant at all, as their credit card receipts still say I Love Tacos across the top.  There was nothing wrong with the food or the service but it was all just very basic and nothing special."}
{"text":"Took 2 hours, they tried to charge me an extra dollar that wasn't specified on the menu, and my friend's choripollo had a piece of rock (slate I think) about the size of a grain of rice in it.  Not off to a good start.  The salsa was good, the food tasted right, and the upstairs patio is... Well, it's not very nice, but it's nice that they have one."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday for bogo margaritas which were very good. The menu is huge and has something for everyone. Definitely will be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend here today. It was just OK. Chips & salsa were very good. I like that the lunch special includes your beverage (non-alcoholic) so it's a great value. The service was good overall. However, the entree was quite uninspired. I had a chicken fajita burrito with refried beans & rice. The refied beans were excellent but the rice was dry & flavorless. The burrito was pretty small and my chicken was dry & chewy. It also lacked flavor. With plenty of competition in the area, they will need to step up their game in order to thrive here."}
