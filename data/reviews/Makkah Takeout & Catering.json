{"text":"Take this review for what it's worth, I've only been here once and ordered just one dish so this review is really based on a first impression at this point.   Makkah is a takeout spot. It's hidden in a tiny little strip mall in a less than affluent part of town. They have big signs outside their restaurant advertising their great prices (5 samosa for $0.99, Chicken Biryani for $2.99).   A minute after I walked into what looked like an empty takeout spot a man popped out from the back room. He greeted me with a smile and pointed me in the direction of the menu. His English isn't perfect but he quite happily and helpfully answered all my questions.  I ordered the Chicken Biryani (it was what drew me into the restaurant in the first place) and was pleased with what I got for my $3.38, cheap eh?!  I'll have to sample more of the menu and report back with a more fair assessment but for now it's close to work and I'm pleased enough to go back again sometime. Also, I should mention everything is Halal."}
{"text":"Only stopped in once (I live nearby, and the signs make this place sound great when passing on the bus) but all they had were a few samosas, they were meh. I never went back, because this place has next to nothing."}
{"text":"This place is great. Me and my co-workers order delivery from this place all the time.    They're naan is super fresh and delicious. We always order extra and keep eating it throughout the day.  They're peas pulao is a great side dish to any of their curries.  Our fav is the Chicken Tikka Masala. Omg. That will light a fire in your bellly! Its super spicy but super delicious.  Only things I would say I'm not a fan of is the amount of ghee (clarified butter) they use in their food. When you order the curries, you have to  skim it all off before you eat...unless you want the heart attack. But thats pakistani food anyways.  All in all, it's really great. We've ordered from this place many times,and will continue to do so.   :)"}
