{"text":"Good chicken, they changed their recipe though. It used to be red chicken, now it's like Costa Verde, a similar Portuguese chicken business."}
{"text":"Good service friendly staff and very tasty food I think this is a good place if you're looking for Portuguese food in the area Weston Road"}
{"text":"I find that there's no better Portuguese place than st. matthew's in the gta. Everything is so flavourful and chicken is juicy and never dry. Only crappy thing is the lack of parking, and service (sometimes)."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time based on other Yelp reviews. Ordered BBQ chicken, potatoes and rice. The food was terrific and service was friendly and efficient. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken, generous sides, allowed substitutions without extra charge. Family has owned for 24 years.  Family is courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of the better Portuguese churrascos.  NOT anymore.  Like all others,  the quality of food went downhill.  WAAAAYYY TOO SALTY!   On my last visit,  I could barely eat it.  No wonder most Portuguese have high blood pressure!"}
{"text":"Dang that's some damn tasty chicken! They give you the option of rotisserie or grilled, I took the grilled and did not regret it for a second."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken I have had, cooked perfectly moist on the inside while crispy on the outside. The hot sauce is the perfect addition. Will definitely recommend this to friends and family. This is my new go to place for chicken."}
{"text":"The best in town. My opinion. Great flavour... Great price, fast service too. Always a great meal."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Churassqueira in town! The place itself is very clean and everything is always fresh. Their potatoes are baked which makes a huge difference compared to the other Portuguese grills on Rogers Road. Their roast beef is my favourite! Every time they have it I get some and am always disappointed I didn't order more. Customer service could improve! The owner can be a bit rude but besides that the food is top notch and I'll always be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Portuguese chicken places in Corso Italia. They are cheap and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"if you want amazing portuguese bbq chicken, these guys are 2nd to none.  the grilled chicken is cooked to perfection.  (crispy on the outside, juicy inside) the hot sauce kinda tastes like franks red hot, but its still really good  the rotisserie is really good too, but the grilled is 100x better.  the pricing is really fair also. for $20 you will get a whole BBQ chicken, a nice serving of potatoes and rice. at swiss chalet you cant even get a whole chicken for $20   i would recommend this place to anyone that loves portuguese chicken"}
{"text":"Still one of the best Portuguese chicken places around. 20 years plus and they're still the restaurant of choice to cater our family events."}
{"text":"Portuguese Chicken is da bomb!  This place has some of the best Portuguese Chicken. Love the grilled chicken, rotisserie chicken is good too, but if you don't get the grilled, you may as well go to Swiss Chalet.  I get it spicy, although they never really put enough spice on it.  Roasted potatoes are actually roasted, not deep fried like some other places. Rice is good too, and it doesn't have olives in it (yuck - olives).  1/2 chicken combo is $9, and comes with rice and potatoes. Whole chicken is $9. Why eat anywhere else?"}
{"text":"really good rotisserie! and the olives (sold by lbs) are super meaty and so tasty. Excellent price. We usually go to Churrasco of St. Clair..this was better, the chicken was bigger and it was a better price. And what we loved the most was the wonderful smile on the lady who served us."}
{"text":"This has to be the BEST Churrasqueira chicken in the city and I've tried several in Rogers area.  I drive across town to come and pick up my St, Matthews, then drive ALL THE WAY back home to enjoy it!  I've stopped buying a quarter chicken because a half chicken dinner is only a couple bucks more and lasts so much longer!  (Plus, I get leftovers for the next day which is right up this bachelors alley!)  I usually get the special with rice and potato balls (hot sauce on the side) which is more than filling and a welcome change from the usual Sub or burger.  Also very affordable at about $11.  The chicken has NEVER let us down and I usually order a shish kebob as well for the drive home!  The smell of the chicken cooking makes you want to eat everything there.  The staff are very polite and friendly.  Even though this place can get quite busy on the weekends, I find that the line moves at a reasonable pace.  The dining room is fairly small so you'll probably want your food 'to go'...parking is quite limited as well being on Rogers so you might have to park on a side street.  Overall, GREAT EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME!!"}
{"text":"By far and away the best chicken in the city. BBQd just perfect, tasty and moist! Hot plates are always spot on as well! Some of the most friendliest staff who are guinely happy to assist."}
{"text":"Pros: Very well prepared food Great prices Friendly service  Cons: Parking is hard to find  My first foray into Portuguese chicken was an amazing experience to say the least. St. Matthew's has some of the best chicken I've ever tasted. Most importantly, it passed the mother in law test with flying colours!!  Came in on a Sunday afternoon for take out. This place us mostly for take out but there a few tables for people to eat in. This place us super busy. There was a huge line spanning to the door as I walked in. Having said that, they're pretty fast at getting people in and out.  Being an Asian guy, when you walk in to St. Matthew's, chances are you will be the only Asian in the entire place. The guy who seemed to be in charge, was one of the friendliest I have ever dealt with. He made me feel totally comfortable for my entire visit.  On to the chicken. The chicken was some of the best chicken I've ever had. It was delicious and moist throughout. Even the breast meat was moist and juicy. We brought the chicken over to my mother in law's place for lunch. She's tough to impress when it comes to non-Asian food but she loved St. Matthew's!! At $13 for a while chicken, she was even more impressed!  The only gripe you solo find with this place is the parking. There's not too much parking on the street so it can be hard to find a place to park during peak hours.  I will be trying the other Portuguese chicken places around the area. St. Matthew's will definitely be my go to when I need to impress."}
{"text":"Best chicken ever!!!! I had leftovers and warmed the chicken the next day in the microwave boy was it ever still fresh!!"}
