{"text":"I have been here twice and both times was very impressed. The Bollywood classic Pav Bhaji is a rather unappetizing looking dish, but it is full of flavour. On another visit I had a breakfast sandwich and was again more than satisfied. The portions are large and the prices reasonable. Dev's is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My tummy rumbled. It had started to rain. I still had a few blocks to go, but I wasn't going to make it! I stopped and looked around. I was right outside Dev's Urban Cabana. I've read about it, been to the website, hadn't been inside. It was a little late for lunch, but you really don't want to deal with a hungry Wendy. Trust me. I wasn't in the mood. 

Tables lining one side of the wall, the kitchen/counter top the other. A small buffet of items available daily from 1130-230. Anything else on the menu available all day. Lunch and dinner boxes can also be purchased for $10.95. I looked over the menu for a good few minutes. And really couldn't figure out what I wanted to eat. A wrap? Pav bhaji? I couldn't decide. A lunchbox it was. Turns out it was a little bit of everything from the buffet! Unless of course you wanted to pick and choose.

One lunchbox meal later, I was stuffed past my brim. That was a whole lot of food. Whatever the chick pea dish was, it was my fave! So good. I asked for the name, do you think I can remember it? Nope. But trust me, just get the dish that's full of chickpeas.

Tip: Don't order a smoothie with your lunchbox. The smoothies are good, but they're huge! And adding that to my meal brought my total bill to just shy of $18. That kept me going the rest of the day.

Tip #2: Go between 2-4pm to enjoy 2-for-1 hot bevvies.

Tip #3: Go soon. Trusted intel tells me Dev's has been sold. So go eat while you can!"}
{"text":"Utterly unique. Dev's occupies the space that was, for a short time, Milano Express, and not much has changed since Dev's took it over: espresso bar near the entrance, counter with steam tables along the rest of the side of the restaurant and a smatterling of tables along the other side. The menu doesn't even seem to have changed much at first glance: coffees and panini look to be the main things on offer here. But look harder and you see things like \"Bollywood Classic Pav Bhaji\" and \"vegetarian hakka noodles,\" which happened to be the two dishes I tried today.

They were outrageously good. Fantastic. The pav bhaji is a sort of puree comprising potato and other things (there's some sort of pulses in there, I can tell, and maybe other vegetables but the flavour is so complex that I couldn't make it all out) served with a grilled bun (this I recognized as a pretzel bun from Rustic Sourdough) on the side. It's light brown and not terribly appetising looking, but the flavours are HUGE and it's incredibly filling and comforting- for $6.95! Also at that ridiculous price is the vegetarian hakka noodles. They're wheat noodles, deliciously crisped with perfectly cook veg (bell peppers done right- not raw, in other words) and, be careful here, chili peppers. Stunningly good, stunning value, please do try this place!"}
