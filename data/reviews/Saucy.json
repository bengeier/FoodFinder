{"text":"I've been here twice so far...The first time I was among a large group during the taste of Streetsville. The service was terrible, I'm assuming because it was packed and they weren't making as much profit on the prix fix menus. The second time was with 1 other person and the service was significantly better. The food and ambiance are good, but not good enough value for price. I ordered the short rib tacos (mediocre) to start and the schnitzel as my main (good). I'm giving this a 4 star rating as it was good overall, but not overly amazing."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my better half. The menu was recently updated to take in the  fall/winter season. My wife was still able go order her Poutine as an appetizer and the pickerel as her main course. I took advantage of the new menu to savour the escargot dish (superb) and the butternut squash ravioli (equally superb). Love the earthy flavours of the season!"}
{"text":"I called Saucy  and left a message to request a reservation for a Saturday dinner at 7pm - I did not hear back from the restaurant by 6:30pm - I had friends coming in from an hour out of town. We were meeting them at the restaurant, so  I called the restaurant on the way. 
The individual I spoke to informed me that they could not honour my reservation, stating that she had called to inform me earlier on in the afternoon but insisted my phone service did not allow for a message to be left. The conversation continued with this person  emphatically defending her actions rather than listening to me as I was trying to tell her that if she had in fact called my number it would have registered on my cell as well as provided an opportunity to leave a message. 
Evidently this person  was more concerned with being right than customer relations. I ended the call out of sheer frustration, quickly made other dinner arrangements at a place we go to regularly,  and moved on.
However, I did call the restaurant back to request to speak to the manager. I got the same person as before , and was informed that she in fact was the manager! I said I felt the situation  had not been handled professionally, and I reiterated that if she had in fact called the right number it would be registered on my phone. She then raised her voice and told me I was accusing her if being a liar! Once again I stressed that her actions had led to my plans being compromised and our out of town guests inconvenienced, to which she promptly hung up on me. She actually HUNG UP!!
A week or so later I went to the restaurant's website and requested to have a chat with the owner, and have not received a response.
I will not be going to Saucy. Ever."}
{"text":"Saucy's a tasty place. I arrived at this destination for a business dinner, and do have to say that it was good! I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area and I do have to say that this restaurant measures up with the taste, quality, and service with many other big city \"good\" restaurants even though Saucy is oddly enough located in a small town named Streetsville and not in the city. Saucy has a classy candle lit yet casual atmosphere. Great place for a business dinner or a casual date. I ordered the sea food spaghetti and got it hot & fresh. Goodish food in a quaint little place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Phenomenal food, amazing service and a great atmosphere. I have tried almost every thing on the menu and it is all great. You must check it out. Whether it's for lunch, apps or dinner."}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely and relaxed, staff is reasonably friendly, food is good, with a reasonable wine list. I had the lobster Alfredo which is filled with loads of large pieces of claw meat. The Alfredo is a little unusual in that they put lemon in with it. Maybe this is common but I've never had it and didn't care for it. All in all it was a good experience. I'd go back ..."}
{"text":"Amazing food but meh service. 
I ate the beef tenderloin & it was just perfect! 
The Caesar salad had the Dressing spot on. 
Nice place for a nice evening but the service was meh!"}
{"text":"Always have loved this resto, great for just popping in for a drink and an app in the lounge or a dinner in the dinning room. Great ambience, we often take our friends there and it never disappoints. They have the most delish apps, the chicken and waffles is my fave!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few menu items (lettuce wraps, mussels, Thai chicken) over a number of visits and wasn't blown away by anything, all seemed pretty average. Service was great and friendly but feel the food needs to be taken up a notch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Im shocked it's only rated 3.5 on Yelp.

Atmosphere is great. The food was delish and a hefty portion size. Service was on point. 

The boyfriend and I chose the appetizer special of the day, which was quesadilla. It was the best quesadilla I've ever had. For my entree I chose the beef stroganoff which was also very tasty. They don't skimp out on the amount of meat in the pasta like some places do.

Pricing is fair for what you get. There's a parking lot right next to the restaurant, which is great. It sounds like a given but for some other restaurants in Streetsville, you have to park on the street or in another lot and walk.

I am excited to come back here and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and it's a cute restaurant that's not too big or overcrowded when we went.  Very modern looking overall with their decor.  We had a table at the bar as it had a more casual dining feel to it.

All the servers that came to the table were extremely pleasant and attentive.  Refilling our waters and just checking in time to time.

So we got the scallops and escargot as an app and I didn't get a chance to taste the scallops, my friend stated the mustard was over powering the dish.  I had the escargot which I enjoyed but as a tip, possibly change the plating style as they had the baguette in a bowl with the escargot mixture on top of it, so by the time I ate it, the baguette was soggy in the sauce.  I would recommend serving it on a plate with the escargot on one side with the baguette on the other side or have the baguette on a side plate.

For our mains, my friend got the lobster mac and cheese and I got the braised short rib.  My friends mac and cheese came with a whole lobster tail and it looked great, I had a little taste and it tasted good.  I had the braised short ribs and I was a tad disappointed as the cook on the rib could have been better as it was still super tough as I had to cut through my meat and it should just kind of fall apart if it's braised long enough.  The server even handed me a steak knife as he saw me struggling trying to cut it with a butter knife.  Also, it was really salty and i was trying to figure out if it was the seasoning on the rib itself or the reduction sauce that was on it.  But it was very overpowered with salt for my liking.  

I'm hoping to try this place again as I wasn't completely disappointed with the meal, possibly try something else in their menu.  Overall an okay experience for me that I would still give it another try."}
{"text":"Atmosphere/decor
Elegant and more fine dining.

3/5
Loved the appetizers. Pernod prawns were delicious served with creamy sauce, and cooked to perfection. This was served with a yummy bread perfect for soaking up the sauce. I wished they gave us more bread. We also ordered the crispy escargot and mushrooms, which was also delicious. it also came with yummy crunchy bread as well.

I enjoyed the beef stragnoff. Although didn't like the braised beef, the flavouring of the sauce was spot on. 

I ordered the black truffle ravioli. It was good the truffle flavour came through. I love that woody earthly flavour of truffles. I did find some of the ravioli pasta seemed a little under cooked and a bit too soft for me. However, the asparagus and tomato that was served with it were nicely cooked. The asparagus added a nice crunchy textural element to the dish. 

Lobster mac and cheese was good. Good amount of lobster and the same delicious creamy pernod sauce from the prawns.

Beef Bolongnaise was my least favourite. Braised beef in a tomato sauce. Felt it lacked a bit of salt and wasn't as flavourful as the other dishes,

The portion sizes were fairly large. 

My dad had the NY strip and lobster and prawns - surf and turf . He was disappointed, and didn't really enjoy this. The prawns and lobster for an extra $12 was a bit small and wasn't worth the extra $12. It was also served a bit cold.

Service was okay. We ordered a coke drink, which tasted like club soda. When we complained this was quckly fixed and replaced. Although, it still tasted weird. The server was friendly, but seemed really busy.

Loved the creme brule was really good. Loved creamy custard like texture and the crunch from the carmalized sugar. Brownie was good, but not as good as the creme brule.

Overall really enjoyed the appetizers and dessert."}
{"text":"The food here is great. 

We ordered tons of apps, and each an entree and desserts. It was a party of 7 for my mum's birthday dinner in October.

I had the lobster and pork, wrapped in brie with veggies. It was so decadent.  The cocktails are nice, but a bit strong. Depending who you ask that could be a positive thing. But in my case, it was not.

The service here is sub-par. 

Our server was absent minded, totally ditzy and was not at all helpful in any way shape or form. No water, no cutlery upon request...no small sharing plates for apps until prompted..

The food is expensive. I understand why, and it is indeed quality food.

However, the service is so terrible that you should avoid this place."}
{"text":"Stay away from the margheritta pizza or any other pizza. I went with a group of 8 and four of us tried the various pizzas. I had the margheritta and the crust was like pita with big chunks of tomato plopped on. Very comparable to Pizza Pizza. Two stars for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Great spot in the middle of Streetsville.  It has a small neighbourhood feel, very cozy, upscale and they serve great food.  The ambiance is perfect for an intimate evening, wonderful for a celebration and perfect for the holidays.   The portions aren't big, but they are tasty and quite creative.  There is ample parking in this plaza, which is a plus.  I love everything I've tried here, from the  pasta, seafood and desserts.  My most recent visit here was for the Taste of Streetsville, which is a three course meal for $35.00.  Everything was scrumptious.  I  have no complaints with respect to the service."}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic.
The service is atrocious.

If you're not in a rush and don't mind having to flag down a server 20 times to get a refill, to place your order, to ask for dessert menu, to get the bill, to get the machine to pay the bill... you name it... then I could see checking this place out.

Food is worth it, really exceptional menu and everything we tried was great. Nice wine list. Quaint interior with a nice patio.

But yeah, wow. Brutal service."}
{"text":"A true sauga gem, make reservations they pack up fast and really popular. They unfortunately closed their pizza place but they still offer a couple of the thin cruats from the menu not all but some. By far their best plate is the Lobster Mac and Cheese as well as the chicken and waffle appetizer you can not miss these items if it's your first time."}
{"text":"Although a friend has been recommending Saucy for years and I've lived in neigbourhood for a long time, I only recently started dining here. Perhaps because the location is in a strip mall and I remember when it used to be a McDonald's, so I was assuming the food wasn't the greatest. I assumed incorrectly. 

Although I only checked in a few times, I've actually eaten here several times with various friends and the food has been good. 

The lettuce wraps, short rib tacos and Cajun chicken soup are delicious appetizers.

The beef & blue salad is great! I also like the burger, tandoori salmon, stuffed chicken, seafood spaghettini, and pizza (Mediterranean, the Woodbridge and Tandoori Chicken). 

The white chocolate Skor cheesecake is perfect for sharing! The chocolate brownie is nice too. The crème  brûlée has a great texture and the flavour changes daily (I had the chocolate mint, which was an interesting combination...but I much prefer an original crème brûlée.) 

The only reason I'm giving Saucy 4 stars instead of 5 is that the quality of the entrées and pasta have varied (perhaps based on the chef working that night?). For example, the first time I ate the seafood spaghettini, it was amazing! The second time, it was a bit dry and over cooked. Similar experience with The Burger where the first time it was great and the second time it was too salty and too garlicky. Twice I ate the Beef & Blue Salad and the steak was grilled to perfection and the salad was dressed well; the third time, the steak was too rare and the salad was overdressed to the point that it was soggy. So, some times the food is spectacular and some times it's okay. I wish I could count on great food EVERY time!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very classy and great ambiance! Perfect for a romantic date. Usually places like these have over priced food served in small quantity but saucy defies this stereotype. The food does not only tastes good but is also good portion! 

Love love love their lobster Mac and cheese! I order that everytime I go there but I am sure their other menu items are just as awesome!"}
{"text":"I came here for a weekday lunch recently with my mom, not having been for years (first time I went was when they had just opened, and I remember distinctly that the spring rolls were amazing!). The restaurant is in a small plaza in Streetsville and most of the other diners looked like business people who work in the area. 
One reason I wanted to go here was because you can get 2 for 1 on any entrees with the Entertainment card (someone was selling them at school for charity, it's like an SPC for adults but instead of just 10-20% off participating places, it's mostly buy 1 get 1 free). Most restaurants that participate are a bit far from major centres, so it's a way for them to attract new customers. 
As far as suburban dining goes, Saucy is a refreshing change from the usual overpriced-with-mediocre-food chains (Moxie's, Milestones, etc.) or massive family restaurants. There's a bar at the front and 1 main dining room, which is small but not tiny. Decor is simple and classy, except for the random fish tank in one of the walls. 
My mom is a regular there, so we got excellent service. 
I had the sliders ($12) - 2 mini burgers with aged cheddar and grilled onions. They were awfully tasty, although perhaps a touch overcooked. It came with a small dish of coleslaw and a generous side salad. 
I was pretty full after that, so just had a latte ($4), which came in an enormous mug! 
My mom had the california chicken pizza, which looked great (thin-crust). 
Even without the Entertainment card, the prices for lunch here are very reasonable - certainly much less than you would probably pay for a similar environment in Toronto."}
{"text":"I liked the food, but I ordered a pizza specifically thinking it was made at the sister restaurant next door (brickhouse pizza) because by golly their pizza is AWESOME.  Instead I got something that resembled a frozen pizza.  (obviously not frozen, but you get the idea)
will be back to try something different."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally for lunch.  Brought a group here last Thursday night after my daughter's confirmation (10 people).  We arrived later (8:30pm) & closed the place down at 10:40pm.  There were only a few other tables occupied.  We got great service from Claire & everyone loved their food from spiduccis, thai lettuce wraps, tandoori chicken bites, baked poutine, pickerel with lobster cream sauce, schnitzel, etc.  Generous servings of wine by the glass too!  Water glasses were filled regularly, limes brought on time.  Very positive, accomodating attitude from Claire.  Thanks!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Saucy opened up last Saturday afternoon just so our large family could celebrate an early Christmas.  They did an excellent job.  Great service.  Great food.  We had drinks in the bar area and then had a large table in a side area.  I hope we come back here for another event."}
{"text":"I wish they rehauled their entire wait staff. Clearly someone is talented in the kitchen because I enjoyed all of my meal but the wait staff is weak point. They were forgetful, slow, and almost inconsiderate. We tried to flag someone down to order after waiting for 15 minutes. We caught the eye sight of one and all she did was look around her and shrugged!! Unbelieveable. We also ended up asking for a jug of water because we asked for our water to be refiled 3 times before someone did it. I will never go back even though I found the food to be very tasty. I had the mussel appetizer (great garlicky tomato broth) and the salmon (nicely charred with good flavour)."}
{"text":"I came here with my aunt and my bf one weekday for lunch. Since it was around the holidays, the restaurant wasn't too busy - I suppose a lot of people must have still been on a break from work. (I've been here during \"typical\" days as well and fair warning, lunchtike can get busy so it would be a good idea to make a reservation if you can.) Anyway, Saucy is a nice restaurant located in cozy Streetsville, in a small plaza with somewhat limited parking (there's street parking though as far as I know). When we were there, service was just okay. Despite it not being busy, I found that it was difficult to get the server's attention. Other than that, the food was very varied, but good. The three of us shared the charcuterie, and my main entree was the lobster mac and cheese which was good but slightly dry. Overall, the experience here was fine and it offered a nice environment to eat and chat, but it probably won't become my \"usual\" when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've been here on a few separate occasions. The appetizers are all extremely delicious; however there are definitely dishes you should stay away from. For the price their pizzas are 100% not worth it. Mediocre pizza at best and price is way too high. Service is okay...one time I went and our waitress didn't seem very focused to say the least.
Overall: Food= 4/5 Atmosphere= 4/5 Service= 3/5"}
{"text":"My two girlfriends and I just recently began a new tradition that on birthday's we will try out new restaurants so we decided since it was a nice hot day (Tuesday July 4th) that we would go to Saucy's in Streetsville. To be fair- our tradition was a little rigged this time around as 1 out of 3 of us has been here before but that's OK!

Anyways, we tried to call and make a reservation (just in case) but nobody called us back- we also left a voicemail. Lucky for us when we got there, the dining room was not too full but we wanted to sit on the Patio which had a lot of available spots. 

Service:
Our server was very sweet and attended us right away and we all ordered a nice suggested shiraz off the wine menu. She frequently came to our table to see if we needed anything and to clear away plates. She also offered us fresh bread for our dip once the dip was sent to us just in case we needed more and we didn't have to wait for any. She made conversation and was pleasant.

Layout/atmosphere:
It has the layout/set up of a fine dining restaurant but certainly more casual. The dinning room area is not huge but is comfortable. When we arrived there weren't a lot of people but once I went to the washroom around 6 ish the dinning room was practically full which is great for a local restaurant on a Tuesday if you ask me. You do get the vibe that some of the customers that go here think their shit doesn't smell but hey, c'est la vie.

Food:
We decided that we were going to split a bunch of apps - which I thought was a great idea especially for a new place.

Calamari:
2 out of 3 of us don't eat pork so when we asked the server if we can get it without she said it was 100% not a problem (we were very content with that answer because we all love calamari and jalapenos). I was a little disappointed on the portion size as it is $12 and the plate did not look full. I thought they would have compensated with more calamari or jalapenos at least since we were not getting the pork belly. The calamari and the chipotle lemon aioli were spot on though.

Lettuce Wraps:
The flavours are great but the chicken was a little off in my opinion. I'm not sure if it was ground chicken or an odd breading but it wasn't the greatest of textures. Luckily, everything else within the wrap was great. It had a great Asian slaw, pineapple and a peanut sauce which all worked very well together.


Jalapeno & Artichoke Dip: DELICIOUS! I'd probably just come back to eat this. The dip itself was so flavourful, cheesy and was just mouth watering. The fresh bread sticks look as if they are made in house and are so fresh, warm and just melt in your mouth. I couldn't get enough of this dip. 

Jerk Chicken sliders: Out of my comfort zone on flavours but it was VERY GOOD. The jerk chicken had a great kick to it and was spicy but not overpowering and unbearable. It had great sweet (pineapple) flavours and textures (creamy coleslaw). It was very yummy and came with 3 which was perfect for sharing.

Warm Chocolate Brownies with Baileys infused Ice Cream: Since it was my birthday we all decided to share this DELICIOUS treat. The brownie is dark chocolate brownie base and was so moist and fresh it just melted in your mouth with the ice cream. It was accompanied with some blueberries and strawberries and was the perfect treat to end our evening.

i'll for sure come back to Saucy's just to try more of their menu items and see how other evenings operate and so forth :)"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Came here for my 16th birthday party and haven't stopped coming since. Food is amazing, service is great, and the atmosphere is high class, but not in a pretentious way. It's in a little bit of a strange area, but it doesn't affect the quality of the restaurant at all."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Saucy to dinner tonight. We were seated at a very nice table in the corner of the restaurant. We were served water and a coffee which we ordered as soon as we sat down. We were ignored for 45 minutes and the waitress kept passing by our table and totally ignored us. We finally got her attention. I told her we have been here for a while now and would like to put our order in. She didn't apologize said ok what would you like? We ordered our meal and all was good. We paid our bill which they were very quick to bring. All of a sudden the waitress approached our table and TOLD us to leave the table because someone else wanted it! The restaurant wasn't full! She told us we can sit at another table! We couldn't believe how unimportant we were to them. This was very upsetting. I didn't dispute because i was stunned. I dine out quite a bit and this has never happened to me. Extremely disappointed. We felt VERY INSULTED AND FELT SMALL! I will never go back."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday one year off of a recommendation and it's a WOW for me. The food so tasty... great portions."}
{"text":"Great food, I have the shrimp stir fry dinner that was amazing, our waitress Maureen had a bit of an attitude at first, but warned up at the end.  She was the only thing between a 4 and a 5 rating.  I will come back, but ask for a different waitress"}
{"text":"The chef at this restaurant BLEW MY SOCKS OFF!!!  What an imagination!  
I am coming back here and bringing my friends just to see what else this guy has up his sleeves.  I sampled some items that were not part of the regular menu...and every single one of them was FANTASTIC.  The staff were great!  The owners were great!! 

So.... I'll be back!  Stay tuned!"}
