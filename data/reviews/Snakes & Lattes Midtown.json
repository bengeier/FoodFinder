{"text":"Loving that there is a snakes and lattes uptown!! Great game selection, good service and coffee items (didn't eat any food). Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This location of Snakes & Lattés is the largest of three currently in Toronto. There's the usual setup where the entry lobby has displays of various board games for sale, plus a boutique style barista bar and pastries display. Then there's the seating area in the back plus upstairs where there's a large selection of Boardgames for people to play in the café. Their drinks menu is very similar (almost exactly the same) as the other locations, but their food menu is slightly different. The chicken tenders, Peruvian chicken sandwich and the prosciutto bacon caesar salad are particularly good! The play all day seating fee is $8. The staff are very knowledgeable on most of the boardgames and are happy to help you get started. If you love boardgames and lattés, or you want to introduce someone to boardgames, then this is your home away from home! If you arrive early when there are still many available tables, feel free to ask the staff for a table that is near an outlet so if you wish to play a board game that has a corresponding phone app to go with it, you'll be set."}
{"text":"Along with the $8 base fee for all-you-can-play board games, Snakes & Lattes offers a bunch of different food and drink items.   I got the poutine and my friend got the max&cheese. The poutine came in this large bowl, definitely more than enough food if you're looking for an afternoon meal/snack. The cheese curds were plentiful and melted nicely with the fries. Personally, I felt there was way too much gravy (it basically pooled at the bottom) and it was super salty. Definitely a savoury dish and I drank 3 cups of water during the course of the poutine.   The max&cheese was baked, with some extra seasoning on top. The macaroni was pretty spiralled and the sauce itself was quite creamy but light.  Overall, decent choices if you just want to something to satisfy your cravings while you play some board games."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to Snakes & Lattes. I was surprised how big it was (two stories and very spacious) because of it's location...it was also really new and clean. The waiters were very friendly and attentive...introducing themselves and refilled our water frequently. They had a huge assortment of games and they were very well-maintained. I saw other visitors came by just to have a drink and chat, a few others were on dates, and some played board games with a group of friends. The board game fee was $8 + tax + tips for the whole day :) I went at noon on a weekday so there was no wait! A few steps away from Eglinton Station."}
{"text":"The service was great here. The wait was a little long on a Thursday night but our waitress was very attentive. I also got the chicken tenders and they were pretty fantastic, I really enjoyed them. I also got an italian soda (mix of passionfruit and peach) which I also enjoyed. Definitely like this location more than the other ones. There's also a green p very close."}
{"text":"4.5 STARS  I'm impressed with the newest location of Snakes & Lattes. Went on a Thursday night with three friends and it was reasonably busy but there was no wait.  THE FOOD- We just had some apps, the dips and the buffalo cauliflower. The dips, while homemade, were a bit bland and unbalanced, not something I'd recommend. The buffalo cauliflower was delicious and I loved that the sauces were on the side so we could have as much or as little as we wanted.   THE DRINKS- My friend had a mocha, he's a bit of a coffee snob but was impressed with the presentation and taste. They don't have a liquor license yet which was a bit disappointing.    THE SPACE- I love the look of this new location, it's bright, modern and spacious. The two floor design makes it less noisy and crowded.  THE SERVICE- This a key part of the S & L experience as you often need someone to recommend and explain games. We got some good recommendations from our server. He sent someone over to explain a game we had found that he didn't know how to play. Our game guru was patient and friendly but didn't do the greatest job of explaining the game and actually confused us more than necessary. But I feel like this is just part of their growing pains and will get better with time & experience."}
{"text":"This is a great, comfy spot to spend an evening playing games. I was happy to see several vegan options on the menu. The vegan poutine was delicious. The staff really know their games. One staff member recommended various games to us and then came to our table to show us how to play each one. Great service, my only complaint is the $8 per person fee to play games. I feel like games should be free if you're spending over a certain amount on other services-- I spent $50 on food and drinks.  Otherwise, it's a fun place to visit in midtown."}
{"text":"Great place to have a great time with your friends! Lots of games to choose from just $8 and it's all you can play! Drinks n food are a little pricy but that's how they make money so it's ok"}
{"text":"I'm good, thanks.  ~$40/2 people for less than 2 hrs of play. Came in expecting the awesomeness of S&L Bloor, left feeling used and abused (?)  1. Asked for a booth, instead, got chairs. We pointed to cushy bench, was given stink eye then brought there 2. Asked if open till 2am, sever said yes (in a \"I hate life\" tone) - I was asked to pay bill and leave by 1:30am, latest (We arrived round 11:40pm.. and left at 1:30am, hence less than 2 hrs) 3. Last call was at midnight?! (no food AND no drinks after that) 4. \"Gurus\" - nobody knew the game we picked up, then they all left round 12:30 am, so no help after that 5. Washrooms were freezing  In other news, food was meh and overpriced, but S&L always had meh food. The hostess was nice.....S&L, why did you stray so far from your formula on Bloor? We miss that on Eglington :(  *Try CODENAMES (fun game)"}
{"text":"I was excited when this location opened.  I came here with my brother, his gf and my partner.  We had been to other locations before and knew there would likely be a waiting list, so we put our name down and planned to have dinner there and some drinks.  We put our name on the list and said it was about an hour so we went next door to have a drink and some fries while we wait.    After the hour we got the text and went back to Snakes and Lattes and only then were told that they didn't have a liquor license.  WTF?  Our whole point was to go there for dinner and drinks while we play games.  They could have told us that when we put our name down on the list.  We ended up buying a game, going to the LCBO and just going back to my brother's place to have our own game night at home.    It's a good location, close to restaurants and other places you can grab a quick drink while you wait for your place.  I'll definitely come back b/c the pros outweigh the cons, but the first experience soured me."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out Snakes & Lattes for several years now, but the wait times were always kinda ridiculous (2-3+ hour waits on average whenever we tried in the past). Maybe the fact that this one is new worked in its favor (it's still kinda in \"soft opening\" mode according to one of the employees), because our party of four were seated almost immediately when we walked in.   On that note, they let us know that because it's a new location that they didn't have their liquor license yet, and probably won't get it until the middle of January 2018. So if you're the type that needs to be sloshed before you're ready to settle in Catan, maybe remember that it's not an option yet.   Anyway, the space is nice, and the booths can easily fit six people comfortably. There's only one restroom as far as I can tell, but there's a red/green sign that lights up to let you know if its occupied; that way you don't have to get up until you're sure the restroom is available.   The food was surprisingly good; we tried the traditional poutine with beef gravy, and I also got a Nutella latte for myself, and both were yummy. I'm not sure why I was surprised that it all tasted good though. Probably because I assumed that it would be like any other game/arcade/bowling place I've been to where the food is an afterthought.   The only negative was the weak-sauce service. The young hostess we dealt with when we first walked in was great, but our servers were overall kinda shite. We had to remind the girl who took poutine order that we were still waiting on food when she came to remind us that full dinner service was no longer an option. Our water glasses weren't filled until I requested it. And then both of the servers who were taking care of us apparently went home without telling us that they were leaving, so the young hostess lady had to take over to get our bills for us.   Poutine split three ways + two Nutella lattes + $8.00 (per person) cover charge + tip came to approximately $39(ish) CAD, or $32(ish) USD. I suppose you could not get any food at all and just pay $8.00 (per head) to sit there all night, which is not a bad price for a night of board game-related entertainment with friends."}
{"text":"A gigantic space and no doubt my new go to location when I want to spend an afternoon playing board games. This location has two levels with gigantic booths, regular four top tables and smaller bar tables for groups of two. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and had no issue grabbing a table upon arrival. One of the guys working there was great with helping us choose games suitable for two players and another one of the staff members was able to quickly explain one of our game selections when we realized we had no idea what we were doing.  It's now $8 per person to play, up from the standard $5 but I'm not sure if this is just at this location or if this has been changed at all three.  This location didn't have their liquor license yet so we stuck to caffeinated drinks. I had the standard cappuccino which was pretty standard but a little on the small size for the price. My friend tried the Nutella latte and absolutely loved it.  Overall it was a great afternoon and I'll definitely be back here next time I'm looking for a chill hangout with friend  UPDATE: Went again this past weekend and though it was much busier, given the vast amount of seating we were seated right away, this time on the upper level. If you're planning on visiting on the weekend I would strongly recommend you come to this location as there was still another section that was completely empty the entire time we were there.  This location finally has its liquor license so we tried the vodka Cesar which was great (very spicy).  My one complaint is how few games are for two players. Each time I go we end up playing the same games or at least have much fewer options than had we come with a bigger group."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great afternoon of playing games and drinking lattes. The chai tea latte is amazing. I deducted one star because the pico de gallo that we ordered was just okay. We would definitely return and try other menu items. A great place to hang out for a couple hours on a cold winter s day!"}
{"text":"Finally checked out the new snakes and lattes location at yonge and eg. It is much bigger than expected, spread over two floors. Service was very slow and inattentive but as we only needed drinks before settling in to play, I didn't mind. The food options are comfort food and snacks. I didn't eta on this occasion but everything that came out of the kitchen looked and smelled great."}
{"text":"OK there's a new Board Game cafe/bar in the hood. Time to check the place out since the little guy is off for March break.  We were hoping to go over early for some breakfast and take advantage of the free play time. But by the time we woke up and got ready, took care of some work (me, not my son) and got over there, it was 11:50am.  Free game play ends at noon.   So much for the free playtime, but they still offered to serve breakfast if we ordered quickly. We both got the Standard -- two eggs, challa toast (no butter -- that was odd) a pile of McCain frozen home fries with some bits of chopped up peppers, and a meat of choice (Chorizo and bacon in our case). $11 was a bit pricey for a basic breakfast that I will call 2 stars, maybe 3. One nice thing -- they offer half salad half home fries which still gives you enough of the potatoes that you're not left wanting. (Unless you want real home fries, like not cut from potatoes last month then flash frozen and stored in a bag to wait for my order.)  The table next to us got nachos which was huge. But it was $17.  Coffee was great -- got a latte and then later an Americano with steamed milk, both were fairly priced, superbly made, nice and strong flavour. Americano was a bit small but that's OK -- other chain places give you same amount of espresso in twice the water, and you lose half the flavour. (It's a \"grande\" illusion of value.)  Atmosphere was good -- very cool two level setup, but it was pretty loud even only at quarter full. At full bar capacity, I can't imagine playing a strategy game that requires thinking, or any kind of game that requires talking with your friends. There is lots of different types of seating (bar tables, low tables, booths, banquette, etc.) for you to choose from. But I'm guessing the high bar tables are too small to play many games.  Game selection looked OK but I didn't pay too much attention. We played four games and found damage/missing pieces in three of them. For a fairly new place, this is not a good sign. Our usual cafe doesn't have a liquor license and their games are in much better shape. Do I detect some correlation here?  Anyways it's a decent spot to go for a coffee or drink with friends and have some fun. My review was picky but considering its not really supposed to be \"restaurant\" I will give it a break on the so-so food.   Cons are $8 price tag and lack of parking (or at least reasonably priced parking) in the area.  Extra victory points for having a circa 1972 copy of Probe, a game I played when I was a kid. Looking at the box made me all teary-eyed and nostalgic. Where did you guys dig that up?"}
{"text":"Great place to go have a fun time with the family or frienda. Lots of selection of games and great friwndly staff.  Have been a couple of times and we love  it.  Looking forward to them getting  their liquor licence but even without it's still a totally worthwhile outing."}
{"text":"A huge board game and cafe/bar place to hang out with friends. I came here with a group of 10 people and we got a table at the very top floor. It was separated from the rest of the place so it was nice and not too loud. It was kind of like a separate room but an open space.  The place was decorated nicely with a colourful theme and modern decor. Its very spacious with 3 different levels.   They have a huge variety of board games and you can play for $8 excluding taxes. They also have a nice variety of foods and drinks but can be a little pricey.  I would definitely come again as its a great place to hang out with a large group of friends and the closest snakes and lattes place from me."}
{"text":"I have loved the Snakes & Lattes concept from the beginning and still do.  Where else can you get your geek on, drink (or not), in a fun atmosphere with a super enthusiastic staff?  I like this location a lot, and the only thing I found lacking was that for the huge size of it, there didn't seem to enough games.  I would think in time they will be adding more.  Other than that, keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Snakes and Lattes midtown is located a walk away from Eglinton and Yonge. The newest location of this board game cafe and eatery is similar to the other locations where they have a wide variety of games to choose from (where each person has to pay only $8 for unlimited hours of fun!). Board game experts were also available to help you with deciding which games to choose!  My party of 5 decided to have brunch and play games on a Saturday around 12:30pm. We were able to get a table and ordered drinks and had brunch. We never felt rushed with deciding what to order as the waitress was very friendly and attentive to our requests. I ordered The Standard (2 eggs, bacon, salad, toast). Food was good and portions were definitely enough to fill you up. My party and I were able to eat and play games for a few hours in the afternoon which we all thoroughly enjoyed. Will be back for more fun!"}
{"text":"Snakes and Latte has finally expanded  outside the downtown core! This newest outpost is located at Yonge and Eglinton and offers plenty of seating between its two floors. They've got a great selection of games here just like their other locations, and boardgame gurus are always on hand to teach and make recommendations for games.  They are still awaiting their liquor license, but the menu here is otherwise the same as their other two locations. The food is decent enough for what you're paying,and comprises of pub food along with snaking options and caffeinated drinks.  The seating fee is now $8, but it still grants you unlimited playing time without a minimum purchase of food/drinks. Overall, a great spot to hang out with friends during the rainy and chilly seasons of the year! Since this location is still fairly new, the wait times are not as insane as the downtown spots yet (i.e. I only had to wait 10 minutes for a small table this past sunday)"}
