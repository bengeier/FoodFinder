{"text":"Ordered through SkipTheDishes. Huge disappointment.  The combo plate (two meats) had no separation of meats (all mixed together, wtf, I didn't even order two of the same animal), had gravy on only half the rice (wtf, this isn't even the expensive part, come ON guys), and came with a gross limp garden salad with peppers (no coleslaw, again wtf, of course they don't tell you this on the menu) and mushy unseasoned rice with minimal peas. Meat was OK. Nowhere near worth the price. The combo plate from here had about as much as a medium dinner order elsewhere, except it had more rice and cost about 1.5x as much.  Portion sucked, sides sucked, price not worth it. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Decent jerk chicken and lunch place. Check out the specials. Reasonably priced and good portions."}
{"text":"Fairly ordinary Caribbean joint that serves your usual jerk chicken, oxtail, curried goat and the like. I ordered the large sized jerk chicken dinner for $12 and it came with a garden salad over top a bed of rice and beans. I thought the choice of salad over the usual coleslaw side dish was interesting (and probably healthier?). The jerk chicken tasted average though, as it was a bit dry and smaller in portion than I was expecting (compared to other places).   The restaurant itself was very clean and the staff were friendly. Overall, an okay place for Caribbean food in the area."}
