{"text":"The food is great here but the bartender is very attentive.  Every time we have been in there, we have to wait for another drink, she is constantly at the other end of the bar on her phone."}
{"text":"Just like Cheers...there's a Norm and there's a Cliff and most everyone knows your name or will learn it before you leave. Great good old fashioned bar food with amazing pressure cooked wings with home made sauces. Clean glasses...yes I pay attention to the bartenders washing them or just rinsing them off. Clean nice bar ladies room also. I check their facebook page (El Dorado) for lunch specials for my husband and I to stop in together too. Stop in....you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Omg! GFW! (great f *ING wings!)  And seriously amazing fries!  The bartender was sweet and friendly, as was the owner.  We're looking forward to stopping here again soon!!"}
