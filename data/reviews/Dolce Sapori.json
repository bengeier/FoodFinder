{"text":"Very disappointed with the service we received.

Server barely acknowledged us. mistake in our order, had to finish my meal before my bf got his. spent over $100 on terrible service and mediocre food.

I work in the service industry and i know for a fact that you should always make up for the mistake you made when it comes to your customers.

the manager gave us a dirty look right when we came in, didn't even discount my boyfriends meal after getting it a half hour later i finished mine....

never going back."}
{"text":"The gnocchi was quite delicious and the service was excellent! The place has a good taste of what it takes to be a modern Italian restaurant. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I have ever eaten. The owner and head chef, Dom, studied in Italy and knows what top Italian chefs are doing now. This is more than just your grandma's Italian cooking, thus is traditional mixed with modern techniques.

The atmosphere is meant for a group of friends or business colleagues. The design helps each table engulf itself into the food and the conversation. Everything is served family style and before you know it the food is eaten, multiple bottles of wine are gone and three hours have passed. 

I know I'm a fan!"}
