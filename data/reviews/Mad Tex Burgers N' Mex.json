{"text":"Friendly staff and quick service.  Love the tortillas and salsa to start.  The wet burrito with green sauce, chicken soft tacos and the fajitas are among my favorites.  I wish they had a better craft beer selection though.  That would earn them their 5th star in my rating."}
{"text":"Got takeout burritos once on a whim when I was shopping in the plaza. The staff was super friendly and turned the food around fast. Burritos were good - obviously fresh ingredients and that's important to me.  Came back yesterday with a friend for dinner. Of course you should start off a Monday night with a tequila shot! They have an extensive tequila menu and while the shot prices were higher than I like, they were *considerably* less than other places nearby (ahem). Our server was great, took a lot of time to go through all the options (as we were indecisive) and gave a generous pour. The margaritas looked delish but it was a neat liquor sort of day, so we didn't try them.  On to food...we started with chips and guac. First, I am not a fan with the trend these days of restaurants thinking it's acceptable to add sour cream to guacamole. It's just not cool and is a rip off. Fortunately their guac is dairy free, so that's a big plus in my book! A little smother texture than I prefer, but the avocados were the star, so A+.  We had fish tacos and chicken flautas, which did not disappoint. I would definitely go back. They did have a number of tvs and a full bar so if you're looking for some place new to watch the game, give this place a try."}
{"text":"We (family of four) came out to dinner on a rare gorgeous Thursday night here in the CLE. We entered around 7 pm and we were the only customers. \"Uh oh\" went through my head. We grabbed a booth and ordered drinks. I asked our waiter about the veggie burger I had heard about only to be told they no longer have it- didn't sell. I asked if they had any other vegetarian options besides tacos/burritos and he suggested the salads. Thanks, that sounds different! Not. Actually all of the salads had to be modified in order to be vegetarian- so I skipped ordering an entree for myself. Boo. The rest of the fam did order however. The pulled pork \"burger\" was apparently the BEST thing on a pretzel bun he has EVER had! Seriously couldn't stop groaning in delight! The other one couldn't stop mmmmm-ing about his bacon burger! The little one ordered wings (buffalo) and said they too were sooooooo good. Our server was very friendly and kept our drinks refilled. The bill was over 60 with tip which is a lot for 3 entrees and 4 non-alcoholic beverages. Which I think is a lot considering the place serves up the food in plastic trays lined with paper. I was also pretty bummed about the veggie burger getting 86 off the menu. I suppose I would go back when I was in the mood for tacos."}
{"text":"We went there on a Tuesday evening. Didn't know exactly what to expect but were sadly disappointed. The atmosphere suggested a fast casual restaurant like Chipotle or Qdoba but a quick survey of the menu showed that the prices did not reflect that. The burgers were all standard fare as was the Mexican food on it. There was nothing to separate the menu from one you'd find in an actual Mexican restaurant or a Burger joint, save for a lack of interesting items on it.   Standard at any Mexican restaurant is complimentary Chips and Salsa. Sadly, this was on the menu for $2.95. The burger we ordered was fine, nothing remarkable. The fajitas were in the same vein but for some reason, did not come with sour cream. After asking the waitress for a side of it, we had to wait until I made eye contact with her while she was texting at the bar before she came over and brought it to us. Worse yet, it wasn't actually sour cream, but rather a cilantro-cream sauce. Although said sauce was good, it was vexing that after asking the waitress for sour cream, she didn't bother to mention it was their own version. How does a Mexican restaurant NOT have sour cream?   As for the waitress herself, we had to ask about the \"Two Buck Tuesday\" special and were only once asked if we needed anything else. She seemed very disinterested in us, which seemed odd considering there were only about 7 other people in the restaurant at the time. It's not too much to ask for you to welcome me to the restaurant, tell me the specials, and ask how everything is.   Normally, I could deal with a place like this if the prices reflected the entire experience. You can get a better burger at Five Guys and comparable Mexican fare at Chipotle and there you don't have to deal with non-plussed waitstaff who charge $.50 for a side of \"sour cream.\" Will not be back."}
{"text":"Highly priced, garbage food. The ground beef is an absolute joke. Ordered a Mexican pizza, beef bland, dry, did not complement the other ingredients. The crispy shell underneath the mess did not hold up well and became soggy and wet very quickly. The burger was no better. Just more of the same bland, dry, rubbery beef. I love Mexican food and was very excited to try this establishment. Nothing but disappointment."}
{"text":"We loved the food. We had the jerk dry rub wings, chips & queso, and fries. The food was a knock out. I just couldn't understand why this place only had 3 tables on a Monday night at 6pm. Well when the check came we figured out why. The waitress whom up to that point had been great changed her tune. The board that has their specials on it said Mondays were $5 burgers & 49 cent wings. Well since we got the wings based on the special we mentioned it to the waitress. She said the chalk artist needed to come to update their board since the wings were no longer one of the specials. OK?! So why didn't you erase it? We went ahead and paid since she offered no solution. When she came back she said sorry but mentioned that there was a postcard that we could fill out and send it to someone and we would both get a free app. The postcard also had the Monday Burger & WINGS special. Wait - now why would I send someone I know FALSE Advertising.... This is why this place is not packed. Even if you have rock star food....with bad service you won't last much longer."}
{"text":"walked by saturday night, sign on the door says \"we are permanently closed\" YIKES!!"}
{"text":"Driving past Mad Tex this past weekend my wife and I decided it may be a cool little trendy Tex Mex place that we would like. The inside of the restaurant kind of reminded us of a Chipotle with the sort of fast food feel. The food was very average. Two things really stuck out to us about this restaurant, neither of which were the food. First, when ordering my wife asked to substitute another one of the sides with her meal. The waitress said she could and told us it would be $2 which was the same price as buying the side ala carte. So you can substitute, but actually are just buying another side while getting the one that comes with the meal taken away. Next, we asked for a side of barbecue sauce with a chicken sandwich. They charged us for this. That amazed us. Nickel and diming customers for a 1 oz side of barbecue sauce is certainly not the way to run a sit down restaurant. Even a fast food restaurant wouldn't do this. When we saw this charge on our bill we immediately decided that we wouldn't be back out of principal. We frequently eat out and I can't remember ever being charged for condiments. This restaurant will not be there for long so if you're interested in trying it you should check it out soon."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on a Friday afternoon and the place wasn't too crowded.  I had a chicken burrito sans tortilla and it was really good.  My lunchmates had a burger and chicken quesadillas.  For the food, I'd give this place 4 stars.  Interestingly, like a previous reviewer, we may have had the same person waiting on us.  It started with him telling us that there was a large group seated ahead of us, and the cook was by himself, so our food may take awhile.  While I appreciated the heads up and transparency, it also felt like an invitation to leave.  On top of that, his sense of humor and snarkiness was somewhat grating.  It's never a real good idea to openly challenge customers, even in the name of humor.  For this reason, I'd give the service here 2 stars.  If I'm in the area, I'd give this place another try... hopefully with a different staff."}
{"text":"The reason this place is only getting two stars from me is because the service was terrible. I went here on a Sunday, and the place was totally dead. I walked in, and it was very confusing on what to do---seat yourself, wait for someone to seat you, or are you supposed to walk around the side and go up to the bar..?? There was only on server working there, and eventually he came over and said, \"Just two? Sit anywhere\" Ok..so we looked to see what sports games were on the tvs, because we wanted to watch the browns game. When we told the server that, he rudely said \"well what game? there's a lot of games on.\" Really dude? There's more than one BROWNS game???? For the rest of the time we were there the server was very sassy. I think that was just him trying to be funny, but I was not ok with it. At least feel your customers out first to see if they might be ok with that. I definitely wasn't. It also took 15 minutes to get our drinks. 25 to get our bill. And remember: the restaurant was dead.  The food was actually pretty good. We did the nachos for an app, and there was a lot of stuff on them, and they were some of the better nachos I've had. I also ordered a burger, which was all right. I normally get them well done, but I think it would've been better if it had been medium. When we gave the server our credit card to pay, we also gave him a $10 off Foodie Cleveland card. First he has no idea what it was, then he said their restaurant never signed up for it, and that the specials listed on the card were no longer specials they had. This confused me, because just over my shoulder was a sign that had the same exact specials that were listed on the card.  I can't really see myself saying I need to definitely make a trip out to the restaurant again...unless I have a really bad craving for some good nachos."}
{"text":"The wait staff is down right funny, attentive and over all great. They seem to know what they are talking about. When I commented to the waitress about the flavor and what was in my dish, she was happy to ask the chef about what the flavor might be, and while they couldn't tell me exactly what it was, they seemed very knowledgable in various things it might be. This to me showed that they knew a lot about the food they are serving and had tasted it themselves as well.  Food was/is very flavorful, and while it's listed as tex mex, I think that the chef has some experience in authentic Mexican recipes. I will definitely be a frequent customer when looking for a Mexican fix."}
{"text":"The food is good as long as you don't stray from what they are good at...and that is mexican. Don't get crab cakes, don't get a burger...even though it is part of the name of the place. Get Mexican and you will not be sorry.  I think it is a good alternative to fast food mexican and a mexican restaurant that drowns everything in cheese with a blob of refried beans. Wait staff so so, not good, not bad. On my list of places to go."}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing out of this world. I would come back if the service wasn't so terrible. The server was so rude to me and my coworkers that I still don't know why we stayed."}
{"text":"The food was fine. And just that. Nothing special, but not bad either.  I asked for enchiladas with carnitas in one and chorizo in another. No can do, you have to get all the same filling. I've made many a restaurant enchilada in my day, so I feel qualified to say that's b.s. But fine. I see the kitchen is much too busy preparing food for the one other couple in here.   ...Asked if I could get the Brussels sprouts ($2.50) instead of rice and beans ($5)... Yes but for a small up charge. Not true. I was charged in full for the rice and beans AND spouts.   We also ordered the flight of guac/queso/salsa for $9. When we got low on chips, the bartender/server asked if we'd like more. Sure, we said. That was an extra dollar added to the bill, but never expressed.   We ordered a beer. Weren't asked what size (short was what we wanted). We ended up with an $8 tall.  It was a series of sneaky little ways to bring up the bill that I'm quite sure were intentional (and came out of her tip, so I hope she enjoyed being sneaky). As a former server of close to 10 years, it's tough for me to tip under 20%, but she made it pretty easy.  The two people working the floor were texting the entire time, literally right in front of us, no attempt to hide it. They did their side work in front of us too, and were clearly eager to get the heck out of there as it was 9pm on a Saturday and dead (not my fault).  The server/bartender also let us know, as she boxed our food, that her boss makes her do it and she thinks it's stupid and went on to a story about it, bashing said boss. Super unprofessional.   Service isn't boxing someone's food. I could give a crap less about that. It's not being so gosh darned petty about what fillings I can have in my enchiladas and up charging me for everything you possibly can. I spent $9 on chips & dips and still got charged $1 more for chips I was offered. I spent $13 on enchiladas and still got charged an extra $2.50 for Brussels sprouts that were cheaper than the sides I said I didn't want. It's not about the $3.50 extra, it's about the pettiness of it all.  They'll be out of business soon. We have lots of better places in this area that are similar in theme and a billion times better at service/running a business."}
