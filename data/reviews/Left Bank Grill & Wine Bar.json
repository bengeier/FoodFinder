{"text":"Horrible service..It took us two hours to dine in this restaurant...just one waiter for the whole dining area...food was medium quality and I believe their desserts were bought from stores and not made in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommend to me and I was honored to be taken there on a date.  Unfortunately the recommendations and ratings for this place are overated.  It would have been nice to have tried the food to here however that never happened.  We were left waiting for over 45 minutes for our 8:30 reservation.  Fair enough as the place looked busy. But not to be offered any explanation for the wait when asked, or any compassion from the maitre d' was another sign this place was sub-standard.  The maitre d' didn't even think to offer us seats at the bar or offer seating while we waited; We were standing for 45 minutes waiting for our table.  Two other couples arrived after us and got seats at the bar, and the only explanation from the maitre d' was \"it is a free for all.\"  WTF.   We asked to talk to the manager and he arrives 5 minutes later and says \"our table will be ready in a few minutes.\" with no explanation as to why we are still waiting and not given priority with the bar seating.  Another 10 minutes of waiting and we walked out.  Lots of other restaurants in the area and we dined like one would expect somewhere else, at reputable, high class, and quality establishment, which the Left Bank Grill & Wine Bar is NOT!"}
{"text":"Sould Session nights. A prix fixe menu and open bar! Plus an excellent musical trio. Portions were good and the food was excellent. Atmosphere even better!"}
