{"text":"Came here for a valentine's day.

Ordered rigatoni pasta and penne arrabiatta.

Both good, decent spot, not the greatest, wouldn't come back.

My lady got a free rose from the waiter though, lol."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good food.  The wait staff was a little bit unattentive, but otherwise we had a really nice dinner.  I had the Chardonnay which was a really nice wine.  I gave 3 stars instead of 4 because of the wait staff....we also did not get any bread with our dinner which I thought was a staple at most Italian restaurants!"}
{"text":"We came here last week because we wanted a meal out on the patio and thought we'd give this small family-run restaurant a try. We ordered the gnocchi bella vista and quattro staggione and we were not disappointed. The food was fresh and tasty, while the server was kind and attentive. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"One Friday night while in Little Italy.. I was in search for a quiet place that I could enjoy with a female friend, I decided to pass on the popular posh joints and settled into this low key restaurant which looked some what family run but professionally run.. to best describe it.. it's similar to the good looking quiet girl at the party that had everything going for her and didn't need all the flashy bling and labels that the rest were fronting. Not packed, not loud.. it was just right! and I was instantly a fan.. I decided to see what this place was made out of and ordered the most expensive items offered.. Special was Beef Tenderloin and Alaskan Salmon which we both ordered with some red wine. Now to describe the food as I dined.. it was amazing.. the beef melted in my mouth as easy as the salmon did.. and both dishes were cooked perfectly.. I never tasted anything so good and would recommend this place to anyone who appreciates great food.. and to top it off.. the head chef himself came to my table and introduced himself. This is by far my personal favorite destination in Little Italy.."}
{"text":"The food is OK at the place but I'm not quite sure it's authentic Italian. I ordered the roasted chicken and it was served with a gravy glaze that tasted like it came out of a ready-made packet. This restaurant is no where near the high standard for Italian food in Toronto. 

Service was okay. The place was dead so that was to be expected. 

My group ordered a pitcher of the white wine sangria and it was AWFUL. The worst I've ever had. It was so watery, served with ways too much ice, and didn't taste at all like wine."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 3.5/5. The service was attentive and the staff were friendly. We came here for winterlicious and I would say the best dish was the calamari, it was cooked well and not chewy. The other dishes we got which included the gnocchi and veal were good but not something we would crave for again. 
This is a good spot to try if you are looking for a good meal in a quiet spot (it wasn't busy hereon a Friday night)."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious. The restaurant is located in the heart of Little Italy and interior is pretty and cozy.
I ordered the Stuffed Calamari appetizer, Salmon with Creamy Dill as my main and Tartufo for dessert.
My friend ordered the Portobello mushroom with Goat cheese appetizer, Gnocchi with Pesto Cream sauce and Cheesecake for dessert.
My stuffed calamari - i would rate a 5. The squid tasted a bit under cooked and the stuffing was tasteless. The Portobello Mushroom with Goat cheese was delicious because i love Portobello mushrooms and I love Goat cheese. 
For our mains, the Salmon was cooked perfectly however it could use more sauce on the plate as it seemed dry. The 'creamy' dill sauce could make the consistency more creamy as well. Thankfully my friend gave me the rest of his pesto sauce.
The Gnocchi was great however it felt very heavy. It was stuffed with Ricotta and spinach. I think a few pieces of those would be enough.
The Tartufo was great and the cheesecake was ok.
Overall the meal was a 5/10. Winterlicious menu was at a low price point. $25pp for a 3 course meal. Service was excellent though and food was fast."}
{"text":"Needing some fresh air along College St west in little Italy I came across Bellavista.... What seemed to be one of the many family restaurants in the area. 
On a quiet Saturday night thankfully this place was not busy. .. But again it was after 11ppm. 
I ended up sitting at the bar with a glass of chianti and a serving of bruschetta on the side to compliment the wine.
The food was lovely and you can tell our was not ape bought! But made fresh in house. ... My server aka bartender was very friendly and we were able to have a pretty good chat about the upcoming World cup fixtures.

Overall this place is clean, classy and the variety of food is exceptional among with their prices. During the summer season they have a cute patio. . So be sure to take advantage of it"}
{"text":"The service was awesome... I've seen some places where the serving staff aren't as friendly during the Winterlious/Summerlicious events but our server was outstanding. I look forward to going back. Did I mention the food was awesome... The Butternut Squash Ravioli and the stuffed chicken were outstanding.

Yours truly,
Pleased Winterlicious Guest... :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for summerlicious. Decided to eat outside for inside was too warm and not much ambiance. 
Food in general was good. Grilled calamari was generous portion. Salmon was a bit overcooked but decent. Tiramitsu was a bit disappointing and small portion. 
Service was not very good. We were the only table that night but had to repeatedly ask for more water. 
Nothing too special about the place but ok."}
{"text":"Slow and inept service, weak drinks, and bland, minimal-effort food.

Understaffed. The frazzled (and apparently new) server had to ask us to repeat our food and drink orders multiple times, apologizing often. The server actually refused to take our food orders when we ordered drinks. We had to ask for utensils. It took an hour after we were seated to receive our entrees.

The martinis and cocktails may or may not have had any alcohol in them. The pasta seemed indistinguishable from dry grocery-store pasta and canned sauce. Disgraceful.

We were overcharged for an item on our bill and had to point out the correct price on the menu to the server."}
{"text":"Bruschetta is good, especially the Bella Vista version with goat cheese and red peppers.  Our group was generally satisfied with their food as we had many different mains.  Pastas and pizzas were all good.  Service was OK.  Not a very popular place on College St. allows for easy access even on a Saturday night."}
