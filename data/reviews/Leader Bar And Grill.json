{"text":"Favorite lunchtime location in downtown Cleveland. Love the food and outdoor patio. Stopped for after work drink last night on patio, and got to see some filming too. Chatted with owner who is really friendly, so important for good service! Celebrating a team victory or after work gathering with friends, nice welcoming place, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stumbled into the Leader last Friday evening having just gotten into town. Little did I know that my planned \"snack and one drink\" would turn into a whole evening. Within minutes, I'd been invited to the HOB to see George Clinton and plied with liquor. I'm sad that I had to come home. I want the Leader to be my neighborhood bar!  Great place. Owners are awesome people. Good beers on tap. Great food. Go. Now."}
{"text":"I was downtown cleveland and stopped by the leader. Everyone was very friendly and my wrap was the best I've ever had. It's worth the stop."}
{"text":"Try the daily specials the draft beer is always cold and fresh!"}
{"text":"Great food, had the blue burger which was awesome. Would have rated 5 but every time the door opened the place dropped 10 degrees."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Great daily specials, and awesome bartenders that make you feel like a regular!"}
{"text":"If I could give this bar more stars I would...service and beer selection is the best in the city and the setup is perfect for watching sports. This place is without a doubt the most underrated bar in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Traveled from Atlanta to Cleveland to see the Browns home opener and stopped in as we were walking around town.  My buddy (former bartender) said his Long Island Ice Tea was the best and our wives raved over their Bloody Mary's!  (I was happy with my cold Dortmunders!)  Had a bite to eat and the food was enjoyed.  Everything that came out of the kitchen looked great!  The staff was friendly and accommodating, the place was spotless and we enjoyed watching pregame shows on nice big screen TV's.   It's a great place for pregame as it's so close the stadium. Will definitely stop by on my next trip to Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Husband & I decided to check this place out after our time at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. So glad that we eventually found it cause the food was really good! We got the hummus to start and for entrees I had the black bean burger & he got a cheeseburger. Icy cold beer too! Really enjoyed the food & service, will definitely come back the next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch downtown and/or drinks after work. The food is better than most formal restaurants to be honest and between the taps and bottles, they have one of the best beer selections in the area by far! Bartenders are great, owner is usually around and makes sure everyone is solid, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little bar in a good location. A few blocks from Playhouse Square, good live music (at least on weekends, anyway), good food, and a good beer selection. My kind of place."}
{"text":"I had a great time there. The selection of craft beers is great I really enjoyed the ipa's. Atmosphere and music was fun, would love to see the place jamming with a band upstairs! Management was friendly and even hailed a cab for our group so we didn't have to stand in the cold. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing veggie burger wrap. Off the beaten path and great for tailgating or hanging before games. Recommend it for lunch on weekdays!"}
{"text":"Drinks were great burgers were slightly over ordered midrare got med but tasted great. Only one person working both grill and bar. Came in on Saturday around 6pm, will stop back in when in town."}
{"text":"Is this place for real? If you're looking for a small DIVE bar, then you've chosen wisely. Food is super limited and they were out of Jack when we visited! I would make another choice."}
{"text":"Tiny little piece of home in the heart of the city. Great place to hang out after work, meet up with your crew before a game, or have a nice glass of whatever you drink(nice whiskey selection) without breaking the bank! I was surprised to see interesting healthy bites on the menu (along side traditional bar fare) and impressed with the flavor! I went on a Monday evening for a work event and I noticed the staff was just as attentive to customers walking in as they were with our \"corporate party\". Service means the world to me!  I will be keeping Leader on my short list.   PS...Ladies, I had to take a bathroom break. I bring this up for 2 reasons: #1 - the bathroom is in the basement--be careful of the stairs including the step up into the bathroom!  #2 - the bathroom was most clean of all public bathrooms I'd EVER seen/smelled."}
{"text":"This \"restaurant\" does not even deserve one star.  Two of us went to the Leader Bar and Grill for lunch.  We were the only people in the place.  We ordered our food and waited, and waited, and waited.  One-half hour later, still no food.  We finally asked for our food \"to go\"  Then we waited and waited again.  Eventually, we were given our food \"to go\".  When we opened the boxes not more than five minutes later to eat our lunch, all of the food was undercooked and cold.  Never again!!"}
{"text":"Solid bar.  We were staying at the Marriott Downtown for a wedding and looking for somewhere to watch college football.  We found it.  Always a good sign for a sports bar when the owner (Jeremy) goes out if his way to not only find your game but pays a premium  to get it on TV.  (It was a bit of an obscure game.)  Great taps, great food, great bar. I'd recommend for anybody looking to grab a burger and a beer....and some college football."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad service!! I came here before and it was good I thought, or else I would have put one star,but I was also pregnant the last time I came..... water down drinks all the way down to the lemonade, I'm almost  95% sure that they cut their liquor and their juice and soda too(is that even possible ). They iced tea container looks like it missed more than a few cleanings eewh. The food is just barely ok....I ordered a patty melt well done,and it was well done but no seasoning at all!! My cheese wasn't melted and the whole sandwich was kinda cold with only a few fries which was fine cause I'm tryna lay off the potatoes anyway.  Now I'm not the type to typically complain all the time,but I do believe that if you are paying your money, the food and service should be satisfactory. So I am saying go here at your own risk, maybe just to grab a beer before the game or something and just keep it minimum and simple. Oh wait I forgot to mention I asked the bartender did she know how to make a Long Island  (I only order those when I'm skeptical )she said yes yes !!with excitement and then asked the other bartender for direction on how to make it.....smh . Tasted like a glass full of coke and gin."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection and good bar food... Turkey Club was especially delicious!"}
{"text":"Leader Bar is one of my favorite downtown spots for a weekday lunch.  It's convenient for folks who work in 200 Public Square and are looking for a casual alternative to the East Fourth restaurants.  Service is friendly and usually pretty quick for a sit-down place, which is important during the workday.  The food isn't going to blow your mind, but it's good enough and has improved within the last year since their menu was updated.  Personal favorites are the Breakfast Sandwich, which is scrambled eggs and bacon in between two pieces of Texas toast served with tater tots, and the Black Bean Burger.  It's a small space and the inside fills up fast, so it's better to arrive earlier during the lunch hour rather than later.  During cold weather, you want to try to grab a seat or table near the back because the draft when the doors open can be incredibly cold.  The two door system they have going on now is helpful, but not everyone follows the sign to not open the second door until they've closed the first."}
{"text":"A great home town bar in the same building of the Cleveland Browns first offices; circa 1945. Close to the Hyatt Regency at the Arcade."}
{"text":"Patty melt was super!  Great service too.  This bar has a BIG selection of draft options. We were looking for IPAs, and there were several. NOTE:  this bar is not on W. Superior.  It is on Superior but is across the street from the public library.  Find it!"}
{"text":"this place was ok. i am a picky vegetarian and the menu was pretty limited. i ended up with grilled cheese that took about 20 minutes too long to make. 3 beers later, still waiting .. would have been more tolerable if the beer selection was better and the beer list was visible - it is written in a corner with a table in front of it. the people eating at the table were probably wondering why i was staring at them so much. not a lot of local options when i was in."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience!  I'm in town for a couple days and just wanted a place close to my hotel for drinks and food for dinner.  Saw this place close and looked relatively inexpensive so figured, why not?  Easily best decision of my trip!  The bartender was friendly and very easy to talk to.  The food was amazing -- had the Tuscan bean and sausage soup which had a wonderful flavor and the mushroom Swiss burger (with tater tots!).  The burgers are fresh, never frozen, and made in house and you can tell -- it was melt in your mouth good.  Definitely recommend stopping by for some good (and inexpensive) food and a very nice draft and drink selection.  If I come back to Cleveland, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great establishment for party of 1. Great value with service to make you feel at home. Will return here before any hotel bar. Groups looked like they had fun also."}
{"text":"This cute space has been many things in my tenure as a downtown office worker, but I think it has finally found its stride. The Leader Bar's menu has something for everyone, but not an overwhelming amount of stuff. Their burgers are excellent, as are their salads. Standouts are the black bean burger- even as a die-hard carnivore, I dream about it- and the pear and goat cheese salad. And you can choose actual vegetables (as well as fries and tater tots) as a side to your sandwich or burger, which is refreshing.   The servers are always very efficient and friendly. It fills up pretty quickly during the lunch rush, so arrive early if you have a larger group. My sole misgiving about the place is that those lovely high ceilings bounce noise around, so I always feel like I'm going deaf while trying to talk to someone. Totally worth it for the food, though."}
{"text":"Great spot. Close to work. Everyone has positive attitudes and is happy to serve you."}
{"text":"Great veggie burger. Homemade black bean patties. Service can be slow but the food is always good and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"If you're in Cleveland and in need of a beer, well, \"You Better Call Saul\"!  Great bar, great prices, good craft beer selection on tap, better than average menus, perfect place to party before or after a Cavaliers game. Saul is a really personable bartender. Felt fortunate to stumble upon it. You could do a lot worse and spend a lot more in Cleveland. Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. Had the turkey rueben it was awesome. Very nice atmosphere for a beer on the patio."}
{"text":"I work walking distance to this Bar and wanted to stop in to try the turkey everyone raves about for lunch today.  I got the cobb salad and asked for Italian dressing with no cheese. The salad was pretty filling and the turkey was as good as the reviews said. But the waitress did not listen and I got balsamic dressing and cheese all over my salad. I was able to push the cheese off to the side so I didn't complain.  But still annoyed since we were the only people there for lunch."}
{"text":"If you are downtown, definitely keep Leader Bar in mind for happy hours and pre-game drinks and food. I love all the \"fancier\" places on E 4th, but to grab a quick cocktail after work with a friend or coworker, it can sometimes feel like a bit of a production to go to, say, Lola, for a simple happy hour. There aren't too many places downtown (that have a patio) where you can get unfussy service, drink cheap beers and eat really, really delicious burgers. Leader Bar keeps it simple, and I am a fan of that.  I've tried a lot of stuff on the menu here, and everything has been delicious! My favorites are the hummus, the southwest wrap, the BBQ burger, and the black bean burger. And tater tots, of course.   The owner, Jeremy, is always hanging out at the bar, making sure everyone is taken care of and happy, and the servers are all awesome!   Tip: Ladies, use the restroom at your own peril if you are wearing heels! It is nice and clean, but getting to it involves both steep stairs and an oddly placed step right by the door to the ladies room. I can't believe I haven't faceplanted even once yet!"}
{"text":"A can of v 8 and and vodka does not make a Bloody Mary. Not sure why these reviews are so good."}
