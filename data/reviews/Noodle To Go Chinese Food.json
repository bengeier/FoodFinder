{"text":"We tried out Noodle to Go this weekend as it's our new local Chinese Take-Out place. My Husband thorough enjoyed it but I wasn't as sold. It was far from the best Chinese food I've ever had but we would go back. I'm inclined to check out other options in the area.The fried noodles were delicious though!"}
{"text":"Great authentic chinese food with fresh Ingredients! 
Crispy noodles with chicken, chicken fried rice, fried tilapia, black pepper chicken are my favourites.

Prices : 5/5 average is about $10.00/person 

Customer Service : 4/5 

Taste :  fresh and flavourful food 4/5 (losing a point because of inconsistency in adding ingredients which affects the taste every time and especially if you repeat the order)

Value for money : 5/5   10% discount on Cash transaction :) so don't forget to run to the bank machine before."}
{"text":"The food was ok....typical of a Canadian chinese joint. Chicken balls are not authentic!  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good, either. 

And it was dirty!  The wind had blown in all kinds of debris when the door was opened but some of the other stuff had been there a long while. It's obvious cleaning isn't a priority.

The woman I dealt with was wearing blue gloves and never took them off. She handled the phone. She handled money. She handled our food. All in the same gloves. There was a child behind the counter with a ringworm spot in his head. At least he didn't touch my food as he was too busy playing on his tablet.  

Still looking for good chinese in Brampton with decent service. 

I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the only real Chinese food take out in Brampton.  I ordered from here often. You can't beat the value.  If you like low sodium, just request when placing your order.  They can also make home style dishes if you order ahead and place a request."}
{"text":"AVOID IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES! I had been to this restaurant before and had a good and a negative experience but thought let's try again. Definitely should have rethought this. I ordered $60 worth of food and asked that no mushroom be put in to the food. I drove out in to the cold 15 min each way, to pick up the food, with gas prices at 123 and hoped for the best. Of course when I got home there was mushroom in my food. I promptly called back to the restaurant and advised them of this. I was asked TO DRIVE BACK to show them the food. They told me they had 2 people check the food for accuracy and quality, Clearly missing the large black Chinese mushrooms in my food. I advised the woman I spoke with that I had an allergy and could not eat the noodle. She told me to bring it back at my leisure and that she would give me a FREE one. What is free about food you have to drive twice to get because they made it wrong with NO care for a customer's order? I told her that she was not offering me something free but rather inconveniencing me to collect food a second time that they made wrong. She HUNG up on me. This is how this restaurant treats a well paying customer who troubles themselves to provide a clear order and request. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, especially if one has a food allergy, because clearly THEY DON'T CARE!!!"}
{"text":"Fried noodle dishes are my favourite for sure!  
I've been here many times now and tried all the fried noodles dishes. All have been fresh and hot, and worth the value.  
The combo diners for one were more just average Chinese takeout, but has still been fresh tasting. 
I still am a continuing customer here!"}
{"text":"Noodle To Go is the best Chinese take-out in Brampton, by far. The food is always fresh and the recipes are authentic, not Canadian-Chinese, but without being too \"scary\" for average palates. All of the noodles dishes are excellent and the Chinese Fillet Mignon is delicious. The Family Meal deals are really good value if there are a lot of hungry people.
  The staff is also very accommodating. I hope this place stays in business because it's the only take-out place I ever use,"}
{"text":"Was hunting for a spot near my work for a quick bite and Noodle To Go came up as one of the better reviewed locations so it naturally became our \"go to\" location. 

They do some very well priced lunch specials and the food was pretty good for a quick and budget friendly Chinese restaurant. Bonus points for not skimping on the portion sizes. I like the fact that they do dim sum, but preparation would have taken too long so I opted to go for a rice and chicken dish. Dim sum would have to wait for next time. I was also happy to discover that the food was not extremely greasy as I've experienced in other chinese/Hakka locations in Brampton, so they inch closer to a 4 star vs 3 for that too. 

And take the name \"To Go\" seriously here because they don't offer any room for you to stay and enjoy your meal. Definitely a place I'd revisit if I'm in the mood for a quick and cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Was north of Brampton and this restaurant came up, decent reviews so gave it a try. Small store front, take out only. There is a seating area and a tv on the \"order up\" counter. I assume this is a family business and I am happy to see the lady at cash wearing gloves. Tells me she is aware of germs being in brampton and all - if you pay cash; and your order is over $20, you get a 10% discount on your bill - $20 before taxes.  I found their menu difficult to navigate online but I ordered the crispy noodles - chicken and shrimp.  There were 4 large shrimp in the noodle dish. The sauce poured onto the crush noodles was better than some of the other Asian restaurants I have tried in the past in brampton.  I also wanted rice so I got the combination plate with two items; chilli chicken and general tao. The chilli chicken is definitely spicy and general Tao was good too, tasty and flavourful. The rice was a bit bland but a bit of soy sauce made it taste better. Also got the spring rolls, which is 2 for $1.80. There was enough food for three people with leftovers! Good quality and price for a quick meal. Will definitely order again to support this local restaurant that is not a chain! :) ps I took pictures for easy reference."}
{"text":"Friday night we felt like Chinese food but didn't feel like ordering a ton of food.  I wanted rice she wanted noodles.  So I pulled out the menu that I got from Noodles to Go.  I had tried this place once when I moved into the area and it was pretty good.  I noticed on the menu they had combo items for one person.  I chose the 2 meat items with fried rice and an egg roll and it was around $10.50.  If wanted to substitute the rice with noodles then it was an extra dollar.  Price sounded great to me.  When I went to pick up the food was just brought out so it was piping hot.  When I picked up the bag I wondered why it was so damn heavy considering there were only 2 containers in the bag.  When I arrived at home and opened the containers I was wowed to the size of the portion.  There was a ton of food.  The rice was very tasty and fresh.  Egg roll was your standard egg roll.  My 2 meats were General Tso Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork.  The sweet and sour was great.  The General Tso was just ok I probably wouldn't order it again as it wasn't for me.  None the less I finished it.  Not liking the General Tso was just a personal choice.  There was nothing wrong with the way it was prepared and cooked.

To conclude I will be returning to Noodles to Go and for anyone of you planning on trying the  single combos you better be hungry."}
{"text":"I've wanted to check this place out for some time but never got to it until today. I was craving noodles for lunch and remembered this place. Upon reviewing what fellow yelpers thought of this place, I figured today's the day!
And this place did not disappoint. The selection of food is big, there's something for everybody, noodle dishes, rice dishes with chicken, pork, beef ...everything is there. Lunch specials are amazing too. I had a beef noodle dish for just over $7 and the portions are big. I can eat a lot but after the lunch I was completely stuffed. This lunch was so good, I had to go back that evening to order dinner for the whole family. Between the mother in law, wife and myself and three kids, we had a feast of wonderful noodle and rice dishes for just over $30. 
This place is amazing and I could only recommend it. This sure won't be my last time i was here."}
{"text":"Great chinese food, and good portion size for what you pay for, and FAST.  My dish was ready in 5-10 minutes.  I got the black bean beef noodles and they lasted me for 2 days.  I wish there was more description on the menu as I thought I was getting one thing and ended up with something else because the description only said \"noodles\" (not hakka noodles or chow mein).  Will be back to try more!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars.

The portions are large, prices are decent and the food tastes good. What I really like? The food isn't salty and oily which is rare for fast food Chinese Take out. I've had a couple noodle and rice dishes and the bbq and looking to try more items on the menu.

I will be going back."}
