{"text":"Service is awesome. So nice. Every time I am in there. Food is great! Love the breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Beats most large chain restaurants if not all. Good portions good prices fast service."}
{"text":"Just not up to par for I want from a Mexican spot.  Better than Taco Bell or Chipotle? HELL YAH!  I went with 2 tacos, red pork and red beef. Went with the refried beans and rice on the side. It was OK. Tortillas weren't soft, meat was a bit chewy, but the fresh ingredients were very good.  Also order Chips and Queso, very basic and boring.  I'd probably go back b/c they're down the street from my office, but wouldn't go out of the way for it.  If you're all the way up north, strapped for time and want Mexican food....Its probably worth a shot. Just not very Legit in my book."}
{"text":"I really liked their chips and salsa as well as their street tacos.  But their Horchata was horrible, but they were nice enough to give me Jamaica which was good.  I mixed their salsa to get one that I thought was perfect:  about 1/4 hot and 3/4 mild gave it the right kick and flavor for me."}
{"text":"Great simple fresh Mexican Food. Fast and friendly! I had the small breakfast burrito, which was equivalent to a large at most other places. Several salsa and pico was delicious. Very nice and locally owned business."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere, and always wanting more! Can't say enough good about there staff, and location .  Thank you Habanero Fresh! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fellow green chili lovers unite!  Just tried the green chicken burrito here...delicious!  Just a little heat on mouth watering green chili flavor - muy bien!    I watched their service line for an hour.  Man, did they keep it moving!  Yet, still made everybody's just the way they wanted.  Obviously, a lot of regulars here, and for good reason.  Gotta love these little hole-in-the-wall diamonds.    Will bring my hungry teenagers here next time they ask for Chipotle.  Much better!  And small local business.  Make sure to get your frequent guest card because you'll be back.  (I have no affiliation with Owners at all.  Just a(nother) impressed customer)"}
{"text":"Just happened to come across the place. Good food and a nice selection of options!!!  The staff is fantastic and takes the time to work with you to make sure your order is the way you want it."}
{"text":"We walked in 15 minutes to closing - first time there - the staff was SUPER polite and so AWESOME! They even said we could stay and eat if we wanted even though they were prepping to close! They walked us through their menu - everything is amazing! We have since been back and are 100% satisfied! If want great tasting food with a friendly staff? This is your place!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp.  I found this great little place because of the Yelp reviews.   Could the guy working behind the counter be any friendlier?  I love going into a place where they are so proud of their food.  He was just beaming. :) I went in just after the lunch rush and the seating area and bathroom was super clean.   That's the time of day when you would expect it to be a bit messy.   Flavors were fresh and homemade tasting.   I got the punch card and I will be using it."}
{"text":"This is an incredible Mexican restaurant in a location that has few options. The place is perfect for lunch or takeout and the food is clean, good quality, and cooked well. The meats are marinated well and the flavor really comes through. This is going to be my go-to Mexican place in the area. Glad I found it!"}
{"text":"If you like to eat in small,  personalized,  and super friendly places with good food, then this is the place for you.  It's a diamond in the rough.  Small menu keeps it simple but you get to choose how you like it.  They even have daily specials.  Try it out.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was visiting another business in the mall and saw this restaurant and gave it a try for lunch. I'm glad I did as the food was great. Burritos, tacos, salads, quesadillas and enchiladas were the menu items. The fun part is you go down the line (like Subway) and add your ingredients. Each ingredient looked and tasted fresh. Prices are reasonable.  If they served beer, it would be a 5 star."}
{"text":"This place is hella fresh, from the tortillas to the cilantro to the grilled steak, my tacos were delicious and from the first bite I became a bit depressed knowing that these tacos would soon become extinct inside my belly. EAT HERE if you want some gnarly good mexican food."}
{"text":"Yummmmy! My first visit and I was totally impressed with the freshness and myriad of flavors. I ordered a burrito with roast pork, pinto beans, pico and the works. It was very fresh. I loved the tomatillo salsa, however, I do wish they had a salsa bar.  It gets crowded at noon so go early!"}
{"text":"My lady ordered the burrito bowl w/ the tortilla at the bottom of the bowl, green chile chicken, rice, black beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, cheese, and sour cream. It comes with a side of tortilla chips and salsa!  ;)  I ordered the 2 tacos w/ rice and beans combo. I went with flour tortillas, grilled chicken, lettuce, pico de gallo, and cheese. They have some amazing green salsa, MMH!   Their guacamole is awesome!  Their service is great!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and super nice staff. Breakfast or lunch, the burritos are great!  Make sure you get a punch card!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good. More choices than chipotle and the quality is good for what you pay. Staff is very friendly. I love the refried beans"}
{"text":"Seriously good Mexican burritos. Definitely crushes Chipotle in terms of choice and flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious food with nice big portions, easy ordering, fresh tasting and great customer service. This was my first visit and I will definitely be back. My ONLY suggestion would be to stay open past 5pm."}
{"text":"Eating a quesadilla right now and I can't believe I haven't eaten hear sooner! It's soooo good! Salsa is on point and portions are generous. Never going to chipotle again!"}
{"text":"Extremely solid breakfast burrito, this is a great go to place when you want something delicious in a hurry. They offer a hot or mild salsa, being a chili lover I get the hot and it has excellent flavor and a nice heat level. The staff is very friendly and the place has been very clean anytime I have gone."}
{"text":"When it comes to Mexican food, you gotta wow me to say the least. 5 stars. Healthy portions. Clean place. Friendly. Tastes are not overbearing and chili was on point. Very deceiving spot, near other businesses on the south-side of Deer Valley.  I recommend for Mexican in the north valley."}
{"text":"Good food, (I regularly take-out lunch from them) but no matter who's behind the counter, it always seems to take a looong time for them to make a simple burrito."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch around 1130am on a Saturday. There were 4 adults and 3 kids 3years - 6 years old.  We had never been here before saw it as we were driving by and decided to give it a shot. Its not in the best strip, but the inside is nice and clean.  We order: 2 burrito's plates one w/ Green Chicken one w/ Green Pork 2 #3's one with cheese one with Grilled Chicken 2 kids cheese quesadillas  1 kids bean burrito  All the food was GREAT! the green pork (pork with green chillies) and the Green chicken was amazing. The kids ate all their food with no complaints. The prices were pretty good for all the food we had.   They have refried, pinto and Black beans all were very good. the Gauc was good and only 75 cents extra not a dollar something.   Will definitely be back to try the tacos, and the rest of the menu. Very good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"WOW a real surprise in this small cafe style eatery. Top block for the food. Without a doubt the best refried beans, rice and very best ground beef. The chicken was moist white meat and the guacamole just fabulous. The atmosphere could use a lift but well worth the self serve ambiance. Oh I do like the old fashion sturdy chair.  Will be visiting this place often."}
{"text":"Found this place based on reviews and location. We were not disappointed!  Not sure of why anyone would give a bad review unless they are just never happy.  Our server was great. We ordered the guacamole and salsa and both were fresh. Chips were great and warm! The  tacos were loaded with amazing carne asada."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to succumb to my cravings for delicious Mexican food.   I highly recommend asking to sample some of the various meats they make from scratch before deciding; there are almost too many choices.   I am always going to be a fan of a place that follows the build-your-own meal model, has extremely reasonable prices and portions, and keeps a clean establishment.   PS - cliantro lovers, rejoice; they offer it on the cold line and will fill your dish like it's lettuce if that's what you're into!"}
{"text":"Live right around the corner from this place and finally stopped in to try it and it was delicious! I had a ground beef burrito with chips and salsa. All of their salsas are so fresh and the green especially has a ton of flavor. You can tell the chips are made fresh and the customer service was fantastic! Will definitely be going back, only complaint is that I wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service, you can't ask for more.  Just don't use the Yelp Eat24 app to order, they will send you coupon codes you can't use and not send your order to the restaurant.  This is not the fault of the restaurant at all, I just have to complain here because apparently there is no way to leave a review for Eat24 on Yelp.  Where's the transparency?"}
{"text":"We ordered for pick up and ate it at our office.  It was awesome.  We are having it again today.  We ordered the burritos, nachos & taco salad.  Very small location and parking not too easy but it overall great experience."}
{"text":"Just had the shrimp tacos and they were great! Ton of shrimp and I really liked the coleslaw and sauce! I have eaten here a few times before and have had the chicken salad and the sausage, Serrano breakfast burrito is my fav! Even though there was a line when I walked in, I was able to order and be served quickly. The staff is super nice and friendly with a family like feel. I will definitely be back to try some different items on their menu."}
{"text":"First time here...didn't look at reviews first so I got lucky because this place is great! Staff is really, genuinely kind. And they are full-on accommodating for my vegan wishes...and it just so happened the woman ahead of me didn't want any meat either (we both got tacos). Two different staff workers are constantly picking up, sweeping, and simply cleaning (thank you for caring). The tortillas (I got flour) are the GOOD kind...know what I mean? Freaking good quality tortillas!!! I'm noticing as I'm sitting here that half the people are repeat customers because they are being greeted as such and chumming it up :) Food comes in a large tin bowls so it's easy to just take with if there are leftovers. I'll be back!!!!!!! Yes!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't say a bad thing about this place. I always compare it to a chipotle for real Mexican food lovers.  Just recently discovered this place and can't stop going. Been dying to find good fresh Mexican food in the area without having to drive too far.   All meat choices I've tried are excellent and made fresh, but I've been stuck on green chile pork lately. 3 different bean options, rice, and then you can top it off with fresh pico, cheese, sour cream, guac, onions, cilantro... And a bag of fresh chips and choice of salsa to go with it.   The people are just as good as the food. Always welcomed with a smile and more than accommodating. last time I was there, a man I believe to be the owner, told me to come in the morning and try their breakfast burritos. Said even better than regular burritos. All he had to say was chorizo and I was sold. Now I just need to wake up early enough to get in there!   I just wish they were open later than 5. I can't always get off of work in time"}
{"text":"Surprised for sure. Just stopped in on the way thinking it was the chain restaurant with the same name but it's not. They let us sample the meats and I couldn't decide all of them were good even normally boring chicken was awesome. Rice an beans were great too not just an afterthought. Kids liked their chicken taco as well!"}
{"text":"Great service!!!   Save your time and skip the lines at Chipotle.  Head over to HF ! You will not be disappointed. True mexican food with one of the best burritos around. Owner and staff are incredibly friendly and always willing to answer any questions you may have. Sample some of the different meats available to ensure you get exactly what you like. I personally recommend the steak!"}
{"text":"Got the ultimate nachos...they were ok. Maybe I got the wrong thing. Wouldn't mind giving it another shot."}
{"text":"I had an errand to do close by and only 30 minutes to grab something to eat, thanks to Yelp, I found this little gem.  When I walked in, I was greeted by the staff and when they learned that it was my first visit, they told me all about how it works, gave me samples of each of the meats.  I was excited about the shrimp tacos they offer on Friday (so I will be heading back on Friday to try them).  I did the burrito platter and it was excellent.  I really liked the fresh and authentic guacamoleo."}
{"text":"Stop here every couple of weeks, the tacos and burritos are worth checking out, I prefer the red pork but the green is good as well.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"First, let me just say this place is under new ownership.  That being said, I've noticed that the girl who normally works mornings is still there (for the most part). She's what makes visits to this place for breakfast so pleasant. She is familiar with the menu and is more than accommodating when it comes to special requests (for example, if I don't want the tortilla on a burrito, she makes it a \"burrito bowl\").  Every time I come in when she isn't working and the owners are there, I always have to argue with them about how I want a breakfast burrito minus the tortilla...in a bowl. They always try to ring me up (and charge me more) for their breakfast skillet option (which is NOT the same). These people wanted to come in and purchase this restaurant, but not become familiar with the offerings of the restaurant. That's why I give it 3 stars. Other than that...since the cooks are still the same, the food is still amazing."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now, since its right down the road from my house. But since they're not open for dinner or on the weekends I've never had the chance til today. I ordered it for lunch on a Monday and had it delivered. My doorbell was ringing 20 minutes after I hung up the phone. And it was delicious. Best taco ever! Enchilada was delicious & the salsa had the perfect heat and flavor. I'd highly recommend it, just wish they were open for dinner so my husband can try it too"}
{"text":"Friendly fast service with outstanding food flavor. I had the steak burrito that was tasty and large sized. The chips were perfectly cooked without a greasy feel and just the right amount of salt. I would highly recommend to anyone in the area or looking for a reasonably priced well flavored meal."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting  Based upon Yelp reviews, I was really exxited to stop here for lunch. Service was very good but the food just wasn't good. I was expecting something special, but it wasn't. The pork tacos were okay but the tortillas were not. They seemed massed produced or store bought rather than homemade and the rice was tasteless. The salsa was okay too, no reason to ask for more though.   The restaurant is small and service is good. Thr wait staff was friendly, willing to make menu changes and very prompt.   I'm not saying the visit was bad, I just had higher expectations for the food."}
{"text":"Over the last 3 years, I've made the trip to have lunch at this little Mexican food stop. The meats are fresh, as the name indicates. The tortillas are soft and large. The salsas and pico are fresh and flavorful. This cafeteria style eatery is small but has a steady stream of loyal customers because they've found that the food is not only excellent but the employees and management are courteous and kind and always go the extra mile.  On your first two visits be sure to try the green chili pork and the beef meats in either the burrito or tacos. Both have exceptional flavor.  Burritos are massive, along the scale of Chipotle restaurants. The chips and salsa are nice and light even though you will get a generous portion.  One of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about Mexican food, so I'm glad to say this place pretty good. I had ordered a burrito with grilled beef, rice, and pinto beans that all comes with a side of chips. The chips could use a little more salt, but overall they were yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through yelp. I ordered a burrito bowl and when I received it barely anything was in there. They put a tiny amount of cheese. I couldn't even find it and zero rice. Also the chips were stale. The service was quick and the gentlemen was very nice. But the food was not worth the money. The pork was good but Cold. It just didn't come together.  Really disappointed after reading the yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Fresh and well-prepared Mexican dishes. A friendly staff and reasonable prices. We both had tacos and they were great."}
{"text":"We came here today because of the 5 star rating on Yelp, and specifically checked the menu to see if they have queso.. We saw they do and were so excited and were looming forward to having authentic Mexican food. We each ordered burritos (steak & pork); the burritos are big and tortillas are fresh (yum!) but were were disappointed that the queso was \"Ortega\" like you get a 7-11 or a baseball game, and the jalapeños are canned. Overall still rating 4 stars for great service And great burritos but the queso was such a bummer so if you know you want chips and queso I wouldn't come here.. If you want a good simple burrito or taco then it's delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my lunch spot. Love this place. They have habenero that's spicy and tasty! $1.99 taco Tuesday's is a plus."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST breakfest burrito in the World!! I drive 30 miles to get one. Actually headed there this morning so I will see the great staff very soon.... Clean place and great customer service!! Keep up the great work guys and you will be running chipotle back home very soon! If you are reading this review then please go try this place. Cody over and out"}
{"text":"Loved it. Came with three of the kids and everyone found something they loved. Fresh food and all the salsas had delicious flavor. Fast and friendly service. Would gladly come again."}
{"text":"The food is definitely good but the choices are somewhat limited depending on the day. Prices are very slightly high for what you get. For example, the enchilada dish comes with 2 enchiladas for $8.99 whereas you might usually get 3 for about the same price elsewhere.  The service was exceptional though. It was obvious we were first time visitors so we were offered samples of some of the meats. That was an A1 nice touch!"}
{"text":"Super delicious! Was recommended by yelp when I was lookin for a place. Walked in and the workers were very nice. Let me try a couple things and made some personal recommendations. Moved through the line very quickly. The rice was great and my tacos were delicious! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Overrated. That is really due to the fact that it's located in Phoenix which has the best Mexican food this side of the border. It reminds me of Chipotle, which is not a good thing."}
{"text":"I come here at least 2-3 times per week.   The breakfast burrito is awesome,  love the salsa and chips and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"So its a tad warm outside, im thungry and I just drive by Hab's Freah Mex. Time for a first time visit. I order a refreshing Taco Salad, which is a build as you go. Pinto beans, a little mexi rice, spicy chix, pico de gallo, guac, chips ots, and some really tasty, but not overly spicy hab salsa. What a GREAT meal it was! Throw in the ability to make an Arnold Palmer and Im a happy n sarisfied lifer at Habs Fresh Mex. Cant wait to explore the rest of the menu..."}
{"text":"This place is never open!!! Seems like they close whenever they want. We went here once and the food was actually good but we have tried to come back now twice and they were closed.   Went in today on Tuesday at 4:20pm when the hours on website and door say they close at 5pm. Doors were unlocked so we walked in but lady said they closed at 4pm. Ridiculous!!!!!   When you work normal business hours how do you expect to go there for dinner when they close whenever they want. They already have super early hours but now they are cutting it shorter?   We will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"Non-descript little Mexican place labeled \"Mexican Grill\" on the building from the road view. They are set up similar to a Chipotle but with a few more choices. The grilled chicken was under-seasoned but otherwise cooked well (aka not dry or chewy). The chips were over salted in my opinion. The mild salsa was spot on delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service! I am thoroughly impressed, it was my first time and I think it was a little obvious, but they offered me samples of everything, gave me a full run down of the menu, they make everything fresh in House including amazing brownies and banana nut bread  the meat is so flavorful and I can't say enough good things about my first experience! Will forsure be back, and a regular from now on"}
{"text":"While VERY pricey, their food was fresh and delicious. I've been on a hunt for a GOOD breakfast burrito and this is the best in the area I've found so far. Much better than Ma Familia and Armondos. They also deliver."}
{"text":"Was rated five stars so I thought I would give it a try. It is basically like Chipotle.  Nothing great by any means. If you like Chipotle it's probably fine."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!! They heat up the tortillas but it makes no difference to the superb quality of the ingredients at this location. I love that I get to choose the ingredients in my burrito (like a Chipotle restaurant) so I load up on cilantro and their homemade pico!  THEY HAVE THE BEST SALSA, HANDSDOWN.  Check them out and get yourself a punch card!"}
{"text":"Food is so delicious and the customer service is outstanding. We always go for their breakfast burritos but today we sampled their meats and those were delicious as well. We'll def be going back for lunch soon. Oh and their green salsa is sooo good."}
{"text":"It was delicious! I recommend the red pork tacos, as they were juicy and flavorful. Quick and easy stop for a great lunch."}
{"text":"This place is close to my office so I go there for lunch periodically,  The food is prepared in front of you and is always fresh and tasty.  The portions are a good size for the money , the staff is also good ,  they also offer a frequent eater card for a free entree ,"}
{"text":"I had a small steak, egg, chees and potato burrito this a.m. and it was absolutely delicious!!!! the potatoes were soft and hot and it was eggy. The steak was real. As I told the staff, before I ate it.......I will be BACK"}
{"text":"This place is right behind my work. Great food, friendly service, clean, highly recommend it. The salsa is (spicy or mild) is vary fresh. Chips aren't greasy Lots of items to choose from. The portion sizes and price are great."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around, great service... Good people. Support your local non-chain non-corporate restaurant! You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to stop in and try this place today, and it is the best Mexican food in the West Valley. Not the biggest restaurant, and the hours can be a little rough if you're expecting to go for dinner, but trust me when I say go at 4, let it sit on your counter for an hour or two until you're ready for dinner, and it will still be better than most of the Mexican food spots in the North West Valley. They're green chile chicken is very tasty and their red beef is some of the best taco beef I've ever had in my life. Great beans and rice too. Until somebody proves me wrong, this is going to be my go-to spot. Nothing but impressed"}
{"text":"I loved this place, very cozy and friendly people. Great service. The food was awesome, to die for!!! Delicious nachos, fresh ingredients made from scratch and reasonable prices!! I definitely recommend it.  My husband had the green chicken and it was fantastic! Very healthy. We're coming back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"This is not one of those crappy hole in the wall Filiberto type places - however the cost is similar. The gentleman who owns this place takes so much pride in his meat. I was a new timer here today, and he insisted I try each of his six types of meat.  SO MUCH YUM!  Build your own burrito, and bask in the greatness of an amazing food coma. This place won't let you down."}
{"text":"Burrito was sizeable and delicious. Nice people behind thy counter. Would go back any day. Love it."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is the bomb. Awesome little hole-in-the-wall place right next to the Deer Valley Airport."}
{"text":"This is a clean and tasty little joint. Walk in and pick your poison from a great variety of meats and yummy frijoles. Tacos are made to order right before your eyes. Chipotle style, hold the hepatitis. Salsa has a kick and is very good. Chips are crisp and fresh. This will be our go to Mexican grind when feeling like a run for the border. Thanks, Habanero Fresh. You did it!"}
{"text":"Always went for lunch and for the first time tried their breakfast burritos. Yowzah. Get one and try it. Delish. Will settle any hungry tummy or a hungover tummy in a flash."}
{"text":"Always extremely fresh.  I don't eat meat and they are always willing to prepare a vegan option whether it be a salad or veggie fajitas (on Wednesday fajita day).  Willing to work with you on portions too, ie  more beans, less rice etc.  My wife who is \"particular\" about chicken loves the hatch chile chicken.  Neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Our first time ordering here, we used the eat24 ap and it was delve red exactly at the time requested. We each ordered the hot ground beef enchiladas and they were very tasty.  We will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Ingredients are very high quality and tasty! Served up with genuine pride and a smile you could only get from a local business.  My Saturday morning ritual is to make a breakfast burrito run, and everybody loves them! You will brag to your friends about your find. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely scrumptious!!!  The chicken enchiladas were so good!  The Bulgogi Bowl (Korean BBQ Beef) was also amazing!   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Heck Ya.  Excellent for Quick and Affordable meal.  In and out, full and happy under $7.  Spicy Chicken Enciladas were good.  Its kinda like a Chipotle everything is premade you make the choices of meat, beans, etc.. and they assemble it in front of you - its just more authentic I'd say."}
{"text":"We came in right before closing time and though they were out of a lot of items (always a sign of good fresh food) what we got was delicious. Staff was gentle with us as tourists. ;-) Guacamole was fresh and delicious. We shared tacos and quesadillas--both yummy."}
{"text":"Great food with a chipotle style concept. but food is far better and authentic. Prices are great too with many meat options."}
{"text":"The best lil Mexican joint around! Love the quality and price! I get enchiladas or tacos (they are corn or flour soft shell.) Great lunch spot and the service is awesome! We love going!"}
{"text":"I go here all of the time because they actually know what hot flavorful salsa means. (They have a variety for wimps too)"}
