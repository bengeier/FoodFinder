{"text":"My husband and I stopped here at random, and I must say the food, drinks, and wait staff were pretty awesome! I had the angus beef sliders with fries, and my husband had the six pepper dry rub wings which were ridiculously good! Also try their Apple CinniMule - surprisingly pretty darn good! Overall, great place to stop by if you're looking for a well seasoned meal, good drinks and pleasant staff. Should we ever find ourselves in this area again, we'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars for the food. But overall this is a nice place to drink a beer and watch the game."}
{"text":"Loved the beer. Loved the TV screens The waitress was lovely and walked miles (what was her number?) Food good! Great place for a Brit to chill!"}
{"text":"Have yet to have a bad meal. This has turned into our weekly go to place. Noticed some turnover in the wait staff but food, service, and cleanliness has stayed consistent. Wish they had a patio and a larger parking lot. Would really be nice if their website provided current info regarding performing bands each weekend. Great place for family dining or a night out without the kiddies."}
{"text":"I am a truck driver have to sit a day  Great place ... Great wings ... Great waitress... But get a Sunday liquor license please my company comes here a lot"}
{"text":"we have gone to this restaurant several times and always enjoyed it. however, we called a hamburger order in-picked it up. four days later we receive an alert from our credit card company questioning us of a large tip applied to the amount. NOPE we didn't leave a tip cause it was a pickup. we looked over our receipt. after 2 phone calls we were told this sometimes happens and we needed to give them our credit card info so they can refund us the amount. i'm sorry but the tip was more than the hamburger and all I get is oh sometimes this happens! well they have now lost us as customers and our family of 6 that we would take there. \"SOMETIMES THIS HAPPENS!\"??????????? what is up with that? Beware it could happen to you!"}
{"text":"One of the best sports bars around!!! Great food, good beer selection, and reasonable prices. On top of that the servers are super friendly and are exceptional at their jobs!!! Highly recommend!!! (And the fried pickles/dip are the bomb!!!)"}
{"text":"This place is centrally located which is good and the food is pretty decent. Two things that are not ok is the service and the cleanliness. The waitress was ok but didn't clear the dishes or refill drinks without being asked. As for the cleanliness, the place was a mess. There was a huge mess on the floor below our table where a family of 8 had all of their kids before us and no one thought to sweep under the table or wipe the chairs before sitting a new group. The rest of the restaurant was no better, including the bathrooms. Blah! If that is what we could see, imagine what we couldn't see in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Typical sports bar and Grill type of place with some hits and some misses. You could do worse in Streetsboro.   Decor: a little odd. Has a sports bar feel but a lot of big Windows letting in light confuses the concept. Central bar with tvs everywhere.   Menu: Easy enough to understand. Think BW3...wings, wraps,  burgers,  salads, sandwiches, and maybe a few entrees. Very large wine and beer list. Beer list also explains the flavor profile for the various beers...love this!   Staff: Service was fast and attentive, but our waiter was weird! He did help me rearrange my order into a combo to save money,  which was great. Was not a fan of him telling us to take our time looking at the menu because he \"really had to pee!\"  TMI buddy.   Food: Huge portions. Fries and chips are made in house.  Fries are the skin on boardwalk style and chops were large cut kettle style. I got boneless wings with loaded chips. Wings were good and chips were very crunchy with good stuff on top! Others got chicken tenders, pulled pork sandwiches and burgers. All were above average quality and a great deal for the portion.   We brought kids during the day and felt it was kid friendly. Have not been here for dinner.   Good food, good portions and pretty good deal. Not and blowing experience, but a great stop for something a bit different on a budget in Streetsboro. Will go again!"}
{"text":"This place is a must stop destination if traveling to or through Streetsboro.  Great ribs and the best wings I've had.  So much better that the chains.  It's a family owned sports bar and the pride in ownership shows.   If you decide to drop in and she's on duty ask to be seated in Sam's area.  Sam is knowledgeable regarding the menu and beverage choices and will see to it that you have a great experience.  You can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Great food and service! My companions had beer. I was undecided between the Pinot Grigio and the Chardonnay. I asked the waitress if I could have a taste of each to determine which one I preferred. (A common practice in AZ). She stated that they don't do tastings and the alcohol was weighed so they couldn't just give me a little. We asked for the manager who promptly came to our table. She said the same thing but said she, too, would have to get permission from someone else. As it turned out, they did bring me a sample of each and I chose the Pinot Grigio. They were very accommodating although I suspect if we hadn't pushed it they would have just left it at no. Everyone in our party was very pleased with their food selection. Ambiance was nice and they weren't too busy. We definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Second time around i have to say the burger was pretty good. Definatly above standards. The wings are also very good. Will deffinatly go back. They only reason i didnt give 5 stars was the service was slow today. Otherwise happy Moose was impressive today. Kudos to the owner and his cooks!"}
{"text":"Fantastic venue, great food and location. Service was amazing for how busy it was on game night and we will absolutely return for another visit."}
{"text":"We were a group of 4 had dinner last night 3 had burgers 1 had the rib special,chicken nachos for an app. Service was very good,all agreed food was also very good much better than our first experience here a year ago"}
{"text":"I got the black & blue burger & my girl got the pulled pork sandwich, both were very good & I would get either one again. Now the wings are a different story. Wouldn't get the again. They were to chewy for me. Plus I got they're equivalent to a sweet heat sauce that was bland. No sweet or heat. Potatoe skins were ave."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. Not quite a 4, but not a 3 in my book (obviously since I wish I could give it a 3.5 on the scoring. It has bands from time to time, which is what makes it a 4. Not many places have an area that converts from a stage at night to tables during the day. I would give it a 3 for food. It's just your typical, everyday bar food. Nothing to write home about, but it's not necessarily bad. Just average. I've been here a couple of times, and I have always enjoyed myself. The service is also fantastic, which also helps its rating. I would recommend you stop at least once to try it out, especially if there is a band."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere and beer selection but for 59cents per boneless wings it could be of decent size.  I got some chicken nuggets size and it was really small.   Maybe not pick the special next time."}
{"text":"2nd time here.  Certainly not healthy eating but OH SO GOOD.  Had the Italian steak sandwich which was awesome.  Bread to guts was perfect ratio.  Side salad was a good size dinner salad.  Service by Brittany was top notch."}
{"text":"Went on the Sunday before Memorial Day, the only race in NASCAR was on at about 8:15. Had 2 beers. Asked for a food menu and we were told the kitchen was closed at 9:00. I could understand that on a regular Sunday but before a holiday was disappointing especially since the burger that the girl received looked delicious."}
{"text":"Used to come here quite often and really enjoyed it but the last few times it has not been good. The quality of food is not good, the zucchini planks were so greasy and the fries used to be really plentiful but instead there were hardly any fries at all. I ordered a side of Cole slaw and paid $1.99 for two spoonfuls. There were bugs on the walls and the temperature was not controlled very well. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere, good service, good food. Amanda was our server and she was just wonderful! I had the buffalo chicken dip appetizer and the jumbo pretzel sticks appetizer; both were delicious. They serve Pepsi products (I prefer Coke) but that wasn't enough to dampen my spirits. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a good 3 - 3.5 star.  We really like this place, but I am not going to say I am a 'fan' just yet.    There food is pretty good but a little on the pricey side.  You do get a decent portion but you may struggle a little when the bill shows up.  The service has always been really good.    They are focused on being a sports bar though and at that, they are pretty good at.  Inside is a little industrial, so if Moose makes you think it is going to have a warm woodlands feel, don't.  But that being said, it very comfortable and open."}
{"text":"Don't drive by this local joint!  Visited for lunch from out of town and had the bacon and blue burger with onion rings. BEST rings I have ever had in my life and that burger....omg that burger. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of times before my diet was restricted for medical reasons, and I thought the food and service both were exceptional. I'm looking forward to having the doctors let me go back in a month or so. In the meantime my son knows their Mentor location well. John A. thought the windows were a bit odd for this kind of place, but it used to be an Eat 'N' Park. Changing the windows would have been a major remodeling expense. The place seemed very kid friendly when I was there both noon and evening."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had high chairs as it looked very bar-y when we walked in.  We ordered the fried pickles, which were pretty good.  The wings were just ok and the bill was huge for what we had.  It just felt very overpriced for very average food.  We didn't even finish our wings, and that's saying something.  Our service was mostly attentive, however.  This would probably be a good place to drink and watch a game."}
{"text":"We got to your establishment at 6:30pm 11/18/15. The waitress we had really didn't wait us. Never asked how we were doing. Never asked if we needed anything. Someone else brought out our food. I had gotten the chicken parm sliders. There was like no sauce on it. The chicken was dry. Both plates were hot but food was cold. My bf asked for no tomato. You could tell that someone had put it on and took it off because the juices and seeds was on his burger. Couldn't asked for sauce she didn't come back except when she gave us our bill. She was way friendlier to the other tables around us but not to us. Idk. Couldn't tell you her name. She didn't say. We basically sat in the back corner at a round table. I was there bout a month ago and had great food and service thought I would come back because I wanted my bf to experience it but it sucked. What sucked even more he drives an hr to see and then I actually live an hr away from your restaurant. So waste of my money, time, and gas."}
{"text":"Always intrigued by this place.   We went on a Sunday and was not too busy.  First sign that it was not gonna be good was the locking mechanism attached to front door.  The kind that one puts a key in for someone stopping by later.  R they selling?    Host and server were fine but the food is why you go.    Got 12 boneless BBQ wings.  I have never had trouble cutting a boneless wing in half with a fork until this place.  They were like rocks.  BBQ sauce was good wings were not.    Partner got Bigfoot burger. His plan was he liked everything on it so it would be good.  It is a burger on French toast with egg bacon and peanut butter.    Did not like at all.  Burger meat itself was terrible no flavor.   I got a Texas BBQ burger  BBQ sauce onions on a big burger   Burger was blah he much better.    Both came with fries that were also tasteless and hard.    Even h2o tasted blah.    Atmosphere smells like what it was a bar.  Spilled beers and urine.    Avoid unless ur drinking"}
{"text":"My husband proclaimed, \"I want to get you liquored up tonight!\"...so off we went to Happy Moose. The parking lot was packed but we were able to get a couple seats at the bar. A number of drinks containing 3 Olives cherry and some apple pie moonshine shots and I was toast. The fried pickles were delicious and that's not the booze talking. We had pretty good service too! Of course we will be returning!"}
{"text":"There was 6 of us for dinner. Food was very good. 3 burgers, 1 fish sandwich, wings and a salad. All of us were pleased. The only reason it did not get a 5 was the service. The place was not very busy but our server made us feel very rushed. The place was not even half full. Will be back but will order takeout"}
{"text":"Very good! Both the service and the food were  exceptionally good. I got a Chicken Philly and it was cooked perfect. No problems what so ever. The prices also didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is so good. Drinks are good. To me it's the only good place to eat in the Streetsboro area."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good as a step up from dingy bar atmosphere and fried food, but it's nothing out of the ordinary and much like an Applebee's, TGIFridays, or Chili's.   I've been a few times. They always have certain beers on draft for a decent price. The most recent time, we shared the nachos with chili with a few friends and I've gotta say, they were good. Huge pile and great for 4 people to share. I ordered the Moose salad with grilled chicken and balsamic. Again, huge salad so I poured dressing on half and ate half. It came with pita bread like Rocknes salads do, but mine was on the stale side. I will say, I think the croutons were homemade and they were good.   Basically, this is the kind of place you stop when you've been out and about running errands and realize you're starving. The selection and quality of food is pretty average, as is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here yesterday and both were told how wonderful the fish sandwich was. So we ordered it. First the fries that came along with sandwich were limp and greasy. It is pretty hard to mess up fries but they did. The fish was a glorified frozen fish stick with breading looks like a very large chicken McNugget. It was served on what looked like a yummy French baguette. It wasn't. It was bland, tasteless and rubbery. We asked for the Catawba sauce (mayo and siracha) which turned out to be the only good tasting thing we ordered. Don't order the fish sandwich no matter what anyone says, unless you like fish McNugget sandwiches.  $42.00 for two fish sandwiches and fries that we did not finish or take home, 1 beer that my husband didn't finish drinking, water for me, fried pickles (tasted good not didn't like the breading).  Overall not good food and not worth the price.  Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Yesterday stopped on the way back from going to the casino at 10:30pm. They were closing and denied us service. It was a Saturday night at 10:30...? There is no way this place is going to stay in business long if they are not open on weekends past 11pm. Be warned , do not plan on going here late at night. All of there customers must be old people that go to bed before 8."}
{"text":"I don't see what people complain about here. If i wanted bistro style, high quality expensive food I would go to Rosewood.   I go to the happy moose because the prices are good, the servers are pleasant and the alcohol is great. My only issue would be to tell management to hurry up on that Sunday liquor license. I wanted to go cocktail crazy but had to stick with beer!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I don't know, it doesn't really do it for me. I'll start this off by saying I've never eaten here, only drinks a few times around 9pm-12am on Saturday nights. It has a strange vibe that I don't really like, because every time I've been there late at night for drinks, they close half of the restaurant, their \"dining room\" down. Maybe I'm just bein weird, but it's not really inviting to have half your place shut down, lights off, chairs on tables. I come with a group of friends and last time we walked in, there was 2 tables dirty and dirty drinks lined up on the bar and the bartender told me to sit at the bar...so we almost left but a different waitress cleaned up a table for us. The bartender was more concerned with her boyfriend/interest at the bar than cleaning up/good service/etc.   This place isn't a dancing bar, it's not a sports watching bar, it's just got a dad-sits and drinks at the bar by himself kinda vibe. Maybe like BWW's without as many TVs or wings. They play a weird mix of music but there's touch tunes, I guess, if you wanna spend like $1/song. Got some sports...stuff on the walls.   The service is average, the drinks are priced average. I think Average Moose is more accurate than happy moose - at least after 9pm."}
{"text":"Arrived to be seated my a friendly hostess. But seconds after being seated noticed 2 dead bugs on our table.  Waitress laughed and made a joke of it.  Not amused.    Food was good.  Not fantastic but not bad either.   Was slow to come out and with a few errors but they did correct them.    I Would return for the sliders."}
{"text":"Had to get my wing fix, I like dry rubs on wings they had 3 different types couldn't choose between 6 pepper, smoked and cajun style so I just got all three.  All were great but if I needed to choose I would go with the 6 pepper, along with incredible craft beer offered makes this place a great stopping place while passing threw !"}
{"text":"Food was ok but nothing to write home about. Be careful with the add-ons and up-sells. Everything is extra, and it adds up. A side of sweet potato fries was over $7. Celery for the wings is extra. If you need extra chips for your spinach dip, they're extra. Our bill ended up being nearly $60 for two people. We could have gone out to a nice steak house for that much."}
{"text":"The boneless wings are really good. We got the moosey platter which is 30 wings (we picked the boneless) and one side. We chose garlic parm, hot garlic, buffalo ranch, medium, and six pepper dry rub. I don't have anything bad to say about any of the flavors. The fries were also really good. For the price, it is definitely worth a try. This was a good meal for my boyfriend and I and for 24.99 we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were so excited when this place opened. We were disappointed the first time we went. Hubby said the bar stools were too low for him to be comfortable and I found myself sliding around on one all over the floor.  But, since then, we've made a few trips back. We sit at a table now since he is in a wheelchair. The staff and patrons always hold doors for us, when we come in and when we leave. The server doesn't even hesitate to move a chair out of the way so I can get the wheelchair under the table..  Drink service is fast.  When I asked what beer the server would recommend, she chose one for me that was perfect and I will order from now on. The dining room is bright and welcoming and the huge televisions on the wall are easy to see. We are becoming Sunday regulars there."}
{"text":"Great wings, great sandwiches & wraps, and even my salad was awesome (I don't expect much out of a sports bar salad, but it surprised me!). I've had friendly and attentive service both times I stopped in. The bathrooms smell terrible-- I think they have plumbing issues, but if you can get past that then it's definitely a place Streetsboro was in need of (sorry Chuggers!)"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a harsh critic for many things, if there is effort involved I wouldn't be quick to judge on a first visit basis, but waiting almost 45 minutes just to be approached and then asked what we would like to drink is lousy. That's almost saying that you straight up, don't care. How on earth there was a mix up, is beyond me. Even on a Friday/Saturday night with the place packed that wouldn't be okay. Me and my girlfriend got our drinks after 45 minutes and ordered our food. We got boneless wings/fritters and they tasted like dirty fryer oil, as did the breaded chicken sandwiches. The Hummus was really good though. It honestly deserves 1 star, but the fact that we had a lot of that taken off our bill was nice at least."}
{"text":"Not really sure what happened since my last visit,  but wow was it great!   The food was cooked perfectly and all of us left full.  The green chili was so great I sat there looking up recipes for when I get home to make it!  Phenomenal fresh salsa... Perfectly cooked pulled pork,  and the mooseadilla was awesome as well!   Wait staff was great and right on with service,  drink  refills,  etc.   We will definitely be back again and that is a promise!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch while we were way out east. We ordered a Cuban and a chicken parm sandwich.  They were above average for pub fair and I would definitely return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Everything was extremely greasy with little flavor. The staff was nice. The place is huge but feels very empty. Its doubtful I will be back."}
{"text":"Really cool place! The salads are fantastic!  Always have good new beers to try. Bartenders are very friendly. Servers are very nice too! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here weekly ONLY because the Boro has limited choices. Wine is $6.25 a glass, service at the bar is really good. Food is pricey but most often good. Can't get out of there less than $30 plus tip. The bartenders are very attentive so that is why we return."}
{"text":"Found this unique place on a recommendation from a friend.... And although we didn't have dinner,, we had drinks..... Staff could not have been nicer... Even recommended a few Italian restaurants in area.... Hats off to this place...."}
{"text":"This place is great Will definitely come back wings, chicken and beef sliders!!!! My son said the Buffalo chicken sliders wasn't that good!!!!!!! Buffalo chicken wrap was good !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. I have never had a better pulled pork sandwich ever. It was fantastic. The only downside was the noise level due to the industrial decor"}
{"text":"We have been here many times and are always happy with the experience. Everything we have tried on their menu is excellent. Their burgers are probably my favorite. They usually have a nice selection of craft beers as well. Our go to place on a regular night. The waiters and waitresses are always friendly and efficient. We love Happy Moose!"}
{"text":"Best veggie burgers w/ pepper jack cheese!   Becky is absolutely the best server!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My visit today just confirmed why we don't frequent this restaurant. Food was decent(not worth a $35 check) but service was horrible. There were maybe 8 tables including people sitting at the bar so obviously not busy. Which was okay until our server brought out our food and never returned. We needed drink refills and extra napkins but couldn't ask our server. I ended up asking another server who was busy cleaning tables and sweeping floors.our server brought the check, came back a minute later to collect but it wasn't ready yet. She never returned. We ended up leaving cash. Normally we like to leave at least 20% for a tip and typically give more, especially when service deserves it. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We were very happy while eating at the Happy Moose! We went on Saturday around 5 and were seated promptly. They weren't very busy which was great. Our waitress was super friendly and was very attentive. She even offered suggestions and boy were they good! I had the wing and pretzel combo and it was perfect! Although too much food for me they were sure tasty. The buffalo ranch sauce was perfect! My husband had the ribs and wing combo and he said they were fall off the bone and very tasty. I'm glad we tried them out and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The French dip sandwich was really good and well cooked. The wings were mediocre. The service at the bar was fairly poor and slow. It wasn't really busy on a mid week evening and the 2 bartenders didn't really seem to have much of a clue. She was only friendly when she handed me the bill. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Best Cuban I've ever had. Great friendly service. Plenty of tvs for sports. The music was just a bit loud for my old ears."}
{"text":"We were in town for 36 hours and went here twice.  Lunch: The fried zucchini was real good.  The moose salad with added chicken was wayyy too much chicken for me. But good.   The soup was green chili. Good, not great.  Dinner:  Different salad, Cobb? Very good. No tomato, no cheese.   Pork sliders with fries. Favorite thing."}
{"text":"It's good to see a family owned restaurant in the fast food capital of Streetsboro Ohio.  I've been traveling here for many years and have long since given up on finding any remarkable food.  This restaurant is no exception. Food was okay at best. I had chicken wings that were a bit under cooked. They came drenched in sauce. It was literally floating in it.  Salad was decent.   Beers were good. Service was fast but without personality.  If you put this place in any other place I would pass.  In Streetsboro however it offers at least a choice."}
{"text":"$32 for 12 wings and two beers.  Food was ok. Beer was ok  Service very marginal.  Two bartenders and only 10 of us at the bar but had to repeatedly wait for service.  They both did find time to spend quality time with a couple of regulars.   I got the dry wings and they were pretty much fried and rolled in a salt/spice mixture.   The place was pretty empty and I see why. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Happy Moose. Upon entering I was greeted with a friendly smile and then choose to sit at the bar. The bar is very spacious, made of granite, with plenty of seating. There are a lot of big screen monitors every where. So, getting a good view is no issue. The beer prices were good and even better once the baseball game started. This time I choose an appetizer, buffalo chicken dip with tortilla chips, that was so addictive I can't wait for more. I enjoyed my first experience and will be going back very soon"}
{"text":"Kind of an odd duck. More of a resteraunt type feeling but with a very expensive menu. Service was good. Apple pie shot was amazing. Very loud for not having that bar/club type of atmosphere.  So ...id say was just ok."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Kid friendly. Love the rib nights. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Gotta say this place is disappointing. Such a great name, it has to be a fun late night place, right? Nope!!!  They have a good beer selection, but no one who knows anything about beer.  The food is OK, but the atmosphere is just sad. They really want to close by 10:00, so don't plan on sticking around."}
{"text":"This place is a sports bar atmosphere with some pretty good bar food!  The portions are always HUGE!  Some of my favorites to order here are:  Smoked Wings- The dry rub is AMAZING! Salty and crunchy and so darn good! Any Salad - The salads are so big and come with so many toppings! I always have leftovers! Any Burger - The burgers have some really good toppings and are always good.  They come with fries (or you can substitute any side). The fries are soft and delicious perfect with vinegar!  Not the most specific, but really every meal I've had here has been good! I don't think you can really go wrong!"}
{"text":"Very good bar food! Good beer selection and service has always been friendly and quick! Nice place to catch a game! Will be back"}
{"text":"The place looked VERY busy, but there was no waiting for a table. It's one of those sports bar/restaurant places with \"industrial\" ceilings that make it super loud to begin with. But add a packed house, several televisions and loud music and you can't hear yourself think, let alone talk to your table mates. I expected this and it didn't bother me at first but my 22 year old son (who frequents BW3's which is also loud) said he wouldn't go back because of it.   We ordered the spinach dip to start. Unfortunately--perhaps because it was so loud--the waitress heard chicken tenders. A man came over with the chicken later and we had to send him away TWICE after we informed him we ordered the spinach dip. The waitress came back and asked if we wanted the chicken and we told her--again--we ordered the spinach dip. She said would fix it and she did. The dip came fairly quick after that. But, we barely took one bite before our entrees descended on us. This annoys me because an appetizer is not supposed to be served with the entree and there was no room for 5 large plates and 4 small ones on the pub-style table. However, the dip was quite good. We all agreed.  My son ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. I could see immediately that the chicken was, albeit large, very saturated with oil. He ate it and said it was ok, but refused to eat the fries for the same reason. He tried doctoring them up and still couldn't eat them. They were oily and limp.   His friend had the rack of ribs. It was $17-ish, I think he said, and not worth it at all. According to him, it was about 20% fat and not tasty. However, this boy eats about 4 things total and is very picky so I'm not sure how accurate that assessment is. He also agreed his fries were very oily but those are one of his staple foods and he ate them.  My son's other friend had a sandwich of some kind, which he devoured. He also said the fries were super greasy, but his mother doesn't let him eat a lot of greasy foods so he thought it was great. LOL.   I ordered a Cuban sandwich and I really liked it. However, half way through eating my (oily) fries...I realized I had ordered the Kettle chips. So, our order was wrong again. I figured I already ate half of them so I didn't complain.  Getting out of there was fairly speedy. We all considered not tipping (or not tipping much) but I personally having worked for tips in the past couldn't bring myself to punish the waitress for the crappy work of the cooks or the fact that she couldn't hear a damn thing in there. She should have accounted for this and refused to serve bad food or double checked what we wanted, though.  I guess I would give the place another try if someone wanted to, but wouldn't suggest it."}
{"text":"Stopped here after the Spartan Pittsburg. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was good not great. Had the wings with the smoke rub and the irish nachos. My son had the texas boy. All were neither a hit or miss. Next time I'm in town I will be back to try some different wings."}
{"text":"I got the smoked wings and requested drums only (no up-charge). Most restaurants usually add a few bucks, this was a welcome surprise. They tasted fine and came with a side of horseradish for dipping. The onion rings were a huge disappointment. The rings were touted as a house special, but tasted like school cafeteria mush.   The beer selection is decent, but by no means enough craft options for my liking."}
{"text":"Terrific food, craft beer and service. Came on a Tuesday night on a business trip and there were a ton TVs playing the Indians game. It was 59 cent wing night and the wings were a great quality. They came out hot and fresh with many different flavors. I had a nice Lake Erie Monster Imperial IPA to go along with it. Great well run restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant. Typical sports bar type fare with a few twists. I had a meatball sandwich, which featured their homemade meatballs. The meatballs weren't very good. The sandwich was clumsy and a but undercooked as there was a cold spot as I ate it. The hand cut fries were disappointing as they had no salt on them. It was okay, but nothing I would crave or want to return for."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Great quality and large portions.  Everyone at the table was very pleased.  Also a very good beer selection.  Service was a little slow but wasn't a huge deal.  Everyone was very friendly.  Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"If you like cold over cooked food this is your place. The service is also EXTREMELY slow!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and we were exhausted and starving. This place had good reviews so we gave it a go. We were blown away by how good everything was! The house seasoned wings were perfect, but the real star was the Irish Nachos. Reuben filling on top of hot waffle fries with Russian dressing? We still talk about how delicious they were. We're looking forward to visiting again the next time work brings me to Streetsboro."}
{"text":"Really liked this place, even tho it got super busy. Good food, good beer selection, really nice atmosphere. Price was on par for quality. Wait staff and bartenders were very friendly and attentive. Will be back if I am ever this way again!"}
{"text":"Alright food bad service. Waited 40 minutes for my waitress to come around so I could get my bill. I could see her. She was busy vaping behind a wall by the kitchen entrance. I finally flagged down a different waitress and got my bill. The whole time my waitress/ bartender was busy huffing flavored water vapor. No one ever checked on me the whole time. I won't be back. I hope you won't go there either. Next time I'll listen to my coworkers and go to Rocknes."}
{"text":"As a note, I give stars based on how well the establishment accomplishes what it has set out to do. Happy Moose is a bar and grill. As such, it succeeds masterfully.   The environment is really cool - renovated from an old EatNPark. The room is filled with local memorabilia and is very spacious.   All of the food has been great. The French dip, custom burgers, and appetizers are all exceptional. The menu is vast, yet the kitchen seems to be able to pull it all off very well. Surprisingly a lot of the spreads, dips, and sauces are made in house.   They have a great beer list comprised of about 10 craft draft beers and seasonal bottles. I love the fact that the menu gives you a price for all the alcohol...sooo nice!   Prices are all very reasonable and the service that I have experienced has been great. The perfect neighborhood bar and grill."}
{"text":"Good causal sports bar. Great place for burgers and beer. My favorite are the deep fried pickles. Wings are also excellent"}
{"text":"So, after hearing what others had to say about Happy Moose, I held some high expectations on the place.  I must say, they were greatly misplaced.  It's a general, run of the mill gastropub.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.    When you first walk in, there are NO signs that say if you have to wait to be seated or if it was seat yourself.  After waiting for 5-6 minutes, hubby and I decided to seat ourselves, when someone miraculously appeared to seat us.  The place was NOT busy, so I really don't understand what took so long.  We were seated at a tall table with chairs and our waitress promptly came by and took our drink orders.  After a few more minutes, she returned with our drinks and took our orders.  I must say, the promptness of the food would have given them 5 stars.  Within 5 minutes, we had our orders.  Hot and yummy.  I ordered the Irish Nachos because I was told that they were \"to die for.\"  I tasted them and was like, \"Meh.  I've had better.\"  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't \"to die for\" either.  I really have had better.  I was offered a refill on my ice tea just after the check came, so points lost of that.  While the service overall was friendly, it was not always prompt.  The place looked clean overall, but I didn't get a chance to visit the restrooms.  While there are TV's everywhere, the rest of the decor was sparse.   The big windows bring lots of light to a very dark place, so I'd hate to see how dark it really is in the evening.  While I won't write them off, I certainly won't promote them either.   Are they kid friendly.  I would not bring my kids here in the evening.  Yes, for lunch in the middle of the day, but definitely NOT in the evening or dinner.  Yeah.... You won't catch me being a regular here."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday. Wings were only 59 cents and the beers were under $3. My favorite of the top three spicy flavors was the Mango Habenero. Fresh cut fries were pretty good too and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. Lots of TVs and the bartender Crystal was very friendly and informative. Happy Hour is 12-7pm Monday thru Friday - just wish we had one of these in Wadsworth. There's really no good wing places like this nearby."}
{"text":"One of the best sports bars around. The food is always good and the servers are always nice!  We usually get burgers or ribs, both are great choices."}
{"text":"Came here to spend time with family and watch game  started of with appetizer platter for $12.99 we had tasty ribs that fell off bones and mozzarella wedges and chicken tenders. We were able to choose the sauce we wanted. Also had potato skins but they were on greasy side.  At half time we ordered food   chicken quesedia and pulled pork sliders and Asian chicken salad.   Food good and service was attentive.  The game outcome on the other hand. .."}
{"text":"Some of the members of our Motorcycle Ministry and I went last night, and it was great. The food was amazing. The atmosphere was amazing. The service was amazing...Definitely will be back!"}
