{"text":"I stand by each of those 5 stars. Without a doubt, it's one of the best Chinese/Thai/Caribbean takeout places I've order from. Food is great, prices are fair, and portions are spot-on.

My favourite dishes are Chilli Beef, Beef Pad Thai, and General Tao Chicken (though it can be a little too sweet). All are good lunch choices!"}
{"text":"One of the better take out Chinese food places in Ajax. Decent price and big portions!"}
{"text":"This is my hands-down favorite place for Chinese food in Ajax. Willing to accomodate and super fast delivery. The employees are always smiling and very friendly. And most important, great tasting food !"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this restaurant after not being satisfied with few other Chinese restaurants in the Ajax area. Ordered Kung Pao chicken, Sesame Chicken and Black Pepper crispy beef and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised that the food tasted really good. This will definitely be my place to go for Chinese food in Ajax. Love the food."}
