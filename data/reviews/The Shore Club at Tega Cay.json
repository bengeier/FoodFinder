{"text":"Placed an order with 3 small children and 4 adults.  After waiting 45 minutes for the dinner to come out, the waitress said she was \"just notified by the cook\" they did not have the meat for a steak sandwich & asked what else would my husband like instead.....AFTER 45 MINUTES of waiting.  By this point he lost his appetite with the terrible service and ate the kids chicken fingers.  Feel like this place could do good if had excellent management and good staff, but they are lacking."}
{"text":"We were excited to try the new restaurant at the Tega Cay Golf Club however were quickly disappointed. The service was good, the food over priced and under seasoned. The crab dip left a lot to be desired. The fish tacos and philly were very plain and flavorless. The two best parts of our meal was the bread and sushi."}
{"text":"They are really making an effort to turn this place around. Michelle as a manager was very in touch with the service, and did a great job communicating and servicing. It's tough when they go from slow to slammed, but you can tell all their employees were working hard and were taking pride. Good job, keep up the good work. Be patient and let's help with the turnaround.  #makeshoreclubgreatagain!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a waste of money. $16 for a dozen oysters, and you would expect high quality decent size bi-valves. Pearlz charges that and they are worth it. Btw Pearlz sells them for $10 dz on Mondays. So save your bucks. They passed the small cling-ons as I call them, as an oyster. You know, the itsy bitsy ones that attach to the larger oyster. Shore club: those are called freebies!"}
{"text":"Best golf course around. This is the only one me and my buddys play at. The only complaint I do have is that a lot of the times we have been the greens were being sanded and we booked an open slot and ended up being in the middle of someones tournament but other than that the course is great."}
{"text":"The Shore Club is located in the Tega Cay Golf Club house.  Bottom line: Food is average  Service - horrible   Atmosphere -  should be excellent but is horrible.  I live near by and have been here dozens of times, it is close by so convienant.   Food/Bar -  average, they have some good items such as buffalo shrimp, pimento cheese with bacon, but most of the fare is average and over priced and inconsistent.  Drinks are better than average but also overpriced.  Sushi is very good.  Best thing on the menu.  Service - horrible.  Do not expect to see any waitstaff if you sit out on the patio.  You will order a drink or food and you will literally have to walk inside to get it.  If they do bring you food it is usually cold and without utensils or condiments.  There are some good waitstaff but the manager is just horrible with no clue how to run a staff. She is usually found smoking a cigarette outside in the smoking section.  Clueless.   Ambiance - what should be a nice golf view is filled with trash, filthy tables, a deck that has not been cleaned ever so spilled food goes underneath and thus lots of flies.  The building itself has mold on it with trash that has been there literally for years just piled up by the HVAC units.  Bathrooms are filthy and usually have no papertowels. The health inspector needs to shut this place down for a week so they can be forced to clean up.  Squabbles between the city owned facility and owner of restaurant has resulted in a filthy eating establishment with poor service.  The owner also owns The City Tavern chain which only 1 out if the 4 I believe is still in business.  He refuses to install fans outside on the deck  to blow the hot air around which drives away business.  This place should be a gold mine but horrible management, inconsistent food, zero service will shut this place down soon.  If it was not a monopoly coupled with beer sales to the golfers this place would have been out of business 6 months ago.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Lunch didn't start off  well, my iced tea came with a crumbled receipt in it."}
{"text":"Great golf outing yesterday. I live 10 mins away in Fort Mill and I know why all my buddies in Charlotte come play here instead of Ft Mill or Springfield. The staff is courtesy and actually acts like they are glad you're there. The restaurant is great and they have great local beer selections. The course is in great shape for March. I will keep coming here to play."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and affordable prices. The servers even brought out ice water for my dog! If I lived closer to Tega Cay, I would hit up their golf club restaurant regularly. I'm not a golfer, but I've heard the course is pretty tough and well maintained and the prices are affordable. I'm definitely recommending this to my husband for future golf outings.  I ordered the sushi and was pleased with the quality and how quickly the order came out!  They also have an excellent beer selection!"}
{"text":"I reluctantly take back my previous glowing recommendation. Yeah, this place is great. Consistently staffed with drunk bartenders (not all) who get belligerent at the end of their shift, go find another place to drink, then drive home.  Did I have a bad experience? Absolutely. Sadly it continues to plague me after several months. Not in the crying everyday sort of way, but in that I'll never go back. The wonderful bar staff feel they have justification for harassing me at other establishments for something that occurred because one of their own drunk bar staff drinking behind the bar couldn't close out because she was so slammed. No worries though. The pimp (don't know his real name) who I see with all sorts of different women on a regular basis helped her out. They even got a little frisky. Legal? Perhaps. Not good business however, and certainly not a place I want to spend any of my time at.  This might be one of the closest places to my house, apart from the Dixie Pig, which is phenomenal. Do all of yourselves a favor though and check out another local establishment. This place has a long way to go."}
{"text":"I attended a reception at this lovely venue, beautifully decorated and very spacious and even provided childcare.  The food was not consistent, which is never good for a reception.  The crab dip appetizer was good but the she crab soup was very watery, the entree of chicken and fish with veggies was just ok.  This is such a great venue for a reception but they would be exceptional if they could put more attention into the food."}
{"text":"I love this place for the various aspects of seating, good prices and friendly staff. The food is good in exception to the quesadilla. It's made with a cheese that I don't care for and whole wheat tortillas but that's just me. I'm sure some people love it. The cool thing about this place is you can eat outside overlooking the golf course, inside on white table clothes for more upscale or hang at the separated bar that reminds me of Cheers. Overall, one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I'm so very excited that this place has been reopened by a knowledgeable restaurant owner. I was so excited when I heard that the owner of city tavern was taking over this poorly managed restaurant. We have been at least 10 times since the change over of it becoming the Shore Club and every time it has been delicious. Last night we went pretty late and the kitchen was about to close and the chef had just left because they were a little slow and about to close. Instead of turning us away they made us stay and told us it would be nothing short of amazing. So we stayed and sat out on the back patio. A friend joined us and my girlfriend and I both got sushi. My husband got the seafood pasta dish in a clam sauce. The manager Brandon ended up making it since the chef just left. Oh my gosh. My husband devoured that pasta dish and said it was the best he ever had. I did get one little bite of his scallop that he decided to share with me and it was banging. The only thing that was left was a little bit of sauce, so I tasted it and it was on point. No wonder he devoured! Our waiter was wonderful, forgot his name but he has waited on us several times and is always great. Our sushi was wonderful and drinks were great. I really just love this place. The food is soooo good and we finally don't have to leave Tega Cay to go to a five star restaurant! Keep it up guys, we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We decided to get a Groupon for The Shore Club because it was obvious that this place is managed by the same people who own City Tavern based on the similar but slightly scaled back menu. This was my first time visiting and it was a good experience. Like City Tavern, the food is good and consistent, but it is not outstanding. The food earns three stars but the amazing service for our table of five earns an extra star. My fish tacos were decent but the highlight of the meal was the hot pimento appetizer. If you want sushi, the sushi chef is not there on Sunday and Monday so keep that in mind.  To find the place, just had toward Tega Cay (watch out for coyotes), turn left where the big sign says \"RESTAURANT\" and drive down the short road to the parking lot. The restaurant is the big building at the top of the circle with no sign on it.  The outdoor area is nice and has a view where you can see some of uptown Charlotte. It is a decent place if you would like to try something different. I will agree with a previous reviewer that some music is needed. Because of the restaurant's layout, it is very easy to hear everyone's conversation, especially when there are only a few occupied tables."}
{"text":"I really like this place, food is consistently well done. I regularly eat in the bar area or patio. If you go when its not busy the service is okay but not very consistent, if you sit on the patio it can be pretty bad at times. Wednesday nights are very busy with the half price apps and music. If the weather is decent the deck is the place to sit because inside the bar area the noise level is unbearable, conversation is impossible. The problem on the deck is the service is utter chaos, servers do not have dedicated tables, the food is delivered by dining room staff who have no idea what table it goes to so food is consistently delivered to wrong table, servers are really inefficient. They seem to do the best they can but you can see the frustration they have and it unfortunately affects their attitude. Hopefully they can look at better ways to service the customers on busy nights.   Sorry but SC Shore Club food is not getting better. Too bad, beautiful location and facility."}
{"text":"Wanted to update my review, as I see the restaurant name has been updated. My previous review was from when this was called Casual Waters, under previous management. The Shore Club has been consistent since the change over. We're so grateful that the City Tavern owner took over, as the sushi chef (best part from old ownership) has stayed on, and the service and rest of the menu has improved tremendously. Nice to have a place right in town where you can go for snacks, a drink with friends or a date night dinner.  Be sure to check out The Shore Club when you're in Tega Cay area."}
{"text":"The new owner and new name has done wonders! The menu is much more manageable and Chuck and his amazing sushi remain. They have also added real desserts. Much, much better and right down the street."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere..your able to sit inside or outside (covered deck and open air deck available).Great live music on Wednesdays. The Food and presentation is really good and great service. I would recommend this restaurant for day and night dinning."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I really want to like it and I want them to do well. But, they are not there yet...since it basically is at the golf country club, they are aspiring to make it more upper class than it really is.  I think the best part might be their servers - they have always been friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The worst part is probably the ambiance. The restaurant itself is nicely done - clean and fresh - but the noise level is a HUGE detractor. Many times we have been in the dining room for dinner and the doors leading into the bar area are left wide open - so all of the bar noise spills into the dining room, including in some cases a live music performer.  Food-wise, the Shore Club is inconsistent. We have eaten here multiple times, and it seems like everything we have tried is somehow off in taste  - like there is one extra herb or spice that throws off the dish - or a key flavor is missing.   This time my wife had the Penne alla Vodka (her usual) and I had the Fish Tacos.  Wife wife knows by now not to expect any strong indication of vodka in the pasta sauce. With my fish tacos somehow there were conflicting flavors - perhaps too much tarragon versus the other spices used in the sauce.  Not sure if and when we'll be back.....I'm hoping I eventually hear positive feedback about the Shore Club by word of mouth down the road. We need some good unique restaurants (i.e. not typical chain fare) in Fort Mill and Tega Cay."}
{"text":"We have tried the shore club a few times, I haven't tried anything from the main menu. I couldn't get past the sushi menu. The sushi is awesome and they have a creative mixture from the traditional sushi places. The selection of deep fried rolls are amazing. The one roll has bacon inside the roll. The bread is really good and great martini's. The service is very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Im only leaving 5 stars because my server Brittany was so great! She was super accommodating with my kids and was just so nice! Ask for her"}
{"text":"The food was great. We got the philly cheesesteak and the sushi. Both were super good and the atmosphere of the restaurant was great too."}
{"text":"This place ... this place .. this place ! Took the kids out for a belated birthday/ graduation dinner . VERY hard to find if your not real familiar with the area . Don't listen to Siri and turn on Pago Pago (street ? ) just make a left toward the big building.  We were expecting to be \"snobbed\" up here being as it is a golf club etc. and we had a groupon . No way ! The absolute opposite! We were greeted so kindly by the woman at the hostess station !The staff was amazing warm and friendly in a genuine way . Especially Davis our waiter , SHOUT OUT Davis ! :) The grouper was great ! Had it in fish tacos and \"fingers\" . We waddled out :D"}
{"text":"The TOP Golf Course in York County and one of the best in the entire Charlotte Metro Area.  Stop in for a round and say hey to Josh and his crew!  Looking to book a corporate outing or get a group together for a reunion while hitting the links, Josh will take excellent care of you."}
{"text":"Food and services were good.  Offered good variety and price range. Fusion of sport bar and fine dining.  In area we were seated, white painted walls with nice art work and white (paper) table covers with TVs showing the olympics and classic rock music playing overhead."}
{"text":"Ok so obviously I live in the area or I wouldn't know about this place. And yes we keep coming back, ONLY because it's 1 mi from home. So, going in we already know the service sucks. But remember 1 mi from home. So I brought a group of ladies in last night, about 9 of us. So, of course service was ok- but slow. But the issue I have is... my chicken was raw. Like cold raw. I ordered the Chicken French. Which was actually more like a Picotta, because it had capers on it. I could over look that if the chicken was cooked. I just couldn't believe it. It was so raw it was cold to the touch. I'm never one to complain but RAW? So, they made me another one. But I was still charged for it. I suppose I could of asked to get it taken off. But it's not about the $12. It's just courtesy.  I think they must know ppl are going to still come in due to its location. Because they obviously don't care."}
{"text":"I was here for a wedding, so I can't speak for the golf course or overall club grounds.  Overall the facilities seemed nice.  It was not great weather on the day of the wedding, and had the rain not stopped between the ceremony and reception for a bit, I'm not sure how we were supposed to get from the covered porch where the wedding was to three buildings down where the reception was taking place.  The food was okay for it being buffet style in a large quantity.  They had penne noodles with garlic and parmesan, but the noodles were cold, and the wait staff did not seem thrilled to be there."}
{"text":"first time I went, food was great. Second time, I got really sick from the sushi and threw it all up. We went for Easter brunch, it was just ok. We didn't even realize there was a salad bar until after we were done (it was in another room). The salmon was good but the prime rib was overcooked."}
{"text":"I enjoyed golfing here.  Clean course and friendly staff.  Watch your speed on your way there. :("}
