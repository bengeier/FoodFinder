{"text":"A girl friend of mine recommended this little sandwich shop, and I'm so glad she did!!   There's so much construction on this street that you don't even know it's there, and it's so freaking good!   My boyfriend loves sandwiches it's his thing..so we decided to check it out.  We walked into this cute little sandwich place and we're instantly greeted by this very friend man who spoke French, major bonus points was when he explained everything in English!   We went while he was doing a trial run on new sandwiches. We got four. Haha it ended up costing 30$ for 4 sandwiches and a rootbeer.  Totally worth it. They were all delicious, my fav was the roast beef!!   Hunt this little place down for delicious sandwiches with a wonderful friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem...owner is super nice and passionate - he takes his sandwiches seriously and you can tell. Top quality ingredients with awesome bread from Arhoma bakery. This place is 100% worth checking out. Bonus tip - these guys are open Monday which is not so easy to find in Saint-Henri."}
