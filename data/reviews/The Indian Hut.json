{"text":"We went to the Indian Hut for lunch. The place was packed, a good sign that the food is good. We even saw people of Indian origin eating here, another staple of authenticity.

Let's start with the food. The choices were limited and they all looked good. I ended up having the butter chicken and tandoori chicken. The naan was still hot and tasty.

They serve a strange beer, a Cheetah mango lager. It paired well with the spicy food."}
{"text":"Two words to describe Indian Hut:  THE BUFFET.  This is a place with a great buffet.  If a la carte is your style, don't come here.  But all you can eat?  You've found the right place.  

Why the buffet?  Well unlike a lot of other buffets, the Indian Hut buffet, while small offers fresh fresh food.  The variety is also excellent for a small buffet, featuring different types of dishes that all don't come out tasting the same.  I love the vegetarian dishes, which make up probably 5-6 items in their buffet (not counting the salad bar).  The meat dishes are good as well, but not the highlight for me.  There is always the standard butter chicken and chicken tandoori (which I feel is always a tad overdry due to being left out too long).  The waiters bring fresh naan to the table, so it is piping hot and so yummy.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  

A small but very decent buffet.  Between Indian Hut Buffet and Trimurti, I vote Indian Hut."}
{"text":"Ive been to 3 or 4 other Indian buffet places in downtown Toronto and this is definitely my favorite.

The food was fresh (which is something that bothers me at most other Indian restaurants), the food was also very flavorful, not oily, and not too overwhelmingly spicy. 

My top 3 dishes were the Eggplant, Palak Paneer, and the mint Chutney with the Samosas. yummmmmmm! 

I guess in general it is kind of pricy but I was able to get a Groupon for 2 can dine for $20. The total bill came out to be $30 which was very reasonable considering how good the food was. Service was also very quick and friendly. Cannot wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"I have heard other stories (one from my boss who doesn't make stuff up) about poor service and general unfriendliness on the part of the owner/manager at the Indian Hut and therefore have changed my rating to 3 stars.  When I read the review about the alleged \"assault\" on Stephanie M, I recalled that we were none to pleased when we were also charged gratuity without our permission. We were very pleased with the food and service however so we just paid the bill (thank God in hindsight!!).

My boss was treated very poorly and vowed never to return, previously he was an advocate of the establishment.

So it seems the reason for the low overall rating on this place is the attitude of the owner/manager/family.  If they want to recover their ratings and help their business, they need to realize that good food is just not enough to cut it in the restaurant business, and start treating customers with respect.

And if you offer a deal through a coupon website, and it starts to seem like a bad idea, you need to man up and honour your committment to the people who bought your deal, tipping is not something that is demanded, it is earned...."}
{"text":"Given the price, the portions weren't large and the taste of the dishes was a mixed bag. Some of it tasted a bit watered down though one of our dishes was very good. One eggplant dish was basically sweet, watery mush, inedible. The dinner buffet also had a very limited selection, and only two dishes for the lactose intolerant among us.

The patio is lovely for a relaxed dinner and the service was attentive and friendly. Also, the dishes are prepared fresh so I had mine made without cream which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Had the dinner buffet on Friday night. It was not cheap , but the food was quite good. The lamb was succulent  and so yummy .I found the butter chicken a bit too sweet, but still good. Will  definetly go again, especially since I live in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night for the first time and so pleased that we did.  The place was packed, the food was great, the service was friendly and the setting was great.  Cannot wait until their patio opens.  A great neighbourhood find that should definately be checked out."}
{"text":"Ventured there because of a Groupon. It was not a Groupon wasted! The food was good and so was the service.

I have to agree with everyone, the naan was extremely delicious. However at the time we went, there wasn't much naan available. We arrived about 8pm; it was a late dinner. The buffet selection was rather tiny, but all the staples in Indian Cuisine were available. There was Butter chicken, Tandoori chicken, Biriyani Rice etc... It is good if you're not looking to try all the different Indian dishes. The salad/dessert section was rather small, and not much of a selection. Just a deep Freeze with Ice Cream and off the hot section was rice pudding, Julab Jamun and not too much more. 

The d√©cor, was a little less than what I would expect from an Indian restaurant on Church. The colors were dull, and poorly put together. I was expecting bright vibrant colors, that of the Indian culture, but walked into a dimly lit room with dull wall colors and table setting.

But the food is definitely something to go for. I would go back just for the food."}
{"text":"Staff: pretty friendly, but service is kind of slow, or they sometimes forgot about you.

I went for the dinner buffet, its ridiculously over priced for the limited amount of items they have. The food itself is average, and I've tasted better in several other indian places downtown. 

I'd recommend going here once, but thats about it."}
{"text":"I love this place. It offers both a buffet and individual meals.

Me and me friend were both not too hungry so we opted to just get one dish each and split it. I got the chicken vindaloo with a side of rice and he got the butter chicken with a side of garlic naan.

The vindaloo was deliciously spicy and flavourful, my mouth waters at the thought of it. The butter chicken was good too, but to me paled in comparison to the vindaloo. 

The funny thing was that our bills both came to around just under $20, which ended up costing more than the buffet. 

I can't wait to revisit this restaurant for the lunch buffer and just eat for hours."}
{"text":"This place is right by work, and being buffet style you can get in, well fed, and back to work in 45 min. They are very nice and regularity accommodate our 10am phone calls for lunchtime reservations of parties of 8 etc.

This really is not the best Indian Food in Toronto, but it is certainly good. Saag Paneer is Great. Naan Always Fresh. The Bharta is a little sweet for my tastes, but the Chana is yummy.

I think the trick is to go for lunch buffet. It is very busy and the food constantly replenished (Fresh!) You get completely stuffed for the Buffet price ($10.95?) Good selection of meat/veggie options. 

Our water is always refilled, they will do separate bills, take plastic and the rice pudding is a nice dessert. The guy that serves the tables and busses plates always has the largest smile and is super friendly. Makes me happy."}
{"text":"Great, authentic-tasting indian food
Friendly staff
I recommend getting a buffet special for lunch/dinner"}
{"text":"great atmosphere, great food. Been to this place a dozen time now ,
Especially try their kebab dish, tandoori chicken , and mixed veggie.. great people working there too"}
{"text":"Closed for renovation, but no information about it on their website or on the phone....their phone just keeps ringing then goes into a full mailbox. I realized what's going on when I walked over to the place. They need to update their web and phone message."}
{"text":"I should have known better, this place is consistent, it never fails to disapont.  Went for lunch buffet.  The Lamb Madras was all bones, only 3 tablespoon size pieces of mean in the buffet pan.  The Butter Chicken was bland, I have made better at home with VH sauces from Food Basics.  There were, no samosas or pakoura.   The freezer where the ice cream and sherberts are kept was covered, it is uncovered for the $17.95 dinner buffet.  Much better would have been the (non buffet) Byrani House on Hayden Street or Kathmandu on Yonge south of Maitland."}
{"text":"Come here for the buffet!

I've walked by this place many of times.  
There is a banner stating \"Best Indian Food in Toronto!\"
That banner may be a bit outdated.  Definitely not the best Indian food in the city... but not the worst either.

The service was good. The servers were always smiling and refilling our water.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and it's a popular place for locals.  I probably wouldn't venture out of my way to eat here, but if you are in the area and want Indian food, the buffet is great!

Most people are here for the lunch or dinner buffet. ($12.95/$17.95).

The buffet isn't huge, but it covers the basics.

The Saag Paneer was really good, I hunted around for the paneer pieces.  The eggplant was the surprise hit.  It was oily and tasty, delicious!

The Butter chicken had large chunks of fresh chicken but wasn't very flavorful or tomato-y.

Lamb curry was all bones, I gave up.

Tandoori chicken was really dry.  But it's a buffet and it's been sitting for a bit.

The samosas and pekoras were meh.  I wish I didn't put them on my plate at all.

They didn't have any naan replenished while I was eating.
I tasted some from my friend's plate, it was chewy.. I didn't miss much. 

Gulab Jamun is one of my favourite desserts.  I'm so glad they were part of the buffet!  I feel like after having my dessert, I forgot about the other items that were mediorcre.

Overall, it was a good dinner and I'll be back when I need a paneer fix!  ...and Gulab Jamun."}
{"text":"Went to the Indian Hut for dinner. Was greeted nicely . The selection is few. You have the staples such as butter chicken, goat curry, tandoori chicken. For veg you have chickpeas,eggplant, mixed vegetable , rice. A few appetizers. The food is so so.  Nothing special. The price is high and the tip which they suggest is aggressive. 
I have been to countless buffets all over GTA and this is  quite forgetable. Then again it is downtown Toronto and getting a decent priced Indian buffet is probably out of question.
And also the people who are fascinated by the food and are giving it 5 stars, have you been to other Indian buffets or is your choice limited to downtown only because you are missing out then."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Friday and the food was great.  I must say that their Naan and Rice was amazing.  I know sounds crazy to start a review that way but you know when you have awesome Indian rice and that delicious naan - it's to die for.  I love my carbs!

The chicken vandeloo was excellent with luscious flavors.  You could see the rich ingredients and spices from crushed chilli to herbal leaves and peppercorns ...  This was not your typical brunch spot!

But what you must come here for is the mango beer.  Sounds crazy but trust me - it's amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a decent little Indian restaurant with a standard lunch buffet. The butter chicken, masala, and paneer are very good and the other items are decent. With a soft drink and tip, it's about a $20 lunch, which is decent for a buffet.

In terms of atmosphere, it's on the main floor of an old house, so it's a bit cramped but generally pleasant. The service is decent."}
{"text":"I'd actually like to give it a 2.5 but a 3 is close enough.
We came September and sat on the pretty patio. The woman who greeted us wasn't very friendly and since one of the girls I came with brought along her baby we were told to stay outside because it might be 'too loud for a baby inside'... Uh... Ok..? Already we deducted a point- we did not feel welcome and the woman was fully aware of that. 
The waiters were probably the best thing about the whole experience. As though they are used to having to overcompensate for the owners terrible customer service. 
The food itself was a big old disappointment to me. You go inside to the back, where a living room would probably be... And there were maybe 5 choices of unidentifiable foods. The naan was tasty- I pretty much had a lunch that consisted of naan, rice, and I think the liquid from butter chicken since there was none left. 
Would I return? Definitely not. It grossed me out a bit. The food was so unappetizing to look at and to eat- disappointing since I actually love Indian (was one of my favorite things about living in the UK years ago...)"}
{"text":"EEK! Vanessa's review differs drastically from mine, but I have never ordered take out from the Indian Hut. 

However, I do know there's a worthy, appetizing, fantastic Indian lunch buffet for only $10.95 located in it! 

YESSERIE, you heard me correctly, I said INDIAN LUNCH BUFFET and for a great steal too! Don't you want in on this deal?!

Unlike the first review, I found all their dishes savory and heavenly. The butter chicken is my fave. She's right about the naan, it is good and the yummy rice adds the right mix to all the saucy dishes. 

Apparently, there's also a salad bar. But whenever I'm here, I skip over it and head straight for the goods. My theory on salad for buffets - salad is wasted space in your belly. Why fill up on salad when you can save that room for the real reasons why you're eating a buffet? 

Lunch hour can get very busy, but if you make your way over to Indian Hut 15 minutes before noon, you shouldn't have a problem getting a table."}
{"text":"Yum!  I came here with some friends for the first time the other day. We did the $12.95 lunch buffet, and we all shoved our faces with delicious Indian fare!  The lunch buffet was a bit modest but it had all the staple Indian dishes, including about 5 types of meat dishes, the chick peas and eggplant dishes, rice, naan, salad, and 2 types of desserts.  I'd definitely suggest the buffet for lunch, since individual dishes run between $8 and $12.  I had 2 plates of food, and everything was super tasty!  The only criticism was with the lamb dish, which was mostly boney and tough.  Besides that though, everything else was spot on.  I'd definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times over the last couple of years. Most of the time the food has been good.. sometimes not always hot.. there is not a huge selection but there are only a few dishes I like.

So everything I am about to write is absolutely true! Nothing has been exaggerated!! It took me over a week to really process this before writing this review.

I purchased a voucher from Deal Find.. $40 worth of food for $20.. I took my friend who happens to be Indian as well.. she was craving some Indian food and I told her I had purchased the voucher. 

The food was not very hot on our visit at 8pm at night with a few other patrons in the restaurant. My friend commented how they didn't have much of a selection and the food was not overly tasty. 

Our bill came and my friend noticed an automatic gratuity of $7.89 on our bill. So we called over the server and he said that is what his manager told him to do. So we asked for the manager to come over. She came over and started complaining to us on how she was losing money from these vouchers. The previous week how many people did not pay the difference in their bills if it was over $40 and they didn't pay tax or tip! 

Then her daughter came over and injected herself into our conversation but with a lot of attitude and disrespect. The daughter stated this is their business and they can run as they see fit. They can charge whatever tax and tip they want to. I was shocked!! I stated if that's how they want to run their business then they need to disclose that as soon as someone walks in the door not when they are paying. 

Needless to say this conversation went downhill. Anything my friend and I would say, the daughter would twist our words and try to throw it back in our faces. I finally said, this is not my first time here and I hope it's not my last time here but this situation is getting out of hand, let's calm down. And I asked the mother to let me finish speaking as she was constantly talking over us and/or interrupting us. 

Well then the two of them went off on us, calling us the rude and disrespectful ones. that they didn't want us as customers, they didn't need our money and they wanted us to leave and told us not to come back.

So my friend and I left and as we were walking up Church St. my friend got grabbed from behind by the mother/manager/owner. She was trying to grab my friends purse. She starts yelling out to anyone on the street saying to call the cops on us because we didn't pay our bill!! I'm said to her, that's not what you said in the restaurant, get your hands off of us. 

She then tried to get my bag strap over my head and was choking me in the process. I started to yell, THIS IS ASSAULT!! I said go ahead and call the police because I will have you charged with assault. It still took a few more minutes to get her off of me, then she went back at attacking my friend. Then me, then my friend again. Then some man from the restaurant said something to her in Hindi and she finally backed off. 

My friend later told me she was telling her daughter to get our bags in Hindi. My friend lost an earring and I was covered in black ink all over my hands and my jacket from the assault, like defensive wounds on an assault victim.

I called Deal Find the next day and told them I had no reason to make up any of the following.. who could really??!! This is a crazy story to tell. I suggested they cancel all the other vouchers to save anyone else going through a similar experience. She called me back and said the owner said it was just a misunderstanding over the gratuity, nothing else happened."}
{"text":"With so many Indian buffets in the city, I think the small differences count. I came to The Indian Hut with a groupon. The food did not disappoint, but nor was I blown away. 

The Pros:
-Servers seem more \"alive\". I find that in many Indian Buffets, the servers act like zombies. No offense. 
-Food quality is good. The butter chicken and Tandoori chicken was very delicious.
-They have ice cream!

The Cons:
-Regular price is higher than most places. $17.95/person. I've had lunch buffet and dinner buffets at $10 and $15 respectively for similar quality of food. 
-Selection does not reflect the premium they charge. Banjara on Eglinton has lunch buffet for just $10 and their selection is greater.
-I really wanted some beef and Indian Hut had no beef. 

So if you're in the area and want some Indian food, Indian Hut is not a bad choice. I understand not everyone is a bargain hunter like me. :)"}
{"text":"The Indian Hut presented delicious and tasty Indian fare for a reasonable price. The atmosphere was dim and intimate, decked with cultural murals, pictures and tarps. 
I enjoyed their dinner buffet, the assortment was typical- ranging from paneer, butter chicken, chicken tikka, samosas, lamb, etc. Nothing different, however, and items were abundant. Freshness was a slight question for some items, others looked and tasted great.

Would have come if it were not for my Groupon though? No, probably not. Only because there are other Indian restaurants close (enough) that see more traffic, priced similar, and offer a few more items. 

Overall, the food was good, ambiance was good, and the prices were O.K."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on a Thursday. Word to the Wise: Dinner starts at 530! So after waiting for a little we were then greeted with beautiful aromas and the decor was alright. The food was very flavorful and good portions! I had the chicken vindaloo and my only complaint would be there was only one potato in my vindaloo, I wanted more! Other then that fantastic place and I will be back shortly!"}
{"text":"So let's start off by saying this is more of a 2.5/5.  I don't think it deserves a 3, because there are areas that need big improvement.

Before we get to that, let's start off with the pros:

a) Seems very authentic, and even the presentation of the buffet looks authentic
b) Quaint establishment
c) Butter chicken is good

Areas for improvement:
a) Price point - 12.99 is expensive for a lunch buffet and considering they only have 5-6 main dishes, I find this quite pricey.  
b) I've been here twice.  Both times, they were slow to re-fill the butter chicken and the goat and mostly been left with veggies.  While I love veggies, I really don't like paying that much for unlimited veggie food.  
c) This happened over 2 years ago, but two co-workers of mine asked if the food was halal.  They said \"yes\" on the phone.  When they got to the restaurant, they asked a waiter again if the food was halal, waiter said \"let me check\".  It was a no.  And when my co-workers tasted it, it wasn't halal (somehow they could tell).  Don't appreciate that.  

Hopefully, they have gotten their act together since then."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered in here the other night and I must say I wasn't impressed. Although I am not a huge fan of Indian food, there are certain dishes I love like Butter Chicken. 

But the food we got from here wasn't as tasty as other Indian places I've been to. The portions were HUGE and spilling out as soon as opened the aluminum containers, the butter chicken seemed watery, not creamy as I had remembered. The naan was good but I wanted something tasty to sop it up with! We also ordered pakoras which were tasty but a little on the dry side. 

The food, for take out, was also quite expensive - $45 for naan, an order of butter chicken, palak panir and pakoras. It doesn't seem right in a city as large as Toronto that they can change so much for their food - there are tons of places to get inexpensive Indian food in the city and I am sure it tastes much, much better than this."}
{"text":"Yeah not bad. The buffet was quite fresh. The salads were yummy. The food was a bit watered down and lack the spice you might expect from an Indian place. But for the lighter at heart Indian food lovers this is the place for you. The servers were super sweet. The atmosphere is lovely. And the patio was like a cottage dock. 
All in all a good place to come back to"}
{"text":"My family went for dinner, all getting the buffet for $18. It included lentil soup, a salad bar, a wide variety of entrees, and dessert. It's was very very good. The staff was tip top. I can't say enough good things about this place. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Had a lot of trouble deciding whether to give this place a 3 or 4 stars, but I'll give it 4, but felt the food was more of a 3. The service was great.

Food, I'm a very meaty picker, so I wasn't very interested in the chickpea's nor was I interested in the vegetable/eggplant dishes. The buffet selection itself was small. They had butter chicken, lamb, and tandoori chicken. The food at the buffet was more warm than hot.

Their rice was...alright. It tasted just like regular rice, nothing special. I disliked the tandoori chicken because it wasn't really soft and settled on eating just the butter chicken. As for the lamb, it was good, just would prefer it to not have so much bones and to have the pieces cut a bit smaller. Their butter chicken was the best dish and the one I had the most of. Reason being, that the chicken was very soft, the cuts were bite sized. Their Naan was fresh (it goes out fairly quickly), but whoever made it, burnt the Naan on one side.  I didn't notice it was burnt until I flipped it around...-._-|| 

The sauce was flavorful, but it didn't feel like the spices were there compared to other indian places I've been to. 

For an AYCE buffet for 12.95 at lunch. I would say that considering the quantity of food, service from the waitresses (attentive and friendly), and location, I would return here again, but only if I am feeling super hungry."}
{"text":"Service is friendly. Quality food, to be honest I would eat here more if it was more affordable, too pricey."}
{"text":"It's a bad experience to go there during a busy Friday afternoon. The range of dishes was narrow; worse was that almost every salad and meat dish was emptied. Were there more selections, I could have picked other food. 

The tandoori chicken was great: strong and deep flavor. The butter chicken was mediocre, just a curry of chicken piece. The goat curry was full of flavor. The eggplant curry was strange: it tasted sweet and ketchup. The spinach curry was good but watery. The daal marsala had a sharp garlic flavor. 

The pulao rice was wet and oily, like steamed rice. The naan was freshly baked, soft and with the smell of the grill. The salads were simply pickles, and one was vinegar+veggie. The rice pudding was mushy and the apple custard was OK. 

It sounds great, isn't it? But I could try only a little for each of them. I walked four times until there was naan, and mostly people grabbed all of them. There was papadum but no pakora or samosa. No gulab jamun or sweet vermicelli. 

After an hour of lunch, the salads and the tandoori chicken were not yet refilled. Whoever came late could only try veggie curry and goat curry. 

The restaurant has a good atmosphere, too good to accommodate a buffet: it could not offer enough food and proper service to customers! If you go for food, don't go there. If you want a good environment to dine, perhaps you may order from the menu, just no buffet."}
{"text":"The selection was weak, only about 3 choices of appetizers and 5-6 main dishes. They were missing key dishes like Matter Paneer or Paneer Makhani. Also, during the entire meal the samosas were finished and they did not restock. The naans are also quite chewy, really close to being under cooked. The naan was also only brought over once and only after asking for them twice. The worst part was the \"suggested gratuity\" that they put on the bill. This is the only restaurant that I've ever been to that did this. And it's an aggressive suggested tip. Overall, this place is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner buffet on a Tuesday night. It would have worth three stars or more had it not the flies hovering over the food. The food is tasty even though the selection is few."}
{"text":"I popped in for lunch recently and did a take away buffet meal.

I found the food good but a bit pricey for 1 take out meal ($14).

Would I go here again? Yes but not for take out. The decor is great and really well done. They've done a great job of setting up a nice ambiance for their clientele.

It gets a thumbs up from me. But the price point for take out was a bit steep."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly waiters, pretty much fills up with customers during lunch buffets."}
{"text":"I used to come by here a lot. And I thought the price was pretty great for AYCE since their butter chicken and lamb masala is reaaal good with their naan! Also because the place is pretty cozy and the waiters are always around refilling people's water. based on this, I would have given 4 stars. 

BUT I don't really like businesses who offer groupon coupons and then offer particularly bad service or to charge extra hidden fees when their customs redeem them. (Like why bother in the first place??) anyway. The Indian hut had a special 2 person groupon deal and I ended up feeling like they treated me differently than usual once I told them I had the groupon. Also upon redeeming it, they charged like a mandatory $3-4 tip plus they said taxes weren't included. So I ended up really only saving like a dollar with the groupon =_=. I felt like I saved a dollar for a bad feeling and shitty service for a place I usually liked.

Anyway..I haven't really been back since but I'm sure if you go without a coupon it'd be a great experience :D"}
{"text":"A group of four of us were meeting up after work at Church and Bloor to grab a bite and spend some time catching up.  The Indian Hut was close by, so we decided to try the buffet.  It was a very early dinner and we were the first patrons to arrive.  We had to wait a bit for them to set up though it was past their advertised opening time.  It was a beautiful day and we were in no big hurry, so that was fine.  We sat outside on the front deck which was quite pleasant.  Our drink orders were promptly taken and soon enough the buffet was ready.

I have to say from the start, I am really not a fan of buffets.  I guess for that reason, I wasn't expecting too much.  The food was okay.  Nothing I tried was stellar, but everything was reasonably okay.  It definitely wasn't the worst Indian food I've eaten, but I know a lot of other places I prefer."}
{"text":"I will not be returning here. Every time I go here I order pretty much the same thing off the a la carte menu: naan, rice, butter chicken. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. Sometimes it watery, poor quality, sometimes it's better quality. Sometimes a lot of good quality chicken, sometimes less fresh tasting and/or less meat. Maybe they have different chefs following different recipes. Or maybe they are sometimes scooping their to-go orders from their dinner buffet? Yes, I think that's it."}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in the city. Their eggplant delight is literally the tastiest Indian dish you will ever put in your mouth - I could eat it every single day. Fresh hot naan brought to your table, fantastic and authentic pilau rice, veggie pakoras that are addictive and incredibly tender goat.

Better for eat in than take out, but always my comfort food go-to spot either way."}
