{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been overwhelmed by awesomeness -- Akai may well be the best Japanese food I've ever had. I'm from Vancouver, so that's a huge compliment. And, I'm Japanese. Heh.

Note: my partner and I are vegetarian, and loved the food and available selection.

I've been desperate for decent Japanese food since moving to Toronto. Everything I've tried has been disappointing.

Highlights of tonight's meal:

- Ambiance: it's so lovely inside! Just like a little Japanese house. Even the bathrooms are nicely decorated. Feels like fine dining Japanese at much lower prices.
- Spicy veggie crunch roll: so delicious! 
- Udon: noodles were perfect (have not found anything like them until now) and the broth was yummy
- Tempura: crispy, light, non-greasy
- Service: outstanding. As others have commented, they really take care to be prompt but not intrusive. The girl who served us was lovely.
- Extras: they gave us both a complimentary piece of deep-fried tofu AND for dessert, an orange dressed in kiwi and sliced strawberries and the tinniest bit of whipped cream..just enough to enhance the flavours.
- Presentation: everything was presented beautifully, especially the spicy roll

Akai just feels like a *real* Japanese restaurant, just like back home. It's not a discount place so expect to pay $12-$15 per entree -- much cheaper than other meals if you think about it. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered a spicy tuna and spicy salmon roll with crunchies - usually delightful rolls, but not here. There was hardly any fish inside. It was basically a rice ball filled with mayonnaise and tempura. I ate half of the rolls, and told the wait staff that I thought the rolls were terrible. They smiled politely and charged me for everything. 

On a positive note, some of the other customers appeared to have lovely looking sushi. Perhaps the spicy rolls are the only ones that are terrible."}
{"text":"Found this place through reviews in Yelp. Cute place and super friendly staff. Food presentation was nice and everything tasted great. Loved the fact that they had a veggie dragon roll on the menu. Delicious. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Akai is miles ahead of anything else in the Annex. It's a little out of the way on the corner of Harbord and Major, and completely worth the 5 minute walk.

The Annex has no dearth of second-rate sushi restaurants -- the best of them boasting shoddy service and run-of-the-mill fare. It's really nice to have an option like this in contrast to the rest. 

The perfect seared sashimi, quaint and traditional decor, mom and pop ownership, and friendly and present service will quickly shatter your new-gen/sushi-on-bloor paradigm."}
{"text":"Akai is great. The sushi is always so fresh it reminds me of Vancouver. The presentation is incredible as well. There are endless sushi restaurants on Bloor st so there is competition but  it is way above the Bloor street standards. The prices are not much different from Bloor st either. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious, not to much rice and nice presentation.  Service was thoughtful and courteous. Good experience overall"}
{"text":"I love this place; the food quality is higher than other sushi places nearby. The price is a little higher but well worth it. Their wasabi is more organic as it seems like fresh wasabi and not wasabi powder. Fishes are fresh, and sushi rice is well seasoned. Also, the services are excellent."}
{"text":"I went to Akai sushi restaurant recently and noticed that the cook has changed a few month ago. There is a sign outside saying 'under new management' so I assume the owner changed. The food tasted better than before for sure!! Sashimi tasted fresher and maki rolls were yummy. It seems more like izakaya in the evening. I love to hang out here with my friends for sake. It is not what it used to be. Gotta try good Japanese cuisines."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is the best sushi in Toronto hands down. We ordered the love boat and were presented with a wonderful presentation of succulent sashimi and sushi. The service was excellent. The staff here is so warm and friendly. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Akai is another attempt to bring Harbord street to life and have a nice, way more quieter alternative to the Annex madness.

It just partially achieves so though. Of course, if you are thinking to go to trashy Bloor street sushi bars, please go here instead. It's still a nice alternative just one block south. The place is small and cozy and the service is always super-polite.

Don't expect to be enlightened by the taste. The salmon/tuna are regularly fresh, some very interesting rolls are offered (my favorite is the \"crunch\", could eat 5 of those!) and every possible modification of the menu is accepted. On the subjective side I find the rolls too small so I always have to spend more $$ to get full. I still keep coming back there from time to time when a good old sushi craving hits me."}
{"text":"Great sushis, makis, sashimis at a reasonable price. Seafood especially Japanese is usually pricey.  Very good combos that have plenty of quality food for again a reasonable price. They also have great Ramen. I had the spicey seafood Ramen which was excellent."}
{"text":"This place has been my go to for sushi in Toronto for the past couple years. The environment is very cozy, not always packed, the service although slow when packed, they make up for it in kindness and are alway willing to accommodate. The sushi here is one of the best I have had for the price. I would highly recommend these rolls - AAC, Golden bridge, Green farm, crunch roll. For sushi I would recommend their uni when Its in season, salmon, and escola. But to be honest I have almost liked every thing I have tried here! 
- happy eating"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in the last two weeks and ordered once online. I love the atmosphere. It's quiet, cozy, and I think there is good attention to detail in the service and the food. Their green salad with house dressing is a must. Much better than the places on Bloor."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in the Annex. Quaint restaurant with great service and food. And if you're into take away, they have a happy hour special.
The inari sushi is worth trying."}
{"text":"It's a nice vibe, small cozy sushi place. They have good Sapporo and black Asahi beer. The sushi is good,  somewhat average, but good price. We had the sushi platter and there was more than  enough for 2 people -  couldn't finish it. The service is good and friendly"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Never very busy but they are very attentive and friendly. I am not really sure why they are never busy. I have only ever been there with one other group. 

Sushi is very fresh, and tasty. It is a nice touch that they give you complimentary tea and dessert."}
{"text":"I visited here on a Friday with a date, and was very impressed with the atmosphere, service, and quality of food. 

We arrived at 7:30 pm (having booked a reservation the day before) and the place was packed, with no spare seating available save for reserved spots. So be sure to reserve if you're coming over the end of the week/weekend!

The restaurant was well lit, though not bright, and so set a great mood for the evening. Though filled to capacity it was easy to speak across the table, and the small candle on our table was a nice touch.

The server was prompt and always around when we needed her but was never overbearing. We were largely left to ourselves save for when food, tea, or the bill were being delivered. Which was exactly as we wanted it. She was helpful whenever we asked her a question.

The quality of food was very good. We ordered the small sashimi boat (25 pieces) and a pair of rolls; one spicy, the other with large amounts of guacamole. Everything we had was very good and was ample for the two of us. Our experience would have been slightly improved if the server had actually told us what the different kinds of fish were included in the boat. While we could identify most of the fish there were two that, while good, weren't immediately identifiable to either of us.

On the whole I enjoyed my visit here and hope/expect to return again. It's a great, quiet, place to come on a Friday or Saturday night and I'd highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"I think they must have changed the chef of something.  This place was good 6 months ago, but it's awful now."}
{"text":"This neighborhood has a lot of fantastic sushi places, and because we live here, we sampled quite a few. This place does serve some fantastic sushi,  but we ended up settling on this one because of the extras: the atmosphere is great, warm and cosy and quiet; the menu is very big; the staff is very nice. And then there are the details that end up mattering: the healthy salad dressing or the extra cup on top of the hot sake to keep it warm (never understood why sushi places never think of this).

Highly recommended for a romantic night!"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 from me. I came here for an early dinner a week or so ago. It's a little dark, but the ambiance is still pretty cozy.

I decided to get the Chirashi dinner. It came with the standard soup and salad, along with fried tofu and potato strands. Like another yelper mentioned, the miso soup had a bit of an odd and unpleasant chlorinated taste to it.

Chirashi was $15.95. There was a lot of fish! Quantity wise, definitely worth the cost. It was at the point where actually getting to the rice was difficult. Still, the fish was fresh and the rice was good! I particularly enjoyed the juicy butter fish and the fresh BC tuna. 

While the flavors and the freshness were good I feel like the temperature was not controlled well despite being one of the few patrons of the restaurant at the time. By this I mean that the fish was kind of oddly luke-warm. It's a little hard to explain, so I'll just say I've had better Chirashi for the same/less cost. That being said, Akai is definitely better than say, Sushi on Bloor or New Gen, despite being a little more expensive. It's also only open for dinner. 

Before I left I was also treated to a complimentary mango ice cream. Awesome! It's why I'm tacking on the .5 to the score.

For a full review, feel free to visit my food blog, conveniently located in my profile. Cheers! :)"}
{"text":"A great little spot away from the many sushi places on Bloor to the north. A great ambiance -- the table for larger groups (max 6-7) is in a bit of an alcove, so you get some privacy. The sushi is phenomenal -- fresh and a wide selection beyond the standard spicy tuna rolls. I personally enjoy their take on the Dragon rolls. Just be careful, the rolls can add up!"}
{"text":"Best affordable sushi restaurant In Toronto. Good date spot near the annex, quiet and has friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was also very good. They have some very creative sushi. My favorite one was a spicy salmon with grilled salmon on top. I can't remember the name but that one is worth trying. The sushi and sashimi boat have a good collection of items. I wish they offered some miso and salad to start your meal with."}
{"text":"Akai has definitely improved lately. I came to this restaurant about a year ago and was thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the meal. Nonetheless, last week I decided to give it another shot to see if anything had changed and I am sure glad I did. I ordered the vegetarian tempura, the chicken teriyaki meal and a vegetarian green dragon roll and all were delicious. The food was fresh and the atmosphere was great. The only issue I had with the place was the slow service, as there was only one chef working and one server but the place was packed."}
{"text":"Nice sushi place away from the Bloor street crowd. Really friendly staff. The sushi was really well presented and very tasty. We had the dynamite, spicy salmon and spicy tuna and they were all fresh and well put together. 

We also got the gy?za which were good too."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this update, but our last experience at Akai was so disappointing that I think it's only fair.

I have to reframe my comments about this restaurant to say that when Akai is not busy, it's a great place to go.  But a couple of nights ago it was slammed (there was a pumpkin festival on the street after Halloween) and it was among the worst service experiences I've had. 

I went with my mom and stepdad and from the beginning, everything was just off.  Tables were left uncleared by the server, so we waited for a clean spot.  We waited a very long time to have our order taken.  We waited ages just for the water and tea we had ordered to arrive (20-25 mins?)  After about 45 minutes our salads arrived but not together.  My mom's calamari salad was frozen and inedible.  My stepdad's sashimi salad was completely different than what was described on the menu.  When my mom explained that her salad was frozen, our harried server took it away with no explanation or suggestion of whether she would get another one.

Then another 30 minutes went by with no service at all.  We reconciled ourselves to the fact that the usual tofu appetizer that they serve was not happening tonight.

Finally, more than an hour after we sat down, my mom and stepdad's sushi came to the table.  But mine was nowhere to be found.  Then another calamari salad arrived for my mom - still almost frozen.  Still no meal for me.  20 minutes later, when my mom and stepdad were almost done their rolls, my roll arrived with no ginger or wasabi on the plate.  

The server seemed apologetic, but took nothing off the bill (even though she said she would take my stepdad's salad off because it wasn't what he ordered).  To make matters worse, my stepdad reported feeling a little sick to his stomach later that evening.

Oh, Akai.  My heart is breaking for you.  I still love you in my heart, but this experience truly sucked.  My advice?  Go during the slow hours to enjoy a great experience.  Skip it when it's busy."}
{"text":"It was clean and quiet. It had a very soothing atmosphere. The presentation of the food was quite nice and they tasted great. I cannot remember what i had exactly but I think what I ordered had a word 'orange in it. It was pretty darn great."}
{"text":"This is a worthy restaurant in a very crowded market. It is a significant step up from  the cheap and \"all-you-can-eat\" type sushi restaurants just to the north on Bloor street.
It was pleasant to see that it was relatively full, even on a Monday evening. So, others clearly appreciate it.

The restaurant is divided into different sections, so you do not feel crowded and the ambient noise is perfectly tolerable. The service is impeccably polite and careful.

Without going through the whole of our menu, we found the Edamame fine and hot, the Maguro sushi was spectacular as was the yellowtail sashimi, the Kamakasi roll was indifferent, the vegetable tempura were very hot and good. All in all you will find some well worthwhile offerings here and there is plenty to choose from.

There were lots of different Sakis on the drink menu."}
{"text":"I had: one of the specials involving chicken teriyaki and california rolls"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Just bit out of the way but definitely worth the walk! Try their avalanche! Sweet yet delicate"}
{"text":"So I didn't have Sushi here, so maybe you can take this review with a grain of salt.  That being said, I was not at all impressed with this place.  I ordered bibimbap and it was cold.  On top of that, the egg was not fully cooked at all...the whites were still runny.  They only brought out small containers of hot sauce...which while nicer that a large jar was not sufficient.  I kind of always thought that bibimbap was something you couldn't mess up....but i was proved wrong.

One plus is they brought out these fried tofu cubes as an appetizer. They were pretty damn good...though again...difficult to mess up fried tofu...or fried anything for that matter..."}
{"text":"We couldn't get into Yasu because we didn't have a reservation.  Walked down the street and found Akai.   Sushi and Sashimi were first rate.  Very good and fresh.   Really liked it and would recommend it.   We tried a lot of stuff and didn't have anything bad.   Lots of decent Saki choices also.   Our only ding was the service after the sushi was delivered.   They were friendly but just didn't come around much to check on us for drinks, need anything, ect.   After asking for additional ginger/wasabi they just forgot apparently.   They give you very little with even 3 rolls.   In fairness they were very nice, just not around much.    For the food, it was really good."}
{"text":"Amazing place for well priced and extremely fresh sushi! The 40 piece small sushi boat is $45 and included a lot of sushi from different types of fish. The maki was well made with less rice than you'd usually find at this price and a lot more fish. All the sashimi used was very fresh, did not have the usual watery texture that cheaper sushi does. The service was very attentive and friendly, the restaurant is decorated with paper cranes and ambient lighting. We were super impressed and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Akai Sushi is a small, quiet sushi restaurant that definitely exceeded my expectations! Our group of 4 arrived at 7pm on a Friday night without a reservation and were seated right away. We ordered 2 love boats, which each included 16 pieces of Sashimi, 12 pieces of sushi, and 2 fusion rolls (the green dragon roll and the blazing salmon roll). It also included a miso soup and a salad to start. The fish was incredibly fresh and the rolls were delicious. My personal favourite was the blazing salmon roll, which was your typical spicy salmon roll, but topped with torched salmon. I've never had anything like it and I am definitely a fan. 

Our server was friendly and attentive, and our food arrived quickly. Since it wasn't too busy, they allowed us to stay and talk even after we had finished our food, without rushing us to pay or leave. 

The price was pretty reasonable too - $54 per love boat. I will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"You guyyyyyyyyys I think I have a new favourite sushi plaaaaaaaace... 

Offered to take the boymanfriend out for sushi (his favourite) the other night and decided I wanted to try somewhere different - I'm frickin' tired of those cheap-o places on Bloor - so (naturally) I checked Yelp for some other options. Anyway, you get the point. 

We only ordered two items, (the sashimi app. and a dynamite roll thingy. also I got some white wine.) but our snack-like order ended up magically becoming a full meal thanks to magical free things. A (complimentary) deep-fried tofu dish was served before the sashimi. It was tasty and crispy and tasty and stuff. The SASHIMI was crazy-fresh, melt-in-your-mouth awesome. The roll was yummy and nummy and omnomnomnom. But THEN. THEN they gave us freeeeeee ice cream. Strawberry ice cream with slices strawberries and a kiwi slice and whipped cream on top! Yes!! 

ANYWAY, as I said to boymanfriend after dinner: YES this place is a bit more expensive than, say, Sushi on Bloor or New Gen BUT they give you free crap and that TOTALLY makes up for it. Also the atmosphere is WAY nicer and so is the staff (our server was LOVERLY as was the man makin' tha foods). I dig it."}
{"text":"Vegetarian gyoza were not good. The sushi was maybe a 3 out of 10. Bulgogi was a 5 out of 10. Service was 5 out of 10. Setting is just OK. Not going back. So many awesome sushi places around here."}
{"text":"Since they were out of my 2 favourite Sushi, Hamachi and Uni, I decided to order just an assorted sushi set, their least expensive called Akai sushi. The sushi was very fresh and tasty, and the assortment offers very good value. The decor is pleasant in sort of a more traditional Japanese style with paper lanterns, low and intimate light, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place recently reopened after an indefinite hiatus. The previous reviews on Yelp, except for another 5-star review two weeks ago, are from 2010 and earlier.

Judging by the fantastic meal we just had, I'd say the hiatus was more than worth it. It doesn't appear extraordinary from the outside, but the decor is a very pleasant surprise, with wood and paper partitions between some tables, and a very cozy atmosphere that fits right into the Bathurst/Harbord area. Great first impression, check.

We had the Gyoza (beef dumplings), and they were delicious, and obviously fried only once before being served i.e. they weren't frozen beforehand. On to two rolls of maki, where it became immediately obvious that the ingredients were perfectly selected, quite possibly the best and freshest maki we've had in a long while, with none of that refrigerator-taste you sometimes get. We asked for the sushi to be sliced into three pieces rather than two, to make them thinner, and the salmon melted in our mouths. We also had the Katsu chicken dinner, and boy, was the chicken a revelation. The total was about $40, which is fantastic for good Toronto sushi, and with a 25% tip, about $50.

We're probably going to be regulars."}
{"text":"I stopped by because I saw a sign outside the front of the building advertising specials of the day that listed beebimbap.  Well, it turned out to be the worst beebimbap I ever had in my entire life.   Portion was tiny - not surprising since it was listed as a special(discount item of the day).  Quality was horrible - not even fit for my dog.  If the owner of the restaurant does not want to sell beebimbap, he should not put up a sign outside trying to entice would be customers.   

Lesson learned: When I walked in - which was 6PM, a usual prime time for dinner- the restaurant is almost completely empty.  I broke a cardinal rule in restaurant patronage - don't walk in to food establishments that obviously does a bad job that causes customers to stay away.

The waitress was nice and hospitable.  The owner was self absorbed and showed no interest in customers, three that were there last night."}
{"text":"Akai is my go-to sushi place whenever I'm in the area. It's the coziest cutest little space located in a quiet neighbourhood away from Bloor and Spadina. The fish is fresh, the rice is spread out thin (LOVE, I hate filling up with overly sweetened rice), and the presentation is simple yet lovely. The only downside is the tiny bathroom downstairs and I would've rated it 5 stars. If you want some private dining with good sushi, this is the secret hideout :) 

Chef also made me a little sushi-man with the chirashi and it was the cutest."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch special, which is around $15 for sushi, miso soup, and salad. It's definitely pricier than some of the other specials I've had around Toronto, but so worth it for the quality and ambience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a nice little stylish sushi place this is... A good alternative to the Bloor Street saturation, you just have to pop south to Harbord to find this tiny gem. The place is quite small. About the size of some people's living rooms -- maybe about seating for 30 people in total? But that makes for a cozy atmosphere. The decor of the place is simple, but very classic.

I'm guessing this is a relatively new place -- there were only two other people dining when we arrived and this was on a Friday night. So our service was bang-on and we never had to wait very long for our food. I feel like the entire time we were there (from walking in to walking out) was only 30-40 minutes. They don't have any alcohol right now so you can't get Sapporo or anything, but I am not sure if this is because they don't have their liquor license yet.

We benefited from a slow night and hitting this place as it's new on the block, because we were given free spring rolls and dessert. The prices were reasonable but maybe a little more expensive than places like Sushi On Bloor. Having said that, everything I ordered was delicious. We split sushi and maki rolls, agedashi tofu, miso soup and kimchi. Even the salad that comes with the order was so fresh. They serve everything in nice, heavy ceramic dishes. Very nice touch.

Will definitely come back to this place. Service was excellent as well. Everyone thanked us as we were leaving. Again, this could be because it was a slow night, but I am sure this place will grow in popularity once the word gets out."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Escolar - a fish that has been banned in Japan for almost three decades because the Japanese government considers it toxic. When I asked the waitress what the fish was, she gave three or four different \"names\" for the fish including names under which the fish is often fraudulently sold (e.g. butterfish or white tuna).

Sushi quality was good otherwise, but I would not recommend it for the aforementioned reason."}
{"text":"My new favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto! The food is fresh, the cuts are good and they don't over-do it with sauces or dense rice. The restaurant itself is basic and cozy. Come to this restaurant if you're looking for the best, fresh sushi, not if you're looking for a fancy restaurant experience."}
{"text":"We had a great experience last night at Akai.  The decor/atmosphere is fantastic.  I had the veggie bento box which was fabulous, my husband had a sushi selection.  It was beautifully displayed and extremely fresh and tasty - as good as anything we had while living in NYC.

I'd definintely recommend it, it is a much better atmosphere than places in the surrounding area - I think it belongs on Harbord among all of the other great restaurants."}
{"text":"Wiated for 20 mins before the server came to take our order and give us water. The rolls are ok, but the sashimi is not fresh and they cut the radish so thick. Definitely not authentic, will not go back again."}
{"text":"Had an ok experience. Was seated next to a drafty air conditioner, which set an unfortunate and chilly tone for the meal. Tea was free but it was weak and lukewarm. The sushi was good, but I had expected a soup and salad to come with an $18 dinner platter. Not bad, but a bit on the pricey side for an 'alright' experience."}
{"text":"I would give it a 4.5 if only Yelp had half stars. 

We found this place randomly on googlemaps coming home one night. The reviews of this place were very consistent so we thought w would give it a try. We LOVE Japanese food of all tiers. Whether it be a cheap neighbourhood sushi joint or an average/above average priced range sushi restaurant or michelin-starred omakases.  We will go anywhere that serves up some good sushi!

This place is our favourite downtown Japanese restaurant in the average price point tier. We've been back over 5-6 times since we discovered this place a few months back, and this does not include the numerous Doordash/Ubereats during those harsh winter days. They have consistently served really good food! Our absolute go-to is their Love Boat. Their Golden Bridge roll, the mackerel and the white tuna certainly stand out the most from the boat. The portion sizes are quite generous. Their tempura is also made fairly well. The batter is very light and crunchy. 

Overall, we have always had a positive experience eating here. The food is delicious, the price is right and the service is impeccable. Love it!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at this restaurant a few months ago.  We wanted sushi around U of T and found this place while searching Yelp.  The reviews were promising, so we decided to try this place.  

This place did not stand out in any area, as the selection was standard and the service was average, but their fish was fresh.  

One thing that lessened our experience was that tea was not served because something was broken in their kitchen at the time (I think it was their water boiler).  Although this was out of their control, they could have at least offered patrons something in lieu, such as soda, or even a small discount off the meal, as a matter of good customer service."}
{"text":"Akai Sushi is a cute, friendly Japanese joint situated in an odd part of the street. The decoration is very tasteful and welcoming, and the staff is attentive to your needs. There weren't many people there during a weekday lunch, so it's pretty cozy. However, the lighting is very... dark? The contrast between outdoor and indoor lighting was uncomfortable.

You are served genmaicha tea immediately, and the food arrives quite quickly as well. We ordered calamari, tempura, some rolls and sashimi. They were all delicious! The only odd thing is that they fried up broccoli and peas for tempura? It was still yummy though. For two people the total came to around $40 including tip and tax. 

Another thing about Akai is that it's run by Koreans, but apparently it's supposed to be Japanese-Korean fusion cuisine, so it's not a problem. As well, they have really short ceilings in the basement, so if you use the washroom you will probably have to bend down a lot. I would come back though!"}
{"text":"Quaint little sushi joint off the beaten path, off Harbord at the end of a residential street.  Maybe 6-7 tables.  Potentially romantic set-up since there are booths.

Ordered #6 from the Roll Platter Dinners ($24.99/25 pieces w/ miso) + salmon/avo roll.  In hindsight, probably not the best choice to determine whether or not it's a good sushi place as there wasn't a lot of raw fish selection in the platter.

(Spicy salmon primarily composed of tempura bits.  So if you like your spicy salmon that way, this is a good place for that!  I couldn't really taste any salmon.)

What stood out was the presentation.  Attention was actually paid to the platting, including garnish and a design with some sauce.

Would definitely go back and order more fish-based sushi!"}
{"text":"Second visit. I'm in the neighbourhood a lot because I work at Robarts Library. At first, I thought it was pretty overpriced -- I got a sushi set meal this time for $17 before tax, but then I forgot that the fish is pretty decent -- fresh, good portions, good fish to rice ratios, creative preparation (though nothing too crazy). Hell, I even liked the California rolls that came with the set, and Cali rolls are not really my thing. 

Go here! Keep them in business!"}
{"text":"Great quality sushi, nice atmosphere, good attention to customers. No complaints whatsoever. And prices are quite reasonable in relation to comparable places."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and delicious sushi - Akai sushi has it all.

My boyfriend and I had dinner here and ordered a 5 roll combo (California, spicy tuna, dynamite, black dragon, forgot the name) and a lobster roll.

They gave us free miso soup and a side salad. Normally it's not included in dinner, but it was cold outside so they served it anyway. The miso soup was really flavourful and I especially liked the applesauce-like dressing on the salad.

The presentation looked delicious and the sushi was even better - flavourful and super fresh. In total for 2 people (including tax and tip) it came to around $90.

I also really liked the tea they gave us. I asked our server and apparently it was green tea with some brown rice. Speaking of tea, our waiter was very attentive and refilled our tea without us ever asking.

The details mattered too: our napkins were folded nicely with our chopsticks tucked in, and our waiter packed our leftovers for us. Instead of generic hard mints they gave us fruit-flavoured gummies.

One last thing I must mention: we left our leftovers on the table and the waiter ran after us in the cold to hand us the leftovers. Keep in mind that this was a cold November day and we had already walked a good 50 metres away.

It's pricey but the sushi and flawless service definitely made it worth it!"}
{"text":"This is such a classy spot! The staff are amazingly attentive. If you drop a chop stick, they hear it and bring you new ones. Seriously that just happened to me. 

decor and feel are authentic. And the food... unreal. I always go for the Sashima because it's so fresh. Seaweed salad is very flavourful and light. Had the tamboura too (as you can see, I love the food!) and it was a well balanced assortment of vegy and shrimp. 

I live down the street. Very lucky. Cause this is my tied for first sushi spot in the city. Sushi 930 is also unreal. But I do think this spot is better value."}
{"text":"My fav sushi place! And not only because it's only 5 min away from my home..

Akai is a mostly quiet little sushi joint on the not-so-busy street of Harbord, and it makes a nice place to have lunch alone or have a small group dinner. It is ran by Korean owners/chefs so some of the dishes have a bit of Korean take to them.

The Golden Bridge roll (with seared salmon on top) is many people's favourite, Hwe Dup Bap (rice mixed with assorted sashimi and chili paste sauce) and udon are great menus for lunch."}
{"text":"it saddens me that I didn't eat here until now. sushi is very well done. the fish is fresh and the chef is extremely competent. there was one server when I was there and she was pretty friendly."}
{"text":"This place impressed me with its cute decor and relaxed ambiance. It's a very tiny restaurant so I imagine you would need to make reservations on a weekend. 

I got the sashimi dinner set and It's definitely better than AYCE sushi. It's also priced very fairly which makes this place the better option. There were a variety of sashimi pcs and made me very filling at the end! 

Service is very prompt and attentive!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Our favorite sushi place. You can't beat the quality and value. Best Chicken teriyaki in the city!"}
{"text":"Ordered Tako Yaki as an appetizer.  Bit into it and it was ice cold inside. Tasted stale too. Is it normal for restaurants to keep premade Tako Yaki in the fridge and then deep fry it? Or is it supposed to be made fresh?
They didn't charge us for it. Thanks."}
{"text":"OK. I was going to give it a 5, but lamented that decision for a few reasons, namely, Katsura is a 5 and although its close its not katsura, lacks a it of true japanese ambience and well it doesnt really have much of a vibe. NOW, the service and food are unbeatable. Ive only had sashimi (ive gone caveman so really can only meats and fish) but let me tell ya, that salmon,magura,hamachi,toro  are as good as it gets in this city. also the spicy squid salad is crazy good. I guess the chef realized i knew my shit on my first visit (last week after not being able to get a table at Japango). and hooked it up big time with some seared toro and salmon, which were also to die for (note to self, order less, eat the free stuff). That said, quite disappointed i missed out on this place the previous 4 months that ive lived down the street, poisoning myself with SOB!
GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Did not expect such great sushi from this place! The outside looked like it needed repairs... Or needs sprucing up a bit. But when you walk in its a really nice cozy place. The staff are really friendly. The food is delicious and fish is fresh. BUT the one thing that really stood out to me was the presentation! It was not just food plopped on to a plate. Now other sushi places serve really nice plating as well but Akai just seemed a step above them. I dont think the pictures do the presentation justice.

Yes I would come back. When I finally got over how pretty the plating was, I saw how generous they were with the fish servings. Yum! Worth the money for sure!"}
{"text":"By last year Akai may have become the Toronto resto I most frequented. So I was very nervous when changed hands a few months ago and the music switched from light FM to house and trance. I predicted doom. For years it had been my secret. How I pitied the crowds lining up on Bloor when there was an authentic, superfresh, skilled sushi house tucked in a cpl blocks away. Where would I go? But the sushi actually got BETTER!. It had always been fresh now it came with tasty little flourishes.. beads of garlic oil, lemon and wasabi and the best simple crusted tofu anywhere but nothing obnoxious or larded with mayonnaise. This place just works. Period."}
{"text":"Looking for a sushi place in our neighbourhood we decided to try Akai Sushi even though everything was priced higher than we expected. The owners have obviously spent a great deal of time and attention to the interiors and the decor. But such attention and inflated prices raises expectations for dining. Sadly, the food does not live up to these expectations. Everything was served in a manner that showed thought for the design, but the food itself had little flavour. The sushi served follows in the Toronto tradition of Korean-styled sushi (usually because of Korean dishes on the menu, or over-mayo'd sushi) rather than more Japanese-styled offerings (a dead give away is the appearance of oshitashi or nasu dengaku). It was over-priced for what was served."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and the price isn't too bad (was a dollar or two cheaper than everywhere else around the area). Got the spicy seafood udon and it was pretty darn good. Only downside was that the service was a little poor in terms of them trying to rush us out of the door. We took a little while to order and they continued to rush us to order. I understand you're trying to get people moving along and you want to ensure you make the time for reservations later, but it's not great to rush your customers through their meal. Also one of the servers spilt soup all over my friend's phone and didn't really notice it. 

Food: 4/5
Price: 4/5
service: 3/5

overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"The is a great spot to grab a quick lunchtime o go or even sit down! 
Their lunch bento boxes are pretty reasonable for the price the quality of the fish. 
Great service and atmosphere! 
Would highly recommend it if you carving sushi and are in the area!"}
{"text":"Nice salmon&tuna sushi for lunch but the portion wasn't very large! Includes salad and miso though the salad is very basic and average. The fish was good quality but rice could have been better and larger rice balls for nigiri. I like ND sushi more in the area but could return if this is the only place open. There was a bad smell indoors so I had takeaway!"}
