{"text":"Good bar, im new to the City, my Mom told me about here, very welcome feeling, close to home, they even had Magic Hat! My only negative about it was, the jukebox over plays the game i came to watch, and the TVs are set high so that if you are at the bar you have to lean back... Hard to eat your very delicious wings and watch football. I will be returning though. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Wings are AMAZING!!! Garlic parm one of my fav!! The pitchers are what keep me coming back! Friendly service and good prices! Def a best kept secret on the northside!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for fantastic wings. Drinks are reasonable (always cheap beer specials) and staff is pleasant and welcoming. A hidden north side treasure."}
{"text":"I visited Krista's because I'll visit any place in Pittsburgh that I hear has good wings. I got some wings but frankly they weren't impressive. They tasted like microwaved costco wings in the BIG bag, Soggy breading, generic hot sauce on them. The place is small and on the dumpy side (but not terrible, despite being in a not so great part of Pittsburgh), however it was quite smoky inside. A couple of yinzers playing pool but not bothering anyone.. that's about all there is to say about the Krista's experience."}
{"text":"A note before I go on: I LOVE dive bars. I love the greasy spoon, salt of the earth, gritty bars that are always interesting and never without their fair share of obvious characters. That being said, I LOVE krista's! It's a no frills, beer and pub food kinda place. If you want hot wings and a beer, this place has Em. If you want white wine and some charcuterie, just keep walking fancy-pants. Wing nights are he best times, and they do $1 shots of anything when a Pittsburgh team scores (which will always be playing if it's on). If you don't mind a smoking bar and an open jukebox, but can enjoy the culture of the north side of Pittsburgh, this may be your place."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write this review, because this place is a hidden gem and I want it all for myself! Lol my boyfriend and I stopped in here one night. I worked all day, then after work I was moving things from my apartment to my new house. By that time I was exhausted and starving so I checked Yelp to see what was near my house and this place popped up. We happened to go there on Wing Night. We ordered a dozen seasoned wings, 6 mild wings, a basket of fries  and two soft drinks for $11. The wings were seriously amazing. Perfectly fried- the skin was crispy and the meat was nice and tender. 

My only issue with this place is that they don't give free refills on soft drinks. Other than that, this place is a great little friendly neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"I felt the need to review this place only because there are two reviews at the moment and the star rating is not at all indicative of my experience.  Otherwise, I would have refrained altogether - because when you find a quality local bar you don't talk about it...like Fight Club.

Bottom-line, I had a good time on a Saturday night.  The drinks were the right price, there are pool tables, and the wings are the shit (don't listen to that other reviewer).      

The wings:  perfectly fried if you enjoy that fall-off-the-bone, crispy type of wing.  The sauces are relatively uninspired classic staples, which is perfect for a local bar, right?  If you're craving that hipster molasses, peanut butter and fried kale style, don't come here.  Did I mention they're cheap?  They're 35 cents cheap, depending on the night.

Pool tables:  go ahead and search for pool tables on the north side of the city.  You come up empty handed.  They have 2 here and @50 cents/game.

Drinks:  They DO NOT have draft beer.  Before you jump to conclusions and assume that's a bad thing, think about this:  this place is small and draft systems are dirty.  Plus, most local bars only have American style light lagers on draft anyway.  The bottled beer they keep is fresh.  And, I was pleasantly surprised to have been offered 4 different seasonal beers (and not the gimmicky ones).

Take it or leave it.  Maybe not show up at all because the neighborhood is unsavory.  I don't care.  I'll be there enjoying the fresh, cheap beers and crispy wings that you're missing out on."}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and was so excited to discover this bar. Awesome bar food, really reasonable drink prices, and cool eclectic mix of people. Everyone was really friendly and the service was great. And you can play pool for really cheap! Greatest dive bar I've found yet in Pittsburgh! It is smoking, but the smell didn't really bother me (and I'm usually really sensitive to cigarette smoke). Spread the word about this great bar so they continue to get business!"}
{"text":"Good service, kitchen open till 1 a.m. great prices, I think they have wing night like four nights a week and music is not too loud, good crowd, excellent place to throw a few back."}
{"text":"Wings. Fries. Big drinks. Nice prices. Friendly service. Not many additional words are needed, the drink menu is extensive the food menu is not but I would say there is no reason for it, I tried the Parmesan wings, the Cajun garlic and the barbecue, all were mighty tasty. Not to mention you can get 32oz cocktails for $7 or less.... you literally can't beat it! May need to budget for that uber ride home so if you'd like to add that in the price feel free, but safe to say you'll get bang for your buck here!"}
{"text":"How can I update a review from 5 stars to 5 stars!?? When will Yelp give the option for more?

I freaking love this place.  I get so excited when we make the trip out here.  We normally get 2 dozen wings between the two of us and 4-5 beers total and it costs us around $30...and that's not even when they are running wing specials. What a great deal!

Stopped in again for the 4th time this past Friday.   The bartender remembered us from the last time and took great care of us - took our orders, brought us food and drinks, etc.  It wasn't very busy on a Friday night (although it was Black Friday) which was fine with me!  We ordered the hot honey teriyaki (of course!), hot garlic parm (actually my new favorite) and Cajun garlic(?) wings. I know I have already said this but  their wings are so damn good.  Cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside and so much meat on each one.  Bobby and I just shake our heads in disbelief when we try them again and again.  Our favorite place for wings in Pittsburgh.  An interesting and fun place to go for a relaxed Friday night for dinner and drinks.

I tell everyone I can to try it out even though I don't want to because I hate to share!!!  Love it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bar! It's always nice to find a great dive bar with delicious wings, great staff, and wonderful prices! Don't go though, because I want it to myself :)."}
{"text":"My new favorite bar. I've been looking for a neighborhood bar since I moved to Brighton Heights, and I definitely found it in Krista's. Friendly, cozy atmosphere, with a pool table and trivia machine. Wings were amazing, drinks were awesome and cheap. Bartender was really welcoming, music was at a good level. Loved it, I'll be back."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot!  Wing specials!  $5 pitchers

Bartenders are attentive and friendly.  Kitchen stays open til 1am.

There are a variety of flavors of wings and they are all very good.  My \"go to\" flavors are BBQ gold and mild garlic parm!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is a great neighborhood bar with good food and good drink specials! The wings are to die for. I had mild garlic parm and they were awesome. I am drinking a rum runner that will have you a bit tipsy whenever you leave the bar stool. And it is an affordable price! They have drink and wing specials most nights. The atmosphere is very homey. Everyone is friendly and the bartenders are great! It's a small place but it's so worth it! I will be back! If I could give it 6 stars I would. This is a hidden gem that I want to keep to myself!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar to go to. I've never had the food but I heard it's fabulous. The drink specials are the best I've seen. $5 pitchers of Long Island all date everyday. Can't beat that. Plus they're within walking distance of my house"}
