{"text":"Came for a quick dinner as I have been curious about the place. Nicely sized plates at a decent price. They grill meat in front of you and their grill is quite large. Sides included in the standard combo plates are pretty decent too; especially loved their potatoes. The service was rather slow, I think the person attending that day was new do that might be why... Nothing that will blow your mind overall but if you are craving some chicken and are close by this is a good place to drop in."}
{"text":"I recently ordered a chicken salad from here, thinking that it would be chicken with piri piri sauce. Although the ingredients were fresh, there was just no favour. It was just pieces of chicken on a wackload of lettuce with a few tomatoes. It was all wrong.

There was also to plastic fork included it my order so that was sort of off putting.

This is what I think the chicken salad should be:

Half lettuce, plenty of tomatoes, thinly sliced cucumber, black olives, oignons and julienne carrots with chicken that actually tastes like it came from a place called piri piri."}
{"text":"After touring st Joseph oratory, this was one of the few restaurants that were open late within a row of restaurants on the main street near the metro. Because of the overall 3 1/2 rating, I hesitated eating here, but there was nothing else we could agree on eating, and it was getting really late, but I'm glad I ate here:

Full rack ribs - 5 stars - for only around $20, the ribs were tender and fell off the bone. It is made to order on a fire grill, and came with deliciously seasoned rice and salad.

Half a chicken - 4 stars - for $9, hubby said we should have gotten the whole chicken for only $6 more because he loved the roasted  flavor mixed with their piri piri sauce, which i can't describe, but a half chicken with the other dishes we ordered were enough.

Ultime poutine - 4 stars - for $12, we got a large dish of fries, potato, meat cheese curds mixed in a wine flavored sauce that tasted unique.

Flan - 3 1/2 star - for $3, the flan tasted sweet and was enough for 2 since we had a filling dinner.

Service - 3 1/2 stars - the menu board was in french so we had a hard time ordering, but the man at the counter spoke English. He could have at least told us there was an English take out menu so we could see the different items easier. The female cashier was courteous."}
{"text":"Good chicken.. Easy walk in during your breaktime.. Not bad for $12 because it is a lot of servings. Good ambiance. Very clean because its new place"}
{"text":"We recently discovered this place through ubereats , so we've only ever had it via delivery so I can't rate the actual location  itself but I can rate the food. Even by delivery we're blown away by how delicious the food is every time and using such simple dishes/ingredients. We've tried a variety of their sandwiches (marinated chicken , chourico, and bifana-pork) and their side dishes (potatoes and rice). I can't even pick a favourite sandwich because they're all delicious the meat inside is always juicy and packs such big flavour and the bread is always sooo sooo fresh ! you can also choose to have the spicy sauce on the side. The rice and potatoes are also very tasty and well prepared with great seasoning. They take such simple dishes and simple ingredients and make them shine and at really great prices.ive had homemade Portuguese dishes which I loved and this place really has that home cooked prepared with love flavour . I'm craving it right now as I'm writing this :) definitely ordering from here again and again !"}
{"text":"3.5**

We ordered the combo meal for 2-3 people for takeout. 
It includes a whole chicken, a large salad and either a large rice or a large fry (they let us do half and half). Total: 23,50+tax

Highlights:
Service -The staff there were really nice
PiriPiri sauce - Nice and spicy, you can ask for extra to dip the fries in.
Salad - He let us change the dressing to caesar, which was yummy. Big salad and fresh ingredients
Fries - Seasoned really well, crispy and hot
Value

Low points:
Chicken - I found the chicken a bit dry. I'm not sure how fresh it was
Rice - It was hard, like it had been sitting there all day

Overall, I would try this place again. I think I would go during peak hours to make sure to get the freshest food."}
{"text":"Came by late evening around 8:30 pm on a Friday. There was a small lineup to order. Service was slow. Seemed like they were having some difficulty keeping up because of the orders coming in through Uber Eats.

The food itself was very good. I ordered a whole chicken to go. Prices there are very reasonable. From what I can see, they are very generous with their portion size. Everybody's plates seemed to be overflowing. The place is very clean and new. There is seating inside and outside.

You definitely can't go wrong with this place. Give them a try. You won't regret it. Don't be surprised if there is a lineup because they are so good."}
