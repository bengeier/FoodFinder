{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. What we thought was going to be a lovely evening, turned into an infuriating one. I made reservations for myself, my husband, and son. We were seated at a table with a bench, which was perfect for my son. As we settled down and perused the menu, we waited for our server to take our drink orders. We waited, and waited, and waited. All this while, the servers were hanging out by the bar, sipping their drinks, not even glancing at the tables. We waited. I was looking at them, giving some sort of signal that we were ready to order. We waited some more. Finally, the maitre d' walked by our table, and we had to flag him down to ask him if there was a problem as no one has even approached us to offer water or take our drink order. Then we promptly got up and left. We sat at our table, without anybody approaching us, for 15 minutes. They were not busy. They just have bad service and an inept waitstaff. It's not that difficult to give good customer service."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out based off reviews on Yelp. The decor and general atmosphere of the restaurant was promising; however, our waitress was unfriendly (pretty much didn't smile our entire meal) and mis-entered our pizzetta order. Portions are tiny and overpriced.  Appetizers: We ordered two appetizers that came fairly fast: Squash and Pancetta Gnocchi - special for the day (it was served lukewarm and lacked seasoning, the gnocchi was overcooked and mushy, the pancetta saved the dish a bit by adding good texture and flavour, also the portions were really small - overall a 2.5/5 dish), and the Lobster and Fennel Cannelloni (the pasta itself was mushy, the stuffing was okay you can taste the lobster, the white sauce was  in was too runny, it was all just a mushy mess - 3/5).   Pizzettes: We waited a good 25 mins in between our appetizers and pizzettes and an additional 15 mins because our unfriendly waitress put in our order wrong. Prosciutto and Arugula Pizzette (nothing special, the prosciutto was sliced too thick which made it hard to bite and chew, the portions are ridiculously small for the price, pizza hut would have been cheaper and yummier 2.5/5). Our second pizzette was the Smoked Caciocavallo and Oyster Mushroom Pizzette (better than the other pizzette, but I was expecting more flavour from the smoked cheese and mushrooms 3/5)  Overall: Food: small portions, and lacked quality Decor: pretty good atmosphere and decor Service: shitty"}
{"text":"This was the second visit to Dolcetto. The first was solo and I only ordered a few appetizers and drinks. This second visit I brought the family. We live a couple of blocks up the street and figured we'd have dinner.  The waitresses was lovely and we really enjoyed her service. Little can be said of the rest of the establishment. The food had ridiculously small portions and I could finish my pizza in a few bits. You'll want to hit BEVO nearby if you really want some pizza in this area. The second was the price, not worth the portion size.  Finally, they charged us $5 for a glass of milk for the little one. We travel the world and have never been charged this much.  NO chance will be coming back."}
{"text":"Dolcetto is now my go-to place for dinner in the MTL.   My brother and I love this place.  The food is awesome and the staff is all over it.   We've even dropped in looking like a couple of bums (picture Travolta and Jackson at the end of pulp fiction in cheesy beach shorts),  and still been treated like royalty here.   Dolcetto earns my very highest recommendation."}
{"text":"The two star rating is strictly for the ambiance and location.  A potential jewel that is sadly lacking in its most important requirement- good food.  We were a group of 6 that tried various appetizers and pizzettes.  Firstly, the pizzettes are below average.  The most important aspect of any pizza-type creation is the crust.  If the crust is blah then you're already behind the 8 ball.  In this case, the crust is far too dry and hard which means it's cooked at a temperature that is too low and for too long.  The prosciutto and arugula version was horrific.  Both guys left it.  The cheese was not melted and the prosciutto was sliced so thickly that it was near impossible to eat- cold and chewy.  Prosciutto should be very very finely sliced so that it melts in the mouth. The ravioli seems to have been cooked hours before and then reheated in a pan with hard, dry edges and minimal flavour.  The Antipasto Misto plate is quite sparse for $30, as well as lacking variety- a tiny ball of burrata and some shaved pecorino with some prosciutto cotto and olives.  The gnocchi and lamb meatballs were only OK.  Finally, the offerings are grossly overpriced.  These are tappas style portions which would be more appropriate at half to two thirds the pricing.  This applies to the pizzettes as well.    Cool place but they have a lot of work to do with their menu before I could recommend it to anyone, let alone visit again."}
{"text":"great tapas, good wine, ambiance is very warming...  recommend; lobster canelloni, gnocchis...  i dont like pasta and those were killer tapas"}
{"text":"My first time having \"Italian tapas\" but my gosh was it good! We had the prosciutto plate to start, followed by the arugula, tomatoes, & parmigiano reggiano and finally the margherita with burrata pizzette while enjoying some refreshing frescas to drink. Everything was delicious; I don't think I've ever had proscuitto that good anywhere ever! What was really cool was that we didn't reserve in advance and the only spots they had open were at the bar so we sat right in front of the chefs as they made the dishes, really cool! It's a bit on the pricier side so best to go as a group (reserve in advance!) and share the orders. Really enjoyed my experience at Dolcetto & Co and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ça faisait longtemps que je voulais retourner au Dolcetto pour les souvenirs que j'en gardais : excellents plats tapas, décor charmants, bonne carte de vins. J'avais donné un solide 5 étoiles après ma première visite. La variété de tapas avec des must (pâtes fraîches au homard) valait amplement le prix. Par contre, j'y suis retournée le week-end dernier et j'ai été extrêmement déçue. Non seulement le menu se limite maintenant à des pizza seulement mais les 3 que nous avons prises étaient fades et sans goût. Il y a définitivement de bien meilleures options dans le vieux, pour lesquelles j'opterai à l'avenir..!"}
{"text":"Decor sympatique, plats de qualité mais les portions sont vraiment trop petites. Service passable."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have experienced. Ordered a wine flight at the bar with friends when waiting for a table. After being seated waiter waiter didn't see us for 15 minutes, when I asked about the wine, he checked and was told they were out of one of them. For food, split 5 dishes between 4. Got the charcuterie board after about 30 minutes, didn't receive the others for another hour and fifteen and the hot food was cold. Good food, but inept service made for a terrible overall experience. The poor service appeared to be restaurant wide as the two groups on each side of us experienced the same and the waitstaff didn't appear overly concerned or apologetic. Why go here when when you can go to other vastly superior places in the area such as Barroca further down the street? I'd even prefer Les 3 Brasseurs."}
{"text":"Es la segunda vez que cenamos en Dolcetto, y lo hemos hecho tan bien como la primera. La comida es buena y el servicio agradable."}
{"text":"I must have visited a different restaurant than the one rated by most others. The place had few customers and the food was mediocre at best.  Tried the eggplant and braised beef (advertised as the chefs special) and stopped to cut my losses. Over priced. Friendly service though and nice setting. Definitely would not return."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed with this place. Probably a hit with tourists but you can do MUCH better than Dolcetto. I have been twice now and had bad experiences both times. The first time, a waiter dropped olive oil all over my girlfriend's shirt, and was hardly apologetic about it. The most recent time, we had a reservation for 14 people. We showed up on time for the reservation and ended up waiting well over an hour for our table to be ready. There is no big entrance so imagine 14 people waiting on the street for a dinner reservation...When we were finally seated, and after some complaints, we were offered a round of drinks on the house. This \"round of drinks\" ended up being two of their cheapest bottles of bubbly, which amounted to one champagne glass each. A slightly nice gesture but hardly worth the wait and frustration. To top off this disappointing experience, our group was harassed by a majorly obnoxious bachelorette party that was upset that none of the guys wanted to dance with the bride-to-be (we were all pretty annoyed by the wait at that point, and didn't feel like dancing in the middle of a restaurant). This included cigarette smoke being blown purposely towards our table (multiple times throughout the night...we were sitting by the large open windows). After a few of us complained to the staff about this, they failed to do anything about it. All of this might have been worth it if the food was on point. Unfortunately it's overpriced considering the portion sizes, and the general consensus from our group was that the quality was average at best. Overall, the service was terrible and pretty much every staff member I encountered rubbed me the wrong way. The one positive thing I can say about this place, in my experience, is that the decor is nice. There are plenty of better options in the area, avoid this spot!!"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Very interesting decor. Informative and helpful waitress but very slow service. It took almost an hour to prepare the pizza."}
{"text":"The décor invites you in to this warm, eclectic place and then there is the tapas style pizzas and other awesome entrees.  We recommend sitting right at the bar and watching/talking to the chefs.  Artistic work - plus one insisted we try figs wrapped in prosciutto as a gift.  A very special place to have dinner."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant with delicious food and a friendly atmosphere.  The servers were great and we even got a review from departing guests that the food was so good that they were there three nights in a row :-)  The restaurant is small and a little crowded.  It has a number of small tables that can be pushed together or split apart, couple of larger tables for larger groups, and seating at the kitchen bar, where you can watch the chef at work.  We ordered octopus salad, lamb meatballs, four cheeses pizza, eggplant pizza, foie gras pizza, and tiramisu.  The octopus salad was tasty ... just enough lime and the octopus was not overcooked.  The pizza were small (about 7\" by 3\") but delicious.  For me, the foie gras pizza with figs was the best.  The best part of our meal was the very creamy and delicious tiramisu.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We loved this hip, \"industrial-nautical\" Italian small-plates joint! Portions were the perfect size for us to share some excellent cheese, charcuterie, a delicious pizza, and some lovely gnocchi in cream sauce.  The cocktails were also quite good. We worked our way through the drink menu and our standouts were the Vespa (vodka, strawberry, cucumber, lemonade) and I think it was called the Limoncella (spiced rum, lemonade, honey).  Finally, we topped it off with a smashing cheesecake for dessert. And if you get the chance, try the \"Latte Macchiato\" -- it's not a coffee, it's a creamy Italian chilled digestif that was a perfect finish to the meal. We wish we'd found this Old Montreal gem a little earlier on our trip!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, very clean, and nice atmosphere.  Portions are small, but the menu's very creative. We particularly enjoyed the foie gras pizza and their house wine.   I would recommend this place to anyone who likes to try clean and unique food."}
{"text":"Amazing and creative foods + lovely ambiance  Please note the meals are smaller than you expect :D"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Found this place when walking through Old Town and decided to stop in. The food is fantastic and fresh, and the mini pizzas are hand made right in front of you. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place serving tapas/appetizer portion foods. Great selections of wine, cheeses and dried meats. Super friendly staff, and the food flavors are just outrageously good. Their homemade gnocchi and the Bianca pizzette with mushrooms, tartufo and goat cheese are delights, and by far my favorites. Not many places can deliver a good homemade gnocchi, but Dolcetto knocks it out of the park!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW. We loved Dolcetto. They accomodated us when we were 20 minutes late for our reservation and were so kind about our untimeliness! We sat down a little before 9p for dinner and until we left the place was extremely crowded and people kept coming in--it's just that good. Waitress was lovely, attentive, and helpful. Highly recommend making a reservation at the bar. It's amazing watching the kitchen staff work and you get to see all the plates they serve. We got one plate from each category and were full. There was not one option on the menu I did not want to try. It was generally expensive, but well worth the experience."}
{"text":"Great place, great service. Food tastes delicious. Reservations are highly recommended though it is worth the wait if you didn't make any."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the fig and foie gras pizza! Great atmosphere, great location, great food. Portions are quite small; more like tapas. Price is a little bit on the higher side but great for a date night."}
{"text":"Delicious and cool looking spot. We ordered duck confit and sweet potato cannelloni, shrimp, lamb shank, eggplant parm, and a bianco pizza. I would say the pizza was the least memorable so I'm glad we focused on the apps. Everything else was delicious and very well balanced in terms of flavour and presentation. Our server was super nice and we would definitely come back here for dinner. A must-try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. This place is pricey, but it's worth it. Every single bite I had was perfect.  The plates weren't horribly small & they give you bread (which is to die for, by the way). Between the two of us we had the lobster & fennel cannelloni, gnocchi, eggplant/onion/ricotta pizza & tiramisu for dessert & we were definitely full when we left.  The tables themselves were pretty small. We came toward the end of the night, so luckily no one sat next to us, but if they had been it would have been pretty tight.  I do wish we would have sat at the cooks' station to watch them cook."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. We dropped by on a Friday evening and they were full but invited us to come back in 30 minutes. When we did we were greeted warmly and promptly seated. The blonde woman who served as both a hostess and a server was so friendly and helpful, suggesting great dishes and even bringing over another staff member to give us advice on local jazz clubs.  The food was terrific, as well as the cocktails. The atmosphere is lively and festive. This seems like a place that would be overwhelmed with tourists just based on location, but really seemed like it attracted a fair amount of locals. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was our first night in Montreal so we were just walking down the street in Old Port. I recommend to anyone traveling there for the first time to stay in this area. There is a long stretch of restaurants and we came across this one. I don't like to rely on Yelp to influence where I eat all of the time so we took a chance. Though all of the places put menus outside so you know what you're getting yourself into. The food was right on. We split the mushroom pizza and ravioli along with the garlic bread. I had two beers and she had a cocktail. Service was great as well. I think we spent around $60 Canadian with tip. Pretty standard in Montreal, there is no cheap way to eat. I do recommend an Airbnb so you can make breakfast before you head out for the day if you're a tourist."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!!!  Overpriced and nothing great.  It is the first time I leave a restaurant hungry.  I thought I was ordering a regular small pizza like I usually order at an Italian restaurant but NO, it is more like a large slice of pizza.  The restaurant is super cute but never again for me.  I blew $70 for two and barely ate anything.  Stay away."}
{"text":"I went here when they first opened and I thought it was a great hip place. The Italian, tapas style food was amazing, especially the mini pizzas.   Unfortunately, when I decided to return to the restaurant recently with my parents and sister, I encountered some rude waitstaff and will never return again.  We had made a reservation for Friday at 6:30pm. When we arrived they gave us the smallest table for my family and I. This would've been fine if the place was already crowded or if we're only there for drinks. The female waitstaff informed us that all the other tables were reserved before us, however when I checked the seating arrangement chart they didn't have any reservations for those tables until 8!   I have no clue how they expect a family to eat at such a small table. They seemed indifferent to my concerns. No apology, nothing. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to be squeezed in here between reservations for a quick bite and a drink before our evening plans. The staff was excellent. We loved our food and the wine choices paired very well. We would definitely come back here. The eggplant parm and the various pizzas that we tried were so good. Definitely make reservations if you plan on going, so as not to be disappointed. We were in and out in about an hour because we had time constraints but we could have easily spent the evening here eating delicious food and drinking very good wine."}
{"text":"Peut être que certains ne trouveront pas que le resto mérite 5 étoiles, mais moi je trouve que pour l'originalité de la place, du décor chaleureux et charmant, l'adaptation du menu italien avec des touches pour nous surprendre et l'ambiance toujours agréable justifient le 5 étoiles. Optez pour le bar pour voir les cuisiniers travailler et pouvoir leur poser des questions, ma sauce tomate maison est nettement meilleure depuis que j'ai parlé au chef et je peux reproduire quelques items de leur menu, sans m'empêcher de retourner-là! Mes coups de cur: piezzeta au fois gras, joue de veau et le homard fenouil. Fou! Les drink sont aussi excellents, une mention spéciale au gin et jus de concombre. Yummy! Si vous êtes un groupe demandez la grande table carrée qui loge 12-16 de mémoire, le set up est très convivial."}
{"text":"Je suis allée au Dolcetto & Co. sur un coup de tête avec mon chum Alex et notre amie Leila, dans le cadre du Mac n' cheese week.   Nous y sommes arrivés à 17h00 un vendredi soir dans un restaurant vide; qui l'est resté pour la majorité de notre temps (on est resté 2h et oui ok, il pleuvait cette journée là).   L'homme qui nous a servi toute la soirée était très attentif et serviable, même un peu trop parfois. Mai bon, mieux vaut trop d'attention que pas assez! Nous avons décidé de commencer la soirée avec un trio de cocktails, soit: un Cosmopolitan aux fraises (pour moi), un Bellini à la purée de pêches (pour Leila) et un amaretto sour (pour Alex). Les trois étaient délicieux, forts et très biens faits. Pour manger, nous avons opter pour la partage de trois petits plats: le mac n' cheese, la pizzette du jour et l'aubergine à la parmigiana.  Le mac n' cheese était succulent, préparé avec une délicieuse sauce au mozzarella, cacciocavallo fumé et boschetto al tartufo (fromage à la truffe), avec trois tuiles de pancetta frit. Nous avons tous vraiment aimé, même Alex qui n'est pas un grand fan de mac n' cheese.   Cette journée là, la pizzette du jour était à la sauce tomate, avec crevettes, mozzarella di buffala, aneth fraîche et tranches de radis frais. C'était vraiment bon; on pouvait goûter la fraîcheur des ingrédients, mais petit (nous avons compris pourquoi ça s'appelle une pizzette et non pas une pizza).   Pour notre troisième assiette, nous avons pris l'aubergine à la parmigiana qui était délicieuse, une des meilleures que j'ai mangé! Les aubergines étaient tranchées finement et la sauce était parfaitement assaisonnée. Ce fût trois choix excellents de plats, que je retournerais manger n'importe quand!   Le seul hic pour nous, c'était la grosseur des portions (mais les prix étaient abordables). Nous aurions aimer en avoir plus!   Pour ma critique complète et plus de photos, allez voir mon blogue: Turquoise Blog (lien dans ma bio!)"}
{"text":"Les tapas que j'ai choisi étaient juste fantastiques. Je m'en lèche encore les babines. La petite pizza de foie gras et la pizza au chevre. Et pour les filles c'est un petit verre de vin gratuit le mercredi que demander de plus. J'y retourne quand vous voulez."}
{"text":"I never write these and am extremely sympathetic to staff in the service industry.  That said, they forgot 5 of 11 dishes ordered (3 margharita pizza and 2 caprese salads). 30 mins after the rest of the party finished, a server told us to \"be more patient.\" 30 more minutes passed before a server asked us if we received everything. Other dishes came out slowly, one at a time. One of the apps wasn't available after all. It took two hours for 7 6\" pizzas (4 of them are margharita) and 4 apps and nobody came back to offer drinks or bread or anything for the wait. Food/ambience was okay but service was very frustrating, bordering on insulting."}
{"text":"What a fun  & creative place!  It is Italian food served tapas style. Fortunately we followed other Yelpers lead & tried the Lobster with Fennel Cannoli-wow!   The polenta stuffed w taleggio and fig compote was very nice though could have used more fig to balance.   Calzone w sausage rapini peppers and olives was so flavorful & filling.  Tied for the best with the lobster was Braised lamb shank w grapes and thyme-out of this world tender & delicious.  The pizzettes are very nice too. Even the table bread was good!  Try Chinotto, Italian coke, it went great with the pizzette!"}
{"text":"Left the hotel and randomly sought out food. The old town of Montreal has the brick streets. The lively sound and quaint interior drew me here. Learning about the area from a lovely millineal girl at the bar while watching the cooking. So far very impressed. Try the lobster large ravioli."}
{"text":"Good service but the portions are a bit misleading. Looking at the pizza and the prices one would think it's a portion that you'd get in most restaurants and is a meal sized portion. But it isn't. You definitely need a salad or an app."}
{"text":"Roaming around the Old Port and looking for a spot that offers delicious italian cuisine with no pretension, stuffiness or formality? Well look no more - you're in for a \"sweet\" deal at Dolcetto & Co!  After a long but productive day at the office, and under the pressure to find a-close-by-yet-delivers-great-tasting-yet-not-too-filling-dishes-and-offers-a-great-wine-selection, I remembered a great tip from a friend and hurried the whole executive team down to this vibrant yet unassuming restaurant on St-Paul street.  Upon entering we were greeted by the friendly and attentive hosts who promptly seated us at the center table (perfect for big parties or bachelorette parties I was told) and helped us put together the beginning of what would be a fantastic italian tapas dining experience!  It all started with a basket of mixed bread which included slices of Italian flat bread, buns, and grissinis served along fragrant olive oil & balsamic vinegar pairing. Added were a variety of olives. This was then followed by the Panzanella, a Tuscan salad made with bread and tomatoes topped with Burrata, a fresh italian cheese made out of mozzarella and cream. Then came the homemade porchetta, a savoury, fatty, slightly salty & juicy slow roasted pork loin with crispy edges. Then we had the ultra-creamy gnocchi, little clouds of soft dough dumplings lightly doused in truffle oil. Following was the Lobster & Fennel Cannelloni, a true explosion of flavours and party in your mouth.And then there were the Pizzettes: small handmade pizzas with different toppings! We had the spinach roasted garlic, parmigiano & ricotta.Followed by the rich yet light foie gras, fig & fleur de sel focaccia. Finally we ended with the margarita with burrata. To seal the evening, most of us opted for italian coffee prepared in different ways but my friend and I went the extra mile to sink our teeth into a delicious the molten chocolate cake - which was surprisingly not too sweet!  Overall, the service was excellent, the timing of the dishes was impeccable, the chianti wine married all the flavours, and our ability to share everything made us feel just like at home! If you can, stop by and ask for Alessandro and Samir - they will treat you ultra-well, just like family."}
{"text":"C'est de loin ma pire expérience dans un restaurant de cette année 2017. Nous sommes venus dans le cadre de Montréal à table avec un ami et clairement nous ne remettrons jamais les pieds dans ce restaurant.  Avant tout, je tiens à préciser que les serveurs sont adorables, ils font de leur mieux et je ne remets pas ça en question. Cependant, il y a clairement un problème dans le service.  La portion des plats est absolument inadmissible. L'entrée, trois lamelles de courgette et trois lamelles d'aubergine. Le plat, une part de lasagne (sans goût) avec des \" épinards frais \" (j'ai vu une pousse traîner dedans, pas plus). Le dessert, un verre a shot de tiramisu (très bonne mais beaucoup trop petite).  C'est inacceptable de ressortir d'un restaurant en ayant encore faim (au point de manger un autre repas).  Ensuite, 25$ pour 3 verre de vin (dont 1 de mauvaise qualité), ça fait très cher. Les plats arrivaient tous en même temps dans la salle, pareil pour les desserts. Ce qui nous a amené à attendre 30 mn pour notre plat et pareil pour notre dessert.  Honnêtement, c'est une honte. Le but de Montréal à table est de se faire connaître positivement, mais cette expérience était déplorable.  Il est clairement temps que le restaurant s'occupe de la taille des plats et du service dans le restaurant. 2 cuisiniers quand la salle est pleine, ce n'est pas assez."}
{"text":"Eek! Methinks not. I came because of the reviews on yelp. I noticed a few other people here complain about the service. I had a similar situation. Waiter didn't smile and was a little rude. They also messed up my order. Food was expensive and okay at best. Ordered a gnocchi dish and it came to the table cold. Portions were unnecessarily small. It wasn't rich, flavour didn't really pack a punch...  The environment was nice but all around a very sub-par dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is the biggest disappointment I've ever had. The service was stupid slow and the food was definitely not worth the amount of hours we had to wait for it. The only good thing they have going is the water girl who kept the glasses filled. Give that woman a raise.   I arrive with a group of people for a birthday to have the \"group menu\" Friday night at 8:45pm. We left at 12:30 completely dissatisfied. The menu included: a small meat and cheese platter (probably the best thing we had), dry shrimp with tasteless beets, and three small sad pizzas to share with 4 people. One bread with tomato and cheese and two bread with tomato, cheese, and jalapeño.  So here we are waiting for dessert (Nutella pizza). We see them clean up the restaurant and basically get ready to close. After about one hour of this, the waitress lets us know they forgot to make dessert and asked if it's ok to get a discount instead. Sure... discount. Happy birthday.  This sad menu, plus two drinks, came to up $70. A bill they messed up as well.   I still can't understand why it took so long. They had plenty of staff and we were the only table there along with a table of two. What happened?  I told myself last night I would re-install yelp on my phone specifically to leave this review. This was honestly the worst dining experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"We often have a meal here when we visit from Vermont. A few years ago I would've given this flat out five stars, but tonight the menu was a little uninspiring. The staff however was as gracious and friendly as ever and the atmosphere is always pleasant. Could be an off night (mid-week and mid-winter) and I'm sure we'll try again!"}
{"text":"The Spot: Italian restaurants are notorious for oversized portions of carbs and mediocre sauces - the old quantity over quality approach. Not so at Dolcetto and co. This bright and friendly wine bar in the Old Port brings a refreshingly light take on traditional Italian fare with a tapas style tempo. At Dolcetto, the focus is on delicious food and drink with a casual upbeat atmosphere. It is a great destination for an afterwork glass of wine with a co-worker or a casual date, but it can also accommodate larger groups of a dozen or so at the communal family style table.  What's Really Good:  With all the crazy Japanese/French fusion taco emulsion foodwizardry we've been seeing around, family-style Italian comfort food is not the most exotic cuisine we have come across recently. That certainly does not mean we are past the point of simple pleasures. At Dolcetto they specialize in taking your expectations and then surpassing them with quality ingredients and flawless execution. For example, the lobster cannelloni and the truffle cream gnocchi manage a delicate balancing act between incredibly rich ingredients and a rather light final product. And you can't go wrong with the pizzas. Whether you take the traditional route with the classic margherita or go for something less typical like the salmon tartar pizza, we promise your taste buds will be satisfied. If you're just looking for a succulent snack to go with a nice glass of wine the cheeses and charcuterie are the way to go. The porchetta is prepared in-house and hits delicious savoury notes of rosemary and orange zest, whereas the boschetto al tartufo served with a golden drizzle of truffle infused honey makes for a fantastic dessert cheese.  You'll Want to Know:  The presentation and portion size of the dishes suggest they are begging to be shared, so don't be afraid to order two or three items per person. The menu is constantly evolving but remains true to tried and tested Italian classics, grouped into four categories:  Antipasti - small appetizers, salads and light pasta dishes. Pizzette - mouth watering personal pizzas, and calzones. Salumi - Italian charcuterie, like prosciutto, cacciatore, and bresaola Fromaggi - traditional Italian cheeses like parmigiano reggiano, or burrata.  Got a hot date and need to make great impression without breaking the bank? Dolcetto offers a fantastic Aperitivo Italiano for the 5 a 7. Wine, cheese, charcuterie and fresh baked focaccia for under $15. If you're looking to get acquainted with the full menu, ask the servers about the special dishes and cocktails. The daily specials are not to be overlooked as they take advantage of seasonal ingredients and the creative energy of head chef Marcelo Gonzalez and his enthusiastic team."}
{"text":"Great 1st meal in Montreal. Tapas so we tried several things ranked in order...  Calamars Grilles...fabulous  Salad Caprese...nice take on the dish   Raviolis Maison aux Homard...texture, flavor, etc, just hit all the marks of a good dish.  Carpaccio de Boeuf...solid. 1 of my favorite things to order but it was out-shone on this night.  Tirimisu...made it move (Seinfeld reference).  Still mad that my brother-in-law nixed the lamb chops in maple and pistachio crust. But all-in-all, great start to 4 nights in Old Montreal. Service was a bit slow, but it seemed to fit the vibe. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"WOW the decor alone is enough for me. If your looking for everything nautical and trendy this is the spot for you!  We scored the window seat (where you are basically on display in the open air window) and ther server was more than happy to tell us about everything on the menu and offered some tasty options.  The pizza was our favourite, very unique combinations of food, but they mix well together and produce a pizza you will salivate for days after.  The drinks are also really tasty and trendy, there are options for everyone.  Best Italian tapas Ive been to!"}
{"text":"Relaxing yet sophisticated place for dining with a few friends. Service was excellent, main difference being that the entire team serves you vs one dedicated server. Food was great as well. Order lots of small dishes to share. Like the reviews said, the pizza is awesome. Highly recommended!!  Don't forget the dessert!"}
{"text":"My family and I made a reservation for 9 people, in which they were very accommodating. After that, we started our descend into a complete disaster... we put in our complete order, drinks, salads and pizzettas. Our first round of drinks and salads arrived shortly after. 1 hour later, we were still waiting for the pizzettas... and still very hungry. When they finally arrived to the table, the order was incomplete and missing pizzettas, some pizzettas were missing toppings, and one order was totally missed and had to be redone.   In addition, the Hawaiian pizzettas did not come with prosciutto and when my cousin asked where it was, the manager said, \"I am sorry, I will make it right\". He came back with some cold ham thrown on top of the pizzettas and told me to \"enjoy\". They also took away my cousin's tapenade away without asking him if he was done.  If you want a snack and to pay a ton of money, this is the spot.   If you want to wait 2 hours for some food, this is the spot.  If you order a beer and it you don't mind waiting an hour for it to come out, this is the spot.  In conclusion, the food sucked, the service sucked, and I want 2 hours of my life back.**  ** please note: they did take care of the pizzettas for us. But at this time, it wasn't about the money... it was about the time wasted**  End rant.  One more thing, the menu displayed on the outside had pasta and when we sat down and ordered drinks, my cousin asked where the pasta dishes were and the manager advised there was no pasta on the menu \"tonight\"."}
{"text":"Went there because of the great yelp reviews, however was so turned off by the rude waitstaff and unpleasant atmosphere that I will never be coming back. We made reservations on a Friday for 2, when we got there the hostess did not seem to know where to place us despite 1) having a nearly empty restaurant and 2) having the room plan right in front of her face, we understand that groups were coming, but we had made reservations ahead of time, so there was no surprise for her. We were sat inches away from another couple, in an empty restaurant mind you, and then were rudely told by another staff member to move our table closer so that they could put another table on the other side of us. After about 10-15 minutes, a waitress finally came to take our drink orders, we ordered a spumante and prosecco, yet she had to check about 5 times with us to confirm. We were highly irritated by this, and at this point the waitstaff started moving tables on top of us, and pulling chairs from one side of the room to the other, essentially reorganizing the entire restaurant's set-up all the while talking loudly. Now this is a small and quaint restaurant, yet there were about 5 times the number of waitstaff than there were tables. I don't know how this restaurant is run, but I have never seen such a thing. We finally received our drink after about 30 minutes, and ordered a margherita pizzette, just to try the food given the reviews. We received this about 20 minutes later, and I can say it was good, but absolutely nothing special. We were so irritated and frustrated and unhappy, that we decided to head over to another restaurant in the old port. I think there are far better italian restaurants in Montreal and the old port with better service and organization, which likely culminate in a much better experience overall. Will NOT be going back and do not recommend unless you perhaps go on a quiet weeknight when they can handle 4 customers."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas parce qu'un restaurant se situe dans le vieux Montreal qu'il peut servir n'importe quoi.... J'ai teste ce restaurant dans le cadre de Mtl à table avec mon compagnon et des amis venus de Toronto! L'endroit était vide lorsque nous sommes arrivés vers 18/18h30 mais s'est rapidement rempli!  La salle n'est pas très agréable, on est les uns sur les autres, la porte qui s'ouvre toutes les 30 sec laisse s'engouffrer des bourrasques de vent et la musique est beaucoup beaucoup trop forte!  Le menu de Mtl à table est sensé être une démonstration de ce que les cuisiniers sont capables et donne envie de revenir et bien c'est tout l'inverse!  Mon risotto était une parodie de risotto...je l'aurai plutôt appelé riz au lait salé.....pas assez cuit!  L'entrée et le dessert était quelconque!  Certain d'entre nous avait pris l'accord met et vin et à chaque fois les verres sont arrivés avec un métro de retard et étaient similaires meme si les plats eux ne l'étaient pas..... Je ne retenterai pas l'expérience!"}
{"text":"We have been in Montreal for a week now and this has been an amazing place.  We sat at the bar and watched them prepare every dish.  I could not find anything that I saw that I would not order.  I wish I had another say to call me back!! Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 5/5 The design and vibes of the restaurant were lit! It was so on point! Everything was cozy, it was intimate, and the staff was great! It felt like I was on set of \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\". A great place to unwind and catch up with friends, while being taken away by your surroundings.   Food: 4.5/5. The restaurant's menu is designed for sharing with your friends. Each would order roughly 2 to 3 dishes. By the time the dishes come, and you take that first bite, it was like experiencing a whole new world. I felt this way for each of the dish! Definitely fantastic.   The only thing that was negative, was that when we paid our bill, the staff kind of forced us to get out, which I found to be pretty rude, and added a sour taste at the end of the whole experience. Don't do this again, we were about to leave in like 2 minutes, and y'all just need to be patient. Reason why, y'all didn't get the 5/5 from moi.   TLDR: If you want a place to show you the world, come to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is an Italian tapa place. Ordered 5 dishes and 2 dessert - and that was plenty for 2 people. Had the grilled calamari & asparagus, polenta & oyster mushrooms, gnocchi in kale pesto, shrimp & pancetta, marguerite with burrata pizza, tiramisu and strawberry sorbet. Food and service is great. Very casual laid back atmosphere. Recommended when in Montreal."}
{"text":"All around a good experience.  Small plates and pizzettes - all very tasty.  It was a busy night, and the staff were running, and attentive throughout.  Hats off to the guys in the open kitchen, they were cranking it!"}
{"text":"Definitely going back and recommending to friends and family. Their pizzette are amazing...dough is perfect and their burratta is amazing...I recommend the pizzetta margherita with burratta, you can't go wrong. Cannelloni with lobster and fennel are out of this world, Homemade gnocchi and lamb meatballs were awesome. Everything was so delicious.  The only negative was waiter taking plates away before I had a chance to do what every Italian does to avoid wasting delicious sauce...scarpetta. As I was cleaning up the lamb meatball sauce off the plate with bread (scarpetta), the waiter took the plate away without my consent...how rude. Otherwise this would be a definite 5 on 5."}
{"text":"Dolcetto is a wine bar that specializes in Italian tapas, located in the Old Port. The restaurant is on the small side, but has a great energetic vibe with a casual, warm decor and fab tunes in the background. What can I say? Both the food and service is amazing! The wait staff are very friendly and attentive, and our waitress made some great wine recommendations.  In terms of the food.... DEE-LICIOUS!  My date and I had:  - Marinated vegetables (Red bell pepper, mushrooms and something else I can't remember. Very flavourful without being 'vinegary').  - Polenta, taleggio and figs (Very good - you could really taste the figs, but the sweetness wasn't overpowering. The polenta had a lovely texture).  - Lobster & fennel cannellonis (My favorite dish! I could eat this alone and feel quite content, lol.  The lobster filling is generous, and I think there are apples as well - I'm not 100% sure, but there is a slight crunchy sweetness that really meshed well with the lobster. To die for!).  - Lasagna (Pork confit, pistachios and apple - simply amazing. This is one of their new dishes and it's not on their online menu so I can't provide the exact ingredients).   - Pizzette (Bianca with fontina, potatoes and rosemary - not at all heavy as the potatoes are thinly sliced. The pizza dough reminds me of naan - delicious!).  - Lamb meatballs (I'm generally not a fan of lamb or meat, but these meatballs were fabulous! Served in a light and tasty tomato sauce).   For dessert, we ordered the Tiramisu Bianco and the Lime Panacotta. My favorite was the tiramisu - the panacotta was nice, but I found it to be lacking in flavour.  UPDATED: You must try to homemade porchetta! It's absolutely delicious and literally melts in your mouth. That's quite a compliment coming from me - I generally don't eat meat, like... EVER! =-)   All of the dishes are prepared with fresh ingredients and served in small portions that are meant to be shared. I really love this concept because it allows you to try different things, without filling up.  I think the only down side was that some of the dishes arrived at the same time, and by the time we got to them, they had cooled down a bit. Besides that, love this place!"}
{"text":"The decor is Amazing but If you re hungry eat before, when i come in a pizzeria, I want a pizza, not a toast sized bouchée. Anyways the service was top and trust me the waitress really felt that I was disappointed about the size of what we ordered so I let a good tip, but I'll never come back here, Sorry there are too Manu restaurants in Mtl to give It a new chance"}
{"text":"Shared a wonderful meal with my mom here on our last night in Montreal. We were walking through old montreal and stumbled upon Dolcetto & Co.- which was still crowded and serving dinner around 11 PM (most other kitchens in the area are closed at this time on Saturdays). We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen- which I highly recommend- the two chefs were so fun and friendly and explained what they were cooking and how they were preparing each dish.  The plates are about 1/2 portion size each, but they are good sized and perfect for sharing. We split the polenta and arugula salad, eggplant parmesan, lamb shank and the chocolate lava cake for dessert.  The ambiance is cute and nautical and our waitress was also very friendly. Windows open up to the street- which is very nice. I definitely recommend Dolcetto & Co. for anyone visiting Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner without reservations on a Saturday night. The place was packed and we grabbed two seats at the bar in the back of the restaurant. We really wanted seats in the front because you can see the street and more of the restaurant happenings (the bar seating causes you to be looking at the back wall of the restaurant) but there was a private party/large group along up almost all the seats   The battens a was excellent. She had great recommendations and was a lot of fun. We took our time and ordered a bottle of wine, then several plates to split and try a variety of the offerings on the menu. If is a fun atmosphere and a mix of people and I like being able to see the chefs in the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Italian tapas style? Great flavourful food. Accepts the Tab app payment. Really accommodating staff"}
{"text":"Dolcetto & Co has a great location in Old Montreal, right along one of the many cobblestone streets, right near the intersection of easily walk-to areas where the smell of the food wafting through the neighborhood will draw you in. It drew us in for sure!  Upon entering, however we were a bit disappointed to see both how small the dining area was and how packed it was. I thought for sure we wouldn't get a table that night but the host eventually took our name and the list put us about 20 minutes out from a table, great!  When we came back 20 minutes later (there really is no place to hang out in the restaurant or even the lounge to wait for a table) the table they picked for us was shoved between two other tables on the back wall and the people already cramped into there were not happy about having us put there. We got squeezed in anyhow. So right away, the claustrophobic tension of what was supposed to be a relaxing, romantic night out was kind of blown up. We got to witness the 2-3 couples who got lucky to get seats near the windows which seemed to have actual elbow room and some small smidge of privacy.  While reviewing the menus, right away the sound and noise of the eating den was also quite distracting. I could barely hear my partner from across the tiny table. Talking about the menu is necessary as it does specialize in small, shared plates so working out a meal was kind of a struggle. I'm normally not a huge fan of this sort of new craze in menu and dining but was very willing to give it a try here.  The food was actually very good and came out to us swiftly. They did not have the bottle of wine we originally chose on the menu so we took the waiter's suggestion which worked out OK anyhow. I wouldn't call the food \"out of this world\" but it definitely spoke to why the place was so filled on a weeknight.   I would come back if it wasn't so packed and noisy. It's hard for me to enjoy good food as this while being packed like a sardine myself. I wish they could do the dining area better."}
{"text":"Awesome little gem in Old Montreal.   The service was amazing. Out waiter asked us if it was our first time dining here. Given that it was, he explained how the menu works, as well as telling us what the specials of the day were. He was friendly and very approachable and always came to our table with a smile on his face.   The food is TOP. We ordered the lobster and fennel cannelloni. Who could have thought lobster and fennel went so good together? The pasta was homemade. We didn't ask, but it showed it the quality and taste of the pasta. It's served with a deliciously rich white sauce. Let's just say we sent back the plate clean! The only thing we weren't crazy about was this vinegary taste in the cannelloni. It wasn't overpowering, and it was delicious none the less, however it was just a little too much for our liking. We then ordered the pizzas which were awesome. The sauce on the tomato pizza was fresh and simple, the way it should be on a pizza!  The only downside is that it is a little on the pricey side. For the price we paid our pizzas, we could get ones that are double the size at restaurants like Bottega. Also, they start you off with a generous bread basket that comes with focaccia, crostini sticks and baguette, served with a little bowl of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.   They have an extensive wine list. Glasses start at 9$...and you could get a decent bottle for 45$  This is a great place for groups, as you can share your food with everyone. It's a \"tapas\" style concept, except the portions are a little bit bigger. Cool find"}
{"text":"Un peu déçu.  La nourriture est bonne, mais les portions sont très petites pour le prix.  Ambiance agréable, mais service un peu lent."}
{"text":"Of all the dinners we had on our trip, this was by far my favorite.  Think small plates meets Italian Bistro.  Cute, modern space...tables were a bit close for my comfort. I made a same day reservation and we were seated immediately.  Staff was friendly and helpful through out our meal, including splitting our check (this was our last meal together, and we had spent evenly at this point).  It took awhile to decide what we wanted...in order of my most loved to least....  Garlic shrimp, Roasted fennel, Panchettta....amazing!!  Our traveling companions shared this perfect shrimp dish....yum!!  Homemade Porchetta....I did not expect such a buttery, delicious Salumi, lightly salted, this sang!   Cannelloni au canard confit & pommes de terre douce...creamy, good. I shared with our companions, and they loved it more than I did  Pizzette with Prosciutto and tomato sauce....good, maybe not great.  We had chocolate desserts earlier in the day, so we did not try theirs.  Perfect light meal....some truly amazing flavors!"}
{"text":"Expensive small pizzas-- sorry, pizettes.  They were slightly above average pizzas.  The wine list was okay as well with prices in line with the area.    Friendly service but very much lacking as we hardly saw them.  I think this place is popular on Yelp because it is relatively cheap for the Old Port area."}
{"text":"Four of us ate here last night and we were unfortunately very underwhelmed.  Everything we had was tasteless (ravioli, pizza, gnocci, meatballs).  It's never a good sign when you have to ask for salt and pepper at a restaurant.  The service was also horribly slow and my wife's dinner didn't come until after everyone else had completely finished eating.  At that point, they might as well not even bother.  Seems like most others had good experiences so maybe we were just unlucky."}
{"text":"Dolcetto looks like a happy sailor decorated it on a very sunny day. They put the Jolly\" in Jolly Rodger. The crowd was stylish, young and loud. LOUD.   We made reservations online, and though they \"lost\" them, to their credit they seated us anyway within 5 minutes on a crushingly busy Saturday night.   When the waiter tells you (if you can hear him) that the food is tapas style it's hard to know how much to order. We ordered ravioli (6 small squares) and a pizza (no bigger than my iPhone 6 Plus.). Order more than you think you want.   The food was really fresh and delicious, but by the time it got to us, it was room temperature at best. I'd chalk that up to the Saturday night chaos.   The focaccia was very good. The cannoli had bits of fresh cherry and were not as sweet as their NYC cousins, but they're probably healthier.   I'd go back on a quieter night so I could get a better hint from the wait staff about what to order.   Fun location. Nice night out for the price."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant on our first night in Montreal while walking around. Restaurant has a very nice ambiance. Staff members are very friendly and helpful, especially our waitress. She was very nice and gave good suggestions on what we can order. We shared a pizza and ravioli which both were delicious.Dining is more of a Tapa style. Prices are normal for Old Port restaurants. My only suggestion is they could more than one type of beer."}
{"text":"Nice, quaint place Italian Resto with a warm ambience. The service was pretty good as well. The portions are tapas size as well as a little pricey so I wouldn't recommend going if you're hungry. I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza although I enjoyed watching them make it. However the Squid ink pappardelle was so good we ordered a second one! In total $34 for a pasta dish (ouch!) but nevertheless delicious."}
{"text":"Super grumpy waitress! Giving us attitude for no reason! She was  rude and aggressive! Food was a mediocre! Very small portions and not tasty! I won't go back"}
{"text":"So I had a fabulous time here with my friends last week for Mtl a Table! We had a girl's night in this trendy little restaurant in the Old Port - beware of trying to find street parking!! For $21 per person, I had to try it.   Of course, after we split a bottle of rose and an extra garlic bread between 3, it ended up costing us closer to $55/each. How was the food? Somehow... bad. Disappointed with the food. I had high hopes and was let down on all fronts.  The extra garlic bread we got was pretty good because we were starving but overpriced ($8 for a heated ball of dough, really?!) The rose bottle was good but so overpriced at $55. To my surprise, their specialty (pizza) was not on their Mtl a Table menu so I was a little taken aback.  I ordered the caprese salad, the chicken ballotine, and the \"tiramisu\". The caprese salad consisted of a quarter of a piece of bocconcini on 4 slices of bland tomatoes... yeah that's not a caprese salad. Next the chicken ballotine... wow. SALT BOMB. It was inedible so I asked the waiter to switch it out for something else on the menu and he accepted (thankfully). We got the mushroom lasagna instead... much better than the chicken but pretty bland. And then the tiramisu... I think I've learned my lesson and will never order this dessert again because no one knows how to make it. I was not served a tiramisu, just some cream!   Overall, very poor food but good service and fun vibes. MAYBE if in the area, I would come back to try a pizza since it's what they're known for but I really think I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pizzettes were delicious , in fact I wish we had sampled more  instead of the antipasto which was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  Sitting at the chefs counter we saw plenty more to return for.  The service was excellent, and the panna cotta was the best I've had."}
{"text":"It would be absolutely impossible to give this restaurant anything less than 5 stars.   We sampled a number of dishes with every single one of them tastebud explosive! My fave 3 that I woke up craving are: tomato and burrata, lobster cannelloni (OMG OMG OMG!) and the octopus fennel salad. To. Die. For.   5 stars for service  5 stars for ambiance 5 stars for food and drinks 5 stars for value   I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Très bonne place.  Pour une des rares fois, je n'ai pas eu l'impression que c'est un resto \"attrape-touriste\".  Les portions petites, mais assez pour partager.  Drinks...limonade....waoh! Succulent!  Fois gras et figues: 4 bons morceaux de fois gras. Mélange simple, mais toujours efficace. Champignons, fromage et roquette: miamy!  Je dois y retourner!"}
{"text":"Very cool looking place...eclectic and vintage. It was great with the front door and both side windows open because it was as if we were on a covered patio (which is great since there was a brief stint of rain). The food overall was above average but overpriced. My wife and I both had a Caesar salad, she had the ravioli, I had the carbonara and the lamb meatballs. For drinks she had a blanc sangria, I had a negroni, and we shared a bottle of Toscan Mocali Cab Sau (which was great).  Unfortunately, portions were too small for the price...$14 for tiny a la carte caesar is too much. They were busy but the service was still too slow considering we had two waiters tending to us; they rarely asked us how we were doing, every time I had to flag them down to order our next course and we were there for 3 hours. Perhaps I'm underestimating the cost of owing a restaurant on St. Paul street, regardless, there are many other well rated places on that street that I will try before going back. Portions need to increase 25% to be fair value for cost."}
{"text":"What can I can say about this place? Oh yes, it's incredible.  We couldn't find a place to eat for New Year's, and finally found Dolcetto, so we dropped in. What a surprising treat. Henri, Alain, Rodrigo: all great guys and big time fun. I cannot remember Henri's partner's name, but she was amazing as well!  Enjoyed their pizza (which is the staple). Had the Margherita. Tasty! All food priced well and impeccable service and treatment by the staff, top to bottom.  Cannot wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is soo  adorable, tapas to  go with how adorable this place is. Open kitchen so  you can sit and talk to the chef at the bar and watch your food being made. Great for groups, dates and meeting well dressed singles looking to mingle.  The bar setup makes for a great conversation starter where the chef plays cupid.   Their wine selection is different - a good different - a chance to try something different, different, had to actually think different, not same old same old- apparently it's all private collection.   Even though it's a ''wine bar''-  the place does not centre around the bar, it's a very small  bar space, with the kitchen bar being bigger. I'd like to say the design centres around great conversation, just the way it's all  setup-  not just drinking or eating.   Though the menu is pretty simple it's nice to have Italian tapaps for a place that still has a nice family feel.  Having grown up Italian,  family  and food usually means 10  courses of filling food centered around the 4 Italian food groups;  cheese,  meat, tomatoe and pasta- Dolcetto is a happy middle ground with a familiar feel, mixing up the menu without the gorging.    I  love this place for looks though,  electric nautical theme with cute little conversation starting eye catchers everywhere. Reminded me  of being in a seaside villa by the sea, reminded me of Venice( the non-touristy part). I think a big part of why I love it was it's nautical ; but European nautical,  not east coast rainboots lobster trap jigging nautical AND the bathroom is sooooo  cute. The place looks so great, combining that with the crowd I would say you have to look  great to go there.   It's  a classy kitschy place and I would LOOVE  to come here to  brunch *wink wink nudge nudge (not all you can eat brunch,  mimosas and champagne brunch)  Grade A date spot."}
{"text":"Teeny tiny food portions, served on fancy little plates bringin a big smile on your face and drilling a big hole in your wallet. That's the magic of Tapas.     Located in Old Montreal is Dolcetto & company is a small Italian Tapas joint with a trendy nautical décor. The food here is DELICIOUS. The ingredients are fresh. Their food menu comprises of pizzettes (small pizzas), Italian charcuteries, cheeses and antipasti. The antipasti is great.      Tried the eggplant parmigiana, Gnocchi with truffle cream, Lobster and fennel cannelloni & Lime marinated octopus & fennel salad. Everything was Awesome. My favorite being Lobster and fennel cannelloni. In cheeses we tried Mozzarella di bufala. Was good too.    Now to the pizzettes....... Let me be honest. Not a big fan of the crust. I'm used to wood fire pizza. The pizza crust was almost like a naan bread. Though the toppings were great. The foie gras & Fig pizza really stood up. Was a nice combination. Do not come here thinkin you'll have a good pizza..... Think of it as a flatbread with great toppings and you'll be happy. The Tiramisu is yumm    Food -  Good Service - Fast & friendly Ambiance - Casual & Cozy Worth the money -Yes"}
{"text":"Do you like $15 glasses of mediocre wine? Do you like uncooked, raw meat balls? Do you like overcooked bowties drowning in a bowl of tasteless cream? Do you like asking for salt? Do you like receiving your main dish ten minutes before the rest of your group does? This was like a meal that my drunken roommate in college would've serve to his friends.  Just because you are in a touristy part of town DOES NOT mean that you have to serve substandard food. Especially when the service is a disaster...  We had family visiting from out of town and wanted them to see the Old Port and have a nice meal, but SPOILER ALERT: Dolcetto is NOT the place to attempt this, you will be sadly disappointed, and feel grossly cheated of all that a dining experience should be.  A perfect example of a terrible restaurant. Dolcetto & Co is an embarassment to the city of Montreal."}
{"text":"Guys, are your listening to me? I mean really listening? THIS PLACE RULES. Italian concept with a tapas/small plate feel.  I spent a few hours here on a Sunday afternoon/evening and literally was treated like family. Sit at the kitchen bar if there's only a few of you. I LOVED watching these guys cook. The PIzzettas were awesome. Homemade prochetta was delightful and the cow's milk/sheep's milk cheese with truffles....i can't even speak. Incredible. They also made me a cheesecake that was so good that I could have had an entire pie  The staff, the cooks, the guests - so fun - so friendly. I stayed for hours and felt like part of the family. The guys even had me explain the menu to new guests. Everyone was so friendly.   Fig foie gras pizza. STOP IT. SO GOOD.  I need to come back for the pasta - like mounds of it.  We ended up drinking shots with the crew and had a lovely time. I can't wait to go back. I thought about hitting a french place because I was in Montreal, but honestly, Dolcetto & Co blew me away."}
{"text":"We spoke to the waitress and she told us everything was made from scratch. It was!  Very impressed with the food and decor. Very cool place and very friendly. The open kitchen was nice. Get to see the action. Drinks are nice but the wine selection was even nicer! Would recommend this spot to anybody wanting good Italian food."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place awhile back when I heard a celebrity chef mention that it was one of their fave places to get pizza in Montreal.  So the next time I was in Montreal, I knew I had to come here.  I was incredibly impressed with this place.  I made a reservation for myself and a couple of friends on a Friday night.  The location is right in old Montreal on a quaint little street full of restaurants.  The ambiance and decor was very simple and inviting.  My friends and I do not speak french, but did not feel like we were treated any differently.  We split a few appetizers (the caprese salad and the arancini) a pizza and a pasta.  If we weren't in public, we probably would have licked all of the plates clean.  Everything was fresh, homemade, flavourful, and tasted very authentic.  I felt like I was back in Italy.  The prices were quite cheap as well!    I honestly cannot wait to come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"This place was exactly what we were looking for!  We were with friends and wanted to grab a bottle of wine and a small bit of pizza.  We had already had so much to eat (and drink).  We shared two pizzas and a bottle of chianti.  Along with the bread and olive oil/tapenade it was just the right amount of food.  The margherita pizza was simply perfect."}
{"text":"Cozy environment with great italian dishes. We got the eggplant parmesan, truffle gnocchi, and spicy prosciutto bruschetta. Would return!"}
{"text":"We came in early and it was super bright in there, so we asked the waiters to turn it down. The staff were accommodating and pizza was on point, there was a few billing issues of double charges, so that had to be resolved. Just wished that they upped their game by providing more pasta selections."}
{"text":"Fabulous! We stumbled upon this little place while looking for a place to get a casual dinner after exploring Old Montreal and so glad we did!!  This is a tapas style menu (small plates for sharing) and with it being just the two of us we ordered... - the maple lamb: served as 4 small \"lollipop\" style pieces with couscous it was so tasty!!! YUM!!!   - creamy lobster ravioli: very rustic style but two large pieces of lobster in a smooth cream sauce with a good amount of crispy pancetta. YUM!!!  - margarita pizza: rustic, fresh and classic. Quite tasty  - mushroom pizza: big mushroom flavour with fresh arugula on top. Loved it.  - focaccia bread: so good...so fresh!!  - bottle of white wine: it was fine. The wine list was a bit over priced in my opinion but gives you wonderful option if you want to go and enjoy a great bottle along side a charcuterie / cheese player   If you are in old Montreal, I do recommend it.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The beat ravioli I have ever had. Great food. Good wine. Tables are very close together. Service is okay. Nice place in old Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas style menu.  Pizza was surprisingly good.  Toppings were fresh and tasty, the dough was light and fluffy.  Appetizers are made for sharing and are tastefully conceived, as everything is made in house.  Relaxed atmosphere, attentive service!  I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Cool pizza joint in Old Montreal. We just shared a stuffed ham, mushroom and goat cheese pizza. Was so hot out it was hard to be inside. Friendly staff and reasonable prices considering other establishments in area. Good if you're looking for a fancy twist to quick eats and tired of big meat dishes."}
{"text":"First, what a fun vibe and suuuuuper friendly staff.  Everyone here was so sweet, energetic, and managed the crowds really well.  The vibe here is fun and the nutella pizza is delicious.  Drinks are inventive too.  I had the mango and jalepeno margartia, which was great."}
{"text":"Nice Italian bistro on St Paul in Old Montreal.    Especializes in tapas and pizzas.    We got a GRIFFINTOWN Pizza (PEPPERONI, PISTACHIOS & SPICY OIL), a PETITE-ITALIE Pizza (BIANCA, SPINACH, MOZZARELLA DI BUFFALA & PORCHETTA) and the BEEF SHORTRIBS, CAPONATA & POTATO SALAD.   All of them were very good.  The service is attentive but a bit slow.    Reservations are a must...this place usually is full after 6pm.   Great wine and cocktail bar menu.  The house bread is also very tasty and good."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place due to a recommendation by my boyfriend's cousin. Only looking for a spot to hangout and have a couple drinks after a long day, we weren't expecting much. This place was packed! We opted for a seat at the bar because the wait for a table would take way too long. We had front row seats for all the cooking action. The chefs prepared dishes that were mouth watering and we had to order a couple things even though we had just gotten back from dinner not too long ago lol. Not sure of the names of the dishes we got but it was a shrimp dish and a pizza with spinach and prosciutto. The shrimp was cooked perfectly! Not over, not under. I love my pizza crust thin and crispy and that's exactly how it came out. Everything was seasoned just right. The restaurant was pretty loud but that didn't bother us at all. I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great experience. Sat at the pizza bar and really enjoyed seeing how everything was made in the pizza oven. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"I love the ambience. The wine collection is great, and the staff have been lovely on my yet visits. They don't rush you, and let you enjoy the for. The food itself is great, and I recommend chef's specialty: the lamb. It was a tasty piece of meat, and it was cooked to perfection. Their cheese collection could be improved, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Decent service, but BAD SEAFOOD. Calamari old, rubbery and tasteless. Shrimp on the pizza bad (made me sick). Lame overpriced wine. DO NOT GO."}
{"text":"What a disaster! Omg Never going here again! We had dinner reservations for 8pm , we waited till 8:40 to finally get seated ... wow that was very unprofessional and rude ! We reserved weeks ago and to not respect our scheduled time was disrespectful! We got our menus and had to wait about 1 hour Im not kidding to order ... we only got bread at around 10:30.. what a longgg ass wait ! We were so hungry at this point that we kept re-ordering bread because it took faster to get some bread than our actual food! The menu is disappointing.. there's not much selection and al the main courses look like entrés! The most ridiculous part is that our main course came in before our entres! We ordered the prosciutto pizza and it was literally the half the size of a small standard slice of pizza .. it was good but just so small .. not filling at all.. the grilled shrimp tasted overcooked with 3 little pieces .. I felt as if I was eating dog treats! The salads ugh even worse.. they were small and overly empowered by the sour vinaigrette they used. Gross!   The service was a disaster.. they messed up everyones order. Food was coming out and they kept yelling at whos food belonged to who.. The place is terribly run! They're so disorganized. At the end, we finished around 11:30 waiting to get our bills and they messed up everyones bill, we had to wait an extra 30 min around midnight to finally be able to pay. It was a disaster and ruined our friends big 40th birthday party. Not impressed at all! I will never be back here again!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Italian tapas. Pizzette wad delcious as was the mozzarella di bufala. If i had more time in town i would have gone back."}
{"text":"We'd been looking for a great Italian place since we moved here and no luck. Lots of okay, predictable fare but nothing you'd get a craving for later. Dolcetto was recommended to us by a transplant from Italy and he was right on the money. It's got an Italian wine bar feel with small tapas made with a delicate touch. Small plates are in the ten dollar range (it's all small plates) and everything we had was spot-on with the gnocchi being the star that night. Will definitely return. Pro tip: Definitely make reservations."}
{"text":"This place serves small plates of tasty Italian food. Nice wine list. It's casual and unpretentious with a great view of rue St. Paul. Service is friendly and obliging. Good spot to share some nice small pizzas with a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"This place is comfortable and the food is a knock out. Margarita pizza, wild mushroom pizza, caesar salad and good wine. Really enjoyed the quality of the food and the thoughtful presentation! Will be back."}
{"text":"Italian tapas.  Small trendy place in Vieux Montreal.  Very good small plates for a late night meal.  We did wait a while to be seated because host was also waiting tables.  Once seated food came out quickly.  Very friendly service. A bit high priced.  Overall a nice place."}
{"text":"This restaurant HAS SOME NERVE.  First, let's put aside that the fact that the portions are unbelievably small and the prices are ridiculously high.  It's the attitude and treatment of the customer which is really what I'm angry about.  Long story short, we were there last night (Monday) me, my wife, and two kids.  Clearly, the waitress (who didn't write anything down) forgot the order but later blamed it on a \"misunderstanding \".  The hostess or manager or owner (not sure of her title) was unhelpful and insulting and only served to further inflame the situation by saying she wasn't there when the order was placed, so she didn't know what happened.  Adding salt to the wound, while I stewed in my anger at the poor treatment we were receiving - and waiting about 45 minutes for my calimari- at one point the hostess apologized to the couple NEXT TO US- and gave them a complimentary pizza because of the delay!  Meanwhile, my calimari never came.  In the end, I cancelled my calimari order because I was so angry (and lost my appetite).  The restaurant did take off the charge for one of our orders and a soft drink for one of my kids but it was a little too late.  Message to this restaurant:  its obvious you are packing in lots of people, you are pushing your expensive alcoholic drinks, your pricey bottled/mineral water, and your high priced snack food - but remember the basics of customer service and treatment of people.  In the days of Yelp, the customer has a voice!  Never going back."}
{"text":"This place was good. The dough was so delightful. I had the pancetta pizza, and I would have adored it...but, I just got back from having pancetta in Little Italy NYC and the meat here just doesn't compare. The pancetta was quite fatty and difficult to eat. We enjoyed the smores dessert, and the service was spot on. I'd definitely return for a chill night out."}
{"text":"Food was good, sat at big communal table and I may be slightly in love with the girl sorta across from me.  Service was attentive. A DJ showed up and frankly he really sucks, might I suggest an I-Pod to replace him... But beyond DJ no talent, this place was great."}
{"text":"This place is a for sure when visiting Montreal. Amazingly high quality Italian food. The waiters are so friendly and the offerings they made for our meal made the dining experience the best I have had in a long time.  I had the Prosciutto pizza and it was top notch."}
{"text":"A local suggested we check this place out and it surely did not disappoint. The place is beautifully and creatively decorated with a nautical theme which sets a lovely ambiance over which to enjoy dinner.   Small plates are chosen by checking boxes on the presented paper menu (a little odd given the ambiance but whatevs.) We were incredibly pleased with the caprese and polenta starters. We just about licked our plates.   The dish that stood out the most however was the ricotta and eggplant pizza, it was truly sublime. Beware, though: this is not a a typical pizza joint. Pizzas are served small plates style so they are incredibly small. (Thank a large slice of pizza sliced in four pieces.) My husband and I split two starters and two pizzas, and thought it was just about the right amount of food, although I can see if you are hungry adding in an additional starter.   Service was kind of lacking, unfortunately losing this place a star. They never did come back and offer an additional round of drinks or check on the food.   All in all a yummy experience and I suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"From the nautical decor, you'd expect this to be a seafood restaurant, and from the name, you'd expect it to be a bakery. Regardless, you won't leave disappointed unless you expect to be stuffed.   You certainly won't be bored, as ordering a bunch of Italian small plates will make for a very entertaining meal. We started with the dreamy lobster/fennel cannelloni and the polenta with taleggio--both plate-licking delicious. The pizzas are not large, so we ordered 2--margherita/burrata and spinach. The crusts are thin but not charred, and the toppings high-quality. After all this, we still had room for dessert, and the chocolate molten cake was fine but nothing special.  Service is casual, friendly, and quite helpful in determining how much to order."}
{"text":"This is perhaps the most disappointing Italian meal I have ever had. The Hotel Nelligan staff suggested this restaurant and we had high hopes. Unfortunately the food was awful, old, rubbery and inedible calimari, bad shrimp on the pizza, my husband got sick from it. The wine was mediocre and overpriced. The pizza was tasteless.  Spare yourself the agony of bad food and frustration of wasted time and money and avoid this  restaurant."}
{"text":"Great tapas place in Old Montreal. We sat at the bar and the chefs were very nice and chatted with us.   I recommend:  -Proscuitto - this is the real stuff, not the packaged stuff you find in the grocery store. I watched the chef slice ours with the machine till it was silky thin - just like what you find in italy -Eggplant Parm - this isn't your typical fried parm! They grill the eggplant instead which makes it healthier, but still great flavor -Lobster Cannoli - thin pasta stuffed with lobster and fennel  Also a great place for a date - the vibe of the place is very chic, nice ambience."}
{"text":"This is a perfect date spot. Guys, follow my lead and get some points with your lady friends. A night at Dolcetto & Co guarantees good food, good drink, a comfy setting, AND you won't break the bank.*  Typically, as soon as someone says 'small plates,' my mind's left the conversation. Why in the world would I want to pay for a dinner plate of food and get back something that could be served on a saucer plate? How does that make sense? To whoever thought of this scam, sir, I tip my hat to thee. It wasn't until an experience at Dolcetto & Co that I realized that my disdain may stem from an American perspective. D&C may serve small plates but said plates are packed with flavor, surprisingly portioned and easily sharable for two. Not once did I contemplate stabbing her hand with my fork in order to make sure I got a taste. Did I say that out loud?  Because I'm worldly, I opted for a cocktail over wine: bourbon & apple juice. It sounds odd but I'd been turned on to this combo in Miami Beach and, surprisingly, it works. Well. For the two of us, we had five dishes: eggplant with fontina cheese, prosciutto & mushrooms (heavenly), rabbit porketta (surprised I liked it; usually I'm not a fan of rabbit but this was the second time in Montreal I had it and liked it), Italian sausage pizza, the garlic shrimp with tomatoes & pancetta (good but nothing you haven't had before), and the lobster/fennell cannelloni (as decadent as you might imagine). The wood seating is tight for either a two top of a four top. I guess Montreal doesn't have the plus-sized population of the nation to its south. As much as I joke, I'm not a particularly large man and I had some difficulty navigating the space between tables. I imagine that for folks of a bit larger size, this could be an embarrassing issue.  *I'm saying I'm cheap or anything but... small plates get expensive fast."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Food was enjoyable and atmosphere nice. Bit overpriced for what you get - but not outrageous. Friendly and courteous staff.  Had gnocchi w kale pesto (good), margherita pizza (meh+), foie gras and fig salted pizza (good), and mushroom and smoked cheese pizza (meh-). No great highlights but nothing was bad. Most disappointing was the smoked cheese pizza. Oyster mushrooms and cheese in it lacked flavour - surprising since I expected/hoped for something much more flavourful.  Btw: their pizzas are small. The size of a flatbread. I kind of like that - since you can sample more - but some folks might take notice from a \"value\" perspective.  Overall, the place is reasonable and I'll likely go again once in a while since it's in my neighbourhood."}
