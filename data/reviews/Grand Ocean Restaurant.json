{"text":"We were disappointed when Scarborough Grand Seafood Restaurant closed down.  It was my mom's favourite dim sum and dinner spot, and we had being going there for years and years.  We decided to try Grand Ocean Restaurant (that took over) on the weekend for dim sum AND dinner.    I thought the dim sum was very, very good.  They had a large variety of different items.  The dim sum served was not oily, or too salty, and did not make us thirsty.  I could not taste any msg (which is a good thing).  I ate so much food.  The soy dessert was great and so were the spare ribs. The carts were a little slow in coming and the service was a little off.  I guess we were comparing it too much to the original restaurant.   We went back that night for dinner at 5:30 pm.  The place was very quiet, there was only one other table with customers. We ordered peking duck, fried rice and some greens.  I thought the food was very freshly made and again, not oily or salty and did not make me thirsty.  Very clean tasting.  They gave large servings.  The service was excellent!  I think the lady serving us was the manager.  They were very attentive, bringing us extra hoisin sauce for the peking duck, offering us extra dessert and cookies (which were on the house), was very attentive towards my mom.  They even packed our leftovers for us!  (Usually restaurants just hand us the styrofoam containers and then we would have to pack the food ourselves).  Thank you Grand Ocean Restaurant for the wonderful service.  Our family will be a definite frequent visitor to your restaurant.  Its too bad the other reviewer had a bad experience because we had a very good experience at Grand Ocean Restaurant."}
{"text":"While the prices here are a bargain, the quality of food is lacking. Came here for dim sum with the extended fam the other day, and was impressed when I heard the numbers: 1.80 for all sizes of weekday dim sum; 2.50 on weekends (3 for the special sizes). Fer reals? Alright!  But after we started ordering some stuff, we realized why the prices were so cheap. The shrimp har gow was mushy, the lotus-wrapped rice had barely any \"liu\" (stuffing) in it, and everything else was mediocre at best. The staff kept trying to push specialty dishes on us, and sometimes even successfully landed a plate on our table as they were convincing us and stamped our card.   It's in a small mall that I haven't been to in ages (tucked away behind another plaza. A fairly open space, but I assume because of it's hidden location it looked like there wasn't a lot of people bustling to dine here.  As much as I like a deal, I don't think this is the place for me."}
{"text":"Hello,  Your restaurant provides terrible service.  My family booked 3 tables there to have a 10 course dinner type meal for approximately 25 people and your restaurant really disappointed us.  First of all, your waitress was rude to us and rolled her eyes and complained about us as we got organized into our seats.  Then we found aphid-like bugs in your baby bok choy.  When we complained, she said that it is normal... is it really normal to serve bugs to your customers?  It was only after much complaint and refusal to eat the dish that your manager offered to replace the dish, even though we had ask for a refund for that particular dish.  Your manager told us that we can replace the dish with anything we liked, but apparently he really meant any cheap dish we wanted, he suggested noodles or rice even though that already came with our set course.  In the end, the replacement dish looked like it was meant to serve 1 person, when we had to share this with 12 per table.  We brought a cake to cut and we insisted on cutting it ourselves.  But then your waitress interrupted us half way through cutting the cake and insisted that she could do a better job.  She took over and butchered our cake into crumbles and then scooped these crumbs onto plates to be served.  You ruined our cake!  Anyways, I highly doubt that anyone from the restaurant would see this, but I do want to state on here that the manager of this horrible restaurant is Angela Lin.  And I hope that by adding this business on here that anyone that even thought about trying this business would re-think their decision."}
