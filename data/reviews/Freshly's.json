{"text":"Visiting from out of town.  Food was generous, well priced, and tasty.  Fast delivery too."}
{"text":"Freshly's has the best Gyro's. The fries are really good as well. Actually I've never had a bad meal here. The pricing is reasonable. I've hooked my coworkers on this place."}
{"text":"French fries were VERY good!  That was the only good part of our meal.  The \"large\" pizza was tiny, soggy and un-flavorful.  The gyros were lacking sauce and condiments.  Waste of money."}
{"text":"Cajun gyros are my fav.. Not a big fan of their free chips scheme; they could sub it with fries.."}
{"text":"Great gyro, fresh everything. Would like some more traditional Greek sides to choose from, but overall solid!"}
{"text":"We had an issue with the Freshley's driver and we've been trying to call and talk to the manager.  The last time we called and asked for management we were told to \"F off\" and hung up on.  They didn't even ask why we wanted to talk to the manager!"}
{"text":"Yum! First time trying this even though I've lived here for awhile now. The broccoli cheese poppers are giant and so good! I wasn't sure what Freshly's sauce was so I got a side of it. Think a more mild version of blooming onion sauce, or even similar to Burger King zesty sauce. Really good. Philly cheesesteak was yummy too, next time I wouldn't add lettuce and tomatoes, it didn't need it. Only critique would be to add more options to the online ordering system. Can't add mayo etc to the sandwich, or sides of sauce. But I called and added the side of sauce no problem so still pretty easy! Next time I'll add pics"}
{"text":"I've got to tell you, you only have one chance to make a first impression. Well got to be honest, you failed at that. Not saying food was bad, but when you ask specifically for a gyro well done, and the order taker doesn't write it down, like he could care, well don't blame the cooks. The cashier seemed to be in charge while I was there and giving orders to everyone working, Maybe, just maybe he should worry about himself more too. Like I said, food wasn't bad but sides weren't homemade like he said, first of all chips in a bag aren't homemade, Cole slaw was bad enough and fine enough, that nobody could make it like that but a machine could. Gyro meat was good, but not to MY liking, more well done for me, oh yes I asked for that too!"}
{"text":"If you want a gyro this is the place. I always go with the origional. The cajon is tempting... my boyfriend likes everything they serve but mostly goes for the ruben.  Great portions free sides and fast service. Cant beat it"}
{"text":"We ordered take out and the gyros were pretty good. I had the Cajun gyro. Only downside , must have been loaded with sodium as I was thirsty for a good two hours after!"}
{"text":"I love the food; the staff is always polite, and patient. I'm currently working my way through the menu, and I have yet to be disappointed. I love the fact that they are never late when I order out, and they never complain about having to bring it upstairs!  needless to say I always give a good tip."}
{"text":"Gyros are tasty. We have ordered delivery a few times. I'm not sure if we will again because the prices are high in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great. Chicken & Gyro subs, pitas, and salads are great. Cajun corned beef is awesome. The sides are good and they have pizza, wings & tons more. Everything is fairly priced. They are open till 11pm every week night. Fri & Sat they are open till 4 am. Delivery is fast. The  negatives are They changed the chicken salad from lettuce to spring greens. Not as good as before. Also not down w the dark meat on chicken pitas and subs."}
{"text":"Awesome local fast food joint. Great gyros and subs..open late, perfect for an \"after the bar\" snack. Try the rotisserie chicken gyro and the pork gyro."}
{"text":"The fries are the best I have ever had and if you go during the afternoon it's a dollar. The rest of the food was good but not the best. I stop in now just to get the fries."}
{"text":"Super good, super quick, super friendly!! Clean place. Food is fresh and delicious! Can't wait for Pattys day to get some cornbeef eggrolls!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far. First time I had a corned beef sandwich which was so damn mouth watering yummy! They use Vienna Corned Beef just like Slyman's and probably just about, if not, every other deli in town. The wonderful thing about Freshly's though is they seem to actually care about what they are serving which isn't always the case with Slyman's Tavern (read my review) or Jack's or Corky & Lenny's. Freshly's is also counter service which I like more because you're strictly paying for the food. Though I have to say the two times I have been here the service was top notch and the people are super friendly and helpful. Today I had a junior gyro and it's the best gyro I've had since I worked at a Greek restaurant in the nineties in Columbus, Ohio. The junior was plenty big enough and I asked for it with feta and it was just the right amount. Plus they warmed the pita which is key to a really good gyro. They do the yogurt dressing on the side and I liked that not to mention the dressing was really good. Not watery and it really took me back. I will definitely be returning because their menu is quite extensive and I am curious to try their pizza and a Philadelphia steak and cheese. Oh and Slyman's Tavern perhaps you should visit Freshly's so you can finally figure out what the correct temperature for a corned beef sandwich should be."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery after a reunion with some highschool friends. Awesome they are open that late, and how they can afford to keep that roman god of a chef is beyond me. Delicious. Finished the rest in the morning, still delicious. Sorry delivery driver we were all so wasted. Cheers"}
{"text":"I loved Feshleys till Saint Patrick's Day. They are known for their gyros and cornbeef and did not offer their usual selection. They did not have any sign when I walked in saying that they did not offer their full menu. I waited in line for 25 minutes and when I got up to the counter I saw their limited menu. I still placed an order and asked for the onions and tomatoes on the side and they said \"No! We cannot put them on the side. If you don't want them on it you don't get them at all. \" I started to ask why and the man said \" its not happening,  you are already holding up the line\". I understand that it was Saint Patrick's day, but the lack of forewarning of the limited menu and the rudeness of the worker was not doing good business. It was busy yes, but they had an additional 7 workers and they  were not taking any phone orders. I will not be going back there. I know they probably do not care because I am only 1 customer, but I just wanted to let everyone know that they do not care about the customer.  How can I pay for something and they refuse to put them on the side. What a joke!!!!!! I will be driving to Mentor for Best Gyros or Nicks Gyros from now on."}
{"text":"Best gyros in that part of town. Super friendly staff and a free side with the purchase of any sandwich. My only complaint is that they charge extra for hot sauce... Most places give you a bottle of tabasco and call it a day."}
{"text":"Apparently, based on other reviews, the gyros here are good.  However, we ordered corn beef sandwiches on St. Patty's day and thought we had bitten into a pile of tree bark, it was so dry.  Man, if you can't get corned beef right on St. Patty's day, why sell it?  Also, to me, the fries tasted more like fish than French fries.  Time to change the oil, maybe?  Also, not being able to place a phone order at a deli style restaurant is ridiculous.  All I got was a message saying,  \"don't leave a message, because we don't check them\".  So, I tried to order on line and got a message saying to call and place an order.  All this and it wasn't even lunch hour.  Oh, almost forgot, we ordered cole slaw when we placed our in-person order and never got it.  Weren't charged for it, just never got it.  Freshlys needs to polish their apples."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great Gyro's, great staff, great price.  Ate here may times and every time the food was fantastic.  Very basic; however, extremely tasty..."}
{"text":"I got a jumbo regular gyro. I couldn't pick it up it was so big. Eating it has to be thought out. It was delicious. When I think of a gyro...this is it. I also got onion rings. They were great."}
{"text":"First off this place i tried this place twice the forst time was with a girl who hung with we tried their pizza which it was awful no flavor what so ever. I was starving so of course i ate my piece if i had a choice i would of went in, and demanded my money back. The 2nd time i tried this place i had a coupon for free food i got a burger and fries. Guess again it was terrible i didnt wven eat the whole thing i ended up throwing it away there is nothing fresh about this place at all. I havent been back to this place whenever i hear about this place i gag its disgusting go to mcdonalds they at least have better food."}
{"text":"I'm from California and came to Cleveland to visit. The bread was soft, the meat was good, and the people were nice. I had the Sicilian gyro."}
{"text":"Best subs around! Friendly people and great service. Love their Phili Cheese Steaks. Reminds me of the East Coast sandwiches. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent gyros traditionally and creatively served. And its awesome that they're open so late in the weekends."}
{"text":"Everything they have is from GFS or Sam's Club but they will claim that it's homemade.
The gyro /corned beef flavors are very limited to the Cajun sauce,Hot Sauce and BBQ. They will over charge on everything and screw you over on the lunch fries special and free side if you don't ask for it.
Just make sure if you do happen to get something delivered from here that you tip the driver decent because they only give the drivers 1.50$ per delivery ( no hourly wage)."}
{"text":"I love their fried mushrooms and salads! My husband is in love with their gyros. Overall, great place to order food when it's late & you're hungry."}
{"text":"I retried this place today and it was great! My corned beef was made like I asked and everthing was hot. So this time I ordered Corned beef, mozzarella sticks and I picked soup for my side which was vegetable today. Everything was excellent my hubby said it was worth the ride to go and get this time. So this time.. I figured its better to go in instead of placing your order over the phone."}
{"text":"Super disappointed.... We order from here fairly regularly (both take out and delivery) since they're really our only non-fast food option late at night and the bonus is the delivery! Placed a relatively decent sized order ($60 pre-tip) for delivery... An order was missing. No big deal, it happens. The girl who answers the phone when I call about it says she will call the driver and call me back.... They call me back. Turns out they never rang in my missing item... The solution was POOR, at best. The manager argued with me, said he would send the missing order but still charge me, despite the fact everyone else had already eaten...(also repeatedly told me they read my order back to me, irrelevant in my opinion, but they did not!) ... Long story short: 1 kid never got his food. I guess it's Steak 'n Shake from here on out. (Plus: the chicken is so very dry!)"}
{"text":"Chicken Cajun Giros are awesome!! As a Lincoln Electric employee I get a discount here. I am not sure why guys leave neg. reviews. This is Greek food, its not supposed to be lean. If you want lean and tasteless go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"There okay, I say this because they need work on there fryer skills. Often doughy not very well fried. The gyros are okay that's worth something and the soup could be hotter."}
{"text":"I've been to Freshly's twice in the last two weeks and probably 20 other times over the years and just forgot to check in. Lol 

I haven't tried everything here because can't stop trying my favorites. 

My first addiction is the Athens Gyro! OMG! Onions, tomato, with feta cheese and balsamic vinaigrette sauce. Dude! I can't say no. 
The fries are actually really good. Better than Wendy's and McDonald's I think. 

My second addiction with great surprise are the cheeseburgers!! I was totally shocked as to how good they are! 

There is so much on the menu it would take one person forever to try everything. The best perk about Freshly's, open until 11pm most night and 4AM!!!! Friday and Saturday!! That's awesome. Please go check them out!"}
