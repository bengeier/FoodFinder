{"text":"The concept of this highly Instagrammable place is really cool. Plus I am really into waffles ! Yes but no. I am a sweet tooth but his is really too sweet. I limited myself to only one garnish and it was a big sugar rush. I prefer my Belgian waffles without any garnish, it's sweet enough. And good luck to eat it and still have an Instagrammable face after that, it's a bit hard to eat without making a mess. Happy I tried but not my favorite thing."}
{"text":"This place just opened up around February!

The decor is very cute/clean and would please any foodie instagrammers. 

The waffle was cooked well and the flavor really hit the spot! My only concern is that their concept is \"waffle on a stick\" but the waffle isn't easy to eat with the stick. My stick fell out so I just used my hands in the end. I'd recommend asking for a fork and knife if they have it. 

The drink selection was really interesting/good. I had a matcha drink with no sugar and loved it! They also have a selection of coffee. 

They have alcoholic popsicles!!!! I didn't get to try one but definitely will be returning this summer to have a few.

Overall I'd recommend it to a friend and return but had to give it 4/5 stars because their \"waffle on a stick\" concept didn't really work for me. Maybe if there were two smaller waffles that were easier to pick up and eat like a lolipop it'd be better, but they were just too big."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ice pops - watermelon and a mango/lime. You have to try one!!! They're great during this spring/summer weather. Free pineapple infused water is a nice touch and the service is very friendly. Will definitely try other flavors on our next visit to Montreal and maybe try the waffles."}
{"text":"Je viens de découvrir ce lieu qui fait déjà parti de mes favoris dans le vieux Montréal.

Le concept est d'avoir une gaufres que l'ont agrémente à notre goût sur un bâton (j'ai pris une gaufre trempé à l'érable avec des morceaux de bananes et des morceaux de crunch, un délice !). 

Le concept est super et ils viennent d'ouvrir il y a 1 mois.

Pour ceux qui aimerait un peu plus de fraîcheur, vous pouvez trouver toutes sortes de popsickle avec des fruits frais.

En plus de toutes ces merveilles, les gérants sont super sympa. 

Bon aller je ne vais pas tout vous spolier, je vous laisse découvrir par vous même et je peux vous garantir que vous ne serez pas déçu :-)"}
{"text":"The best stop in Montreal! 
The waffle was amazing! Had just enough options, just enough toppings! My friend and I sat in their cute nook and ate our waffles and cappuccinos, and that moment was one of our favorites of our trip. 
We text eachother dreaming of those waffles to this day. Not only were the toppings fun, but the waffle itself was SO GOOD!! 
The people that worked there were friendly, welcoming, and happy we were there.
Wish I lived close to Montreal so I could go back every weekend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Waffles on a stick, with a choice of four dips including chocolate, Nutella, maple and salted caramel. Then you get your toppings. The waffles themselves are amazing, and the dips/toppings are amazing. They also have ice pops and boozy pops. Do yourself a favor and check them out!"}
{"text":"L'endroit est connu pour ses gaufres mais j'ai pris une glace car elles avaient l'air plus appétissant. Le décor est très joli, dommage qu'il n'y a pas plus de places pour se poser. Pour le prix de la gaufre (nature!)vous payez toutes les matières premières et chaque topping vaut 50 cents ou plus, ça va au caramel fleur de sel, fraise, chocolat etc... Les glaces à l'eau ont des parfums exotiques, et bon mélange entre les saveurs. J'ai vraiment apprécié ça. Personnel sympa."}
{"text":"LAPOP has a cool concept of waffle pops dipped in chocolate with toppings. I saw this in old Montreal and was intrigued to try - but I didn't want something too heavy...luckily they had these adorable ice pops. 

The shop is a bit hard to find as it is on a street with lots of construction. Nonetheless I ventured my way in. 

The staff are super friendly and the store is clean and aesthetic. You'll definitely find an ig worthy spot with the interior or old Montreal streets as the background. 

They have an abundance of flavours...the most popular being mango lime and blueberry lemonade - but I was really curious to try the kiwi one. 

It was made with fresh fruit and looked absolutely delicious. Essentially it was like eating a mushed frozen kiwi with a much smoother texture. I'd definitely go back to try the other flavours!"}
