{"text":"Would concur with another reviewer - food is bland and nothing special.  Had the stir fried pork with black bean and it was underseasoned.  The fish with creme sauce came with frozen vegetables (peas, carrots, corn).  One meal was served first, and the second came about 10 min. later.  As well, the HK milk tea lacked flavour and was warm.  Wasn't worth the $22 for lunch, and will not return."}
{"text":"Another Hong Kong cafe in the Richmond Hill area, this restaurant offers your usual \"Daily\" lunch specials (available on weekends as well), and afternoon snacks. I always go for the usual Satay Beef and Vermicelli (this one comes with an egg sandwich as a bonus), which I use as a  as my benchmark for these type of restaurants, and the taste, flavour and quantity were very good. 

Overall, a solid alternative for Richmond Hill residents living in the northern part of town, and don't want to drive down to Bayview and Hwy 7 for Ocean's Seafood Restaurant or Chi Star Cafe."}
{"text":"3.5/5~ Nice Hong Kong style cafe. Interior is nice and well lit with natural lighting and tables are well spaced apart. They have the typical breakfast, lunch, and tea time deals at a very good price. I think the highest price I saw was only at $7.50!

Came here for lunch and decided to try something off their lunch specials. I ordered their shrimp wonton noodle soup and my friend ordered the beef brisket and tendon noodle soup. I think they were both around $5.50 each. Our waiters were nice and friendly and food came out within 10 minutes. We were pleasantly surprised that the food wasn't overly salty and didn't have much msg. My noodle soup came with 5 juicy wontons with lots of shrimp. I also tried the beef brisket/tendon and it was nicely seasoned and not too chewy.

Would definitely recommend this place for those living up in this area looking for hk style food. Totally coming back here to try more food!"}
{"text":"One word: bland

Two words: very bland 

We've been meaning to check out this restaurant for awhile and finally came here for lunch one Saturday. We ordered: 
- baked chicken and ham with cream on spaghetti: barely baked and I had to rely on the ham for any flavour in this dish. This was ordered from the lunch specials menu, which came with a soup and drink
- laksa: it's really quite surprising that laksa could be made so flavourless. There was plenty of colour in the soup which was very deceiving 

Totally not worth a visit, and will not return."}
{"text":"Good experience.  Owner a d staff willing to listern comments and improve.  Way to go.  Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"A pretty decent Hong Kong style western/diner/comfort food.   Acceptable price point.

Convenient for Richmond Hill-ers, so they do not have to make a trek to Markham.

Decor could be improved.  It seems they took ownership of another Chinese restaurant so the floor tiles looks a bit grimy...but the food is decent/tasty.   Great service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner: Mixed grill on sizzling plate was only mediocre, the pork chop and chicken were deep fried so they were very dry. The $7.99 chinese dishes were very small but came with a bowl of rice and soup. Food wasn't bad but not the best value for a HK style cafe."}
{"text":"A HK cafe with a relaxed neighbourhood feel, serving tasty generous portions of rice, noodles, congee, sandwiches and even sizzling hot plates. Not a fancy joint but a great quick stop for some simple, hearty food."}
{"text":"I came here twice after work from the Richmond Hill  GO train station, going north on Bayview. The menu selection was decent for a HK style restaurant. I ordered a baked ketchup chicken cutlet with spaghetti and it was pretty tasty. They gave me an abundant amount of sauce and pasta which fed myself completely with some left overs for the next day. Chicken cutlet was not fried which I like (as some hk style restaurants do) and pasta 'hardness' was done just right too. What I liked the most was the fact they spend time baking it so the whole meal was very hot which I am a fan of. Service was not bad but I did come right after two tables ordering full meals so I had to wait a long time (20 minutes). My meal was $9.50 at the time of review and it didn't come with coffee/tea. If you are a fan of baked rice/spaghetti then I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"went there around 2:30pm, server with some attitude with no patient when placing order and asking questions about the menu (they only have 4 tables with customers and they have 4 servers on the floor).
\"Like\" them on FB for free upgrade iced drinks no longer available, and they still have the promotion printed on their main menu.
for their signature dish, served with a tiny end cut piece of corn and the cauliflower tasted weird and it's SOUR. did not eat that at all.  Reported to the same server, she said she would report to the owner, but of coz she didn't.....she was within the dining room area before I paid for the bill.
Don't think their business will last long.

Suggestion to the owner:
work on your food portions, and have your servers trained properly."}
{"text":"This HK-style diner was unsurprisingly quiet on a Friday morning. 

Coffee was nicely strong and was served in classic, stout cups. 

My omelette was sub-par (relative to the one I'm used to at Golden Carriage)...not enough salt and mushrooms inside the omelette were rather tasteless. 

On the other hand, the Chicken cutlet was pretty good-average. The French toast was quite good with a buttery layer in the middle and crisp outer layer."}
{"text":"Good HK style restaurant with other homey comfort food....  The baked Portuguese chicken dish was our favourite."}
{"text":"A pretty decent HK style cafe offering good value.  They have breakfast, lunch, dinner and even afternoon tea.  Good prices and the food is tasty without being salty.  Comfortable environment as well.  Considering the price vs food vs service vs environment, you have a pretty good place to eat."}
{"text":"Actually a decent HK cafe, with good quality.  Surprisingly the filet mignon ($16) was on point and they gave an assortment of veggies. And good veggies!! Several other places compensate quality for quantity where your meat might be a bit more over cooked, and you'll just get cabbage and carrots (or maybe I'm just picky). 

Service is better than typical too! 

Cons: Really the location, coming from downtown Toronto. But that can't be helped, and they're in a location that's good business for them. 

The price is decent; you're getting what you paid for. Would definitely come again... If it wasn't across the world from me ."}
{"text":"Typical Hong Kong style cafe. Interior is pleasant. Price very reasonable. Breakfast is Ok, but otherwise, the food is just so-so. Overly salty in most cases, especially Spaghetti Bolognese, which is supposed to be a tad sweet. Milk tea was really good one time, but disappointing (stale and too milky) the next...inconsistent quality."}
{"text":"I ordered two set meals for take-out today and it was ready within 10-15 minutes. I quite like their dishes. The quality of the food and the ingredients they use was good especially with the soups and the veggies. 

Will be back again!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard Hong Kong Style cafe food. The portion is generous for $7.99 \"set meal\"; you can choose many choices of dish and come with rice and drink. Taste is on the good side.

Sizzling hot pan dish is okay; portion is big but the meat quality is okay.

Service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"Golden Sunrise Kitchen is a typical Hong Kong Style Cafe. But it is quite a welcome additional in this neighbourhood. Good if you don't feel like driving down to Hwy 7 or 16th for your cheap Hong Kong Style Western food fix.

Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon Tea and Dinner Set Specials available. (opens 8 am for breakfast)

Lunch is from $5.99 which is quite a good deal. My Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50) has a spicy kick and so was my borscht soup.

There is also an all day special if you want to have a made to order stir fried dish for $7.99 which includes soup and rice but no drinks.

Like them on Facebook for free upgrade to a cold drink which cost 75 cents. They even have an online menu and twitter, instagram and foursquare account?!

Breakfast and Afternoon Tea menu looks promising. I would be back for those."}
{"text":"Golden Sunrise Kitchen is pretty alright for lunch.  The menu is full of items that are meal-for-one.  You don't have to rely on the lunch special menu.  They use the same menu for dinner.  It feels a little strange if you want to eat dinner in a communal style.  For example, if you are a party of four, and you order one dish per person, each dish comes with a bowl of rice, as if each party order a meal-for-one for dinner.  We worked around the menu by ordering 3 meal-for-one, and the fourth person ordered a bowl of rice only.  We shared the 3 entrees, and each of us had a bowl of rice.  It worked out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great value on good Chinese food this is the place for you.  I go here often for there combos.  For about 6$, you get a really good bowl of noodles, eggs or egg sandwich, and a drink.  Pretty good value IMO.   I usually go here for breakfast or lunch."}
