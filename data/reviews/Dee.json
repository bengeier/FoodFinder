{"text":"Had lunch today- both dishes were excellent. Staff were friendly and helpful, and knew their dishes and menu well. They have a new dinner menu and are currently trying a soft opening lunch menu which is great. Great addition to neighbourhood"}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch one Saturday. We had read a review saying that the decor was beautiful, and it was indeed. The wall decor featured vividly colored art by a Thai artist, and the tables were fashioned from old sewing machines. Although we didn't have any drinks, the bar looked well-stocked and very inviting. So, a very good first impression.

The ultimate impression, of course, comes down to how good the food is, and we were not disappointed. The appetizers all sounded good, based on the menu descriptions, so we did the only logical thing: we had a combination of four of the appetizer dishes. We chose the curry puffs, spring rolls, deep fried shrimps wrapped in crispy noodles, and Tom Yum fried cheese. Everything was very tasty, and the portions were such that you could almost get away with just eating the appetizers.

It was the main dish that really shone, though: we shared an order of Dee's Pad Thai, which consisted of succulent noodles, perfectly flavoured (meaning, for me, that it had that subtle blend of sweet, savory, and sour), with (per our choice) battered tiger prawns served beside the noodles. Chopped green mangos were also on the plate, providing a welcome palate cleanser between forkfuls of the delicious pad thai. And, although some of the them had gone a little soft due to proximity to the hot noodles, the shrimp chips that were also served provided a nice plus to the dish. (There is apparently another lower-priced version of the pad thai on the menu, perhaps less fancy and with less sides, but probably just as good.)

My wife quickly formed the opinion that this was the best pad thai in town. I could not disagree. Of course, I prefer to live in a world (and a city) where there is more than one \"best\" pad thai offering. So I would say that Dee's Pad Thai is definitely *one* of the best pad thais I've eaten in Toronto. (There are two others, but that's another story for another day.)  

We were told by our server that the main figure in the artwork is a goddess. We found this most appropriate because we certainly found the food godly and will be returning to petition for more of these blessings."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was very delicious and very filling. The Papaya Salad is also very good too!"}
{"text":"First off I would come here again, but I think they need to figure out a few things. First off the Khao Soi has a small portion of dry noodles. I thought it was nothing special, and was surprised to see fresh cut up chilli and onion instead of those being cooked into the broth. The Zohar Thai looked great with Jumbo Shrimp. Outdoor tables should always be wiped down first before Menus are put down. Overall I wish Them luck and will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"If you are looking for premium authentic Thai food... Here is your gem spot. Love it!! Chicken Fried Rice is the simply best. Khai jiao Grob Moo Krapao is superb. \"It is all good\" like its name, Dee."}
{"text":"My husband and I were regulars at Lil Baci and were most disappointed when it closed. We live in the area and were excited to see something new in its place. We were put off by Dee's garish and tacky decor but decided to give it a try. The server was lovely - she was bubbly and helpful when we asked for some suggestions with the menu. She shared what she liked and the \"most popular\" items.  We opted to let her and the chef choose for us and surprise us (we often do that).  The food was a huge let down. We were told the restaurant had been around for a number of years but changed locations. I can't imagine how. 
We had: 
GOONG SARONG - Deep fried marinated shrimps wrapped in crispy rice noodles served with sweet chili sauce (gross appearance and just tasted greasy); 
YUM MAMUANG - Mango and strawberry salad with red bell peppers, green onions and cashew nuts (it was really just a plate of mango); 
JIM JAEW  - grilled steak (chewy and over-cooked, low quality steak); 
Battered prawns - our most disappointing dish - they were battered but still in their shell!!!! We bit into them and ended up with a mouth full of prawn shell;
Pad thai - normally one of our favourite dishes, Dee's is food court quality at best. As an aside, Queen Mother on Queen Street West is perhaps the best in the city.

Sub-par for this neighbourhood. If you want Thai, save yourself some $$$ and go to a food court. If you want quality food in the area visit Noorden, Little Sister, Five Doors North, La Vecchia."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Ordered the pad thai and fried rice with chicken. Food was favourful. Service was excellent and attentive. Looking forward to coming back very soon. Great addition to the Davisville neighborhood."}
{"text":"\"I don't think I've ever paid $21 for Pad Thai before.\"

Those were the exact words out of my mouth after glancing at the price for Dee's Pad Thai during a recent trip to the eponymous eatery. But was it worth it?

Not really, unfortunately.

We arrived at around 6:00 on a Thursday and the place was sparsely populated. The restaurant had just opened the week before, so our waiter wasn't exactly super polished but he did seem to be trying his best. (I'd be very surprised if this wasn't his first gig waiting tables.)

We decided to start with the Popiah Tod (\"Vegetable Spring Rolls served with sweet chili sauce\"). They arrived to the table piping hot and they're fine. There were no bold flavors here that really stood out, but I enjoyed eating it and the accompanying sweet chili sauce is pretty tasty.

For my main, I obviously went with Dee's Pad Thai (\"Signature Pad Thai noodles with lightly battered prawns, crispy wontons, shrimp chips, cashew nuts, green mango, bean sprouts, dried shrimps, crispy shallots and chopped omelette.\")

I've eaten a *lot* of Pad Thai in my days and this one would rank somewhere squarely in the middle. It's far from the worst I've ever had, but it also doesn't hold a candle to the offerings at Pai and Khao San Road or even Salad King, for example. It is, at least, not as sweet as certain variations of Pad Thai tend to get, but there's just nothing here that blew me away. And the decision to place the various accompaniments on the side didn't really work, as far as I'm concerned. And the whole cashews are just weird, since you can't pierce them with your fork. I kind of just ate them separately with my hands as a snack.

(Adding insult to injury, the dish arrived to the table practically room temperature. I guess it was just sitting around while my dining companion's dish was being prepared.)

(As a second side note, I want to mention that my dining companion's curry dish cost $24. $24! These prices are out of control, especially given the quality of the food.)"}
{"text":"Delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly and I need to get the recipe for the tofu that was in the dee salad. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner here last week, and we really enjoyed ourselves.  I had the Spring Rolls, which were lovely, while my wife had the Mango Salad (could have been a bit more mango).  We shared the Pad Thai and the Panang Curry.  Both were very enjoyable.  Portions were generous.
Service was good, and we felt everyone there wanted to please.
The d√©cor is wonderful and the ambience is bright and cheery.
We will definitely go back.
I am sympathetic to those who lament the closing of Lil Baci.  However, I'm lamenting Lil Baci at its peak, not in its final months.  The area needs a Thai place; there are still a few Italian places around."}
{"text":"FOOD: I haven't tried enough dishes at Dee to have a conclusive opinion, but what I've tried so far has been tasty. I'd like to try their Pad Thai and Kao Soi to get a better idea of the overall quality of their food. So far, I'd rate my experience as ok at 3/5 stars.

SERVICE: Exceptional and friendly service. 10/10.

AMBIANCE: While I'm no fan of their design decisions when it comes to the interior design, the atmosphere in the restaurant itself is nice. It feels spacious enough even for larger groups of 4-6 people.

Overall, Dee is a great addition to the neighbourhood. I'm sure lots of nearby residents will appreciate having a Thai place nearby. I hope Dee stays in business long enough to establish itself as a neighbourhood staple."}
