{"text":"My sister and I discovered this gem of a place and felt like family upon entering.  The chef and crew welcomed us and the chef even gave us pointers on preparing eggplant and bok choy.  The food was heaven and we plan on returning again and again!"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a quick bite to eat, reasonably priced. Frank the owner is a super nice guy. Will def be back here again!"}
{"text":"Found recently. Been twice. Very cozy atmosphere, clean cooking area, open design is nice. Friendly people and traditional service feels special. Good food, good size portion for money. Egg soup flavor rich and good thickness. Lettuce wraps wonderful. No skimping on meat in any dishes.  Wontons firm in soup not all mushy.  So happy."}
{"text":"Would of MAYBE been OK if I actually got the right item(salt & pepper pork chops). It is definitely my fault for not checking. Oh well...learned lesson...the Hong Kong Noodles were just \"meh\"...will not return..enough said..."}
{"text":"I've tried a few of them and I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in Aliante. The place opened recently and seems to be consistently busy, which is what I look for before trying a new place out. The quality of the food is much better than most other chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Las Vegas and haven't found a good Chinese restaurant that we liked.  I saw this on Yelp and thought we'd give it a try.  I am confident that we have found one now.    I didn't see the family combos on the menu until after we ordered and we ordered too much but everything is amazing and we have enough leftovers for a couple of meals.     The food was freshly prepared and each item was brought to our table as soon as it came out of the wok and it smelled and tasted fabulous.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my hubby. Ordered the orange chicken, sweet n sour chicken, hot and sour soup and egg flower soup. We enjoyed it all. Owner Frank was very attentive. Kitchen is open to view so you can see them prepare yiur food. Will most definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We order takeout from here about once a month.  They are super fast and they're very friendly.  Food always tastes good and it's always hot. I live in Aliante and it's nice to have some good options for Asian food."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great option to add to the list."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I called late (30 minutes before closing) for take out and they were very happy to take the order. Everything was excellent (wor won, house fried rice, egg rolls, orange chicken and string bean beef). Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is my next favorite Chinese spot!  They are friendly and the food is delicious! My favorite is the orange chicken.  The lunch special is very affordable!"}
{"text":"Great service, & awesome food! They exceeded my wife & I's expectations. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went on the first month they open , I was so excited to try their food right after work but when we got their the lady gave as really bad costumer service I asked her what does she recommend and she said \"well theirs  the manu \" with  stank ass attitude like we were bugging her. Literally our appetite was gone with such a bad  costumer service"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times.  The first time we ordered the family B meal with Mongolian beef and general tso chicken, house fried rice and combination chow Meir. The second time we picked up some orange chicken, and shrimp Kung pao and fun chow. The food here is delicious.  So much better than China a gogo or any other Chinese food around.  The staff is so friendly too.   My favorite so far is the orange chicken and the fun chow!"}
{"text":"I had the chow mein combo which had good flavor and big portions. Just a little too greasy nd by the time I got to the bottom there was a little puddle of Grease. If it wasn't for that it probably would have gotten a four-star."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food, my wife and kids can take it or leave it, they aren't jumping for joy when we get it but they don't complain either. Let me begin by telling you, Gourmet China Bistro was a hit for dinner tonight. We usually order from another Chinese food restaurant here in Aliante and my wife read about Gourmet China Bistro on the nextdoor app. She further researched it on Yelp and considering the great reviews we decided to give it a try.  The gentleman who took our order over the phone was pleasant and easy to communicate with. However, unbelievably, he told me my pickup order would be ready in 4 minutes... Yes, you read that correctly, 4-minutes. Living right around the corner I made my way to the restaurant right away. Sure enough it was ready when I arrived.  The inside of the restaurant is on the smaller side with only 3-4 tables, but it has a very nice and cozy inviting feel to it. Most importantly it is very clean and the entire kitchen is easily visible from the customer area.  The gentleman working the counter greeted me and assisted in completing my transaction. I like that he took the time to go over my order with me to make sure I had all of my items.  The entire time I was in the restaurant he was very nice, complimentary and made me feel at home. He did ask if we'd heard about them on Yelp and I explained that we had researched them on Yelp which was the determining factor in ordering from them. However, I confessed that we had originally intended to order from the other Chinese restaurant since they have always been our go to place. He responded with \"Well that's okay because you'll be back to see us. You'll see that our quality exceeds theres\" and boy was he right! Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Wow! I am blown away, our food was on time and this place is amazing!!! I got the orange chicken and fried rice with potstickers. So flavorful and delicious !"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazingly good, but we find it ironic that the dish they touted as the best was the worst of what we got. It took us a couple of days to eat all of the food but we tested it all right away.  We went mid week in mid afternoon, so we were the only customers. We got our order to go, despite the availability of tables. I noticed that they have enough table space for 14 people but only 12 chairs.  The restaurant was clean and the gal at the counter was friendly. She gave Hubby a packet with 2 almond cookies on the house, which was nice of her.  We order 2 appetizers, Cream Cheese Rangoons and Pot Stickers. We both ordered a cup of Hot & Sour Soup. Our entrees were their much-touted Orange Chicken plus Mongolian Beef with medium spiciness. Hubby also added Honey Fried Bananas after I pointed them out on the menu, I knew he would want that!  Rangoons: Okay on their own but fantastic with their sweet & sour sauce. The sauce actually has a bit of tang to it which separates it from the rest.  Pot Stickers: Okay on their own but fantastic with their dipping sauce. Next time we'll ask for an extra sauce, the one included was too small and we wanted more.  Hot & Sour Soup: We both loved it. The cup of soup is a huge size but we both finished off every drop.  Orange Chicken: Not good at all. It wasn't fresh, all we got was stale fried chicken & chewy yuckiness. This dish went into the trash, very disappointing.   Mongolian Beef: Excellent! Tasted fresh and flavorful, and the meat was cut well with no fat or gristle found. Medium was just the right level of spice, any more and it would have overwhelmed the great flavors of this dish.  Honey Fried Banana: Tasty, tasted lighter and fresher than I expected with the banana starring instead of just pure sugar.  We will definitely eat here again, but I doubt if I'll ever order their \"Best in Town\" Orange Chicken again."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and I've been trying to find good Chinese food. This will definitely be our new go to! The food was super fresh (had it delivered) and good. We had egg rolls, chow mein, orange chicken, fried rice, and sesame chicken. The meat was on point, for ratio of meat to breading, too. Most places these days, you get a bunch of breading and a tiny piece of meat. Not here. Can't wait to try some more!!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very often, but I've been so impressed with the quality of the food at this restaurant that I felt obligated to leave a review. I tried their Kung Pao Chicken and Honey Walnut Shrimp and they both tasted amazing. I feel like I was getting top restaurant food for a take-out price. This is definitely mine and my family favorite new Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little place. Ordered the family meal B. My girls enjoyed the eggs rolls. The wonton soup was good tasty broth. Ordered the orange chicken, it was really good, very fresh tasting.  The shrimp and vegetables was delicious. The combination fried rice was on point too. This will be our new go to Chinese place."}
{"text":"The chicken lettuce wraps are delicious! We ordered delivery for our first time and they were very nice to place the order with and delivery was fast. We ordered the orange chicken, chicken lettuce wraps, house fun chow, Mongolian beef mild spicy, and veggie fried rice. All were delicious. They even threw in a couple veggie egg rolls. The lettuce wraps were everyone's favorite and the portions were BIG! Price was good and everyone was happy! We will be back for the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"This may have been the fastest delivery I have ever received. Food was hot when delivered, tasted great and the portions are very large!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. Everything I've tasted there has been wonderful and delicious.Extra attentive staff. Fresh food. Give it a try. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"I have been here since the 1st week they opened... I've  had a few different itmes on thier menu and have yet to be disappointed.  I have to say the orange chicken has been better than china a go go and panda express.  Its so much more flavorful and the chickwn chunks are meatier, less breading. The won ton soup has plenty of won tons.  Kung pao chicken is super delicious.  Thier chicken curry is definitely one of my faves. Chicken chow mein is way more yummier also. Salt and pepper pork chops were a bit hit ! I hope it stays here ,its close to home.  The owner is always super nice and the employees too ."}
{"text":"Place was awesome. I believe everything I ordered was made from scratch. It was so fresh & you can really tell the difference. Mongolian beef was delicious so was the orange chicken, still crispy with the sauce drenched on it. The best part was the salt n pepper chicken wings, so crispy and seasoned perfectly. Big wings too! Go there and see for yourself. Frank the ownet is a great guy. Who knew he is a famous chef in town. Glad to see he's got his own thing going now. Been looking for a great Chinese spot ever since the owners of China Doll(Diane &Allen) retired a few years back. Found it!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to try out the new restaurant since we live in the area.  We were pleasantly pleased with the quality of the food.  The orange chicken and honey walnut prawns are very tasty.  We will definitely be back to try their other culinary delights."}
{"text":"Today we found out our favorite Chinese restaurant had closed. We went on a search for a new \"home\". After some digging we decided on Gourmet China Bistro. The staff is very friendly. Took our order and had us seated with our soups in no time. Food followed shortly after. The Mongolian Beef was great. Vegetables were crisp and fresh. Generals Chicken had a great sauce and the chicken was very good. No funky gristle. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"First of all, this is not really a restaurant. Rather it is a take out place with four or five tables so that one can eat in.   What I like about this place is that the food is delicious, pricing is right and portions are large. One of the key ingredients to be a good Chinese take out place is that the veggies must be fresh, e.g. no wilted veggies; food must be hot, not luke warm; little or no msg; little oil so that the food is not greasy. This place has accomplished all of that.   If you do eat in, the wait staff is courteous and serves you well. But do not quite expect this place to be a five star restaurant, afterall it is a take out place.   My wife and I have been there many times. Especially recommended are Orange Chicken, Kung Pao Shrimp ( Large shrimp ) or Chicken; Pork Fried Rice ( one of the best I have encountered in Vegas) , Beef Chow Fun, Chow Mein Hong Kong Style . Fried cream cheese wonton is one of the best as well.   Strongly recommend this place. This is not a five star restaurant, But for the price and quality and portions, it is a super great place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Great takeout chinese food. Very flavorful and cheap, fast, and very convenient! This will be our new chinese food spot for a long time."}
{"text":"Since I moved to this area, I had been looking for a new Chinese food spot. I looked to Yelp and found exactly what I needed. The staff is very welcoming and the food is amazing! I try to make myself try something new every time and I have not had a bad dish yet."}
{"text":"Been to this wonderful restaurant about 4 times. They only have 4 tables. It's a small establishment. The food is great and so is the service! I am impressed by the freshness of the food and the taste. This has become my main Chinese restaurant. The potstickers, egg rolls, and rangoons are made fresh. I will be coming back over and over! The owner is a very friendly man. Thumbs up to this place!"}
{"text":"This place has the best orange chicken combo in town. I come here for lunch all the time and the quality is constantly amazing. My friend was in town for the weekend and we came by for lunch and this is now his new favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Their homemade hot sauce is fire as well. It's a great spot for lunch or take out. Seriously though their orange chicken is incredible."}
{"text":"Small location only 4 tables I believe it is designed more for take out pretty warm inside. We had their lunch specials, chicken chow mein and orange chicken both were served fresh and hot with great flavors. We will definitely return. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Delivery driver picks nose while handling food the ribs it on a house. Gross! Be careful about who you order from."}
{"text":"I love this place. Honestly some of the best Chinese dishes I have had in a long time. My wife and I have tried a few different dishes. Recently she tried the chicken Chow main she thought the taste was on point and so did I, however the noodles were a little too cooked for our liking. However I bought my favorite dish their Mongolian Chicken and it NEVER FAILS to amaze me. I also suggest their Chicken fried rice, orange chicken, and wontons!"}
{"text":"Food is so good! Always fast, have never messed up an order. Staff is so helpful and welcoming! My personal favorite items are their wonton soup, dumplings, orange chicken and fried rice. The are very close to my home as well so I do not mind calling a head to go pick it up at the store."}
{"text":"Just open few days ago. Had lunch with my family.  A 5 star chinese restaurant.  The owner Frank  is a very famous chef in Las Vegas.  Very delicious food. Will go back  all the time."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Vegas. Place is very and staff is friendly. Frank , the owner, is awesome"}
{"text":"BEST Chinese I've ever had. Always served hot, fresh AND fast. Would recommend their spicy chicken chow mein"}
{"text":"Ordered online through Yelp because of the claims of having the best orange chicken. We were given a 45-60 minute delivery window and it arrived within 30 minutes. The food was piping hot. We got the family meal A with orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, bbq pork fried rice, and the corn flower egg soup. We also subbed the egg rolls to get four cream cheese wontons instead. After our order went in, they actually called us and confirmed our selections which was awesome. The cream cheese wontons were fried perfectly and weren't overly cooked like many places do. The sweet and sour chicken was delicious and my husband agreed that the orange chicken was definitely delicious. The real star was the pork fried rice. My husband and I have been looking for the perfect fried rice for quite some time and I think we finally found it! It was super flavorful with lots of filling. The egg soup was delicious as well. We will definitely be ordering from them again-delicious food and super fast delivery!"}
{"text":"This rating isn't about the food... food is the best in NLV.   It's about the horrible and rude customer service we just received while trying to place a delivery order over the phone.  The woman was inpatient and extremely short and rude!!!!  This is the reason we WILL NOT BE coming back to this restaurant.  You need to hire people that are patient and love their job."}
{"text":"Food was great . People were awesome . Nice and clean environment .  Price is pretty fare . Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Finding this really good Chinese take-out was great. Authentic Chinese food cooked by authentic Chinese chefs. Took my order straight away and the chef went to work. You can see how all the meals are cooked on the Wok. I ordered the orange chicken and the portion was excellent for the price. Even included rice and sauce with the entree. Great take out restaurant."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time I ordered from this place. The owner Frank was very busy with orders but still took time to chat with me. I sat and waited patiently for my food. He apologized for my wait and upon leaving, he gave me free soup and almond cookies. The BBQ pork fried rice was delicious and our Hong Kong pan fried noodles were the best! I will be definitely eating there again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Tastes soooooooo good. Great prices! So glad they just opened by my house   I RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"The best. Customer service and the food. Just fantastic. I have tried a bunch of chinese  restaurants since our  move to the Las Vegas area and this place is now my favorite. It's close to our house in North Las Vegas so that makes it nice, but finding this via Yelp was absolutely amazing.  Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went again after a cold evening outside and it was great! Enjoyed the Mongolian beef, I asked for it to be cooked well done and arrived having the perfect texture, not slimy. Everyone seems very friendly and welcoming. Hot and sour soup is hands down 100x better than from other local Chinese restaurants. This is now our new place to enjoy a great Chinese meal. Glad they are here, welcome to the neighborhood GCB."}
{"text":"Finally some great Chinese food around Aliante!  Excellent customer service and food was fantastic.  Restaurant is clean and ordering takeout was easy and fast.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a decent Chinese takeout place for 4 years. This place beyond pleasantly surprised us. The best takeout we've found by far. Super clean restaurant. Great staff. Really helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the customer service is the best! The cashier hooked us up with a free side of noodles and shrimp since it was our first time. The food is honestly the best that I've EVER HAD!  It's really good gourmet style food. You can taste the original home made Taste. None of that Panda Express B-Shit!"}
{"text":"AAAAAAMAZING FOOD!!!!! Finally found a great Chinese restaurant to order takeout from. They delivered quick and the food was spectacular. I moved to Vegas 3 years ago and have been on the search for good Chinese food and so thrilled I finally found it. The owner even called after delivery to see if the food had met our expectations and thanked us for our order. What restaurant does that nowadays? We will be ordering again from them."}
{"text":"Average at best. Sent back the eggplant which was not sweet, garlicky or spicy like at other restaurants. It was stir fried with no sauce, the hot and sour soup was very hot  and had an after taste..not good. The chow fun was fair. The general tso shrimp was pretty good as was the moo shu chicken. It was not greasy as in many other restaurants. The egg drop soup was poor. I will not return."}
{"text":"This place says they have the best orange chicken. First bite was amazing! I must agree with them."}
{"text":"I was very curious with their signage that says \"The Best Orange Chicken In Town\" so we came in expecting it but it wasn't all that. The Orange Chicken was very meaty which is good but I like my Orange Chicken crunchy. My son did not like his Orange Chicken. We also tried sweet & sour chicken and that was very disappointing. The chicken was hard and it had a smell to it."}
{"text":"Upon walking in to pick up my order I was greeted by the owner Frank.  It's a small restaurant with around 4 tables and you can see the food being prepared.   The food tasted fresh with good flavors.  We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"The packaging of the food was nice, but there was a bunch of flavor missing. I will be going back to China a go go."}
{"text":"First time coming to this new restaurant and it's very clean and made fresh to order. The staff was very polite and immediately helped me with my order. I'll definitely be coming back to try some different items."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was so good. When you order take out online it says 45-60 minutes but it only took 20 minutes. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Fresh, hot, super friendly staff, and tasty. When I want Chinese food this is on the top of my list. Portion size is good for the price."}
{"text":"It was ok. Not very flavorful. Out of chicken egg rolls. Hunan beef had no taste. Chow mien was alright. Probably will not go there again."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out. They do have a sign that say \"best orange chicken\" but based on other reviews we decided to order something else. We got family dinner B. General tso chicken and I forget the name of the other. We also ordered a noodle dish and thank God we did because the portions on the family dinner was barely enough for our family of 4. The food was ok but nothing spectacular. The place itself was nice and clean and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great place...we were looking for some awesome Chinese food in our neighborhood. The prior reviews didn't let us down. I'm very funny about egg foo young. I was nicely surprised. Found our new spot."}
{"text":"Above basic Chinese food. The all white meat orange chicken is good. Would recommend for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Vegas!!! Salt and pepper pork chops are to die for! Great orange chicken. Owner very very nice!!! Def going back!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place but I'll never order again. I ordered sweet-and-sour chicken with the sauce on the side like always. my chicken is burnt the sweet-and-sour sauce is like water I was told my delivery would be 35 minutes, it was over an hour!  A simple courtesy call that you guys were running late would've been great..."}
{"text":"This place was ok. The service was just ok. Went in the person behind the register did not greet me or acknowledged me at all. The owner/ cook was sitting at the table writing and saw that I was not being serviced and came over to help. I asked for spicy general Tao chicken but there was no spice at all. Orange chicken is good but not the best. The sauce is to dry and thick. The fried rice is very good. Egg rolls are plain. Plus they charged me extra for fried rice and I was told there was no charge to substitute it for white rice. Good chow mein. Not sure if I'll be back or not."}
{"text":"Great little Chinese lunch special spot! So far I've had the beef and broccoli, chicken and broccoli, and the orange chicken. All were pretty good but all on the sweeter side for taste. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl and we found a string of metal!!!!!! Not only it tasted bleh... but metal? C'mon!"}
{"text":"Again, Love this place. Very friendly staff. This time I'm getting just Hot and Sour soup. My wife loves this soup when she's sick. So they went out of their way to make the soup a little more spicy when I told them how much my wife loves the soup.  Really, Really, listen anyone willing to go out of the way to do that is awesome.  Go check this place out and enjoy."}
{"text":"Yum! My husband was craving Chinese and I was craving something new. I looked on Yelp and here we are. We ordered Family dinner B. The hot and sour soup was outstanding! I usually don't eat it, but this one was not too vinegary and had a nice sneaky heat. They bring it out in a large bowl piping hot and serve it to you. Nice touch, two of the 3 of us had 2 bowls and there was still some left! The egg rolls were crunchy with a nice veggie to meat ratio. House fried rice was full of shrimp, chicken and bbq pork! Shrimp egg foo young was amazing! Orange chicken was just that, fresh orange flavor! Mongolian beef was tender and full of veggies, just wish we would have ordered it hotter than medium. The staff was very friendly and prompt. They will need to find a bigger place soon as there were only 4 tables! We took home a menu for delivery and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"As advertised. The BEST orange chicken! They have the best shrimp also. I highly recommend the Honey Walnut Shrimp"}
{"text":"Food was really good. They claim to have the best orange chicken in Vegas. I gotta say it's good and tastes home made. They may have the best.. See for yourself"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese food I've had since moving to Las Vegas 7 years ago.  Super friendly and great service.  Orange chicken is by far the best I've ever had!! Pork fried rice, chow main, Mongolian beef ALL GOOD! Great portions."}
{"text":"I love Love Chinese food. New to Vegas from Los Angeles and decided to try this spot out, not to far from my place... food was very good, just honestly wish the environment wasn't so hostile. The entire time the waitress only checked up on my sister and I once. While everyone else was checked on numerous times. The waiter wasn't friendly and seemed to be bothered? Then another waiter was continuously looking at us? Which made me so UNCOMFORTABLE I didn't even want to finish my food. When we finally decided to leave, we totally threw away our receipt by accident. The waiter approached us so rudely. As if we had done something so wrong. HORRIBLE customer service. Never will get my service again. Actions speak louder than words. Body language says a lot."}
