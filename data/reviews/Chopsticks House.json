{"text":"Had a Taiwan beef noodle soup and it was good. What I enjoyed most was the clean and quiet environment and the friendly and pleasant stuff. You felt like you were at a friend's kitchen."}
{"text":"Went with the whole family. The oyster pancake was amazing and so was the three cup chicken. Really good portions and the decorations were pleasant and clean."}
{"text":"This Taiwanese food place opened up not that long ago -- if you don't read chinese and you haven't looked at the menu, you'd have no idea that Taiwanese food is their specialty! I lived in Taiwan for half my life so with this so close to where I live, i had to give it a try. Overall thoughts: pretty good.  The interior is really nicely done -- way more well-decorated than when it was magic oven. The people who work there were very attentive and friendly, and they refilled our tea constantly. They have many Taiwanese dishes that I was so excited about! We tried the oyster omelette, salt & pepper chicken, sticky meatball, and sliced beef shank ox tongue stomach (long name!). They were all quite good.   My favourite was probably the salt & pepper chicken. It was nicely flavoured, and tasted a lot like home. It probably needed a bit more white pepper though -- i think a fellow yelper mentioned you can ask them for it.   The sliced beef thing was good too. I don't recall ever ordering this while I lived in Taiwan, but it definitely tastes like something from home -- recommended! it is a bit spicy but it has great flavours.   The oyster omelette wasn't entirely like the ones i'm used to having in Taiwan. There's a bit too much egg and it's a little too cooked/crispy on the edges. Every place makes it differently though, so i wouldn't call it entirely inauthentic. The sauce on top tastes the same as the ones i've had. They use a different vegetable at the bottom, and I liked it because i'm not a big fan of the kind that is usually used. For me, this dish is an okay, not a must-try for a fellow Taiwanese, but for someone curious about Taiwanese cuisine, it's a must-try.   Finally, the meatball was a bit of a disappointment. The flavours were right for the most part, but it was a bit dry. The sticky part was too thick and there wasn't enough meat inside. In Taiwan, I often see them sold in bowls and drenched in sauce, but here it was served on a plate with sauce drizzled on. It's not bad, but I was a bit disappointed.   Overall -- definitely a good place to try if you're craving some Taiwanese food! They also have the usual chinese food staples there, but I didn't try any.   Final note: there's no stinky tofu!! :( :( :( :("}
{"text":"Fast, attentive, polite and very knowledgeable service. The food came quickly and was delicious and authentic for cheap!"}
{"text":"As a Taiwanese, I have to say this is NOT a place for authentic Taiwanese food. If you're looking for a place for quick lunch or dinner, this place is a good option. But don't come for Taiwanese food. It's definitely NOT their specialty."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chopsticks House since August 2017 and they have been consistently good. Lots of great noodle options and even the best Pad Thai I have had.      The real treat was when we discovered their takeout discount and the quality of the takeout. Getting takeout from here is not only fast, but gives you an equal dining experience to dining in. They do not skimp on any of the components of your dish, if you are getting noodles they will keep the noodles and soup in separate containers.       Totally recommend this place to anyone who enjoys both traditional and Western style Chinese food, but in particular the noodle dishes are stellar."}
{"text":"Great family dishes! Definitely a hidden gem in the busy street of Yonge. San Pei Chicken is awesome! The traditional meat ball is interesting as well, mushroom, bamboo shoots and meat covered in sticky rice dough, way beyond imagination. If you'd concern about healthy choices, don't miss out the seafood fried brown rice with beans."}
{"text":"How does this place have 4 stars? I ordered the oyster pancake, chicken stir fry and the black pepper beef. The food was extremely low quality, nothing tasted fresh. He pancake had unmixed balls of dough and foul-tasting oysters. The chicken and beef tasted expired. Ended up throwing everything out because it was that nasty. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"I basically came here to sample their oyster pancake. If you're Taiwanese you will understand why this is like the holy grail of Taiwanese dishes.  Chopstick serves their oyster pancake on a small bed of stir fried greens and then covers it with a sweet & sour like sauce. Ok I'm not Taiwanese but I don't think the sauce is authentic and did not go well with the oyster pancake at all. The pancake had only 3-4 small oysters but the sauce actually ruined it for me completely. Maybe someone who's had real Taiwanese oyster pancake can comment. Sorry not very impressed.  On my second visit I tried their shredded pork, veg & shrimp noodle soup.  On the menu it states a choice of ramen or udon.  I asked for ramen but when the dish arrived, it was udon.  I had a feeling this might happen because the young server seem very inexperienced and new to Canada. Oh well, it might be okay, so I sucked it up like a buttercup.    My first impression was it looked appetizing but the taste was bland.  I had to season the broth more with soya sauce (that is never a good sign), the shrimp was not fresh but was a good size and the udon tasted like the ones you buy at the grocery.  To top it off I was waving my hand in the air like a crazy person to get my water glass filled each time. And it wasn't even a water glass, it was those small cups you serve tea in.  Why can't they just give me a large water glass like a normal restaurant.  Yah I'm done...totally done with them!"}
{"text":"We had a quick lunch at this place after discovering it on yelp.  Service was quick and friendly.  We ordered Oyster Pancakes, Salt and Pepper Chicken and Taiwanese style vermicelli.  They were all soooo good and had more than enough food!  Flavour is authentic."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant while walking down wellesley. They started doing a pre-opening today so things may change between now and official opening, so this review only considers the food I had and the service.  It is advertised as a restaurant featuring Taiwanese-style dishes, which is something the downtown area lacks, so this is a welcome addition.  They have a number of different items on the menu, with a set of taiwanese speciality items.  The owner recommended the oyster pancake (oyster omelette). For $6.95, the size is pretty good for a standalone meal. Comes with a good number of oysters and sauce (too much sauce for pictures though), along with a bed of A-choy vegetables underneath. Pancake has a slightly glutenous texture which is pretty interesting in the mouth. Not too greasy either.  Also got to sample a couple taiwanese sausages and taiwanese tempura, and both had good flavor.  Would definitely return to see how the restaurant goes."}
{"text":"Order take out at this place and it says in Chinese they serve Taiwanese food. After I see the menu not much like Taiwanese food on the menu. So I ordered a stir fry noodles for lunch. The item is ok when u put some hot sauce with it if not it won't have much taste. Also, very careless thing is that I found a metal thing in my noodles so I'm worry to finish my noodles I gotta throw it all away. They gotta be very careful and clean. Not really a recommended place to go to."}
{"text":"Was horribly disappointed after getting take out from this place. Yes they offer discount, but the food quality and taste is extremely average at best. There are better options available in the area for chinese food. Worst of all? They claim to be a Taiwanese restaurant but the waitress haven't even heard of the iconic Taiwanese beef noodle soup?"}
{"text":"I live close by, and in the last few years I've seen 2 restaurants come and go on the exact same location. The first one was Magic Oven- a pizza place that never really see much crowd. Magic Oven officially closed shop about a year ago, then a Thai place came in around spring this year (My memory is not very good as I never paid attention to this space till now). I went to the Thai place one time and vowed to never go back again. So when Chopsticks House opened, I was not too optimistic. Perhaps the Fung Shui is not so good at this location or something.   I walked by this place almost daily, not paying much attention, then one day the light came on- It was their opening day. I almost missed it but there it was, on the menu was a list of Taiwanese food. The variety they offer are not just the regular fare you see in bubble tea houses, they have so much more.  I went in, and the servers have very obvious mainland accents.... They are not Taiwanese...hm... I wonder if the food is going to be authentic? The staff told me that the chef has 20 + year experience from New York.   I tried the oyster pancake that first night. This was my favourite dish back home and Chopsticks House did not disappoint. The oysters are obviously not the same type of oysters in Taiwan but otherwise the flavour is pretty spot on.   The place had been opened for 3 weeks so far and I think I had been in at least once a week, sometimes ordering a full meal, sometimes just a side dish or 2 to accompany what I have at home.   The service is very good. The staff are always friendly and often give me an extra soup or marinated egg from time to time.   I told them that they should focus more on Taiwanese dishes so they can distinguish themselves from  Just Noodles, a restaurant nearby that offer the regular crowd pleasers like Kung Pao, Sweet and Sour. The staff told me that they are just testing the water and will likely change the menu soon once they know the market a bit better. Apparently there is some sort of Taiwanese hot pot coming out soon...  My favourite so far has been the oyster pancake, salt-pepper chicken, Sanbeiji (A special Taiwnese chicken dish) and the Taiwanese Style Sticky Meat Ball. Their combo cooked with House Special Maggi Sauce is also great.  There are 2 items on the menu that I really wanted to try but the menu said it's dine- in only. I've only ever done take outs so I was a bit disappointed. The 2 items are fried oyster and fried squid tentacles. I thought this is odd because I've had these two items from other restaurants as take outs and never had I encounter restrictions before. So I asked the staff why they are restricted for dine in only. They told me that the chef wants the customer to be able to enjoy the dish as it should be, freshly fried. He worries that the dish will lose its crispness by the time they get home. I find that it's refreshing that the chef wants to uphold a high standard for his food. Therefore I believe this restaurant will continue to serve up excellent dishes."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, especially the Taiwanese specialty dishes. Waiter was very friendly and attentive, even bringing some free soup as a starter. Food came fast as well. We had basil chicken, mixed vegetables, and a beef hotpot. Hotpot was the best, along with taiwanese meatball."}
{"text":"Great authentic Taiwanese food, top up with juicy chicken wing as snack, can't beat it"}
{"text":"Ordered the braised beef udon in soup. The soup was amazing. The beef could have been better if it's braised a bit longer. Service was great. Constantly refilling my hot tea."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit wasn't as great as the first.  The food was waaaaaaay too salty. We got the maggi sauce and it tasted like they poured the entire bottle.  The hotpot on the other hand was extremely bland but I guess they balanced in somehow.  The service continues to be great with attentiveness and courteius servers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the taiwanese food (he's taiwanese) but left a little bit disappointed. We ordered an oyster omelette, a taiwanese tempura and a stone bowl beef noodle soup to share. The portions were generous but the flavour weren't authentic...   The taiwanese tempura tasted like the frozen ones you can buy at the supermarket for your hotpot and the sauce that came with it tasted like a typical sweet sauce you'd find at any Chinese buffet. The oyster omelette on the other had had too much egg to it: a good oyster omelette should be composed in a large part of a starch/water doughy mix with some bits of eggs and oysters but this one tasted just like an omelette with oysters and some pieces of starch on the sides. The was nothing special about the noodle soup, the soup didn't stand out, the noodles were a bit over cooked to my liking and there was piece of boiled romain lettuce which I find very odd.   I must say we left quite disappointed and will likely not return."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert in Taiwanese cuisine by any means, but it comes pretty close to what I perceive as legit Taiwanese food (at least for their street-styled ones). I had the oyster pancake, sticky meat ball, and complementary sausages.   1) Oyster pancake (???)- this was actually an omelet coated in potato starch. Embedded within were pieces of oysters, and underneath was a bed of A-choy (Taiwanese lettuce). As for the sauce, it was a thicker & sweeter version of ketchup; similar to the ones in HK cafes). It complemented the omelet well and made the dish sweet & savory. And b/c of the starch, the omelet had a gooey chewiness to it.  2) Taiwanese style sticky meat ball (??)- the \"meat ball\" was a savory mixture of pork, bamboo shoots, and shiitake mushrooms. It tasted similar to the fillings of vegetable & pork buns in Chinese bakeries. Enveloping it was a translucent dough that had a gelatinous texture. And on top was the same tomato-based sauce.   3) Taiwanese sausage (??)- these were grilled & served on top of garlic slices. They were rather sweet & salty, and matched well w/ the spicy & pungent taste of garlic. The spices made it fragrant as well, and the skin had a slight crispiness. This would be a good side dish to have w/ rice or alcohol.  Overall, it's a pretty solid spot and the service was superb. They had great manners and I felt welcomed as a customer."}
{"text":"Just opened recently. Used to be a Thai restaurant. Had the Oyster omlette and basil chicken. The oyster omlette is the best I've had."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner around 7pm on New Years Eve.  Was about 30% full.  Decor looks modern.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Food started coming out around 15 minutes after ordering.  We were a group of 5 and they gave us a complimentary cucumber jelly fish dish.  I ordered the Kung Pao squid with chow mein combo which also came with veggies spring roll, sea weed and cashews.   Potions were big, tastes and textures were good. Didn't like the dried chillies which I didn't eat.  Was able to try the oyster pancake and it was really good.   Will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Ordered a bunch of appetizers with my sister today because we havent had authentic taiwanese food in a while, and we are so glad we did! All the dishes we ordered were so yum and authentic! Only suggestion I have would be to include white pepper for condiments :P I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner on Chinese New Year.  I ordered the mild Basil chicken combo $9.95. It comes with a spring roll, seaweed salad and rice.  They gave us a free corn soup since it being Chinese New Year.  It was a nice touch.  The waitress was pretty nice. The chicken & rice tasted great.  The seaweed salad was ok but it was small.  The spring roll was bland.  Will come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"My and friends walked in during Sunday lunch hours and we were the only people in the restaurant, so the ambient was very quiet.   We decided to try the pan-fried eggplants and General Tao chicken. I did like the eggplant dish a lot, but for the chicken it was a smaller potion compares to the G-chicken dish that I usually get at other places, and taste wise it was a meh.   I was able to get 10% off by showing my Chinese Scholar Student Club card if I pay cash."}
{"text":"I'm slightly confused about this place because it advertises itself as a Taiwanese place but it's got a whole mix of different kinds of food from different parts of China.  Their dishes are shareable as they're fairly large.  We had a spicy Szechuan chicken dish and it was really quite good.    Overall, I would definitely come back here to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"This place is not easy to find as it locate on a relative less busy street. But the food there is just fantastic. Most of the menu offered there is Taiwanese. By ordering combos you get a free side dish.   Food: If you are a Chinese food lover, you will love this place. The spring rolls, Oyster pancake, and Taiwanese sausage are great food to try.  Service: The couple running this restaurant are very attentive. They care about how you feel and how you love their food.  Price: around $10 will get you full  Conclusion: GO TRY IT!"}
{"text":"The food in this restaurant was clean and tasty! Also, the restaurant owner was very courteous. :)"}
{"text":"The beef noodle is ok, sliced beef& ox tail in chili sauce is below the average; but the green bean& beef with house special Maggi sauce and minced pork rice are reallllllllly yummy.   Definitely I'll go back for other Taiwan dishes."}
{"text":"I'm Taiwanese and this place is pretty legit.   I got take out which =10% discount and a free soup!   The salt and pepper fried chicken was ok, the traditional version is usually marinated in a sweeter sauce with a different type of batter but it was still good (4/5).  The 3 cup chicken (sanbeiji) was exactly how my mom makes it, and unlike most restaurants, it wasn't swimming in oil (5/5).  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great location near Wellesley station and they give 10% off for take out.   After reading fellow reviews I ordered the Taiwanese style sticky meat ball, Deep fried chicken wings, General Tao's chicken and the house special Maggi sauce with beef. To my surprise they also gave us complimentary egg soup with corn (something that made you feel like it was straight out of your mom's kitchen). We also found 2 small seaweed salads in the bag. Both mains tasted delicious and the packaging made it very organized without sauce dripping everywhere. The spring rolls were still fresh and crunchy after picking it up and bringing it home. The deep fried chicken werr tiny pieces and had good seasoning but did not stand out as being memorable.   Everyone mentioned getting the Taiwanese style sticky meat ball so I thought why not give it a try. I don't know why no one mentioned this before, but the smell of this meat ball was awful. I opened the container and felt sick. I thought maybe it would taste better than it smelled but the smell wouldn't let me enjoy the taste of it. The chewy texture wasn't a good combination with the smell. I had to eat it right away in the kitchen before my whole place smelled of this thing. I didn't enjoy it at all but if your like stinky tofu maybe you'd like this.  Despite everything, I still think the food was great and for the amount of food, it's not expensive at all. Great value, good location and fast service. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Saw the menu online and decided to try it out as not many Taiwanese Food downtown.  Ordered takeout: Maggi Sauce combo, mixed vegetables combo, salt-pepper chicken and Taiwanese meat ball.  The only thing that was tasty was the salt-pepper chicken and it was not Taiwanese style.  The rest tasted blah or bland... maybe I just tried the wrong items but don't think I will come back again..."}
