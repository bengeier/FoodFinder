{"text":"The only reason I ever go here is because people I'm affiliated with go here. That being said, my last experience ruined my mood and the mood of everyone that was with me. I was up here with a group. The one bartender who works there (her name is Lisa), has said alot of bad things about my friend and I when we first started going up there so for whatever reason, she already hated us (I'm sure she talks about everyone). So my friend and I, while minding our own business as most everybody does, kept noticing her looking at us. So after so long of this happening, she walks up to my friend out of NOWHERE, accuses her of talking about the other bartender, says if we are then she can leave, and that she didn't like the \"vibes\" from her and our group. My friend and I had to explain to the other bartender that nobody was talking about her at all. The whole thing was ridiculous. So if you go here, be careful of the \"vibes\" you give off, or Lisa will be there to harass you."}
{"text":"Stopped in here randomly to grab a little food. I was expecting a dirty dive bar, but was pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong, this place is nothing fancy, but it has a lot of local neighborhood appeal. Pretty clean, looks like the place has been updated not so long ago.

Decent food selection of typical bar/pub grub. Again, nothing unexpected, but comforting nonetheless. Decent prices. I tried some wings and a pizza. I wasn't blown away by the food, but it was tasty and filling and worth the price.

The bartender was very pleasant and her service was excellent.

If I lived in the area, I could see myself stopping in here on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Always get take out and think the pizza is some of the best. Wings are really good and love the Roman chariot sandwich, we always just get just one and split it cuz there is so much of it."}
{"text":"Kinda shocked I haven't posted earlier, but this spot is my favorite destination in their neighborhood. Great wings, reasonable prices and hands down the best pizza in the city!

The staff is super friendly and the customers aren't a bunch of troublemakers (like the other bars nearby). 

I strongly recommend it for an easygoing night out, a pizza dinner or for one of their daily specials. 

Oh...kid friendly too!"}
{"text":"Ordered a take out pizza recently and what is usually a treat wasn't this time.  Overcooked and the sausage had a funny taste.  Must just have been a bad day.  Not writing them off just yet."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in North Royalton or close by and craving wings Firehouse is my go to place and they're very generous with the sauce. The whole menu is great and cheap but you can't go wrong with pizza and wings always a party favorite thanks Firehouse."}
{"text":"This establishment isn't even worthy of one star. The place is disturbingly filthy - both bar and kitchen area. The staff is just as slow and inconsistent as the food, but also rude. The entire staff looks unkempt and disheveled - which only brings forth the realization of how terribly disgustingly dirty the Firehouse is.
I highly advise everyone to steer clear of visiting this bar. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings. Cheap beer. Food can be inconsistent. Sometimes it's really good. Sometime ok. Never bad. 

Garlic pepper wings really good."}
{"text":"We went back again and I had three friends with me. Everything was AMAZING!! We ordered 4 kinds of wings, the Asian plum was my favorite. The pierogi pizza was made to perfection this time. The French onion soup is delicious. I was very happy and this time, everyone was able to experience the anticipation built up to its fullest. Completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Great local little bar for a quick escape with my hubby. Best deal is sitting at the bar, catching the Cavs game, getting a $5 pitcher of beer and splitting a Roman Chariot...perfect thirsty Thursday dive bar stuff...and only $15!"}
{"text":"This is our new local hangout! I say that in the fashion of a cool kid, but I'm neither cool, nor a kid. 

Good food. Servers/bartenders are pleasant and attentive. Relaxed atmosphere. Tons of TVs for sports (go local sports team, beat that distant sports team!). 

Large portions (the signature sandwich portions are too large for one sitting, and that's a good thing!). Almost everything I've tried here I'd recommend. Who wouldn't love a capicola/ham/salami/pepperoni sandwich with a pizza dough crust? A damn communist, that's who! Actually I have no idea if communists would like that sandwich or not. I'd like to think they would, but I'm a 'glass half full' person. 

Pizza is good, the wraps are great. I've tried nearly half the menu and haven't had a bad meal. And, the 'sweet smokey gold' wing sauce is my favorite sauce I've tried in Cleveland. 

Decent drink specials (often have $5 pitchers on Friday, they'll even fill that pitcher with domestic beer if you ask!). My tipsy friend once spilled a shot (which was probably an indication she didn't need it) and offered to pay for another one, but they made another one, no charge. Aww, that was nice. 

If you have OCD, or are a grammarian, please be aware the menu has many grammar and formatting issues. Don't let it deter you. While the panini melt comes with \"fires\" (sounds hot) don't worry, they have firefighter-themed equipment all through the restaurant to keep you safe. I don't hold it against them, in fact, I'm intrigued by the person that goes outside the box of society-standard spelling and spacing. I would have gladly proofread the menu in exchange for a delicious sammich.   

They have an adjacent takeout location that houses the kitchen connected/next door. It's dirty in there, so don't ruin the mystique of the main restaurant/bar by going in there."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service.  Nice corner bar atmosphere with much better than bar food.  Nice hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great owner. Def my favorite watering hole and place to watch games and fights"}
{"text":"if you're looking for great food and also a great atmosphere to spend your evening, this is the place to go!! The Fire House is equipped with phenomenal staff who care tremendously about their customers! They have taken the time to get know us personally, and they make sure that we are well taken care of every visit. One time I asked for shrimp tacos that I didn't know were no longer on the menu, and the owner took the time out of his busy schedule to make them for me!!! We will continue to be regulars here for years and years to come. Delicious food, friendly people, and fun times!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough.  We went here the first time for Pizza and it was well worth it.  A typical bar and grill setting no ambiance if that is what you are looking for but the food menu is well worth the stay.  Me and hubby love the Roman Chariot - we split it as it is huge.  Try it you will probably like it."}
{"text":"My favorite bartenders /servers ever!!! Alisha, lisa and kathy are so great! Attentive, professional and nice. We love, love, love their pizza"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best pizza and wings and on Tuesday nights they do a fun trivia night (winner gets a free small pizza & pitcher of beer).  Kathy & Jimmy are our favorite bartenders, always great service :)"}
{"text":"Got pizza and wings to go and it was just OK. Not a fan of whatever spices they put on pizza. Nothing I ever need to really eat again. The garlic parm wings were eh def not great the Asian plum sauce were alright."}
{"text":"This place has some tasty food! They have fold over sandwiches that are REALLY good! The Roman Chariot has a similar taste to the Roman burger from Mr. Hero but you can tell it has better qualities. Their pizza is pretty good too. I recommend the pierogi pizza! So yummy!"}
{"text":"I called in a carry out order for some wings and two of their sandwiches that they make by folding over a 12\" baked pizza crust. I arrived 30 minutes after placing the order as that is when I was told it would be ready. But it wasn't. I ended up having to wait an extra 10 minutes. The wings were typical pizza place variety and Pretty good overall. The sandwiches were really good but were a bit dry. Both definitely needed some more sauce, or condiments, or something. The unique pizza crust wrapped around was great. Looking forward to trying Firehouse again."}
{"text":"Firehouse is my go to place in North Royalton. The staff is always spectacular as well as the atmosphere. The bar is equipped with a pool table, mini bowling, and darts for those who are into games. The food is to DIE for. When I say to DIE for I mean it. I've never been let down whether it be a salad, soup, sandwich, or pizza. My mouth is watering just thinking about their amazing food. Anywho, I highly recommend Fire House you would be missing out if you didn't give this place a try. 

FYI: happy hours is 11am to 7pm Monday - Friday. W"}
{"text":"This place is great. The atmosphere is wonderful and the food is excellent. You know that a pizza place is good when they get constant orders from the local fire department. I try to get in here at least once a week to see what specials the chef has. This is more than just pizza and wings they usually have some pretty good soups and sandwiches as well as gourmet dishes"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. Ordered the roman chariot.  It's a roman burger on steroids. Very friendly and attentive staff"}
{"text":"Do not order food here  I ordered 5 large pizzas and 50 wings. When I picked up my order the cook looks like he was just in a fight black eyes and open scabs on his arms. Very gross that his cuts were not covered and he was cooking our food. When I got home they gave me the wrong flavor wings and a wrong pizza. The other 4 pizzas were way undercooked the crust was white half way cooked. I took the wrong pizza back to them also I gave him one piece of each pizza to show the owner how bad it was he refunded 1/2 the wings and only $10.00 of the $20.00 pizza that we did not order. He was rude and said it wasn't that bad. 
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"We always have great service no matter when we go. Never ordered food that wasn't delicious! And lots of tvs to catch our favorite sports."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings for pickup. The kitchen was very busy - good sign. The pizza had a nice substantial crust, this isn't NY style if that's what you're looking for. Thick generous layer of cheese. Just a great pizza. Wings were large and meaty and reasonably priced. Glad to have them in my neck of the woods.  Have not tried dining in yet but I expect a sports grill atmosphere."}
