{"text":"I used to frequent Pita Queen, until Beirut Street Food across the street opened; which is waaaay better.   Pita Queen guy is the parking police.  If you're parking in the lot where is  restaurant is, and not a patron of his or any other establishment, he's on you.  He was yelling and following me as I crossed the street. Beirut was slammed clearly because their food is amazing, and I didn't have time.  Lucky for Pita Queen guy, I was able to remain parking in 'his' lot because Subs n' Bubbles is right next door, which is also amazing.    Pita Queen, I would suggest installing some parking signs to specify parking restrictions or make better food."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Not only are their donairs and shawarma wraps tasty and well balanced, their samosas are in my top 3 picks as the best in the city. And you can't beat the value here either! Pita Queen is now also my is my new spot for hummus and Baba ghanoush as both are DELICIOUS- I'm pretty excited about not having to buy the grocery store stuff anymore. Also notable is their meat and potato pies and really friendly service. I will be honest and say that their baklava isn't my absolute favorite but that's ok because Pita Queen's pride is already clearly seen in the all of the other food I've tried there."}
{"text":"Pita Queen is always friendly and they often remember what I like on my shwarma. It's exactly what you would expect from a shwarma place. Tasty wraps with great flavour. They also have some nice veggie samosas, falafal and baklava. Nothing spectacular, but it always hits the spot."}
