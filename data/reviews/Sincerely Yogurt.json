{"text":"Lousy service. They state they close at 9:00 and the doors were locked and the kids inside were sweeping at 8:30! Wouldn't even look at us or acknowledge when we asked about the closing time. Disappointing. The other franchises I have been to are much better!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 1 star because the service is horrible!!  The yogurt is yummy, but every time I have gone the lady working at the register has been very disconnected and unfriendly!!  A number of times the door has been locked and the store hours say open.. And though I have gone at 11 am everyday and it's usually open, last week the door was locked again at 11:30; she came to the door, peaked out and said \"what??\" I said id like some yogurt... She said we don't open until 12:30 now!  I asked why it had suddenly changed and she said it hasn't had much business before then and then she just shut the door..no smile nothing!!  I usually love sincerely yogurts, but this location is by far the worst as far as friendly employees!!!  :/ I wouldn't recommend coming here because the doors may not be open !!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The for yo is great and so are the toppings. My favorite is the cookie dough. I also love the nonfat and low calorie options. It's great for adults and kids."}
{"text":"Great new location!   I visited this Sincerely Yogurt today with my family.  I was impressed with the new and fun decor.  There was plenty of flavors and tons of toppings.  I especially liked the color changing spoons--a very fun touch!"}
{"text":"I had never tried a self serve frozen yogurt place before, and I found this Sincerely Yogurt to be very enjoyable.  There were lots of flavors and toppings to choose from and the dining area was clean and comfortable.  I especially liked the fruit toppings, but there were lots of choices.  The temperature sensitive plastic were a surprise and quite fun."}
{"text":"The latest Sincerely Yogurt location is at Caste Village- at the end behind the Wine and Spirits store. Despite recently opening and a location that is difficult if not impossible to see from the road, Sincerely Yogurt has developed quite a following. In addition to the tables inside, there are few tables outside as well. It was packed on a recent Saturday night with young and old folk alike enjoying a bowl of their favorite flavors with a bounty of fresh toppings.  The inside is kept immaculate. The toppings bar is always full with exactly what you would want on your yogurt. There are plenty of flavors to choose from including my favorite- cake batter. They even offer hot fudge and fresh whipped cream near the check out. Don't forget to get a punch card. Buy 8 get one free!"}
{"text":"One of the worst frozen yogurt I have ever try ... But the spoon there is interesting and cute because it can change color when it touch to frozen yogurt ~"}
{"text":"First and probably last experience with this Fro Yo joint....  Pro: they have several different flavors and toppings to choose from and it's fun to make your own bowl.  Con: See, that's where they get you. Let's face it, I'm cheap. You pay by the ounce, which I believe is $.48 or $.49 per ounce. My yogurt was $3.50, husband's was close to six bucks. Could have gone to McDonald's and got 2 ice cream cones for a buck. And, it's ice milk, so just as \"healthy\"."}
{"text":"My family and I had a fabulous experience at Sincerely Yogurt this evening! The store is large for a little yogurt shop, and thank goodness it is... On a beautiful Saturday evening, it was definitely bustling. They had your basic flavors of yogurt, from chocolate and vanilla to cheesecake and strawberry banana. There were probably 50 or so toppings, and I felt the topping station was clean and better maintained than a lot of other similar shops. However, the hands-down best part of my experience? The cup dividers! Slide in that little paper wall in your big cup, and you've got 2-4 options of yogurt creations! I made one side of my wall chocolate covered with peanut butter and fudge treats, while I made the other side cheesecake covered with strawberries and cheesecake bites. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is a new frozen yogurt place that just opened in the Waterfront, right across from Lowes Theater. There are around a dozen frozen yogurt flavors and lots of toppings to choose from. My favorite fro-yo flavor is chocolate and one of my favorite toppings is the waffle pieces. I really like the spoons- they change colors! These are good quality spoons that can be reused many times.    If you've never been to a froYo place before, the staff is more than willing to tell you how it works. Don't forget: at the end your cup of yogurt will be weighed by the ounce. Don't think you have to fill up your cup completely or else you will be paying a lot more."}
{"text":"Great place for my tasty frozen yogurt in Caste Village. Usually have about 10 different flavors to choose from. Cake batter is my fave! Many toppings as well from fruity to chocolate to salty. You pay by weight which I think is standard for fro-yo places like this. It is never over crowded here and is very clean as it is a fairly new location. Indoor and outdoor seating so it's great for a treat all year round! If you shop at the Giant Eagle across the street they always have coupons on the back of the receipt for 15% and 20% off. Also, ask for a Frozen Yogurt Card so your 9th fro-yo is free!"}
{"text":"They have all five star reviews here for a reason...it's fantastic! The yogurt and toppings are delicious and I LOVE the customer service/loyalty program they offer here...that's why we come back over, and over, and over again..."}
{"text":"Beautifully kept. The lady there was incredibly friendly and helpful. Good flavors and enjoyable on a spring day."}
{"text":"Yuuum! Love stopping here for some froyo! We took my dad who was a bit skeptical for the first time and now he is just as obsessed! There are flavors to fit everyone's taste buds and enough toppings to appeal to everyone! I love that there are healthy options and you can make it as indulgent as you want."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best frozen yogurt place I've ever been to. The yogurt flavors aren't too tart and they have a really great taste; they're also organic. The staff is super friendly, there's an abundance of toppings, the store is kept very clean, and they give a discount to police officers. This was a great place to stumble upon."}
