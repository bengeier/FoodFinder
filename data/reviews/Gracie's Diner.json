{"text":"Love love love Gracie's awesome place , hospitality is great , hot coffee , great breakfast and good donuts!!"}
{"text":"Gracie's is a great place to grab breakfast.  They offer an affordable menu with lots of options.  There items are also available for carry-out which is very convenient.  The breakfast sandwich on a croissant is loaded with eggs.  It is delicious.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Getting my donut on. !  Nice little place glad i finally stopped.  Go check them out so many choices."}
{"text":"Family of four just looking for a new breakfast place.   There was one waitress and the place was packed.  But the service was really good so was the food.  We will most likely come back.  I got the eggs Benedict...  it was good, eggs were runny like they were supposed to and it tasted like a fresh sauce poured over top.  Delicious. :-)."}
{"text":"Great food! I come here with my wife very often for breakfast. Eggs are alway done perfectly. Great service and friendly atmosphere. They have donuts and my favorite poppy seed rolls. Nicole runs the place and her mom is an exceptional cook. Quick service during the week. On weekends the place can get very busy and you might have to wait for a table but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I stopped in this morning to grab a bite to eat before work. The service and food were both great. Great breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"I feel bad giving a two star review. :( But when we walked in there were about 3 people down at the end of the place and they all looked up and stared at us startled like. Nobody was behind the counter. So we stopped right there. Then one lady looked kind of confused and said \"Can I help you??\" and we were like \"...Yeah we just wanted to get a couple donuts and some coffee??\" and they acted mildly disorganized/confused and were like, \"sure,well, she's not here but I can help you till she gets back\" Then the lady went behind the counter and did proceed to get us the donuts. They tasted fine. The coffee was fine. After the initial confusion about us they were very nice. The odd welcome just made for an awkward feeling. Then another lady did come out and both ladies were behind the counter sort of... but were just talking to the guys there and then doing scratch off lottery tickets - strange! So maybe this is the place where you can be a local and be a regular at the counter of a local donut shop - and that can be a good thing... but not for me. Sorry Gracie's! but it is what it is.

But maybe in a couple months they will be doing better, so maybe give them a try anyway?? :)"}
