{"text":"For the last 7 years my husband has attended and helped with a pool tournament here and I have gone as often as possible. The owner is really nice and the staff are always on top of things even though I suspect that the don't often have 60 or 70 people there. The food that we have had has always been great, especially the samosas. All in all we have always had a great time here."}
{"text":"This is a good local pool hall. Friendly staff, pub food, and great happy hour pool on Sundays. They have both dollar tables and full per hour tables. Wanna play snooker? They have that too."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Chalks Billiards on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I wanted something dirty that I could sink my teeth into and enjoy. I wasn't expecting a lot because it's looked just like overpriced pub food, but I wondered if I would be pleasantly surprised? I wasn't.  The pool hall was empty around 2 PM on Sunday. It was A beautiful day outside so I'm sure people were busy doing outdoor activities.  The music was cool, 80s jams and the food was prepared quickly.   The Ruben was mediocre it was nice that the bread was garlic toast (I could smell but not taste the difference and the bread was kinda soggy on one side), the cheese was processed (looked better than it tasted) and the meat was low quality and a low amount. The fries were good. It totally wasn't worth it but it looks like a fun place to play pool."}
{"text":"I used to spend many a Friday night here. On most nights it's pretty low-key.  The drink prices are fair and they have some good specials.  The staff are frindly for the most part."}
