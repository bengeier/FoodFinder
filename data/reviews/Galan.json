{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and the antojitos are bomb! Everything looks so good so i had a hard time deciding what to get, finally I decided to order some pepinos preparados with cueritos and Japanese peanuts  they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy your sweet tooth and your spicy tooth as well lol. They had everything from \"Fresas con crema\" to \"Fish Ceviche\" . I will definitely will be coming back. Prices are very reasonable for their yummy food."}
{"text":"We went in looking for an ice cream shop.  Not your typical ice cream, but good.  It was fun to try some new things.  Excellent customer service in explaining the different drinks. Horchata is homemade and really good.  So is the \"eggnog type of drink\" (I don't remember the Spanish name for it).  The tamarind drink was a bit too slimy and sweet pickle taste for me, but worth a try.  The elotes in a cup was good, but definitely want to share it.  The only complaint my kids had was they did not have chocolate ice cream."}
{"text":"Awesome new place to get your Thrifty ice cream or antojito fix. Great friendly staff Love it!!"}
