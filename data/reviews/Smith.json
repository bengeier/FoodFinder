{"text":"Had Brunch @smith  Sweet tooth today, so I had the waffle , so good and fluffy not overly sweet and it was delicious.  Our waitress was a sweetheart and very accommodating    Thanks Smith"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, sloppy service, bad food and dusty/tarnished cutlery - I wouldn't go back.   First I ordered the scones. They were hard and cold, not the way scones should be. They also didn't come with jam or whipped cream! What the heck! Then I ordered the donuts and they were pretty good. But of course, it's a donut.  The menu looked like an old newspaper, which is nice and goes with the vintage style of the restaurant. But the cutlery was tarnished and the mugs and plates were dusty. I think they went overboard with \"vintage\".  My meal, which was potatoes and brisket was overly salty. It slowly made my teeth ache.   The waiter made multiple mistakes with my bill, overcharged me, and then asked, \"Is this okay? Sorry, should I reverse it?\" - No, I love paying extra for bad food!"}
{"text":"Trendy atmosphere and great service.  Scones are amazing and a must have if you pop in for brunch.  Entrees were so-so, however.  Eggs benedict were overcooked and the omelette was just about average for something at this price point.  Overall a pretty standard brunch place but given the service and atmosphere probably a good 3.5 star plus."}
{"text":"Great place and you definitely get what you paid for. Amazing onion soup... The best in Toronto so far"}
{"text":"Smith has a great atmosphere and attentive, friendly service.  I love the newspaper menus, charming and unique.  Because it's not in the West end, or Leslieville or the Beaches, you don't have to fight for a table or stand in a lineup.  We walked in easily at 10:30, though that patio was full by about 11:30am.  The only thing is the food, it's decent, but it could be better.  I had the salmon frittata on my most recent visit and the egg was dry and the smoked salmon didn't taste that fresh.  I've had the scones in the past though and they were great.  Also, it seems like you're getting free coffee top ups, but they're actually charging you for them."}
{"text":"Loved the mojito! Had the pork belly, I would prefer it a little more moist than what I had but it was overall a good dish. The appetizers were amazing! Love the decorations of the space."}
{"text":"Smith is like the child of wealthy parents who decides to study plastic arts in an Alpha city, with a long term goal of becoming famous by looking famous.   3$ for filtered coffee?! The last time I paid 3$ for filtered coffee was at Harrod's....AND THAT'S ALL THEY DO.  The scones are nice and the lobster eggs benedict was okay. The waffles weren't special. I guess my same criticism of that kid described at the beginning review is what I would say to Smith, if it were a person. You're well turned-out, a little refined and have some interesting ideas but you're not special. :/"}
{"text":"Split the pancakes and the huevos rancheros with some friends. Great ambience on the third floor. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. Would definitely recommend to friends/family!"}
{"text":"Unassuming from the outside, this Church street establishment is well known by locals for its brunch. When you enter Smith, you almost forget that this is Toronto. It is quaint and cozy, and felt like an elusive secret spot for only those in the know. But judging by the number of people who were already seated when we arrived, as well as the abundant 3 floors of seating, this most likely was not the case.   Everything about this restaurant feels intimate. The warm oak fixtures, candle lit ambience, freshly cut flowers, porcelain plates, and elegantly aged silverware; almost makes you feel like missed putting up some sort of white picket fence outside. Despite this, Smiths was unintimidating, relaxed, and perfect for the cordial catch-up brunch I was about to have.  The entire menu is printed on fold out recycled paper, unmistakably similar to newspaper that you would browse during an early morning meal. I actually thought this was quite the charming touch.  We kicked off our brunch with an order of House Doughnuts for the table. These were handsdown the best thing! Pillowy soft, rolled with cinnamon sugar and crushed nuts, served with a side of creamy lemon curd. Probably not the best decision for my waisteline, but I was definitely considering having just two plates of this next time and calling it a meal.  First thoughts when this dish showed up? The monstrous portions. Is this really for one person? They definitely don't mess around with brunch. The Croque Monsieur is a layered ham and swiss topped off with an egg - basically the ultimate breakfast sandwich. And yes, there is definitely as much cheese as it looks like it does - cheesy, cheesy, goodness!  ast to reach the table was Smith's Brisket Hash.Crispy cooked home fries, topped off with tender cooked brisket, a perfectly runny poached egg, and heapings of bernaise sauce. As excited as I was to consume this mountain of protein and carbs, the dish failed to impress. Something about the way each component was prepared, just didn't work as a whole. At best, it was a side of well potatoes, egg, and brisket served on a plate with little consideration of the whole. Nothing to write home about in my opinion.  Some hits and misses, but in general a memorable visit to what many would say is a hidden gem. Weeks after my visit, I'm still impressed at how much I enjoyed my time there. The friendly servers and charming low-key vibe made it one that will merit my return visit."}
{"text":"Best brunch we have had in Toronto so far. Beef brisket and waffles are the best. The place is spacious and service is acceptable. Better to reserve as you might need to wait for long."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch today with 3 friends.  The restaurant had a really cool vibe.  The service was great (very attentive servers) and the food was even better!  We had mini donuts to start which were a nice treat.  I had the Ballina Benedict which was smoked salmon with a leek sauce.  Soooo good!  My friends also enjoyed the regular Smith Breakfast.  Definitely recommend and will be coming here much more often."}
{"text":"Smith is adorable, friendly, and most importantly, delicious.  I stumbled upon this restaurant after an exhausting move, and am I ever glad I did!  There are so many small, wonderful details in the decor, and the service was fantastic.  The food was delicious. Seriously. If you like breakfast potatoes, you need to eat here. You're doing your mouth a favour."}
{"text":"Food was superb and service excellent. The staff were friendly, polite, and attentive without hovering or feeling rushed. Only down was the music was a bit club style for a relaxed dining atmosphere. Otherwise an overall great experience."}
{"text":"They are horrible. First they gave us curdled / spoiled milk with our coffee. Then my eggs were runny when i asked them for over hard. I sent the eggs back and she said they would take care of it. When my eggs came back the second time they were still runny.  I shall not be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing place for brunch. It's a gem. Their patio is really nice. The wait time was acceptable, the food was great, the quality and quantity was greet for the price. I would definitely go back. We were three friends and we all enjoyed it! The service was great, everyone was amazing. Really nice vibe, environment."}
{"text":"After having tried to go to Wish on a date one evening, we were greeted by an employee who informed us that it was closed but suggested we visit their sister restaurant, Smith, down the street and around the corner (their other sibling is the awesome 7 West Cafe...so you really can`t go wrong here).  During the summer, Smith has a cute patio out back complete with umbrellas for shade, strings of lights and pillows to make yourself comfortable. There`s just something nice about being there on a beautiful summer day where you feel tucked away from the bustling city.   Smith has THE cutest vintage bathroom of all time. Pedal-activated sinks still exist! They even have cute tiled floors with wording in some places. Just be careful when eating outside on the patio and heading up to the washroom...you have to climb up the narrow fire escape route.   As for the food - amazing! We both ordered a juicy Smith Burger with a side salad. All very tasty and nicely presented on a mini cutting board. It was a nice-sized portion and I felt very satisfied after this meal.   Next time, I`m going for the brunch!"}
{"text":"Very cute patio on the side of the restaurant. The menu simply designed, but very fun to look at. A friend and I went on a Saturday morning for brunch and the wait was about 20 mins, so not too bad. Both of us got egg bennies and they were quite good.  The New York-loft styled decor is cute enough for a return visit :)"}
{"text":"It's not an exaggeration to state this is the best breakfast I've ever had. Eggs benedict with smoked salmon and banana bread french toast. Plus a very fun bathroom with pedals for faucets. Just the cutest vibe, and most delicious food. Don't miss this place for the world. (Coffee snobs - it's not great. Starbucks is better)."}
{"text":"Came here on a crisp, clear, spring evening looking to take advantage of great weather. My dining partner and I opted for a seat out on their sidewalk patio which was as great for enjoying a sunset in the city as it is for people watching on Church.   The dinner menu looked superb! I ordered the duck leg with shaved beets and greens. The duck skin was perfectly light and crunchy and the leg was nice and tender (not fatty at all). The beets were a great compliment for the palette. My partner ordered the tortellini with enoki mushrooms in a creamy garlic sauce. Both were very well done and in decently sized portions.  Dessert was a reco from the waiter: bread pudding with a side of strawberries that warmed your belly as the sun went down and the night got colder. The pudding wasn't super sweet and wasn't too soggy. Well done!   The service was excellent. Although it was a weeknight and a bit slower, the wait staff still came outside and checked up on us regularly.  Plus the tunes playing in the background behind the bench varied like the menu.   Overall a great date spot that should be on your radar besides coming for brunch!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pretty awesome, super cute. We were seated on the third floor and the decor was really chic (I'm talking about orchids on the table)  The food was not bad at all, I really enjoyed their crepe, they put so much pistachios in the crepe!! Yes it was a bit sweet, but definitely not over the top.   Now onto the reason I'm writing this review: The waiter in my opinion was very mediocre, not attentive, but filled our waters when asked. I honestly didn't think he was all that great and when he gave us the bill he didn't even bother handing us our individual bills, just dumped all three bills on the table and expected us to sort it out ourselves.   So needless to say I did not tip him that much (10%, which in my defense, is rather standard). I would tip people 15-20% if they were exceptional, but hey, I'm still a student.   The waiter was really rude after receiving the receipt, he asked if the service was okay. We said it was \"fine\". And then he proceeds to giving us a lecture with A LOT OF ATTITUDE saying that \"it's unacceptable to give me 10 percent... blah blah blah'. I was absolutely shocked at his attitude. Last time I checked only good services deserve higher tips.   Will not go back again."}
{"text":"VERY mixed experience here on a Friday evening. Really  more like a 2.5.  Surprised that they were *only* offering the very limited Summerlcious menu. Parts of it were good, parts bad. My pork was very overcooked, even after requesting it pink, and the dandelion greens were a poor choice for side (way too bitter). The grits (or whatever it was supposed to be) underneath was completely inedible.  My partner's fish was so-so. The dessert was actually quite good, if improvisational in feel. I had lemon curd with berries and my partner had a substitute for the ice cream (some chantilly-type concoction which was actually tasty).  The wine list is way too short, and the cheapest bottle at ~$49 is really not in keeping with Toronto restos of this caliber. I completely don't understand that.  They did a good job redesigning the space that used to be Babylon, but overall it is strangely  gimmicky and overdecorated. I couldn't help but think the rope hanging in front of the fireplace was a noose. Way too many objets attached to walls, etc.. And then there's the bathroom...Oh. Dear.  The crowd seemed to be the more sophisticated gay villagers -- rather young, as are all the server boys  (who are all decked out in the latest H&M rolled shorts and t-shirts).   I do want to like this place, but methinks they're going to have to evolve or perish.  Recos: -- more concern for quality of cooking --tone down the decor  --decent wine list, priced appropriately --servers that are a little less twink"}
{"text":"I had great hopes for Smith before I finally settled in there for brunch.  We were led to a table on the second floor. The service was absolutely atrocious as our waiter Jack, made a concerted effort to ignore my date and I. People were served, while we sat there with empty water cups and ready to order. I had to flag him down to order. Wait 10 minutes. Flag him down for water. Wait ten minutes. Flag him down for more coffee. Wait 15 minutes. Rinse and repeat.  The food would have been acceptable if the brisket hash wasn't dripping with water spilled from our waiter.   Wow."}
{"text":"We had an excellent Sunday brunch here. I really appreciate that they take reservations even for small groups.  Really like the space, it's split amongst 3 floors and each feels a little different. There were families and groups of friends filling all the tables.  The food was delicious. We shared a plate of donuts - light with espresso sugar and lemon curd. They also do an assortment plate of scones and coffee cakes, will have to try next time. Our mains in our group included Huevos Rancheros with perfectly cooked poached eggs, black beans, guacamole, salsa, tortilla and cheese - potatoes on he side. Smith Breakfast for a standard breakfast including fresh thick cut toast. And the brisket hash, topped with poached eggs, potatoes and bearnaise sauce.  Service was very friendly.  We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Smith many times now and have been pleasantly surprised with exceptional food on every occasion. Most recently I went in and had the lamb ragu special with made-in-house pappardelle that was incredible! It is often difficult for a restaurant to pull off house-made pasta but this was some of the best I have ever had. The lamb completely melted in the mouth, really very delicious.  Now about the fried chicken - words cannot describe! Crispy outside, moist inside served on a bed of chopped brussel sprouts and corn, southern cooking at its finest and most refined. Although some reviews have said the restaurant is \"over priced\" it may be on the slightly expensive side (hearty mains from 18 to 30) but the serving portions are much larger than the average restaurant at this price point. The appetizers are very reasonably priced and great to share.  And finally, the most important part of the meal - dessert! Smith serves a bread pudding that is absolutely to die for. The pudding, as the chicken, cannot be justified with a few words in a review - go try it! The lemon curd is another hit on the dessert menu, although it is quite tart (what I look for in a lemon curd) but keep this in mind if you prefer a more mild curd. Served with preserved blueberries and creme fraiche, the curd is a pleasantly light but full flavored dessert that will certainly please.   All in all I am a huge fan of this restaurant, with it's excellent food, great service, and absolutely stunning decor. The cocktail list is exceptional, 'The Minimalist' is a cocktail unlike any other, light and fresh - a few of these can become dangerous. I would and will recommend Smith time and time again!"}
{"text":"I was on a trip recently to Toronto from Seattle and had dinner at this restaurant.  The food was really good and our waiter was so sweet!  I also really enjoyed being able to sit outside on their little terrace.  The other thing that was absolutely delicious was the seafood chowder which was available on their menu that day.  It is some of the best I've ever had, and living where I do, we like to think we can make a mean chowdah.  (Can I bribe the chef for the recipe?)"}
{"text":"After walking past Smith repeatedly and curious about the newspaper-style menu in a classic newspaper box outside I finally stopped in for brunch with a few friends.  The first think you'll notice about Smith will be the décor. Original, funky, and interesting. We sat at the 6-person table by the window, which was next to an actual boat anchor hanging from the high ceilings. Throw in some modern art, a black/white/grey colour scheme, and unisex bathrooms with one long sink that uses water fountain spouts and a foot petal to turn them on and you have a unique dining experience.  I ordered the huevos rancheros, as recommended by other Yelpers, and I wasn't disappointed. I especially liked the authentic tostada. One poached egg was a little runny (the way I like it) and the other was cooked a little longer and not runny at all - not sure if that was a mistake or by design. The hash browns were light and fluffy, but not soggy at all. The texture was great, but I could have used a little more flavour from the spice rack.  My dining companions ordered the eggs benedict, the coddled eggs, and the Smith breakfast with peameal bacon. Note that the peameal is more like a slab of ham than bacon. Everyone seemed pretty satisfied, although the coddled eggs apparently could have used a little more punch.  Moral of the story: you won't be wowed by bold flavours, but everything is cooked well and with an eye on detail, as you would expect based on the restaurant's design."}
{"text":"Smith has a great brunch vibe. The owners of Smith also own 7 West and Wish.   I was lucky enough to get a seat on the patio. The patio is actually at the back of the restaurant. You have to actually go around the corner to get into the patio. The decor at Smith is great with a lot of whimsical details ex. the milk for my coffee came in a mini milk jar.  I ordered the scones and coffee cake. It was pretty decent but the portion was small. It is great for a snack but I wouldn't recommend ordering it if you come with an empty stomach.  My friend got the Smith Breakfast. It came in a good sized portion and the home fries were pretty good. I would probably get the Smith Breakfast next time.   I would definitely recommend Smith for a low-key brunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for Sunday morning brunch with my mom, and received amazing customer service. I got the Banana Bread French Toast, which was really good, while my mom got the Eggs Benedict with Salmon, which she enjoyed as well. There were a lot of knick knacks and plates on the table, which was cute but kind of made it difficult to move stuff around, not a big issue though. Overall, we enjoyed our visit here and would come again :)"}
{"text":"We made an inquiry about a private function in July and only received a response in September (We should have known at that point that this would be a disaster). We finally made a booking with the manager and she said \"how about Thursday\". Okay so it was Monday so automatically one would assume Thursday of the current week. We show up for the appointment but no manager - she said that she meant next Thursday...really?   Okay - strike 2. We make contact the next Thursday and we discuss our needs, budget, menu, etc. and are very excited. Manager says it will take a couple of days to prep the quote and we should be good to go. Two weeks later, and no quote - strike 3. I don't understand how a restaurant can advertise private functions and treat potential patrons this way. We were prepared to spend thousands of dollars on the event but I would be an absolute fool to go through with this now.   Out of principal I will not be frequenting Smith any longer, and I recommend, based on other rveiews re: service, that you strongly consider avoiding Smith. It is really such a shame, because they have a very cool space for events and the menu is great."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to give this place a try for a while now, and the time was finally right for Sunday brunch.   The good:  1) The owner/manager seemed very interested and engaged. The staff were polite and attentive 2) The atmosphere of the place and the decor were spot on, just right to enjoy a pleasant weekend brunch 3) The menu was focused and had many interesting items  The bad 1) I ordered the breakfast burrito, which, unfortunately, was horrible. Staying with the letter b, it was bland and burnt. The scrambled eggs inside were terribly bland, no salt whatsoever. The eggs were also overpowering the entire dish, and I wasn't able to taste any of the beans, or other ingredients. OK, so you can perhaps add some salt (no salt shakers on the table) to rectify the situation. The biggest problem was that they grilled the outside of the burrito until it was completely black, so the entire dish had a distinctive burnt flavor to it.  To their credit, the side salad I had was fresh and a good portion.   On balance, this might have been the case of an unlucky choice of dish on my part. All the other orders looked very good, and my party were very happy with their breakfast Cobb.  As a result, I'm willing to give the place two stars instead of one, hoping to return for better eats next time."}
{"text":"Five stars for accommodating our seating request. Lovely decor. After that it was all downhill. Menu had just changed. I ordered the salmon in a bowl of broth. The salmon was very uncooked. The broth it was sitting in did not complement the fish. It was a huge disappointment. No one asked if we wanted a second drink. In fairness, my partner's fried chicken was very delicious. Don't bother with the fries. For the price it was not worth it. Had thought of trying for brunch but this was enough of a disappointment I won't be back."}
{"text":"We went for brunch here today. I must admit I was impressed. I had the huevos Rancheros. Not as salsa-y as they usually are and  with a mild curry type flavor from them. Lots of black beans and soft shell tacos. Delicious. Came with melon and a pile of home cooked fried Potato chunks. Huge and filling portion.   My dining date had the waffles which looked fab. She was happy out with her choice. The mimosas were a very decent size. The coffee was only so-so, so losing a star for that. I'm a self confessed coffee snob and like a decent crema on my Americano which was noticeable by its absence. Friendly service but not annoyingly over attentive.   We sat on the patio which was beautiful. Very hipster bathrooms too all clean and well maintained. In all a very pleasant brunch. I will return.   Oh and 10% discount for Yelp check in on Tues and wed. Might have to check it out.. Be rude not to"}
{"text":"We were totally spur of the moment and just walked in - it's got a warm eclectic vintage vibe. The coffee was tasty, and we both had the smith breakfast (a billion eggs which are my fav, bacon, homefries, brioche, and fresh fruit) all for 12$??? I ate every bite and loved it. The service is too notch, they're attentive and I appreciated that.   Ive never seen a bathroom quite as cool as theirs though,  foot pedal activated water fountains? Sorry but that's awesome.   Definitely will be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"We went here for our annual staff Christmas party. First let me say the staff were superb, they had enough servers to ensure that our event ran well and nobody's hand was ever without a drink. They had a superset bar open for us (approx 40 people) and ensure it was well stocked - so kudos on that smith restaurant! We started with a charcuterie board which was delicious, a wide variety of cheeses, little crackers and great meat, along with oysters (which I didn't partake in). We all had a choice from a pre fix menu, I started with their smith salad which was great, nice mix of greens, pears and a tangy dressing. Dinner (for me) was the steak frites, the steak was a bit cool (but they did have to hike up three floors to serve us), but he fries were tasty and plentiful. Dessert was not my favourite, Lemon custard dish, the meringue on top tasted bitter and chemically. I'd take a hard pass on that any day of the week. Overall our experience was great, service was outstanding and the majority of our meal was excellent. We would def. come back to check out what looks like a killer brunch menu."}
{"text":"This was a lovely place for brunch. The patio was nice in the summer and our server was friendly and efficient, but not pushy. My food - the french toast - was excellent and so was my coffee. Overall, just a very nice atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here for brunch this morning.  We got there at about 11:45am and didn't have to wait at all.  It's pretty tiny on the first floor, so I was pleasantly surprised we were seated so soon!  The servers are all super friendly and casual with us...I love that!  To be honest, I woke up in a great mood this morning and I felt like I was going to love it there, even before we walked in...and I was right!  My best friend is a vegetarian and they were super accomodating for her.  I'm the meat eater between us...Even though we both ordered the classic breakfast, mine with extra crispy bacon and sunny side up eggs...hers with roasted tomatoes and a poached egg...we both loved it.  The toast that comes with your meal is wonderfully buttery and divine.  The roasted potatoes are delicious...and the serving sizes were very generous.  All this for just $10.00.  That's an amazing deal, fo sho!  We both have a serious addiction to hot sauce...and normally when you ask for it, you get Tobasco sauce...not here!  At Smith, they have an entire tray, hot sauce-holder thingy filled with at least 10 different kinds of hot sauces.  Needless to say, we were in spicy heaven!  By sheer coincidence, my friend happened to run into her friend who is their brunch chef...she's amazing and was gracious enough to bring out some of their lemon poppyseed scones.  OH.MY.GOODNESS!  They're baked fresh and served with a homemade creme fresh and homemade raspberry rhubarb jam.  Wowza, they're GOOD!  Do yourself a favor, and order these.  You can thank me later.  :)  The only reason why I'm giving them 4 stars out of 5 is because we kept having to ask for more coffee.  And really, that's not a big deal at all.  If you happen to use the washroom upstairs...you're gonna love it.  It's quite unique and actually fun to use too!  :)  Happy Brunching!"}
{"text":"Intriguing signage and branding. The menu looks like a newspaper! I'd been looking forward to coming here for some time. Overall disappointing. I like the decor, but the food was bland. I can make better lamb at home and the gazpacho tasted like watered-down hummus. As an exercise in graphic design, great; as a restaurant, meh."}
{"text":"Late night dinner.  We sat outside and enjoyed the street life. Food was fantastic. The pasta was made on premises. The lamb was great too. Friendly staff.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! Nice addition to neighborhood! LOVE LOVE the decor and ambiance - especially if you sit near the windows. Nice brunch music.   Great services. Food was was pretty good too! :)"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe, homey and eclectic however the food was a disappointment.   Always looking for a good brunch alternative since Fabarnak is closed on Sundays, sadly.  When we arrived at Smith, the place was extremely busy on the first floor.  Luckily, there were several available tables on the second floor.  The initial impression I had of the service was impersonal and a tad disorganized.   We ordered one of the most popular items on the menu, Huevos Ranchero.   Taste wise, it was a decent dish.  Guacamole and salsa were flavorful.  Not sure what happened to poached eggs and potatoes on our plates, both were cold.   Maybe they were having an off day, based on previous Yelp reviews.  We'll give them a second try."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews and finding out this was the only place that takes reservations for brunch, I decide to give it a go. Although we made a reservation for 11:30 we were quite rudely greeted at the door and told to wait while the table was being prepared. It took about another 10 minutes. After that we were taking to the third floor to share a table with two other people. The terms of quantity the food was plenty. In terms of taste for the money I don't think it's worth it. The atmosphere is quite good but it is rather noisy if you want to have any type of conversation, making it difficult. Overall, for what you pay in the food you get it's definitely not worth it. But if you don't mind paying quite a bit for food that isn't very good but definitely edible then it's a pretty decent place to go. And again, the best thing is they do take reservations."}
{"text":"First visit was good, back in patio season.  Most recent visit lowlights were glacial service. And a 'glacial' white wine. Old booze trick folks: when something isn't good make it extra cold.   I have a particular dislike for ordering wine by the glass, and having a server come back with a glass of supposedly said wine. Or worse, a little carafe. Great, let's make an extra dish dirty while you obscure what I'm drinking. Brilliant, really brilliant.  Clue: bring the bottle, and do the pour in front of me. Show a little class, let me see the label. I'm even okay with a discrete hashmark on the glass to keep the control fanatics and bean counters happy. This glass and carafe charade is sterile and off putting.   I'll go again, but during patio season."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch a few months ago. The food is nothing to brag about and our waitress was the rudest I've ever encountered in Toronto. The manager actually came to our table and apologized for her behaviour, but damage was already done."}
{"text":"I keep thinking about the brisket hash. So much meat, savoury and a with a side of spicy sauce.... this is gotta be my ideal breakfast food. Add in the crispy home fries and you have a real winner. There's attention to detail here in the food and presentation.  This place was crowded, and they lost our reservation, but it was the only time I've gone so I'll give them a pass for this for now. On my list of places to go back to. Definitely reserve ahead of time."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 Atmosphere: 9/10  Service: 8/10 Overall experience: 8.5/10  I've been to Wish (the sister restaurant to Smith) a few times before and quite like it, so was excited to try Smith. After my Sunday brunch, I think Smith will become my go-to!  The staff are very friendly, and attentive. They do the little things that tend to get forgotten during the craziness of the brunch rush (i.e. refilling water, coffee, etc).  You will definitely have to wait for your food, that's not their strong suit. No points taken away for this though. To me, it's just what you sign up for when you decide to pursue brunch in the city.  We got the doughnuts, eggs benedict and frittata. The doughnuts are a nice little sweet snack - the brown sugar/cinnamon combo is the perfect coating, though the dough is admittedly a little lackluster. The benny is great - the home fries that come with it crispy and delicious.   The decor is quite lovely and rounds out the experience. Considering we only waited 10-15 minutes, as compared to the hour/hour and a half wait at other popular joints, I'd say go for it!  THE BOTTOM LINE: long wait time for food made up for by great service, lovely decor and good brunch food."}
{"text":"I would've given it 5 stars for the food, but deducted one for service.   A friend and i came here for Sunday brunch based on a recommendation from a website because they take brunch reservations. Sure enough, we were seated on time according to our reservation.   The best part about this restaurant is the facade and interior decor. It was probably a converted house and the place is narrow and tall. The whole thing has three floors and the decor is TO DIE FOR. I was taking notes the entire time i was there.   I ordered the croque monsieur and my friend ordered the brisket and hash. They were both delicious and very savoury. Very satisfying. No complaints. We finished off with the donuts which were also amazing.   We were on the 3rd floor and I think our server was new. It took her a VERY long time so even introduce herself to us, and also took some time for us to bring us our food even though the food had already been prepared and was placed on the bar right in front of us. The place DID look busy, and I'm sure it's not easy to run up and down the flights of stairs. I would definitely come back and try the dinner."}
{"text":"Came for dinner...Third floor...way too dark for my taste with marginal service. Food was tasty but way overpriced for the quality..."}
{"text":"Smith has a really good vibe and certainly has their own unique style. From the decor to newspaper menu and even the cutlery, you can tell that the owner has put in effort and care during the design process.  I admit I'm not much of a drinker but their wine list looks extensive and there are specialty cocktails with unique names. I'm guessing most just come here for drinks because the food items were low on variety.   Portion sizes were on the small side considering the prices and nothing really stood out.   Service was slow but our server was a sweetheart and waiting the whole second floor on his own.   I would come back with friends who can properly enjoy their drinks menu - no portico problems there!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the manager or how we were treated.  We had a reservation for 6 adults & 2 babies and we had requested the main floor. We were made to wait half an hour (expected & understandable) and they seated us on the third floor.  We expressed displeasure as to being on the third floor when we had requested the main floor as we had strollers with us. We were treated very rudely by the manager and basically told that we can't request specific spots. we explained that due to nature of our group, when we called we were told that it shouldn't be a problem to sit on the main floor. Unfortunately, instead of apologizing and showing empathy, the manager was rude and gave us attitude. This whole unpleasant experience could have easily been avoided if the manager was nice and explained the situation and their policies properly instead of being a B. Also, the baby chairs they have are extremely unsafe as they do not have any straps to hold the child in."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday brunch and was really looking forward to it. I love brunch and I really wanted to love this place but it just didn't do it for me. While the decor was fantastic and the location was great (although the restaurant itself was a bit hard to find due to a serious lack of signage) the food and service were pretty disappointing. I ordered the eggs Benedict which was pretty good. The hollandaise was quite nice, but I found the English muffin a bit tough and hard to cut. The potato hash on the side was really underdone which was kind of the kicker for me. When I go out for bunch I at the very least expect the restaurant to know how to properly cook a potato. I mean seriously people, they were raw potatoes. I got the orange juice with it (as I'm not a coffee drinker) and it was ok, granted it didn't taste like pure orange juice (I'm assuming they mixed in some grapefruit which I thought masked the sweetness of the fresh oranges) and wasn't worth the 4$.   Overall, not a bad meal but really overpriced. I would go back again if it weren't for the cost. I ended up paying a total of around 28$ (in part due to the added gratuity for groups) for one dish and a juice. Not at all worth it, especially with the inattentive service. There are much better brunch places in the city."}
{"text":"My number one favourite Brunch spot EVER. This place gets it right every time, with anything you order. Best hollandaise sauce, maybe on earth? The waffles are amazing and piled with fruit. The banana bread french toast is decadent. I love how they add basil to everything, and the decor/vibe here is fantastic. Couldn't recommend more!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for brunch and it is great!   Any style of eggs are really good and the presentation is also well done.  They have a nice vibe and really great atmosphere for sharing a late morning with some friends. The beef skillet is awesome and they also have a nice eggs benny.  Good choice for a morning with some friends!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends. Delicious food, urban/current decor and great service. However, for the prices you would expect more unique flavours or at least larger portions. Ate 2.5 entrees, had 2 cocktails but still left hungry despite a hefty bill. I am curious about the brunch menu and will give that a shot."}
{"text":"We went to Smith this past Saturday (May 6th) and had a reservation for 11:30.  We weren't seated until 11:50 even though we had all arrived by 11:35.  The server we had was lovely, however, the hostess was incredibly rude and acted like she was doing us a favour.  We were rudely told to stand on the stairs and then told to move off the stairs by more than two servers who were coming down from the second floor.  Food was nice but when I'm paying 20 bucks for eggs I don't expect to be treated like an imposition by the hostess."}
{"text":"I have now been to Smith twice, both times for brunch. I must say the staff is very helpful and friendly (and good looking!)  First time I had the banana bread (I wasn't feeling particularly hungry) which was very bland. I blamed myself for getting something so boring. The last time I was there I had waffles which were delicious. I only finished half. I ordered a side of fruit which was a big mistake as the waffles have a whole field of berries on them.   The Good:  1. Staff. Friendly and accommodating. One of my favorite things about a resto. 2. Atmosphere. Good ambiance and people here. Mix of old and young, gay and straight. Everyone seems to love this place.  The Bad:  1. Cost. A lot of the items are a bit expensive (example: a mimosa is $9.) 2. Selection. The selection here is not great. The menu is quite small.  Recommendation: try this place out for brunch if you are nearby. I can't speak on dinner."}
{"text":"What I loved: - The Brisket Hash was delicious - The atmosphere was nice and casual - The waiters were friendly but not overly attentive  What I hated: - The seating -- on 3 levels? C'MON NOW. I hate climbing stairs. - The overpriced juice at $4 per glass (that's the price for one full LITER)  Still if you want a casual brunch spot and don't mind paying through the nose (in my opinion it was a bit expensive for some frickin' juice), come here.   It's friendly, unassuming and not all that bad. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Wow! Love this place. Amazing service. We had this charming young man named Kyle who made our experience unforgettable. Can't wait to come back. You should be so lucky to have Kyle look after you. Such a peach!"}
{"text":"Food is great and we love the decor. Unfortunately, if you come after 12 noon on Sundays, your average wait time is 45 mins to an hour, which we experienced twice. Thank God we had something to eat before heading there."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about this place and I will certainly give it another try for 2 reasons: 1. it is such a intimate setting 2. reviews are raving about brunch.   On a Friday night, we made our way to this church street spot. I was running late, so I called at last minute to push my reservation back. The man on the phone was understanding and had no problem. When we got there we were seated in 5 mins. It gave me a chance to peak at the first floor. I loved the the decor and the fire place. E were on the third floor and again the seating was beautiful. I wish we had a bigger party so we could get awindow seat but we got a take by the bar but it was away from everyone else. If you are a party of 5 or more, ask for a table by the windows or there is a private room on the third floor when you go up the stairs, it has a white table and chairs, away from the other patrons.   Or waiter was really friendly. Suggested two drinks which I can't remember the name but they were good.  We order e from the winterlicious menu $25. I got the tomato based soup and Dave got the gumbo. They were both okay, nothing crazy good. For mains I got the article char which was delicious, the skin was super crispy and the fish itself was most and tastey. It came with vegetables like roasted beets pumpkin and fennel along with sliced oranges and toasted nuts. It was good but the fish was better. Dave got the Cornish hen. It was also delicious. The skin was crispy, the inside moist. He said he enjoyed it. It came with a buttermilk bisque. When he bit into it his face changed, he was in biscuit heaven, who knew! I only had one but so I can't really explain it but it was that Good. For dessert we had the ginger creme and the snow bar. Dave never had smores before, and my attempt at home to enlighten him has majorally failed. He really enjoyed it. It wasn't too much of anything. The right amount of gram the right amount of chocolate ganache and the right about of roasted marshmallow. It was delicious, I took two buttress instead of one. I had the ginger creme. It was good, light and not too sweet; after such a heavy meal, it was perfect. It was presented with oranges and slivered ginger on top.  Bill for two winterlicious $25 menu, plus two drinks (average about $15 each), our bill was $94 (tax and 15% tip included).   Even though the restaurant was busy we were rushed to leave, the wait staff didn't try to wrap us wrap by constantly coming over. They were attentive but not to the point what you're not sure if they are tree trying to get you or of there.  The food was good but not amazing. The staff was great. The decor was just what I wanted for a Friday night date night.  I will go back to try their brunch and the make an informed decision!"}
{"text":"I was REALLY excited about brunching with yelpers this fine Sunday morning a few weeks back. Smith, located in Toronto's amazingly fun Church-Wellesley Village, (aka The Gaybourhood) is toted as a top brunch spot, so when nearly 20 of us gathered I was expecting big things... I mean I woke up super early, put on my best plaid and ventured down from the burbs for this!!  Arriving, our group was seated on the second floor of this retro-fitted historic looking Toronto home. It was nice up here, big bay window, long wooden tables and a bar area just for us.  Menu's soon followed and I have to say I was impressed! Not by the fancy menu items but by the menu itself! Printed on full out newsprint pages, opening one to look through the options requires the same dexterity one would require in reading/folding/re-folding the Toronto Star or Globe and Mail. Kudos - I liked this little touch.  With little deliberation I decided on the Huevos Rancheros (a recent egg fave after traveling in California). Pair that with a coffee and some Mimosa's (sadly not the bottomless kind as I had become accustomed to in SFO) and I was ready to go.   The HR took just shy of a lifetime to arrive, perhaps it wasn't that long but I was hungry so the small extra wait made it seem endless. When they did finally hit my plate I dug in with reckless abandonment. Sadly, there were NOT the best I've ever had... in fact far from it. They were OK at best, and after seeing the meals everyone else was enjoying I was a little disappointed.  The other point is lost on the overall price of breakfast and two drinks (over $45!!). No thanks... It's breakie/brunch, don't forget that!  My own meal aside, I cannot fault them too much, I think I just had an off meal, they seemed to do other things on the menu so well: Fresh scones with whipped butter and homemade preserves, French toast, Smith Benedict... I know what to order next time...  And like Annie says you can \"bet your bottom dollar\" that I'll return to update this review!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the rave reviews are about - it's okay but I've definitely had better brunch food, especially at this price point. It's a beautiful place and the service is fine...but the food was just okay. Not worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"pros: they take reservations and were accommodating it moving it back   cons: waiting 40 minutes for an avocado toast with no recognition that it is a long time to wait for food  Food itself was okay but I wont judge them based on avocado toast because I did not pick a good menu item."}
{"text":"Went there for a friends birthday. Both the appetizer (sausage) and main course (the burger) were delicious. I was very impressed with the portions. It is certainly a great value. The service staff were also friendly, even though the wait time may leave more to be desired."}
{"text":"Great menu options. Had brunch here this past weekend with a group of friends. Ordered the pancakes and the brisket hash and they were both amazing."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday for a special occasion and had a great time. Smith is one of the few brunch places in downtown Toronto that actually accept reservations, so not having to wait in line for hours for brunch on a weekend was a huge bonus. The restaurant is really cute and charming. Because I went in December, the place was decked out with poinsettias, lights, and other festive decorations.  To drink, I ordered a coffee (bottomless - they kept coming around to refill my cup which was nice) while my boyfriend had an orange juice. To eat, I got the eggs benedict florentine which came with homefries and fruit - it was delicious and I would highly recommend any of their three eggs benny options. My boyfriend had the brisket hash which also came with a side of homefries and he thoroughly enjoyed his meal.  Overall, I would highly recommend this cute brunch spot - remember to make reservations and you're good to go!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a while and just finally got around to it today for brunch.  Walking in we were surprised at how cozy and rustic the atmosphere is. The place seemed quite small but very unique with some pretty cool decor. The bar looks like a crowded cottage kitchen and there is a lot of minor details that add a lot of character such as antique silverware and plates, as well as random birds nests and bee hives around the walls.  We were seated immediately and ordered 2 regular caesars. We asked about the other 2 varieties of caesars on the menu to which the waitress did not seem to have a very good knowledge of, so we went with the classic. They came and were delicious, darker than any I've had with a fairly unique flavour profile and a good amount of spice, so far so good.  For food we ordered the house doughnuts to start, which we were informed they were out of, so alternatively we went for the coffee cake and scones with strawberry compote and lemon curd, all of which were amazing.  For our mains I ordered the brisket hash and my partner had the Huevos Rancheros. Portions were quite large. Food was hot, seasoned well, fresh and expertly put together. We both absolutely loved our dishes.   Will be returning here for sure as we were both thoroughly impressed with the entire experience and fantastic food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food isn't spectacular, but it's plenty good, and what really gets me is the amazing staff and the ambiance of this place. I love the way it's designed, it's completely cozy, I love the patio and the charming lights overhanging. Just a great great place."}
{"text":"Love this new place. It has become my  favorite restaurant  in the village. Tasty, affordable and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I want to love the Smith, and everything about this place, from its exposed beams/bricks, menus printed on newsprint, tiny starter donuts with three toppings in tiny separate containers (tell me tiny delicious side dishes on little plates aren't exceptionally satisfying for some weird universal OCD reason and I'll tell you you're a liar), but I can only \"like\" it, as the experience is a bit hit/miss.  PAR EXAMPLE: some menu items are a lot better than others; delicious brisket hash, but super weird and unappetizing frittata thing. Service is sometimes good then sometimes not. Sometimes donuts are REALLY fresh, sometimes not. I like donuts always, but I like fresh ones more.   It's completely worth a trip on a good day, but it's a bit of a roll of the dice, alas."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Atmosphere: I really enjoyed the unique touches of this quaint and eclectic brunch spot. Not only is there a nice cozy patio in the back of the restaurant, as we were leaving, we also noticed a cute tiny area at the front of the restaurant, where you can dine and people watch.  Service: One huge perk about this restaurant is they accept reservations for brunch. Most brunch places I have been to do not accept reservations and come with long wait times. Our server was friendly and attentive, and the food came out quickly, within 10-15 minutes from the time we ordered.   Food: I shared a sweet and savoury dish with my girlfriend.  - Ballina (4/5 stars - $18) - The smoked salmon egg benedict dish was absolutely delicious. The smoked salmon had just the right amount of salt, balanced with the sweetness and slight tanginess of the leek fondue sauce on top of a perfectly poached egg. There wasn't anything else on the plate to rave about, but the star of the dish definitely shined.    - Pistachio Waffle (3/5 stars - $15) - On the first bite, the waffle was fluffy, and I really enjoyed the toasted coconut and roasted banana combination. However, I found the creme anglaise to be on the sweet side. Unfortunately, because this dish was eaten after the egg benedict, the waffle became a bit soggy as there was quite a bit of sauce.   Overall, I would return to this restaurant for the convenience factor. Although there is some good potential with the food, I do wish there was a bit more creativity, especially for their sides such as the home fries."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place when we were out for a walk. Decided to try the brunch. Found it very warm inside but we sat on the newly opened 3rd floor and it was great. Was a little worried that we would be ignored up there but that wasnt the case. We started with the scones and coffee cake which was lovely with the jam and lemon curd. My husband ordered the Brisket Hash and I had the huevos rancheros. Both were fantastic. Way too much food. Ended up taking half the brisket home for lunch tomorrow. Will definitely be going back. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Super Duper overrated in my opinion. Some people are too concerned with a trendy popular spot rather than actually delicious food that stands out from the crowd. There's nothing really special on this menu but you can't find in a dozen other places around town. Not bad, not the greatest servers"}
{"text":"The staff member lost our reservation we made 1 week prior. While we were waiting, the servers were rude (as if it was our fault our reservation was lost). Our party understood that they were busy with the brunch crowd, however the service's attitude was poor. We waited probably an extra 30-45 mins for our table.  The food was good. However, the experience was not."}
{"text":"Mood/Decor 4/5 I found a new brunch place! The decor is modern contemporary with some eclectic touches like antlers on the wall that give the place a unique twist. The tables were nicely set with sprigs of flowers on the tables and china plates, which added an elegant charm to the place.  Downstairs the walls are painted white and white booths contrast nicely with the black chairs. The black fire place also breaks up the walls and booths. Upstairs is more dining space and a bar as well. In the unisex washroom, the sink water is operated by pressing on a pedal stool, which I thought was awesome and added cool element to the place. It makes the place a great place to have brunch, hangout, or have a date.  Food 4/5  I ordered the Smith Benedict, which comes with 2 eggs on English muffins. The poached eggs are served with a leek fondue instead of the traditional hollandaise sauce, pea meal bacon, home fries, and fresh fruit. I liked how non greasy everything was. The pea meal bacon was cooked well; not too salty or greasy. The portion sizes are large and the coffee served was fresh and hot. I found the brown cubed sugar in the small bowls with a tiny spoon adorable. My only critique would be that while the cream and milk came in cute glass containers there should have been more in there, rather than us having to constantly ask for more.  My boyfriend got the Smith Breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage, tons of toast, and fresh fruit. When we asked for the food to be packed up, they were thoughtful enough to pack the toast separately so that it didn't get soggy. Looking over at the other tables, I want to try out their French toast and scones next time.   Service 5/5 Everyone from the host, to our waitress, to the food runners were friendly and attentive. We had our orders taken shortly after we sat down and the food came out promptly as well.   I'm always on the look for a new brunch place and I'm glad that I found another one that I like."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed everything about this restaurant, but I thought it was a bit overpriced.  The ambiance is just great. We were sat upstairs by a window and I really liked the dark, intimate and kitschy chic vibe. The service was very good and he was very nice, despite the fact that the rest of my party was half an hour late (never trust the Greyhound to be on time!), and we all had some kind of deathly food allergy. The bathrooms are unisex with separate stalls, including at least one where the wall is a foggy mirror, which is disconcerting at best. The sinks are old school water fountains, which is kind of cool, but it took me a while to figure out that to get a good height on the water, you have to step on BOTH pedals.   The food was tasty, but the portions were small considering the price. I ordered the lamb, which was good, but not anything out of the ordinary. There were bits of hard leaves in it (bay leaves?) which were inedible and I had to subtly remove them from my mouth, as they seemed to be mixed in the food and unavoidable.   I don't think I'll be returning. There were a lot of good things about this place, but they were offset by others things that brought the experience down."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch in November. The place was full so they took us to the heated patio area. Boy were we impressed by the cozy atmosphere, menus, and delicious breakfast. I would highly recommend this place and their Huevos Rancheros!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere here, service is a bit on the slower side because of this place is so popular but the atmosphere here is so nice I would recommend this place for a summer engagement or birthday party sort of event. Their backyard light-bulb lit area is super romantic!  Atmosphere: 5/5 Price: 3/5 Presentation: 3/5 Taste: 3/5 Portion: 3/5 Service: 3/5  Atmosphere: This seems to be a very brunch place. Really nice decor all around. There are many floors to this place and our table of 20 got seated in a very cozy backyard-feel type industrial, bricks with warm blankets! Love love love the stairs that lead up to the bathroom here as well. Would definitely plan a cozy intimate gathering here with my close friends when the weather gets warmer!! Can also see this seating area being ideal for dinner setting with the dim lit lights.   Price: This place is priced on the higher side for the type of food you are getting.   Presentation: All of their brunch dishes are served in iron-cast pans so nothing really different here in terms of presentation.  Taste: Taste was about average.  Portion: Portions are on the smaller side. Their brunch plates could use more sides.  Service: The wait for a table here on a Sunday afternoon was not as long as you would anticipate for a group of 20. The staff here are extremely friendly and very willing to be of service! Thanks for all the group photos!"}
{"text":"Lovely interior design, nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  If you are planning to come on a weekend I'd recommend to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Overpriced for quality. Not terrible but nothing to rave about either. Huevos Rancheros were bland even with hot sauce. There are way better brunch spots in Toronto for a better price point as well. Decor is nice but it's also very hot inside!   Was here with a group and must have been charged a group rate. $30 set price for brunch which would have been fine if it included a lot, but it was just a brunch entree and some shared mini donuts and scones. Would have just preferred to have the entree. After an autograt was added, we ended up paying $80 for two people. Didn't even include alcohol. This was for two entrees, two coffees, and a few bites of scone and donuts. We could have a nice dinner WITH alcohol for that price. Not worth it for a mediocre brunch. I get that large groups are a pain but the autograt should have been enough. I was a server before too so I know that groups can be tough sometimes but it would have been nice to have the option to order just an entree for the regular price. We would have tipped well regardless. Definitely let down."}
{"text":"On my hunt for Toronto's best brunch spots, I went to Smith with 2 friends to try it out. All in all, a solid spot: The ambiance/decor was casual and comfy enough for brunch and stimulated long conversations over 7 cups of coffee.  Their freshly baked scones with lemon custard are to die for: warm and moist. We all ordered the huevos rancheros and loved it! The salsa and guac were fresh, eggs perfectly runny and tortillas warm.  Service was solid - friendly enough to make small talk with us, professional enough to see we were engrossed in our own debates to leave us alone.  I would like to try a few more dishes before giving it a 5/5, which means I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Was looking for a brunch place nearby and as the place we had in mind was closed, we decided to pop into this place instead.  So happy that we did. I got the Huevos Rancheros while my partner grabbed the Smith Breakfast. We were both pretty pleased with our meals. The service was pretty good. Our server told us that new menus were being determined and was friendly and attentive.  We dined on the balcony. It was a little scary.... what if birds came by?? But they didn't. And we enjoyed a lovely brunch in a secluded spot."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars.  I came here for brunch today at 11:30 and it was already packed. One thing I like is that you can make reservations online which not a lot of places have that option for brunch. So when we arrived, we only waited about 5 minutes before being seated. Smith has two floors, and we were seated upstairs. I wish we could sit near the window (for good lighting when it comes to snapping pics of your food), but we sat near the bar.   I had the huevos rancheros which was recommended by our server. And my bf had the brisket hash (popular favourite). We also started with the mini donuts which I definitely recommend! It comes with a lemon curd dip and when paired with the donuts.. It tastes like perfection. My huevos rancheros was delicious, it was a pretty big portion IMO. And you may think the brisket hash looks small but they really fill you up with the briskets! I tried the brisket, and I found it to be tender and not salty. Really tasty! Service was good, our server was attentive and quite efficient so props to him. I can totally see myself coming back here again..great spot!"}
{"text":"The best thing I liked about this restaurant is that they take reservations for brunch. I had the Smith Benedict (pea meal bacon benedict) and it was really good. My friends also enjoyed their meals. We ordered the donuts because they were recommended on yelp- they were just ok. Nevertheless, I would definitely go back because of the good meal and lack of wait for brunch."}
{"text":"One of my mainstay brunch places. Mainly because it's close. Always have a table to walk in and sit down as it's huge. I always order the classic breakfast or brisket hash. Both are good, not great. Drinks are amazing. Dinner is below average and I wouldn't return for that. Consistently good, but a brunch place with available seating is at a premium!"}
{"text":"My friend Bill and I met here this morning at 10am (when they open on Sundays), we've been meaning try SMITH since they opened (should of come here a long time ago because SMITH is now going to become my new best friend on the street. Considering its' at the end of my street and is just a quick 2 min walk I will for sure be coming back here over and over again !   We ordered French Toast which was served with caramelized bananas and blueberries and is out of this world yummy ! Can't have french toast without bacon, so  ordered a side of bacon with it and nice thick slices of bacon and for only an extra $3 - fantastic and you get about 5 strips which is MORE than enough. Bill had sausages and since he ate them all I can only assume they were yummy too.  The coffee was really nice and the service was FANTASTIC !!    The place is FUNKY for sure ! Seats about 30 people on the main floor and upstairs about 20.   Love the funky decor and re-purposed EVERYTHING. Little glass door knobs became vases for the table with a little delicate flower, the washrooms - VERY creative and LOVE IT!!! The decor everywhere you look is wonderful and very well though out !  Love the eclectic flatware and china.   Breakfast menu had many choices and all sounded amazing. The lunch and dinner menu looks outstanding  - can't wait to return ! :-)  I think this is my neighbourhoods best kept secret - so I'm spreading the word - YOU MUST EAT HERE !"}
{"text":"I had brunch with a party of 11 on a saturday around noon. It is very important to highlight that you wont be seated unless you come with the whole group of people. I highly recommend making a reservation since the restaurant tends to be packed for brunch.   The service was great, our server checked on us several times. I decided to eat the eggs florentine. The potatoes were crispy, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. (I think as they were plating them one of the egg yolks broke, which i was a little sad about :(). The sauce was not the typical hollandaise sauce but the taste was great and it made the whole dish come together. We also ordered mimosas, the one option that is suggested for groups of 4-6. The bottle of prosecco came in a cooler with a side of orange juice, so everybody has to serve themselves at the table.  I would definitely come back here for brunch again since the service, the aesthetics of the place, and the food were all great."}
{"text":"This place has two floors in a beautiful building. This place is a bit of a treat though, as it's $$.   The service is great and patient as well. I came here for a birthday brunch and it was as smooth as can be.  The Brisket Skillet is actually phenomenal. Of course, the mimosas are great too as they give fresh OJ!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 1 star because their food is OKAY at least. There is NO POINT AT ALL to make reservation in ahead because you are expected to wait for another half an hour or so at the door. I made a reservation of 3 but the other girl changed her mind last minute. So when I walked in and tried to talked to the lady whos arranging everybody's seat that \" is it okay I change my reservation to jus 2 ppl now? \", she quickly replied \"yes no worries can u jus wait on the stairs I'll be back to you in jus minutes.\" So there goes my 15 minutes wait. when i tried to talk to her again asking why it takes that long, she said \"oh cuz there was jus 1 of u, i cant accommodate you until 2 out of 2 are here\" I was like.......why dont you tell me when I first came in??  okay, but so far this still makes sense to me. so I came to her for the THIRD time with my friend here this time thinking that there should be no excuse anymore. She finally gave us a \"heated patio seat\" which is considered \"outside\" as well during winter time."}
{"text":"Cute decor and buzzing place for weekend brunch.  However, food was mediocre and overpriced given the quality. Ordered the baked goods platter to start, which was wayyyyyyyy too sweet. I ordered it because it includes a scone, which I love, but this scone was disappointing. Had the Ballina Benedict (smoked salmon Benedict) as my main and was rather disgusted by the quality of their salmon. It was quite slimy and tasted off. I would not recommend to come here for brunch - there are better places out there."}
{"text":"It pains me to rate this place only 2 stars, but the best thing about this place is the service (prompt & tag-team) and the setting (cool, funky, and laid-back).  Maybe just today, because I've enjoyed other meals here (love the kale caesar salad!), but the brunch was meh.  The Ballina Benny ($18) was boring and bland. If I'd had it for $10 in a small town diner, it would be fine. But not at a refined, trendy place. Nothing interesting or exciting about the dish. Instead of Hollandaise sauce they used a tasteless white cream sauce. The smoked salmon was difficult to find under the white sauce on the white muffin. The fried potatoes were huge wedges with no seasoning. And the fruit was large chunks of honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and watermelon. All the cheapest fruits available. And also bland.  Skip brunch here and go to any diner - cheaper and basically the same experience."}
{"text":"arrived early and couldn't be seated, so they suggested waiting - single-file- in the stairwell. While I understand this is reasonable under normal conditions, this instruction was relayed to an 8-month's pregnant woman. Could a seat not have been offered? Everything else was great - service was fine once seated, and the food and ambience was great - but the greeting was a touch surly - this is Toronto, not the lower east side NYC."}
{"text":"I give 5 starts to their customer service but 1 to the food. I had pancakes today. I've never had such bad pancakes before! It was very very dry."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the \"poached\" eggs were soft-boiled by the time they reached the table."}
{"text":"Went for their winterlicious menu. Ordered the shrimp and chorizo gumbo, some sort of fish, and a creme caramel. My friend had the gumbo, steak and frites, and some sort of lemon curd.   Gumbo tasted like a can of chunky soup. They used a tin of salad shrimp. We then waited an hour for them to bring out the main. Both the fish and the steak & frites tasted like salt. The fish also had a strong oil, but the salt overpowered all other tastes. The accompanying vegetables were also seasoned with salt. The dishes could have actually been called \"salt with fish\" and \"salt with frites\".  The desserts were a mixed bag. The lemon custard was nice. My creme caramel was watery and tasted far too strongly of ginger. I couldn't eat more than a bite of it.  Where ambiance was concerned, it's staffed by apathetic hipsters. Our waitress didn't come by for almost an hour between courses. Surprising since the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"came here with my in-laws for mother's day brunch.  it's a very nice atmosphere here. very attractive servers.  large portions - i remember getting the beef brisket and really had a hard time finishing it."}
{"text":"I came here for a Winterlicious  for a 3 course dinner that includes an appetizer, entrée and dessert. It's a nice small restaurant in the Church-Wellesley area. I made reservations beforehand and my party was seated immediately at 7PM. Our table was nicely decorated with décor, a nice flower vase and the lights were dimmed so it was more of a candelit dinner. Our server was quite friendly and helpful giving us recommendations. For the appetizer, I ordered the salmon tartar with avocado, orange, chive, yuzu and chillies. The tartar was quite good and very flavorful. It was a perfect appetizer to order and a great way to start a meal. For the entrée, I ordered the steak Frites with the crispy onion, chimichurri butter and jus. I got the steak medium rare and it came in a skillet full of crispy onion rings and fries. I was very impressed by the portion of the steak and the amount of onion rings and fries they gave. The steak was simply delicious, juicy, tender and cooked to perfection. Definitely one of the better steaks I've had recently. The steak frites entrée was quite filling and they gave a great portions of the steak. Lastly, for dessert, I ordered the lemon curd with wiss meringue and shortbread crumble. It was a bit too sour for me so I wasn't too fond of the dessert. My lips were puckered because I couldn't stand the sourness. Overall, it was good Winterlicious dining experience and I would be back to get the steak again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the last couple of months and I must say that the food and service has been consistently good.    I've tried their omelettes, waffles, french toast, and their sides of bacon and sausage.    The ambiance is great for brunch with friends, but it does tend to get crowded on weekends so I do recommend reservations.    My one and only beef with this place is that they charge you for jam...so, if you get toast with your bacon & eggs and ask for jam, you will be charged for it...which makes no sense to me, but whatevs.  Other than that, this place is great.  I would highly recommend...food is delicious, consistent and service is always good with prices being what you'd expect to pay in Toronto (maybe even a little cheaper than some brunch spots in this city)."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch as part of a group of 7, with a reservation.   Ambience is pretty hipster, with mismatched tiny plates, milk in tiny glass bottles, servers dressed down, etc.   NOTE: The weekend brunch menu on Smith's website is NOT current. Some of the items are the same but there are many differences.   I ordered the pancakes with the toppings on the side. The maple cream and berry compote were flavourful and complemented eachother well, however the pancakes were overcooked.   I tried my husband's Egg Balladina (poached eggs with lox and home fries) - pretty tasty.   We also ordered a scone to share - menu didn't specify any flavours and neither did the server, so I assumed it was a plain but it was actually a raisin scone (cue heavy sobbing). Despite having raisins, the scone was good when paired with the lemon cream it came with.  Service was relaxed. When we got the check, we realized no one in our group had been charged for scones (4 were ordered in total) - we brought this to the attention of a server, who went to speak to someone, quickly returned, and said not to worry about it. Nice touch!  Overall, mix of pros/cons. I wouldn't make the trek here from Mississauga again, but if I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind returning and trying something new."}
{"text":"Unassuming entry way, we thought we were walking into a law firm.  The decor is rustic and laid back, and we loved the mismatched vintage plates and utensils.  We came in a larger group of about 8 to kick off my bachlorette.    The portions are very generous, I had the benny and I was not able to finish my food.  The service was great and we had a lovely time."}
{"text":"Smith caught my eye a little while back, cute house on Church with a newspaper box out front with it's menus printed on newsprint.  We went for brunch and it was really enjoyable.   I love that they have set items on their menu that they make slightly different each day or maybe week? Makes me want to go back to see what they have next time. :)  For example, their scones that day were cinnamon cranberry scones with candied pecans and a pear and amaretto jam. The pecans were by far my favourite part because they were still crunchy and flavourful which suggested they toasted them before mixing them into the scones batter. Gotta love that attention to detail.  I had the Smith Benedict which was peameal bacon, poached eggs and a leek fondue. It was good but not at the level of the scones or the potatoes...   And while the Benny may change I hope they never change their potatoes because they were amazing. I'm pretty sure they boil them first and then deep fry or roast them at a high temperature because they were light and fluffy on the inside and very crispy and caramelized on the outside with a hint of thyme. Delicious!  We sat upstairs which was really cute but I was right beside a staircase up to another level which meant I did have to move a few times to let people through.  There were two large tables beside us and it looked like a great setup for a large group for brunch.  All in all a great experience and one of the nicer brunches I've had in the city."}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch as it was one of the few places that took reservation. I like the funkiness of the  restaurant that included a random bowl of yarn on the table?? Menus are on newspaper prints which is a unique touch, but a little difficulty to fight for elbow room for everyone to open them up. I appreciate the small menu options where a good variety was available. However at 1pm, I wish the menu options included more lunch options as well as brunch.  I had the Smith Salad which was quite good. It had the right level of dressing, flavor combination, and texture combination. I also had a piece of waffle to share and the texture of the fresh waffle was amazing. I wish I had the room to try more dishes.  I was thoroughly confused by the bathroom sinks, where you had to foot pedal what looked like water fountains."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant with amazing service and even better food! I would highly recommend this place for a date night,  The meals are reasonably priced but the drinks are on the higher end of things (but delicious)."}
{"text":"Service was quick and good. Food was fine, nothing mind blowing. I thought my eggs benny was a little cold. And a lot pricey for the quality. I liked the coffee and free refills. I would go back with friends,  but wouldn't go out of my way for it.  Ps. They take resos!!!! Huge plus. I usually avoid brunch because I hate the waits. They will not, however, seat you until your whole party arrives, even with resos. Such a mixed bag..."}
{"text":"I loved this place. My girlfriends and I came here for late brunch. We all ordered briskets with egg on top as our waiter described the dish so well. We went to the third floor near the solarium was and we saw toe shoes hanging from the wall - we loved the display. The food was delicious but more so our waiter, a girl(tall short hair) with short hair she was so nice. I haven't had that genuine customer service for a while."}
{"text":"I would have given a higher rating if it weren't for the poor service (the food was very good). I had a reservation for two and arrived on time. My friend had not yet arrived and they would't seat me until he did; my table sat empty while I was made to stand in the cramped hallway. I don't understand why they wouldn't seat me and let me order a beverage while I waited. It left a bad taste in my mouth, not a good first impression."}
{"text":"2.5 review, but rounded up. The brunch menu was interesting and we had high expectations going in. However, the food was a bit disappointing. The best part was the scones so you must get that. The benedict didn't have much taste to it and the ham had a bit of a sour taste. The omelette was something that you could've made at home. The service was great and topping our cappucinos / expressos up with coffee after we were finished was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I went there on  Sunday morning for Brunch. It was rainy outside, and very packed inside. :-) the waiting line is long , i think around 12 ppl waiting for a table. Therfore : RESERVATION is essential.  Very indie style, specially thier menu.  I really liked it.  I hade the Brisket and a fruit plate. It is a decent size portion and very tasty. Highly recommended to come with big hunger :-) i will definitly go back again and try other items in the menu."}
{"text":"This place looks small from the outside, but it's actually quite large when you take into consideration the patio and the other levels.  I came here for a birthday and they sat us on the second floor which was kind of nice because we basically had our own floor.  There were some smaller tables but they never ended up getting filled.  On the third floor we could hear a private party of some sort going on as well.  The decor is cute and kitschy.  The service was friendly as well.  It was summerlicious when we came - so no regular menu options.  I ordered the chowder, fettuccine and the apple dessert.  I thought the food was somewhat overpriced compared to what you would get at a similarly priced restaurant for summerlicious.    The chowder was delicious.  It was a bit oily but had a lot of meaty chunk, potato, vegetables and a lot of flavour.  The pasta was also tasty and was a hearty meat sauce.  The dessert I wasn't a big fan of as it was a really dense cake.    Here's the kicker though; that evening, I was hit with excruciating stomach pains.  Needless to say, I had food poisoning.  It lasted the rest of the night (had to call it quits early at the bar because I did not want to use their bathrooms!).    Despite that unfortunate incident, I have heard Smith's brunch is really good."}
{"text":"I have to say I love the lay out of this place. So many spots and nooks - hard not to enjoy this place. I do want to give this place another shot especially for brunch.  My order itself was not so great, the pizza. I would not order again. At the same time, the other dishes  such as the tartar, the in house pasta and salad that they ordered they seem to have enjoyed.  The wait for one order was absolutely silly. Even with the wait the server was doing her best until it arrived.  So until i pop over the next time, it's a 3.25 this time round."}
{"text":"The short story is that it's overpriced and the wait is a killer.   To be fair, they do accept reservations however, that isn't really something people do for a hungover brunch. The food is not great and definitely doesn't warrant the price."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. I would agree with everything the post from 7 days ago said (good food, service, washrooms, wait time,etc.)  Coffee could be improved but everything else is go great I would still give 5 stars.  Have been many times and will be back again"}
{"text":"I really loved my brunch time here!  Love the design of the space, the little details and good service. We were offered coffee shortly after being seated, which was good and bottomless. Must've had 3+ cups as they frequently come around to top up.  Started with Housemade Doughuts - love it! Soft inside with a crisp exterior, Love the cinnamon sugar on top. Great on its own or with the lemon curd.   Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon - the English muffin just a tad hard but eggs were poached perfecty (yolk runs out when you cut it!) Great leek sauce, since I don't like Hollandaise. Home fries good; large chunk pieces.   Tried a bit of the Brisket Hash - again another perfectly poached egg. Beef with the cheese sauce is really good. Def a filling, hearty dish."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 near 4 stars.  I went with a party of 6 for Winterlicious ($25) and I think we had a pretty alright experience. I really liked the décor, other than the fact that it was a little tight and small, but it was nice because my party got seats in the front of the house and had a lot of space compared to some of the other seats. Had a very intimate setting. I will talk primarily on my dishes. I ordered the Applewood Smoked Tomato and Roasted Garlic Soup with Basil Cream, a Crispy Half Cornish Hen with a Cheese Biscuit and Red Cabbage Slaw and the Lemon Curd with Shortbread and Strawberries.  The soup was pleasant, it was a good amount of sourness from the tomato which I liked but the garlic was a little faint tasting. It wasn't amazing but it's better than your average tomato soup. I really enjoyed the hen, the skin was crispy and the maple glaze was very nice. I wasn't a fan of the slaw, it was quite monotone. I think I enjoyed the lemon curd the most. I loved the lip-smacking tartness accompanied by fresh strawberry pieces.   I want to make note that when I got home, I felt very thirsty afterwards and am wondering if the meal had something to do with it, which it probably did. One of my friends also felt thirsty too.  Overall it was a pleasant dinner with a nice atmosphere. $25 for a 3 course meal, it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service & ambiance/decor. Will definitely go back for bunch again!"}
{"text":"My fave breakfast spot in toronto.  The decor is beautiful. Best donuts in the city!!"}
{"text":"I joked with one of the management that I was going to be the second person to write a review for Smith on Yelp.  And I guess I'm going to be that person ;)  My two girl friends and I came here today for brunch (Saturday at 12 PM).  We were debating between here and Fabarnak -- but we had decided to go to Smith instead since it was new.  We heard about this place due to BlogTO's \"Top brunch places\" article that came out a week ago.  Apparently this restaurant had opened up about 2.5 months ago, and business was quite slow back then.  However, since that article came out, business has been booming like mad for them (management told us that they were packed the next day).  Decor is great.  Simplistic with a touch of traditional look to it.  Not too haughty-taughty.  I absolutely loved the mirrors that they had upstairs, mixed in with the fireplace that they had underneath it.  The downstairs area of the restaurant was packed full - however, we were lucky that they decided to open the upstairs for us.  It was nice, because it felt like we were VIPs.  We sat at a communal table -- we later had three ladies sitting next to us - and it wasn't awkward at all.  My friends and I had ordered the following:  1) Buttermilk scones (with blue cheese, and pear amaretto compote): Absolutely delicious - the special was with blue cheese.  I'm usually not the biggest fan of scones or blue cheese, but it was paired quite well with the pear amaretto compote.  Definite recommend!  2) Huevos rancheros:  According to Foursquare, somebody had recommended this place - so I ordered it myself.  I've only had huevos rancheros somewhere else before, and that was at O&B at Bayview.  I really liked Smith's Huevos rancheros better -- much more flavourful.  The potatoes served with it as well were delicious -- not too salty and quite flavourful.  - Friends had ordered the french toast and the eggs benedict (friend had changed it to a florentine because she's vegetarian).  No complaints from them.  The food was REALLY good here, and I was quite satisfied afterward.  (Also - free refills on coffee).  Our server was great (apparently he was management or something and was called in early that day at 9).  There were a few things he forgot/missed (e.g. asking the chefs if we could do eggs florentine instead of benedict, pepper, etc.).  However, he was technically supposed to work that day and doesn't usually serve food and what not - so I can write that off.  Despite that, he was quite friendly and joked with us the whole time.   Not only that, we were there for QUITE some time (about 2 hours), and they were really friendly about that as well.    Oh also - did I mention that the music here is absolutely amazing?!   I would definitely recommend this place for brunch!"}
{"text":"Ambiance - 5+ We went for brunch, it wasn't bad. I got the smith classic breakfast, the potatoes and toast were great, the rest - meh - average. My friend got the brisket hash, that looked great. I would check out the spot for sure again:)"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch which was posted to serve until 4 PM. Got here at 3pm. And caught the full switch over for the dinner. Meaning the bus trays were out to pick up coffee cups,  sugar and cream etc.. Lots of staff chatter about tasks to be done. Very distracting. Had the Smiths breakfast and it was just basic. Home fries were overcooked probably made earlier in the day, toast a bit cool,  eggs over done etc. The best thing about the whole experience was attentive service with never having my coffee cup or water glass empty. Didn't get the right change back from my money but i was shortchanged by less than a dollar so hey.  Listened to Drake the entire time and with his lyrics wouldn't have wanted to have brought Mom.  Tiny last point but still important, the unisex washrooms do not have any hooks in the stalls. Would be nice to hang up my coat, scarf and purse as I made a pitstop before I left the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Smith and wasn't disappointed. My party of three made a reservation for Sunday morning brunch a few days in advance. I highly recommend doing this as there was a line outside the door and it was pretty hectic inside, but with a reservation we were seated immediately on arrival.   We sat on the heated patio which you get to by walking around the side of building. Even though it was a cold day, I was comfortably warm.  The decor is adorably rustic, from the antique-looking silverware to the little glass jar that the milk was served in. The coffee and water cups are small, but the staff were quick to refill everything. The wait for food was quite long, but I was happy to enjoy the ambience and good company.  The prices run high ($20 for avocado toast) but the food was incredibly delicious. I ordered the Croque Monsieur, which was served with a runny egg on top, fresh fruit and home fries. The ham was the best part. So salty and delicious with the egg, soft bread and sauce.  I was super impressed with Smith and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches I've had in a long time.  I ordered the Florentine Benedict which was amazing; the eggs were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious.  Make sure to order their baked goods.  The cinnamon bun in particular was out of this world.  Added perk: it's a super cute space.  Quirky and cozy.  We were seated on the third floor which appeared to be an old ballet studio.  So cool."}
{"text":"This is a cute find on Church, with an outdoor patio which is kind of in a laneway and a funky refinished retro 30s interior (or 20s? it's not black and white you know!).  Staff was very very friendly and welcoming in a hipster east way - not saying hipster west is bad, just difference. More indifferent out there I find to east enders.  We did a benedict, regular breakfast + scones. All good. Scones were cranberry chocolate and very tasty. A bit small we could have eaten 30 of them!  Pricing was typical nice brunch spot. No complaints. Decent coffee. Safe bet for friends, mates, partners, girls and/or boys.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and brunch place! We were very satisfied with food and service! The brisket hash and egg Benedict were delicious! Also the portions were big! Recommended!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  Came here for a birthday party on a cold Saturday night. The atmosphere was very unique and rustic. We were seated upstairs where there was our party of 10 or so and another table of two. We sat near the fireplace, which warmed up the whole place, almost too warm, some of us thought. It had a dim and romantic atmosphere with a candelabra in the centre of the table.  The service was very good - friendly and attentive staff. The food was very good as well. Many people in the party ordered the fried cornish hen, which tasted so moist. I ordered the arctic char, which had a crispy skin and fatty meat. I was told that the gnocchi was also very good, pan-fried and large pieces. The portions were decent. You definitely would have to order a side or appetizer to feel more full. The bread they serve is warm and fresh. The appetizers were also tasty, including the bone marrow and octopus salad.  If I am ever in the area again, I'd probably come back here. I've heard that their brunch is pretty good, so maybe I'd try that next time!"}
{"text":"Decor is quaint and the vintage cutlery is a cute touch. Food was OK, the pulled beef brisket was nicely spiced and very tender.   The Hollandaise had terragon and shallots in it.... not hollandaise, bearnaise sauce.  I asked for hollandaise on the side as well as bearnaise and just got more bearnaise... oh well.    Bathroom was FREEZING as the door was open and it was below zero outside.  Not sure why this was a thing.  Staff kept going in and out onto the fire escape presumably to smoke.  Regardless, their convenience shouldn't take precedent over not freezing your ass off when you sit on a frozen toilet.   Bizarre.   I echo the pointlessness of waiting at the door and having to wait for the whole party to be seated.  We had a party of 2 and I had to stand and wait, again by the freezing cold front door when I could have been enjoying a mimosa (aka spending more money) as I waited 5 minutes for my dining companion.  The place was busy but there were still free tables around us once we were seated... puzzling.   The processco for the mimosas was delicious and one of the better bottles I've tried. Definitely recommend that.  You'll need the alcohol to warm up!!"}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)  I've been to Smith 3 times now and always enjoy it. It's a nice spot for late night cocktails, and it's also a relaxed weekend brunch place. There is plenty of seating over 2 floors + a side street patio. There's even a tiny patio out front, although I've never seen it in use. You may have a wait a few minutes for brunch during peak times, but I wouldn't imagine you'd have to wait too long.   The decor is very rustic chic. I loved the antique-looking mismatched tea cups and dishes. The menu is like a newspaper, which is cute.   Food is solid. There are always specials, including scones, waffles, omelettes... Definitely get the scones!! It's one of their specialties and can vary from blueberry earl gray to bacon and cheddar. Amazing when served warm out of the oven. I've had the omelettes and while the eggs could be a tad fluffier, it's a satisfying brunch dish and they always have tasty fillings.   The dinner menu looks appealing, although it's pricey. Overall, a reliable weekend brunch spot and a nice place to catch up with friends without feeling rushed."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and decor (although restaurant is a little crowded and there's not much space to stand and wait for your table). Awesome that they take reservations for brunch. I was actually thirty minutes late for our reso (TTC shuttle buses, ugh) but we were still able to be seated as soon as I arrived which was a pleasant surprise! Coffee was great, I had a decaf Americano. For food I had the croque monsieur which wasn't quite to my taste - it had a cheesy, salty leek  sauce on it that kind of over-powered the dish. The homefries were great and service was good too, I'd definitely like to go back and try a different dish."}
{"text":"Not the best place I've been to for brunch in Toronto.  Maybe it had a little to do with what I ordered.  Normally would go for the usual classic breakfast or the benedicts.   This time, I opted for something a bit unconventional.   My friend and I decided to share the scones special and beef brisket served on an iron pan.  Scones was nothing really spectacular considering the ones I had at the Kitten and the Bear.  Banana bread was a little on the dry side.  Two mini scones and a mini banana loaf all for $8.   I guess it is what it is.   Second dish- the beef brisket served over poached eggs and potatoes.   Not done too well.  They overcooked the egg so it wasn't runny.  That's a BIG no-no when it comes to eating poached eggs.  It's all about the yolk, man!  Beef was tender but too salty for my liking.     Decor was cute.   Service was ok.  Might be back again to try other items on the menu because I think the place was cute. ;)"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5  Service: 4.5/5  Atmosphere: 4.5/5   Went here for brunch on a Sunday with a few other friends and we waited for about 15 minutes. We were seated on the main floor and it was super cozy and a little smaller than I expected. The service here was very friendly and the food came out fast. My friends and I ordered an assortment of different brunch items. I ordered my go-to eggs beny with peameal bacon and I must say that the portions were huge and came with a massive amount of home fries. None of us ended up finishing our plates even though we normally clear the plates during brunch. Overall, I'd recommend this cute little brunch place when you're around church street."}
{"text":"I must say I was impressed with the whole experience from the moment we walked in. Our server was really nice and attentive, he brought us some home made yummy bread and he did his best to make our experience better.   We started with potato leak soup. It was a mild taste, not the usual restaurant style but we enjoyed it.   I tried the chicken stew with biscuits; it wasn't bad. My husband liked his salmon Benedict. The potatoes on the side were a bit dry.  Our cocktails were both delicious.   I was really impressed with the warm rustic decorations. If you haven't been upstairs yet, you should check it out. I will definitely comeback for a dinner experience.   They have lots of space for large groups. They accept credit debit card. They are very busy on weekends so you might need to reserve in advance."}
{"text":"I came here with the Yelp group for brunch and I'm glad I did. Although seating is extremely close, the setting is whimsical and friendly. This is definitely a place to hang with friends and I put back more than my usually 1-2 cups of coffee. The bathrooms are a mystery to me. They are unisex but have designations for men/women on individual stalls - something I didn't notice until I was washing my hands. The sink is a bizarre contraption of old-fashioned faucets operated by a foot pedal. I wasn't bright enough to figure this out on my own but the waitress set me straight when I asked her. Still, it's hard to wash hands properly when there's barely a drop coming out of the multiple faucets. Perhaps they were broken.  Bottom line - cute place, decent (albeit somewhat overpriced food), and weird bathrooms. Clearly you can tell which left a lasting impression on me, but don't let that stop you from visiting Smith!"}
{"text":"Love the food, lighting and atmosphere came for valentines. Staff is attentive and drinks are balanced well strong but don't taste so."}
{"text":"Good spot for brunch with good food. Went at noon Sunday with a reservation. Please note they won't seat you without your whole party. Please also note that despite a reservation there may be a wait.  Their next door neighbor is very rude and I heard him threatening to call the cops on some people so make sure you don't block their entrance.  There is no air conditioning in here! Thought I was getting heat stroke waiting in their stairwell for our table to be ready.  The food is okay. We shared the baked goods; y they were out of donuts. But the glazed donut that came with the baked goods was unimpressive. The berry was really good and the scone was good but not noteworthy. The mimosas were strong but small for the price of $12. I had the pancakes with maple creme which were good but the maple creme was on the top pancake only so the bottom three were dry. Yes, there were four. Way too much. My favor third was the sausages - they were better than your average breakfast sausage for sure! I also really really enjoyed the lemon curd and strawberry jam That came with our baked goods."}
{"text":"We booked a reservation at Smith for Summerlicious. One of the major problems was finding it though. Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door/staircase was the proper one to get inside.  Once inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD!  My brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away.  We ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the Smith Lemonade) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards.  As I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the curried carrot soup, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a Georgian Bay whitefish, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The pork chops were also raved about. There was also a risotto, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater.  The desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just chocolate ice cream, nothing special. The lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good.  I think everyone left feeling really satisfied.  It did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice. Basically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom. Also, the hand dryers were weak/not working.  That said, I wouldn't let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here! This is a nice, little place!"}
{"text":"This place is the ideal brunch restaurant for Sundays. The service is excellent and the food is great quality! I wish we had one in Chicago."}
{"text":"Super duper cute spot in LGBT-friendly area of the city. I grabbed a quick boozy brunch with two gents here one Saturday morning after enjoying drinks at Uniun the night before. My friend and I both ordered the brisket hash, so I cannot speak for the rest of the menu items. The brisket was cut with the grain, as opposed to against, leaving my meat in very long, but tender tresses. Eggs were perfectly runny but overall the dish was just alright.   The hallmark of my visit was definitely the drinks. The mimosas were perfectly poured but my rose and gin drink was refreshing and delicate.   Perhaps I made a mistake in visiting only for brunch, as the dinner menu look stunning--tartare and torchons."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch for the first time today.  The restaurant is adorable and everything about the decor is thoughtful and really cool.  The menus are printed to look like newspapers which was hilarious and a nice touch.    The service was excellent.  Our server (don't know his name but a tall guy with a beard) made sure that our water and coffee mugs never sat empty for more than a minute.  I think that poor service is a big problem in this city because brunch is such a big deal and so many restaurants are perpetually under-staffed for brunch shifts.  Especially when patrons head out for brunch after a night out, sitting and staring at an empty water or coffee mug feels painful.  This was not the case here at all, and was definitely some of the best brunch service I've experienced in the city.    My boyfriend ordered the brisket hash and it was really well done.  The meat was tender and seasoned perfectly.  I got the huevos rancheros and thought that the dish was good.  I don't love when the tortilla is toasted since I prefer to eat my huevos with my hands, and the tortillas were a little too crispy for me.  But that is a personal thing, and the flavours on the plate were pretty bomb (would be even greater if the dish was served with some sort of house hot sauce in the future!).  I also am normally not a home fry fan but these were fantastic.  Really.  The home fries were so crispy on the outside and the inside was oozing with warm soft potato.  Overall, an excellent choice for brunch.  We overhead that they take reservations too, so it seems like a great spot to bring groups or friends from out of town."}
{"text":"My Brunch review.  VIBE  Smith used to the old \"Straight\" bar owned by the same owners as Wish and 7 West. The owners definitely know their design and it's one reason why I love coming to their establishments. Really funky lighting decals, splashed mirrors and white wooden floors. It's just a cool place. Never thought I'd be listening to dance music during my brunch. It was actually a nice surprise!   Service is friendly but you almost wonder if they're listening to your conversations. But all in all, they were fine.   That's another thing: I was so close to the other diners that it didn't feel like I could have a private conversation.   WE ATE  Scones and Eggs Benny for us.  The scones were delicious! They had anise in them which gave it a liquorice taste. It was different. The creme fraiche was fantastic. Yum!   We were told Eggs Benny and Huevos Rancheros were the most popular items on the brunch menu. I'm wishing I got the Huevos.  The eggs benny was no more than a a thick slice of ham on an english muffin with the goopiest sauce (perhaps it was hollandaise because it didn't look like it!) splattered on top. It looked messy and gross and I didn't finish it.  The side potatoes were great.   Our neighbours had the waffles/pancakes and they looked fantastic. Definitely a generous portion there.  But the Eggs Benny crown remains at Easy.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Ordinary sounding name but not ordinary looking digs.  Don't get the eggs benny. Do get the scones."}
{"text":"Treat yourself to a simple and elegant brunch at this pretty little spot. The decor also reflects on the food as well."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks really nice and the service is great as well. I had the Huevos Rancheros which was really tasty. Portions are big though. In general, great place for brunch."}
{"text":"Smith and I have had a long love and hate affair. I first went to Smith in September of 2012...  1st visit:  ....When we arrived we did like the decor very much, but when we began to review the menu, we found it challenging to even just open it without feeling like we were drowning in it. It actually took us several minutes to realize that the menus were at our table unbeknownst to us. The waiter seemed nice, but because he was new he was unable to answer many of our questions, but did look into our questions and came back with the answers. My friend ordered the Smith Burger and I ordered the Steak Frites. When we received our food we only got the meat component but no sides. I found that odd because most restaurants give you a side to go with your burger or steak, but for some reason I did not think to question our dishes. I also felt bad having to ask our waiter more questions. My friend found her burger to be okay, but quite small. I ordered the steak medium-rare and it arrived medium. We were both still really hungry after we finished our meal because we did not have a starch to go with our food. I did not look into the error in our dishes which is just plain stupid. I was shy then? I can't even fathom how that is even possible. I did give Smith's bread pudding a try and I found it to be really good. So much so that I was happy to put it on my Facebook food page to let my followers and readers know how good it was. Maybe a larger piece would have been great for the price, but again, I was hungry.  Needless to say my friend was disappointed and I was embarrassed for getting her so excited about a restaurant and having her not enjoy the experience. So we decided to go to another restaurant after we settled the bill. Yes, we settled the $60 odd bill and walked over to a pub and ordered food there. We were hungry! ...and broke by that point.  That evening when I got home, I was annoyed and wrote a pretty pissy review on Tripadvisor about my experience at Smith. Shortly after I was contacted by one of the owners of Smith wanting to know what happened exactly and wanted to rectify the situation. I thought that was pretty amazing. Taking responsibility for an error. An error that I could have/should have looked into while at the restaurant. Awesome! So lucky me was sent a $50 gift certificate to return.  2nd visit:  So in April of 2013 I invited my friend Ang to come to dinner with me at Smith....  We got to Smith promptly at 5:30pm when they opened. We were the first people there and seated quickly. We reviewed the menu and I ordered another steak frites (can't help it, I love my meat) and my friend Ang ordered the fish and chips special. I ordered my steak medium and when it arrived I cut it in the middle (I learned my lesson from the September experience) and it was not cooked medium. There was very little pink in the middle of the steak. I called the waitress over and told her my predicament, \"oh sorry about that\" she said. And then walked away. What?! So I called her over again and told her that I needed a new steak. \"Oh\" she said, \"sorry, I will tell the chef.\" Less than 10 minutes later I got a new steak and it was cooked perfectly. Cool, I was a happy camper.  My friend described her meal as okay and the portion was pretty small. Meh. Oh well. I was happy with my steak and fries. Even the fries were good--thinly cut and crispy.  For dessert I ordered the bread pudding to share because I really liked it the last time I was there. As we waited for the dessert I saw several parties arrive. Then I noticed these parties receiving the exact same bread. Do you have to pay for the bread? We did not get any. And if you do pay for it, is it that good that everyone in the restaurants has ordered it? I had a feeling that no, you did not have to pay for it. So I called the waitress over and asked her about this mysterious bread. \"Ah, the bread is an olive bread that the chef made today.  We are giving it to the customers for them to sample.\" \"Mmm\" I said, \"can we have some too?\" \"Oh, you want some?\" She said. Really? You have given every table some to try. Are we invisible?! \"Yes we would like to try it.\" Oh for heaven's sake.   My review is too long, so to read about my Summerlicious experience, please check my blog: http://noregretsjustlive.com/2013/07/20/smith-i-give-up/"}
{"text":"First off, they take their decor very seriously at Smiths, just by  looking at the 100 plus posted pics of the interior  you can tell.  We had already eaten brunch at another restaurant, so just like Deana from the Jersey Shore, we as well love drinking during the day.  I ordered the smith punch, it had reminiscent flavours of a mimosa, but it also had a tropical flare to it.  I love that it was shaken, because i liked the crushed ice in it.  My sis had the minimalist, with gin, elder flower, lime, and cava.  It came to the table and was a beautiful colour, it was on the sweet side, but it was delicious.  To go along with our drinks, we ordered the scones with preserves.  The scones were on the dense side, but they had tremendous flavour from the cheese and herbs.    Overall, the service was excellent, the drinks were fab, and i will definitely come back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Dining at a restaurant during a city's \"restaurant week\" can be hit or miss. My dinner at Smith was a home run.  I had three courses for $38. For the 1st course I picked beef tartare, 2nd the steak frites, and 3rd an apple tart. Each portion was very generous and delicious. I also appreciated the friendly service (thx, Marion) and the restaurant's relaxed yet elegant downstairs dining room. There is also additional upstairs seating and a cute \"secret\" patio in the rear.  Count me a fan!"}
{"text":"I came here to do some work on my computer when this place was in \"restaurant mode\" (and not a bar at night). They have free wifi and a check-in offer for 10% off on Tuesday and Wednesday. It's kind of an expensive place but the drinks and food are good so I'd say it's worth it for the area.   I got the Southern fried chicken which the waiter said is their signature dish. Reminiscent of my visit to New Orleans but this one tasted much better than the ones I got down south. The scotch bonnet honey sauce was delicious. It came with brussels sprouts which were yummy too, as well as corn, which was actually much tastier than I thought it would be.   My drink was Kentucky Summer. It had blackberry and premium bourbon. It was pretty good too ($13, probably because of the Bulleit... Other cocktails cost less). The waiters were really friendly, especially my first one (I was there for a while). They had quite the selection of tea. They are definitely ready for any influx of tea snobs that may come through the door. I ended up getting a white tea (that the waiters thought was herbal--I think I just outed myself as a tea snob) and it was very light and tasty (or maybe not a tea snob since tea snobs probably don't use \"light and tasty\" to describe tea).   I just realized that I had a very American south-themed dinner with the bourbon cocktail and southern fried chicken.  As for the washroom, this is a restaurant in the Church-Wellesley village and I think the co-ed/unisex/multi-sex/gender washroom perfectly addresses the needs of the community to have inclusive (re: sex and gender) washrooms. I can understand concerns about mixed bathrooms but I'm thinking it's great for the T, T and 2 in LGBTT2Q. It's also the perfect excuse for not renovating! I thought the pedal to turn on all those fountains was fun and unique. It reminded me of elementary school.  This is a good place for food in the Church-Wellesley village that has wifi and I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area. I'll also make sure I'm not driving so I can try more drinks on their elaborate cocktail menu. I'm curious to try their brunch too. Friendly service, fancy cocktails, good food, free wifi... It's a good place, albeit a bit expensive, and I'd recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Made a reservation online for brunch the past Sunday for 1pm. Even though our party of 5 was on time, we still had to wait until 1:30pm to finally be seated. Had to constantly check with the hostess how long it would be. Really defeats the purpose of being able to make a reservation.  Finally got seated upstairs on the second floor. Decor was cute, but the restaurant was super dusty. We sat at the table by the window and kept seeing dust particles fly everywhere from the curtains. Music was way too loud for conversations. Asked the server if they could turn it down, response we got was \"I'll see what I can do\" aka nothing.   Had to wait another 30 minutes for our food to arrive, so we didn't start eating till around 2:20pm. Ordered the ballina (smoked salmon) benedict and donuts. The donuts ended up coming before the actual meal. At this point we were so hungry we just ate it first. They were super soft and fluffy and would recommend. Finally our meals came. The benedict was typical, nothing spectacular but the potatoes were nice and crispy.   Overall, probably won't go again for mediocre food due to the wait and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the cutest little spot for brunch! While their menu could be a little more creative, their portions are huge and their homefries hit the spot :)  TIP: Ask to be seated in the sunroom around the corner - one of the most gorgeous little places in the city in my opinion :)"}
{"text":"My one Summerlicious experience this year was at Smith for lunch.  It was close enough to our office, so my coworker and I decided to check it out instead of our usual haunt, Fabarnak.  I wasn't sure if Smith was even open for lunch as it normally is closed during weekdays.  I tried to call ahead but no answer on the phone.  Arrived around noon and was happy to see that it was open.  We chose to sit in the back patio which was very cozy and comfy.  Unfortunately, it started to rain about 10 min. later but the servers were happy to open up a big awning to protect us.  From the Summerlicous menu, I chose the Smith salad, the salmon main and the brownie dessert.  My coworker chose mostly the same but opted for the pasta main.  Because we were pressed for time to be back at work for a meeting at 1pm, we let the servers know and they did a really good job pushing our orders forwards ahead of a bigger party sitting next to us.  The highlight of the meal was the Smith salad which had a great tangy dressing with crunchy candied pecans.  My salmon was a thick hearty piece but for me, a little underdone.  And because were on a bit of a time limit, I didn't send it back to be cooked a little more.  We asked for our dessert to be packed up to go.  It was just a simple brownie, whipped cream on the side with a few blueberries.    I wish we had more time to enjoy our meal but we were limited in time and the down pour of rain was slowly splashing on us.  Overall, I thought $15 was a great price point for this 3-course lunch.  Service was friendly and prompt.  I'd gladly come back for the dinner offerings."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner. We tried the duck and black cod. The food tasted good, but portions were very small leaving us hungry despite a $90 bill. However, the worst part was the service. The waiters were not very attentive. They took a long time to clear our empty drinks. The place is too pretentious.  For this price, you're better off going to a high-end restaurant."}
{"text":"This place ruined our mood. That's hard to do if we get to eat brunch. VERY, very hard. But here we are, a failed experience at Smith for Sunday brunch. I can't even tell you what went wrong because it felt like everything and nothing. Service was okay, when we received it. Food was good, when we received it. I think it was all that damn waiting without being acknowledged. That pissed me off.  Sunday brunch is always busy anywhere, so we expected the waiting at the door. But nobody acknowledged us (or the other guests standing there waiting). No guest count...nothing. Just walking by past us trying to get food and drinks to tables. After all of that waiting we were led up to the second floor to be seated. For some reason the other tables that were to be seated on the second floor, went back down. We were left up there without any staff...just standing there. The second floor bartender/server/everything guy showed us to our seat. Then we sat around waiting for water, for anything.  Tables that were seated AFTER us got to place their order, their drinks and their damn food before us. We would've loved to get the attention of anyone...but they just avoided us until they had time. We would've loved to leave but by now we were HUNGRY. When we finally got our order in...we waited some more. At least this time they comped our coffee and latte because the latte didn't show up for at least 20 minutes.  Trying to order was so annoying. Our server was clearly in a rush because my fiance had to stop him and ask him for the rest as he was walking away. The side sausage, brisket hash and huevos rancheros came first. Then we had to remind the server of our order of donuts. Everything was good, except the donuts weren't as advertised - wasn't sure where the lemon curd was.  Again we had to wait for the bill. We had to wait for water to be refilled, other tables got a jug of water...but our table was a special table in waiting hell.  Get more servers for fucks sake."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for breakfast while visiting our daughter in Toronto . Our daughter had been here before and said it was good . We had breakfast here and we're very please with their food . Highly recommend . We will go here again ."}
{"text":"Food was a little over priced for what we received. Presentation was nice. Food prep was OK. I had the steak and frites. Nice cut of meat but basic taste. They have an interesting interior and an alley way type rear patio which is rather cool. Service was acceptable.   It appears that brunch is when to go.   We won't go back but if you do it won't be bad."}
{"text":"Went to the nearby Farbarnak for dinner and it was completely booked and could not seat us, so I went on Yelp to look for another restaurant. Only two reviews but both five stars, must have potential.  The place is small and the ambiance is very romantic. Not what we were expecting. And as romantic as it was, the lighting was waaaay too dark, and we had trouble reading the menu and we could not see what we were eating at all. We were seated upstairs because it was full downstairs.  The menu is written on newsprint and it opens up to be gigantic, with 4 folds, which made it hard to navigate.   The prices were surprisingly high. Each entree ranged from $20 to $30 with the average being $27. The bread costs money. $3. Seriously?  The service was a bit pretentious. Our server appeared to be polite but kept pushing us to order more food and we felt like we were being pushed out because we didn't want desserts or more drinks.   The food was more than good, which made the place at least 3-stars.  We ordered: - mill st. organic - the minimalist cocktail: Great drink and not too sweet - top sirloin: the steak itself was too hard and jerky, but the mushrooms and mash potatoes were phenomenal. - morroccan chicken: we actually had real pieces of chicken--drumstick and everything. The chicken was tender and juicy, but the flavour was only on the skin. The coucous, and I cant tell what is in the couscous (i think i tasted apricot and olives, and yellow squash, among other things) because I cannot see what's in my plate, was really good.  The above was over $70 before tax.  Perhaps I'd come back for brunch and see what the hype is about, but I likely would not come back for dinner."}
{"text":"It was a nice Sunday brunch experience here with my friends. But you need to make a reservation before you came. Otherwise big line up always. We all like to food here. I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"This places has an incredibly cute, clean and fresh decor. Ate on the charming patio. Was served coffee in cups for ants, they were quick to refill, but a decent sized coffee cup is a brunch must for me. Got the eggs benny. English muffin wasn't toasted, so the dish lacked substance, structural integrity and, most importantly, CRUNCH. Hollandaise was nice, provided us with some nice hot sauces. Huevos rancheros looked fresh but tasted bland, poor execution. Healthy sized potato bites were pretty nice."}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice in decor, ambiance.    However the food was not... Went there for brunch, I ordered Eggs Benedict.  It was one of the worst eggs benedict I had in Toronto!  The 'leek fondue' was very watery, and bland in taste.  I prefer the regular hollandaise sauce!  Anyway I don't really like it and won't come back for brunch."}
{"text":"This was such a cute brunch place! Loved the kooky, mismatched decor. The staff seemed pretty cool.  I ordered the Smith crepe and although it was a bit too sweet for my liking, I'll still probably return to try some of their other brunch offerings."}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant that makes you feel warm and welcomed on a cold January day. It seems like you walked into someone's old house. I was looking for a brunch spot to try near IamYoga studio and landed here. I was not disappointed. The pancake was absolutely delicious. They have free coffee refills and the crowd is young (20's) I'd say. On weekends they only have the brunch menu available.  There's also an upstairs spot with a bar. The washroom is unisex and has a unique decor. I'm glad I tried this place out. The service was good and I left with a great experience in mind."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch spot in the city. I've been here for Winterlicious a well, and I still have to come back for dinner. Super cute decor, great waiters, and amazing food.   Just don't forget to make reservations."}
{"text":"Originally my group had reservations at a different restaurant down the street that was too loud to even talk, so we stumbled upon Smith who took all 7 of us with open arms. We wanted a quiet space and the host set us up with our own table on the second level. Beautiful ambiance and interior design was on point with great details. The menu had a variety to choose from however would be between $$-$$$. Chose the roasted lamb loin. Sauce was amazing however I couldn't really taste the truffle in the ratatouille. Very fresh ingredients and flavours all combined well together. Portion was fair but more could be desired. The waitress showed us around and let us know about the patio for next time. Excited to return!"}
{"text":"Came here late on a Sunday for breakfast/brunch and it was great that they were serving breakfast till 4.   My girlfriend and I ordered the Brisket Hash and the Huevos Rancheros.   The Brisket Hash was poached eggs atop beef brisket atop home fries. The Heuvos Rancheros was poached eggs on a tortilla covered with sour cream, beans and guacamole with a  side of home fries and two slices of watermelon.  The food was great, the servings were plentiful, the atmosphere was lovely and the service was quick as well (we went at a time when there were only two other tables occupied). It's also located in a very nice area in the Church-Wellesley village, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Pretty patio, not great food, worse service.  A bunch of friends and I went here for appetizers and drinks, on a Friday night.  We waited between 30 to 45 minutes, for our drink orders.  At one point, the server brought the wrong drink, and explained she had substituted (without verifying if this was ok) because the bar had run out of Sprite and 7Up (Huh?!  There's a convenience store about 50 feet away).  I ordered the caprese salad.  It was awful.  The \"chef\" had poured some sort of oily, salty, thick goop over all of it.  I barely touched it.  The server walked by three times, and didn't say anything.  On time #4, I finally asked her to take it away, and  politely explained why it wasn't very good...and it still ended up on my bill!  However, their patio is very well designed and nice.  It's a shame the rest of the restaurant doesn't match up."}
{"text":"The meals here seem to lack the flourish that I was expecting. I came excited to have the avocado toast, but changed my mind when I saw it at the table beside us. For $19, I would have expected something more interesting that just sliced tomatoes and poached eggs on it. I went with the Florentine Benedict instead but again, it lacked that something special. On the plus side, the bathroom was really neat (if you can figure out how to use the sink) and they take reservations for brunch."}
{"text":"I would say this place is cozy because the tables are all so close and it's very small, but the place is freezing so not very cozy. I kept my coat on the entire time. I was seated near the coat rack so I did a lot of moving and shuffling out of the way.   The server had a bit of an attitude and got annoyed with me for asking for a clean mug. The food was pricey but decent. Highly recommend ordering the mimosas for 4-6. It's only $45 and the Prosecco was delicious. We enjoyed the mimosas so much that my friend ended up getting a tattoo later that evening...   Something I found odd: the hostess refused to seat my friend until the entire party arrived, so she was forced to stand the in VERY crowded doorway. We contemplated leaving and going to Fran's."}
{"text":"Smith is a OK place for brunch.   Love the second floor dining area, which feels like I am in someone house instead of a restaurant.  Service is A-OK even as a big group (10).  Me and My Yelp friend shared:  Smith Benedict ($15) - I enjoyed the Leek Fondue Sauce which is a lot lighter and feels even healthier than the usual hollandaise  - The eggs were poached perfectly  French Toast ($12) - Quite standard in presentation and taste... - The local sourced maple syrup though is a nice touch  Coffee ($3) was fresh brewed and really good.. I ended up having at least 5 cups...  I might come back to Smith if I am in the neighbourhood, but I won't be rushing back!"}
{"text":"The interior and the food is very good at Smith but one of the main reasons that I go back is the great attutude of the manager there. We ususally go for Saturday and Sunday brunch and the manager is always present and she is very accomodating and make sure that you get what you want.  Overal I recommend the restaurant and although I haven't been there for dinner but I heard a lot of good reviews about it."}
{"text":"Great for brunch. Food and service was really good. Better than the places immediately around it. It can get crowded, but they have three stories and do their best to fit you in. The baked goods were delicious. I had a frittata which was delicious. My friends had the hash, eggs benedict and the cobb salad. All were really good. Bathroom is cold, but so cute. So check it out."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time and it was delicious!  A sense of pride and creativity come through in the cocktails and the food. Staff was friendly and attentive. The bartender makes a great Moscow Mule, and the fries are to die for. Had lamb and mussels - both done perfectly. Make a reservation as it is always full for dinner."}
{"text":"I called 20 min before I would get there and they had no problems reserving a table for me and my friends the service was great the food was amazing"}
{"text":"Excellent service and brunch food. The pistachio crepe was out of this world. Very sweet so only for those with a sweet tooth. Delicious huevos rancheros as well. Outdoor patio is very cute."}
{"text":"The Smith Brunch experience lives somewhere between a three star and a four star, but I do love a good brunch in the Gaybourhood, so I'm going to round up.   My pal Roma organized a group brunch, and I'm glad she did. Hanging out with cool people over eggs is my fave way to start a slow Sunday. I promptly ordered an earl grey tea with honey and opened up their newspaper-style menu. It looks like the New York Times and is a deeply adorable throw back to eating breakfast with your parents as they flipped the ink. Solidly done, Smith. All of your attention to decor detail is fabulous, but I'd expect no less in my fave hood.   I decided to build my own brunch, by way of of their scones, breakfast sausage and poached eggs. The scones are fabulous. $6 gets you two with fresh clotted cream, but the extra $2 charge for jam is a big NoNo in my books. I got my eggs poached, and they were tasty but the ramekin they come in holds in the extra water from poaching. Not a fan of this, egg water is gross. Finally, breakfast sausages can do no wrong.   PEPPER POINTS for their cute street-side patio. Perfect for practicing my neighbourhood watch skills."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Saturday; made reservations beforehand (which was great because not a lot of brunch places take reservations). The restaurant was packed as I walked in at 1230; the front of the house staff were friendly as she made sure that people got seated quickly. The restaurant itself has a cosy and chic atmosphere and warm fireplaces on the first and second floors. As my party arrived we got seated on the second floor next to the window.  Service was attentive and the waitress gave us ample time as we had a hard time choosing what to eat (or rather...we were trying to just catch up). We got the ballina (smoked salmon) and florentine (spinach) benedicts, the brisket hash, and the huevos rancheros as well as the soy milk masala chai tea. I've been to their sister restaurant, Wish, and really enjoyed the leek fondue and it was the same at Smith as well.   Would recommend others to come and come back if I'm around the area for brunch."}
{"text":"The attention the food can only be matched by the attention paid to the decor. The only drawback is singles sometimes get forgotten by staff.   I recommend sitting in The Loft if your knees can handle the stairs."}
