{"text":"We had a quiet dinner for our son's bday. Charming bistro with traditional French fare. We loved the potato and leek soup, pâtés, escargot, and sampled the 3 course meal of the night. Everything was delicious. The owners were very pleasant and attentive. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Situated in the Village neighbourhood, this cute restaurant offers hearty, classic French bistro food. The servers are friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The portion sizes are very good. My friend and I tried the five course tasting menu for $35 per person and we were stuffed by the end of the meal. I recommend the \"quenelles de brochet\" (pike quenelles) which were light and fluffy, served with a delicious cream sauce. Even though the restaurant was busy (we went on a Saturday evening), we received each of our courses in a reasonable amount of time. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Our family of four had a lovely evening at this cozy restaurant...great food and very cool ambience.  Enjoyed the 3-course menu, servings were large and we all shared tastes of the Lyonnais-style food.  Desserts were highlights.  Quenelles were light and delicious, French onion soup was served in an innovative style."}
{"text":"Quand on se demande où manger dans le Village, c'est l'endroit parfait pour le calme et la super bonne bouffe! Véritable service à table, les bocaux sont que pour le lunch! De succulentes spécialités Françaises, qui plus est Lyonnaises. Des produits frais, des plats fait maison. Même le pain est fait maison...! Si vous hésitez, n'hésitez plus. Allez-y vous ne serez ps déçu (Entrée + Plat + Dessert à la carte + Service = 50$ sans boissons)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had special group offer tickets for that restaurant. Having been to Lyon in a typical \"bouchon lyonnais\", I was wondering if they served the traditional \"quenelle\" that you find in those types of restaurants in Lyon. And they do!

The service was excellent. The lady that served us was very nice and super attentive. The restaurant reminds me of old French restaurants. The decor is very nice and very cozy and warm.

Their menu is amazing. Of course I picked the quenelle since it's so hard to find. The table d'hôte came with some amuse gueules that consisted of bites of crêpe soufflée, with a rillette and a spoonful of diced marinated veggies, lettuce and mackarel. It was very yummy! For the apetizer, we had a small salad with the real typical salad dressing they serve in France, made of olive oil and dijon mustard with vegetable ravioles made of pickeled beets and other root veggies with goat and blue cheese. And for the entrée, obviously, I had the quenelle made from pike with veggies and a homemade potato croquette. The meal was absolutely delicious.

They also have a 5 à 7 special where you can just drop in, sit at the bar, have a sip of their private imported wine while eating a plate of various cheeses or other bites.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody who wants to experience a typical meal from Lyon without having to travel across the Atlantic.

I was charmed and will definitely go back with my family and friends."}
{"text":"Un endroit servant la cuisine bourgeoise de la région de Lyon. Cette ville est souvent cité comme étant l'épicentre de la cuisine française. 

La carte du restaurant change souvent au gré des arrivages et des saisons. Ce n'est pas de la grande gastronomie mais la cuisine que les familles aisées de Lyon servent lors des jours de fête. Le chef connaît son affaire et sait préparer les plats avec goût et dévouements. 

À noter la décoration d'un des murs faits de pages de vieux livres de recettes collés sur le mur v"}
{"text":"My mom and I met here for lunch when she was in the area for work, it was a great Yelp moment since she'd had a mediocre lunch the day before and was delighted to discover this tiny spot tucked right around the corner from her workshop. It was cozy, there was even a lovely fireplace (though not a real wood one.) The service was incredibly warm and friendly and the lunch specials were affordable and tasty. I loved the cream of vegetable soup, especially the presentation in the jar with the tasty scoops of cream on top, and my smoked meat pastry lunch done tarte tatin style was super good. My mom had a hot healing stew that didn't change her life but I think made her pretty happy. I'd come back here for lunch when in the area for sure.

One thing - they had a vintage poster on the wall with a caricature of an African man eating a banana that made me kind of uncomfortable, seemed fairly racist to me, though I wouldn't be the right person to fully determine that. I just know that it didn't seem right."}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable Lyonnais setting - perfect for dining in. We took to go and it was very cute and tasty glass pods meals. See pictures: I had the\"Pot-au-feu Traditional\" and she had the \" Brandale de Morue et Alie de raie\" - A great quick lunch option to go! A change from the formal big lunch and a grease easy to go meal. Right across from the CBC in Montréal."}
{"text":"Super expérience culinaire, l'accueil y est très agréable, le cadre charmant et la cuisine à la hauteur de ce que l'on connait de Lyon. Un lieu à découvrir assurément et qui deviendra sans doute une habitude."}
