10 of us decided last minute to go for dim sum on a Sun, fortunately there are quite a few parking spaces left, and there's a parking garage as well.

They still have the old style dim sum with the pushing cart, it could be handy for people to see the dishes before ordering. But the waitress only speaks Chinese though.
The food is surprising decent, each dish is pretty decent in size. Instead of keep waiting for a specific dim sum, you can flag down a waiter/waitress and place a request a dim, and the dim sum cart will reserve the order for your table. 

I can't really compliant about the food, but the toilet is a different story - it smells.....
Please switch the urinal / toiler to the automatic flushing ones, it will cut down on the smell.
If not for the toilet, it would receive a much better rating.

{"text":"Read the reviews about hit and miss. Definitely a miss for me. The food was to me low quality and not too flavorful. We had the standards rice noodle roll, siu mai, etc. 

Not a return for me because even a hit would not be that good. That's how bad a miss it was. 

I personally wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible place. No service. Attitude when asking what the cart pushers have. If you dont plan to be a regular, don't come. Been here half hour only 1 plate of food."}
{"text":"We went this place for dim sum last week, we had some congee from the cart, while we're sharing congee, we found a body of Cockroach inside the congee. we told a waitress Immediately and ask her stop selling that bucket of congee, she said they won't sell it anymore and put it back to the kitchen already. But we are sure that lady who selling the congee still sharing same bucket of congee to the customer. OMG, I won't go there anymore.

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????!"}
{"text":"10 course banguet with Mary's Alumni. Huge crowd. Noisy but food was good.  Will come back and try Dim Sum."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience here... not only was the service bad, but the food was too. 

80% of the dishes we ordered were cold and/or undercooked (the pork, the tripe, and the custard bun). after seeing how undercooked the food was, we stopped ordering any more meat dishes. 

the service was equally bad. I understand that it was busy but that's no excuse to be rude and lazy to boot. we were missing a place setting and when I inquired about it, the server went on a rant about how she had already asked another server to get it. Ok, fine, I get it... she was probably just stressed, so I can cut her some slack. But I can't excuse the laziness... when we sat down, my napkins clearly had a stain on it, but instead of replacing it for me, she just flipped the napkin over, hoping I wouldn't see it.... um, what?? 

Anyway, just a terrible experience overall."}
{"text":"There is an early bird special so come early if you want to take advantage of that

There is a somewhat long line up, they give you a number and when they have a seat available  they call your number and escort you to your table.

It is pushed cart dim sum style on the weekends, but they don't have a lot of good dishes anymore. They used to have really good dishes but they changed the place a bit. 

Its perfect for family gathering as I go there a lot for family lunches, and it is close enough to the highway. 

Food wise: Its A-ok but you have very few options there compared to other dim sum places. The siu mai & har gow is the far best and also the congee is really good too!

In final, it is an OK restaurant perfect for family meals, the price is fairly good and go early if you want to save some money! It is the perfect restaurant for authentic Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This is our main go to place for dim sum. They have a good variety of dim sum here. If you come before 11:30 I believe, it is the same pricing for all sizes.

They do have push carts still for the people who prefer the traditional method of dim sum.

I've also tried the dinner multi dish preset menus. They aren't bad for the price you pay and what you get."}
{"text":"Good variety and large area to dine in. Very comfortable setting. Pseudo sharksfin was good but there's nothing better than the real deal. Service was good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for dim sum and the food is served by traditional food cart ladies.  The food was good and some of the ladies were pretty friendly with the exception of one rude lady that seemed to hate her job.  I was least impressed with the man that brought us our bill at the end of the meal.  He insisted that I give him more tips.  He stood by our table as we paid, then counted the money before asking for more tipping.  He was rude and unprofessional.  He raised his voice to attract attention and made us feel as we owed money.  I told him that with his attitude I should not be obligated to tip and that I would not be returning to the restaurant in the furture. He seemed unfazed and told us he didn't care if we came back.   I was appalled and left me feeling really angry.  As we left the restaurant he was still ranting therefore I will not be returning to this restaurant again. I should not be forced to tip."}
{"text":"We just got back from dim sum so here's my review to be swept away by Yelp to not recommended, as usual. This was our second time there. The first experience was utter crap so we thought we'd give this place one more try. This second experience was ... surprise, surprise ...utter crap.

The food was cold. The food was terrible. Har gow shrimp dumplings had the skin on all of them torn when brought to us - skin was like eating rough carpet; shrimp was over cooked to hell. Siu mai dumpling was a tough and cold meatball. Chicken feet was rubber and drowning in corstarch sauce - also cold. The rice noodle rolls (we got the shrimp) had the exact shrimp as the har gow - way overcooked and tough as nails, and cold. Zero variety - the same FEW carts wheeled around again and again with nothing new coming out. We had to specially ask for the har gow and siu mai - and they were still cold coming out! I must have seen the congee cart wheel around congree no one wanted about 30 times.

To top off the indignity, the bill was $30 for 2. Lots of places are cheaper and, far more important, better quality. The back dumpster of any other restaurant might be worse...but not by much. This is not dim sum."}
{"text":"As you walk in through the mini mall, the wonderful smell of dim sum hits you as cooks are flipping freshly cooked dishes at an exposed work station. 

The familiar favorites are all available on carts being pushed around.   

Did not find any turnip cakes, but I'm sure they would have made some.  

Large restaurant with many tables, no waiting at lunch on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to get chinese dim sum. It is a cart-style dim sum so the food is pushed around on carts and you pick out what you like. Since I don't know chinese, I always get up and ask the servers if I can look at the food. I've often eaten here with large groups and they are always busy on the weekend."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The food is below average for me. I mean service is decent, but the food... I just WASN'T impressed at all. 

The dishes are relatively expensive and overpriced,"}
{"text":"One of the larger dim sum places in town. Went there on a Monday at 11am. No lineups.  Weekday prices are $2.80 for S.M.L from 8:30-11:15 and then from 1:30-3:30.  Weekends are just slightly more $2.88 from 8:30-11:30.  Dim sum quality is hit or miss. Squid tentacles are chewy, bordering on tough. Beef cheong fan is good."}
{"text":"The service had always been subpar an the food around the 3/5 sometimes 4/5 mark. However, what put the last nail in the coffin for my family to NOT come here was the fact that having paid the bill was chased down while mid way to the exit by a shouting staff, that my family and my poor relative who had been dragged there was called a THIEF..I guess she shouldn't have left that decent tip. What followed was the manager, as it turns out, was the one who collected our bill, just said \"oh its been paid-oops\" AND THE STAFF SAID SORRY very quietly and the manager couldn't give a rats ass as he quickly left. Yeah, IMPECCABLE service, definitely a contender for worst manager EVER!

NEVVVVVVVVVER returning to this place! If you want to abusive or mortify your company this is your cup of tea!"}
{"text":"This restaurant could have been fantastic for morning dim sum, it really could, except it was lacking variety. 

I was there for family for some Sunday dim sum. After being seated we were able to order and get food immediately because they still use the old push cart system, which is great! I love the fact that we can take our time to nibble and chat as food is slowly presented to us by way of carts, rather than the modern method of ordering all items at once on a menu and have it all come rushing to your table in a disorderly manner that just disrupts any communication.

Things were good, but after 20 mins I realized the carts that were coming around kept offering the exact same dishes! Over and over we heard the cart ladies call out the same items: beef tendons, tripe, pork ribs, and chicken feet. Yes yes, these were some of my favourites and dim sum staples, but where's the variety? Where were the shrimp and pork dumplings? The rice noodle rolls? The congee? The sweets? These items slowly started to trickle out only after 11am when prices are higher. Sounds like a scam? Yes, most definitely. They offered us in the morning the stuff that was made the night before and waited till the house was full before bringing out the better stuff. 

Not cool.

Never going back.


PS. Food was okay, nothing fancy, but was on par."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for older classics here - one of the few dim sum places where the menu still comes around in the form of human cart-pushers hollering out what their goods are on their trolley. It's outdated for sure, but eliminates the risk of not getting your food fresh. Century Palace has been around for a long time and they've survived because they're a huge venue that attracts a lot of forums and wedding dinners, and word on the street is the owners own the building meaning they don't have to pay rent. Over the years a lot of their dim sum choices disappeared due to lack of interest, but there's still some that I can only find here on a consistent basis.

Morning tea is a hit because all dim sum are the price of small dishes. This is pretty huge - nowadays, it's typical to find higher end dim sum places starting their menu off with medium dishes and ranking their dishes up to XXL and Specials all the time. If you're new to the dim sum game, here is where size matters - dim sum dishes are denoted in price by their size and the price difference between each size is about $1 from S to XL. However when you venture into extended sizing the prices start to exponentially increase, but the portion doesn't always stay linear in quality or quantity.

My visits always follow the same routine - secure a table, drop off coats and bags, and grab the stamp card to head off to the pan fry station. You won't miss it - it's right in the front and the lady is frying all kinds of goodies on multiple portable pans. Pan fried rice rolls, water chestnut cake, potstickers, stuffed green peppers, and their amazing soft and chewy thick crêpe with coconut and peanuts are all must-haves. If you're here during morning tea time, the battle has only just begun. The small-dish discount applies based on when you get the dishes stamped to your card, not when you arrive nor when you pay. The routine is to scan the place for all the food trolleys and gather all the goodies right at the start, then settle down and enjoy at your own pace. Rice in mini-casseroles with varieties of meat are great value for money, as are the fried noodles and anything previously mentioned from the pan-fry station.

My top dim sum choices here for the savoury side are their deep fried crispy taro balls, char siu buns, rice rolls, and soy sauce fried noodles. I'd skip the typical har gow (shrimp dumpling) and siu mai (steamed pork in a wonton wrapper) because they're generic and not much different from elsewhere. 

For the sweet side: tofu fa, thick crêpe with coconut and peanuts, baked tapioca sago, brown sugar round pudding cakes, and water chestnut cake. Skip on jelly-like cakes and deep fried items - theirs subpar and I hear there's one that looks to be a sweet dish but is actually savoury.

All in all this place is old - so do not expect any fancy décor, any hotel-style service, any nice new additions, or anything of the sort. Everything is functional and their dishwashing does a fine job, but that's about it. I guess the atmosphere adds to the olden dim sum style as well? You'll have to decide."}
{"text":"This dim sum restaurant has been around for a while now but I rarely come here with my family (... and will probably continue this way after my most recent experience). Century Palace is actually quite large with lots of seating so one positive aspect is that you will almost always be able to find a table here - no need to grab a number and wait (im)patiently in line as with all other Markham dim sum places. Decor is quite dated.

I came on the weekend. Dim sum here is served traditionally in carts so you have to wait for your favourite dim sum dishes to come around. Or maybe they will never come around - good luck! I found myself having to yell at the cart ladies to either tell them to stop (some will just rush right by you) or to ask them what they have. If you don't understand Chinese be warned that you will probably have a difficult time ordering the dim sum you want here. They do have a menu with rice/noodle options though.

Honestly the quality of the dim sum was not that great. Everything we ordered from the siu mai (pork dumplings) to the custard buns tasted mediocre.

If you decide to come here note that dim sum is cheaper before 11:30am so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Apparently going here twice has made me the duchess. I'll take it!

Came here for dim sum with the families while on a visit back home, and then again  because I think someone thought it was awesome. The prices are totally reasonable, and some of their items are good but plenty of it is really just your regular stuff. I really enjoyed the gai lan, the plate that shows up is huge! Another good bet is the plain rice rolls - they've got a great texture and are delicious and smooth. 

Overall it's a decent place though it's certainly looking like it needs a face lift. It's one of the few places that still does push carts, so that's fun in itself too. They've got a beautiful tiled piece in the hallway by the entrance, which I love, but man - the wedding arch and the worn carpets really bring the place down. A bit of TLC and this place could be sparkly again. 

See you next time Century Palace!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum is something that is new to me. Went with a few people from work. They are more of experts than I am. From what I understand some people have been here infrequently and the rating is 50/50. I didn't mind the things I tried. Sorry but can't remember the names. I would suggest going with people who are familiar with the menu. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Standard run of the mill dim sum place. Nothing too fancy."}
{"text":"2.5/5

Very mediocre Chinese restaurant in a very dingy and old plaza next to the tnt at warden and steeles... came in for the first time today for dim sum because the chinese newspaper advertised 2.89 a dish for dimsum ( S,M,L). The restaurant itself is located inside a chinese plaza that looks unrenovated since the 90s.. upon walking in, your hostess is basically half way into the restaurant. (very odd and big foyer space)

Majority of the dim sum is made to order (you get a slip and you mark what you want) but they also have some cart ladies coming around with certain fishes (tofu dessert, congee, noodles etc). The dim sum menu is extensive and majority of the items are S,M,L so one price. We wanted to try a variety... majority of the steam item that came out was not pipping hot! Was so unsatisfied that it was only luke warm. Shrimp dumpling (har gow) was good, but not the best in town.. Siu mai was super salty, the fried squid tentacle was super hard to chew! The potted rice was good for the price, standard but not the best. I think the only item we liked was the chun fun (rice rolls), the rice roll itself was very silky smooth which is tasty and the shrimp was big but that was really only the plus side to our dim sum order. 

The bill was also a little hard to decipher as well because they don't separate the cost of tea per person from the dishes you ordered... cost per tea is also 1$ per person which is on the cheaper/standard side for any dim sum. 

Lots of parking in the plaza, but will 99% not be returning as there are so many other great dim sum places in the area."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the worst dim sum experiences I've ever had.  From the rude ladies pushing around the carts, zooming by without nary a sound let alone announcing the dishes they bear to the lack of waiter service which led to a pile of dishes piling up at the table... Eating here was a disaster.

It is located inside a plaza, and its a maze just getting inside.

The dim sum itself is pretty decent but with the many options around, I would probably not come back again.

The server also messed up our order of Salted Egg Yolk Dusted Bitter Gourd Melon.  They brought us squash instead.  

We arrived around 11AM and there weren't even that many carts going around.  The variety here is lacking, and closer to 1PM when we left, there were barely any carts going around.  I feel sad for those who are arriving around 1PM no doubt, with drumming stomachs.  

It also wouldn't hurt for them to invest in wireless VISA/Interac terminals, as you have to go with them to the cash register if you choose to pay with plastic."}
{"text":"Came here today for dim sum. I haven't been since last August because the food wasn't so good and the service was none existent, we couldn't get anybody to refill our tea pots. Today's food was all ok. We arrived at 10.45 am and the place wasn't too full. If you put your order sheet in before 11.15 am then all S, M & L dim sum are priced at $2.50. There are a few carts that float around. There was the congee cart and a couple of others with egg tarts, fried stuffed peppers etc. We ended up chatting for ages and I wanted to get some take out for my kids.  So I asked the waiter to take down my dim sum order. He said that because it was after 1.30 pm, all S, M & L dim sum dishes were priced at $2.50 again. But if I wanted the kitchen to pack it up, I would be charged the regular price. So he told me to just put in another dim sum order sheet, let the food come to the table, and then to pack it myself, to get the afternoon tea price. He said that he was trying to save my money. I thought that was good of him but that's a really stupid rule. 
Overall, the service has improved a lot too and the food is not bad for $2.50. It got quite packed for the afternoon special but because it's such a big place with lots and lots of tables, you shouldn't have to wait for a table.."}
{"text":"Horrible service.... I waved at 5 servers within 5 mins and they just ignore you as if they aren't even working here.  Don't expect much here...."}
{"text":"Located near pmall! I went with a big group for 10am and it was still  busy on a Sunday and it just got busier the whole time I was there. 

Overall experience was good, the shrimp used are big shrimp! The shrimp dumplings were great as well as the pork dumplings. Rice noodle rolls were decent, low on supply unfortunately. The steamed bbq pork buns were fine, they're one of my favourite things on the planet so I'm a bit tough on them. The buns weren't fluffy enough or was the filling flavorful. There was a lot of fat in the buns as well. I would compare with a the buns in the fridge section from T&T. I enjoyed the fried shrimp wonton (always good) and fried taro cake. 

The soup dumplings weren't very good and would not recommend them. 

The prices are great and I guess you get what you pay for, there's great value here. It's good enough to return. But I wouldn't try to impress someone with this dim sum."}
{"text":"Back in the days when Chinese food/grocery only existed in China Town this was one of the few Chinese Restaurants that existed in Scarborough/Markham borders.  This being said, the business here was INSANE and it was as crowded as any Canton Dim Sum restaurants back EAST.

How things have changed around here as development of Asian Malls and Plazas mean that next to a Chinese restaurant exist another of the same.  A never-ending vision of Chinese food supply more than demand.

This place still holds its old time charm that was there from DAY ONE.  You'll have to walk through the mall all the way to the BACK of the building to find this place as you past by Hair Salons, Snack Places, and Empty Stalls.

Food and Service is good and now that it isn't as BUSY as years before, you can actually CHIT-CHAT with the staff on Weekdays.  It's one of those places that have LARGER tables so finding a table for a big group isn't as much a worry as some others.  

They have nice spacing inbetween the tables, so you won't have to worry as much about Push Cart Ladies knocking your arm or hot Tea spilling on you like other restos with TIGHT spaces.

This is definitely a place to YUM CHA with the Daily News as long as you are OKAY hanging with a crowd of retirees.  The good thing is that they won't even notice you because they can't even see that far.  They can only see as far as the newspaper they hold with their hands."}
{"text":"Wow. This place has a lot of tables...and a lot of Chinese people lining up to eat at it. I actually heard a Chinese guy say \"Wow. There are so many Chinese people\". I thought it was kinda cute. I should hope that an authentic Chinese dim sum place has a lot of Chinese people. If not, I'd be concerned about authenticity, price, and/or taste.

Came as a party of eight, I believe. I have no idea how much anything was because I didn't pay. Unless we split the bill wrong, it came out to about $10 per person.

Most things (siu mai, breaded fried shrimp, sesame glutinous rice roll, soap/lye glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leaf, pan fried glutinous pancake with preserved Chinese sausage and green onions, pan fried leek dumplings, etc.) were alright. Deep fried taro filled with minced pork (wu gok) was slightly disappointing. It was tasty, but the birds nest part wasn't airy enough. It was considerably more dense than it should have been. The flaky egg tarts weren't hot enough, and were a darker yellow (almost orange) than I'm used to. Phoenix talon was delicious though. Good portion too. Also their fish pasted stuffed tofu and eggplant. Four pieces. Smaller serving than usual. Two eggplant, two egg tofu. Pieces of eggplant were very small. Almost like the tips of two eggplants. Topped with the fish paste, not two pieces of eggplant sandwiching fish paste, as other dim sum restaurants do. That being said, the egg tofu was a plus.

Didn't have this one, but the pan fried rice noodle rolls aren't made in house. They're from the same company that you can get at every Chinese grocery store. Saw a lady opening up the packs.

All in all, not many choices, food wasn't outstanding, and service wasn't astounding. Not much that I would want to come back for. I might come back if invited, but there are also much better places to go for dim sum."}
{"text":"My rating is more like '3.5' than 3. Its a tough to decide my exact rating given this place does provide authentic Cantonese style cooking and the prices are reasonable. But on the down side, the decor/ambience is nothing special. 

I have been here a few times with my in-laws, who tend to find one place they like and stick to it. For years. No diversion, no change, it will not go well, we simply cannot dine at other restaurants or run the risk of family argument.

Moving on, I've had Dim Sum here quite a few times for lunch. I don't do the ordering, my in-laws speak fluent Cantonese. The menu is in Cantonese. But don't worry, if you don't speak Cantonese, just look at the food passing by you on a cart. If you like, motion the server you want some. They will serve the dish and mark your menu for you. 

Although the clientele is by majority Chinese, there are a few non-Chinese (like myself!) in the crowd. So you will not feel out of place either way. This is a massive restaurant, more akin to a Banquet hall that they open up for regular dining hours during the day.

The washrooms...ah unfortunately typical cleanliness I've come to expect with Chinese restaurants (having travelled to China, it can be worse, a lot worse. But if we want to compare which country has the worst washroom, far and away my winner would be India! Still traumatized by that gas station hole in the floor outhouse never been cleaned for at least 40-50 years.)

Getting back to this place, the washrooms are ok, relatively clean. Just sometimes they don't have paper towel. Or soap. Or its a bit messy. 

You will need reservation for busy times, so lunch time or dinner time. It can get really packed. You can still get in without reserving, but might wait a few minutes.

Lets talk about the food itself, it is pretty good! Definitely authentic and this is not your typical Americanized Chinese take out food. Dim Sum is traditional Cantonese brunch, with wide range of fried, steamed and otherwise cooked foods. Most common items are dumplings (shrimp is my fav!), buns, flavoured rice, and some desserts. Watch out for the chicken legs!

For dinner they have family style Cantonese meal. The quality of the food is good! Usually there is a total price for a selection of dinner items to be shared. For example, package can include lobster, fish, duck, chicken two kinds, veggies and some kind of mixed vegetable and meat dish. The price is reasonable, averaging $15-20/pp often with a little leftover to take home."}
{"text":"Came here for the 10 course banquet meal and was fairly pleased with the food here. The pricing is definitely one of the better ones in the area, $300 being the one we got. I wish they served us (for all the dishes) but it's not that big of a deal.

Roasted suckling pig - was half a pig but still plenty to go around, more than enough. One of the better dishes of the night. Crisp skin, and not too much fat. All pieces were served (why not?) but it still tasted pretty good.

King Lobster in maggi sauce - 5lbs. Fairly big, love the sauce here!

Garoupa belly with bitter melon - heavily battered and sauced, big bony pieces of fish that is not for everyone, but I enjoyed this dish. Works well with bitter melon.

Garoupa with broccoli - both broccoli and the fish were overcooked here. You could tell the fish fillet was from frozen. Disappointing

BBQ chicken - nearly crispy enough to pass off as fried chicken but with thin, crisp skin, and the meat still being fairly moist. No shrimp chips, sorry. 

Stuffed crab claws - served piping hot, and well stuffed with shrimp and the like.

Fish maw soup - suprised with the amount of seafood in here!

Baby bokchoy with mushrooms - no abalone or dried scallops here but rather abalone mushrooms. 

E-fu noodles/fried rice - both were good. Better than the average, and both were flavorful.

Red bean soup/almond cookies/jello - for dessert. Good consistency for the soup, the red beans still in tact. Almond cookies were really soft."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a good dimsum, but CP is definitely my favourite. So I took my Montreal darling, vers2ter, to her first encounter of visiting Hongkong. It was a gourmet dining experience, filled with mouth watering carts of delicacies, including steamed chicken, xiao long bao, siwe mai. Of course, prawn dumpling is a classic that is a crime not to taste. It can be quite frightening to the uninitiated, but those who are brave enough to venture will be richly rewarded.  Look for young waitresses pushing the carts, they are often less intimidating to newbies. Moderation is key to a good life, but my eyes were bigger than my stomach. It was a paralysing experience for her to have enough courage to try the beef tendons. Yummy! So, so good. We have to re-live this experience, again and again, for the first time ... and CP is the place to be."}
{"text":"Overall a good dimsum restaurant, for the handfuls of times we've visited.  The actual space is enormous, and so the definite plus, is that even on weekends, there's almost never a wait, since there are so, so many tables scattered all over the place. Their dimsum is also so hot and fresh, primarily because they still push it around on carts!

The atmosphere, service, and decor are really nothing special, just your typical, standard treatmeant.

The food itself is of decent quality, fairly standard/average dimsum calibre.  Because of the fact that it is pushed around on carts, there is a wide selection of dimsum to choose from, often ones you wouldn't find (especially not for the same price) at other dimsum restaurants.  Their prices are very competitive, and for the selection of food you get here, well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Close to home, we decided to try this place for my bday dinner with the family.  Century Palace is located in the ever-so-busy Metro Square.  For us who know, this place is always busy so parking can be a challenge even through they've got a tier leveled parking facility attached to the building.
Once inside the restaurant is quite extravagant and BIG.  This place seems to be busy every part of the day since they're known for dim-sum and dinner specials which are USUALLY cash only.  
From what I recall, the service is fast and efficient and they do \"crack\" a smile once in a while.  
Our entourage of 8 ordered their 10 course meal, which was OKAY.  They're prices are reasonable for the quality you get. 
In this 10 course meal it included the usual, house bowl of soup, 3-5 lb. lobster, steam bass, suckling pig, egg-veggie dish, sweet and sour pork, Enoki mushrooms dish, two other dishes I could not recall, and red bean dessert.  

Overall it was a good experience, the quality and service was to our standards."}
{"text":"I've had dimsum in Hong Kong. It was loud and boisterous and absofricking fantabulously delicious. Dumplings to weep over. Sticky rice bundles filled with tasty delights. Delicate and tantalizing desserts. Service so efficient that you're never wanting for food or variety and your tea pot is always fresh and full. Tables full of families with at least 3 generations representing. 

I found something similar at Century Palace. This cavernous restaurant fits a LOT of people. And every weekend it's packed to the brim. If you're lucky, you get a seat where the carts always pass by. If not, make sure you stand as they pass and get yourself noticed. CP has way more dimsum selection than most places I've been to. And it's gooooooooood. Make sure you get the staples of Har Gow (shrimp in rice wrapper), Siu Mai (pork in egg wrapper topped with shrimp), Cheung Fun with Shrimp (rice noodle filled with shrimp with sweet soya sauce), Pork Dumplings, Deep Fried Squid Tentacles and Bao (steamed rice bun filled with bbq pork). Bonus points for having Tofu-fan (hot tofu with sugar syrup). 

Sunday is THE day for dimsum. Be prepared to wait. I guarantee that it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great Dim Sum... usually.  (A couple of times it was not very good because there wasn't enough variety that day)  Very large so the wait isn't too long.  The Cheong Fun is great."}
{"text":"I came here again for a family dinner. The service was horrible. Our party felt neglected the whole time. The servers didn't change our plates throughout a 10-course meal until we requested. They had a wedding in the other room so that was their top priority. Our dinner took over 3 hours to finish because it was so inconsistent. We would receive the first few dishes within 10minutes between each one. Then sometimes we would wait 30 minutes. I think it's horrible to neglect the regular dinner patrons just because there are other catering events in the restaurant. The restaurant should be aware and schedule more staff to accommodate this. I would probably not return again."}
{"text":"Like others mentioned, they use cart. I like cart per se. Because carts let you to see the food before ordering it. However, menu should also be provided so that we know what to expect. On the top of that, the place is quite spacious, so it takes quite long to let the cart go around, which results in a quite long waiting time. And nobody likes to wait for breakfast."}
{"text":"Push carts, why do I despise push carts for dim sum.  Oh yeah, it's because depending on where you get seated you may have to fight for dim sum.  Fight did you say?  Yes that's right you heard me, fight for dim sum.

Ok, I don't know about the rest of you but I like to go to restaurants to relax.  But here's the problem with this place, we never get a good spot.  So when the popular favourites such as rice and spare ribs with chicken feet come along, alot of people swarm the push cart lady because they want to make sure they get a dish.  

The other option would be to wait until the push cart lady gets to your table, of course that means that you only get the left overs of what no one else has wanted (boy do I feel sorry for the lady who has congee and goes around and around without any buyers).  

Dim sum here isn't that special and on the pricey side.  I can deal with pricey if that means I get good service but alas that isn't found here either."}
{"text":"Decent dimsum! A family friend been eating here for over 10 year!

Shrimp ball is pretty decent size and they use large size shrimp in the dimsum.  Pan fried turnip cake is good too.

Water chestnut jelly cake really stands out - the crispy water chestnut and refreshing taste was great!"}
{"text":"Mmm wasn't great, but price I guess was on the lower side.  For people who like to dance, this restaurant has dinner & dance events & live entertainment (on scheduled days not an everyday thing)."}
{"text":"Century Palace checks off all of my dimsum needs and requirements. 

Firstly, dimsum isn't dimsum without older aunties yelling out what is available as they push their carts around. Ticking off orders on a sheet is called ordering at a restaurant, not having dimsum. Dimsum should require an awareness of your surroundings and the constant eye out for your next dimsum plate. 

Secondly, the quality of the dimsum here is evidently better than what is available even in the dimsum dense options of Markham. The shrimp dumplings have a thin but chewy wrapping, the BBQ pork pastry is flaky, the runny egg yoke bun is ACTUALLY runny, and the big meatballs are correctly seasoned. Each dish that we picked out was just well made with quality ingredients and came hot to the table. 

Thirdly, all their dishes are considered the small price until 1130. So no need to wake up crazy early to have well priced dimsum. 

My new go to dimsum place!"}
{"text":"Been here last week and on Mother's Day.  Both were dinners:
1) Busier than most high end restaurants on a slow week nights
2) Very affordable la carta dishes
3) Set dinners are amusingly good deals
4) Set dinners are their specialties on weekends or risk waiting a while 
5) My coworkers told me that dim sums on weekends are fair ~ good, depending on what you will expect when the pricing is so low."}
{"text":"We came here for a banquet.  I did not expect high quality food from this restaurant.  However, their suckling pig surprised me.  It is the best suckling pig I had within the last few years (sorry I didn't take a picture of suckling pig because too many people aftering it and didn't have time to take a pic).  The rest of the dishes such as crab meat ball, fish, chicken, lobster is so so.  Just for the suckling pig, I will come again.."}
{"text":"Usually a great Chinese Dim Sum restaurant. But today, service was bad. Food was delayed (lots of tables waiting for their orders). Plates were half the portion it is supposed to be. Poor customer service and food all around."}
{"text":"Found another old school push cart dim sum place.
$2.40 early bird special from Mon to Fri before 11:30am
$2.48 early bird special on Sat and Sun before 11:30am
I guess that $0.08 really makes a big difference.

The place is super huge so we didn't even have to wait to be seated on a Saturday morning. The carts came flying around at super speeds and I was impressed even though the place was so huge they could get the food out so fast on the push carts. Typically we spend at least an hour at dim sum but the food came so fast that we were in and out within 40 minutes. 

The food itself is pretty decent and pretty fresh considering it was push cart and not made to order. There were the typical items that you can find in any other dim sum restaurant and there wasn't any other special items that you can usually find at the higher end dim sum places.

Overall a good meal for a good price at fast-food joint type speeds."}
{"text":"Pros:
Large seating area

Cons:
Horrendous cart service/rotation

I grew up with the cart pushing dim sum places so I'm always up for some nostalgia.  That being said, you have to do it right or else the experience is just horrible.  Century needs to improve or else they should just not do it at all.

I came here with the entire family of about 18 people.  The one thing Century has going for it is that it has a huge seating area.  There are a lot of tables here.  Even though we were such a large group we were able to be seated in almost no time.  They have many large tables here so coming with big groups won't be too much trouble.

As I said before, Century still uses the push cart system for dim sum.  Usually, when the restaurant is really big, it becomes very difficult to utilize this system.  Most of the larger dim sum places nowadays have ditched the carts for good reason.  In my opinion, Century should do the same.  

Century is just far too big to keep using the cart system.  On top of that, the rotations of the carts were just horrendous.  We came at about 1115 and were there for a good 2 hours and not once did the har gow/siu mai cart come.  NOT ONCE!!  2 HOURS and NOT ONCE.  That's absolutely unacceptable.  On top of that, the ladies pushing those carts don't seem to follow any route.  It was the same 3 carts that kept passing us by.  The ladies would chat with customers they knew and just make small circles around the tables to come back quickly and chat with them again. 

I'm not going to blame the ladies completely.  This falls totally on the management.  Most dim sum places I go to, you will see the higher ups in suits always making rounds to make sure everything is running smooth.  I did not see any of those throughout our meal.  It starts at the top, if the management doesn't care enough to make sure things are running smooth, then the workers in turn don't care.

Like I said, Century needs to improve the cart service or stop using it at all.  When you actually get the food, it's pretty decent.  Good luck trying to get it though."}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant for a 50 person small banquet celebration. Service was excellent, and waitstaff was very polite. The whole process from booking (6 months out with a $200 reservation deposit) to actually paying the bill that night was very smooth, and no surprises. The dinner was reasonably priced per table, and as common with many other places, they required the total bill to be paid in cash, including the 12% advised gratuity. Food was decent banquet food, no home-runs, but nothing to complain about for the price we paid. They set up the semi-private event space, which was in the first entry room, right as you entered the restaurant space. It was nice they set up a few stock decorations they already had to match our occasion. They had a large projection screen (which could not play sound, we used for powerpoint slides and an online display accessible from internet) and a large TV screen with DVD player which was the only way we were able to play a short video with sound. The manager and head waiter were very polite to our whole party, without any snobbery towards some of the younger generation ABCs. There is a parking garage in this building. I would recommend this place for a similar sized banquet."}
{"text":"Don't like to downgrade ratings but last couple of times here food and service has fallen so have to ding them a star.  Tonight's dinner service took about 3 hours to finish and that is with constantly asking about missing food;(

Would get first couple of dishes then wait 15 mins and nothing. Kept asking about the food, get a bunch then wait, ask again...   Eat, wait, ask, repeat....

Food was not bad but hard to enjoy a meal like this.

3/5"}
{"text":"pretty nice decor & pretty convenient location, but the food was only average at best.

I guess it's also nice to note that this place still continues the transitional dim sum style--they have workers pushing around dim sum carts and you take them as they come by. Although this is great, it's probably not the best for non-chinese speakers. (since they broadcast in chinese and you will have difficulty knowing what's inside all those little trays) 

Also, I found it quite loud since the tables spacing was very dense, so it made it harder to hear what the broadcasts were. 

if your chinese isn't very strong, I would suggest going to another dim sum place where you place your order on a sheet."}
{"text":"If u want dim sum and don't want to have a long lineup, then Century Palace is the place u should go, cause it's big, so will make your wait time shorten.  I suggest don't go if u want dim sum after 2pm, cause u may find not many dim sum available around that time.  I found the taste of dim sum not always the same, sometimes taste good, sometimes not.....so u have to try your luck.
I like to go there because they have the sweet pancake that is not available in most of the dim sum restaurant, although not as good as the one my grandmom cooks, but better than none."}
{"text":"Once a year, a large group of us will come here for dimsum. By a large group, I mean approximately 25 of us. Why here? Because they take reservations for that many ppl. The dimsum is decent price and it tastes decent. Nothing spectacular, but nothing to complain about. This time around, we only paid about $9/person after tax and tip. CRAZY cheap. Go before 11:30am to get the special early bird prices. 

Never much of a problem with service either. Definitely recommended for large groups.

My favourite thing here is there \"lai wong bao\", which is custard buns. I didnt see any \"gau choy gau\" (dumplings with chives). Their chicken feet is delicious!!

I have been here for a wedding reception before as well, very traditional."}
{"text":"Service is so bad. You cannot order dim sum directly. You have to wait for the cart coming to you. Food is average."}
{"text":"$2.40 All Sizes for Early Bird Special... but you do need to submit your order in before 11:15 am to take advantage of that..

I arrived too too late... I hate paying full price... 

Century Palace Chinese Restaurant is not longer pushed cart dim sum style. You checked off what you want from the ordering sheet. However, the experience is complimented with a few ladies pushing their carts around. 

We ordered a few dim sums to share. Everything quite standard and solid. Nothing too amazing enough for me to go out of my way to come back to have dim sum again at Century Palace.

I guess I have to wake up earlier for the Early Bird Special as it is definitely a better deal than paying $4 for the Large items which I haven't have a chance to try them out!"}
{"text":"I like their siu mai more than any other place.  Their other dim sum were pretty good also.  Good service.   Just a big space.  I don't think they have private rooms.  On weekends it's push carts.  On weekdays it uses an order form."}
{"text":"Getting tough to find dim sum places that still rely solely on the traditional cart pushing method. If you're looking for that experience again, this is a great place to go! Interior decor of this place is pretty ok too. 

It's quite a huge restaurant so didn't find much of a wait to be seated for a table of 3 during your regular weekend lunch hour. The cart pushing ladies came around quite often as well although with this type of dim sum, it's always a hit or miss depending if they come around with the dishes you'd like to get.

Taste wise was pretty on par with your usual dim sum - nothing too special to note there. However, do keep in mind that because they are wheeling these carts of food around, your dim sum might not be as hot as places where you'd place and order and it'd come right to you once ready. 

In terms of variety, unfortunately, during the time that I went, the kitchen was still trying to pump out dishes that were already all sold. So my selection in dim sum available was rather disappointing and I didn't have the patience to wait.

Overall, pretty ok for regular dim sum fare. Brings a bit of nostalgia too with their carts! Would come back but don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while, but decided to come here with a few Caucasian colleagues who haven't really had dim sum for a while either.

This is a weekday afternoon so it may be different than weekends.

Anyway the system had change from the push cart to the more efficient \"just tick off the list\".  They still had pushcarts for some food though.

The good part about doing this tick off style is the food comes to you warmer.  However, it does lose its \"quick\" appeal.  So I was waiting a bit for the food rather than just picking it off like a vulture :)

However if you have an hour plus for lunch break it is still doable, just order everything as quickly as possible.

So what we ordered as Chrysanthemum tea (ko-fa cha if they ask) to start.   We then started picking off our orders.  I got the beef tripe in ginger soup (simple staple but still tastes good).  My colleagues got beef ribs (I didn't really like it too much),  BBQ Pork bun (yummy), mushroom with chicken (not really too good for me and note mushroom is singular), Chicken bun (not too keen on it).

We also ordered the deep fried sesame ball with pork inside (yummy) and was from the cart.  I also got tofu-fa to share with the rest of my guests which they liked.

IBM discount applies here and all three of us got the meal for $25.66 taxes and tip included."}
