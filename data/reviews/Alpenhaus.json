{"text":"seiously... service is great, food is totally not worth it...gez  poor waiter had to serve garbage to me =.= i felt sorry for him... it really lets me down, i had a pretty high hope for it....do not go there...for any occasion"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon voucher for the restaurant and we had a cheese fondue and a Chinese fondue (hot pot basically). I recommend the cheese fondue because I think this is really what they're known for. As for the service, it was okay. The waiter/server was also training a new waitress so our service took a little longer than it normally would. We were also the only customers at the restaurant so we didn't really have to wait for anything. 
The food was mediocre quality, and the Chinese broth wasn't anything delicious and it looked a little too murky in my opinion. The cheese fondue was better, but it's not anything I'd go back for."}
{"text":"Bien passé avec mes amis, les plat éteint délicieux puis la place est romantique. C'est une bonne choix avec le Groupon."}
{"text":"Wonderful fondue dinner at this restaurant last night. Great service too. Top quality beef. Don't forget to finish off with the chocolate fondue!!"}
{"text":"The food we had here tonight was delicious!  We had the goulash soup, Cordon Bleu, Wiener Schnitzel and Swiss chocolate fondue.  The goulash soup was different from most varieties we have tried, but we found it very tasty.  The schnitzel and Cordon Bleu were some of the best we have had.  The chocolate fondue was great!    It was such a rare treat for us and there were a wide variety of fruits to dip into the wonderful chocolate."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive service, cozy atmosphere, live piano, and a roaring fire.
The cheese fondue is a decadent treat. A perfect escape from the winter!"}
{"text":"A delightful place. 

The warm cozy interior, cheesy as it may be, is so well complimented by the cheesy cuisine that you won't be bothered by the faux Swiss chalet design. 

Firelight and piano music add to the warm atmosphere that put me in a jovial mood as I enjoyed the best onion soup I've ever had. 

The fondue we tried was also spot on and delicious. 

A unique and wonderful place well worth a visit."}
{"text":"This was a truly sub par experience. After purchasing a groupon I was forced to pay a tip on the original value of the meal (100$). In my opinion a bowl of vegetable soup, some old bread dipped in cheese and fruit salad for dessert does not classify as high end dining... and the rude waiter didn't warrant much of a tip either.  In hindsight I would have been much happier at McDonald's. My boyfriend warned me about this groupon and from now on I'm relinquishing my restaurant decisions to him..."}
{"text":"Schnitzel and no fries and they just bring it out with rice, not even asking me? Send it back just payed for the overpriced beer. Not going agai"}
{"text":"Good german/swiss food! Ambiance is very nice if you bring your gf/bf, very romantic. I personally go to the bar in the back of the restaurant, great ambiance and KIRSCH :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding Jägerschnitzel!  Great service, great atmosphere, and most importantly outstanding food.  My friend said the French onion soup was the best he'd ever had.  I hear on weekends the main dining room rocks with live music and a fireplace.  Next time I'll have to check it out.  Go there!"}
{"text":"Very bad, entrecotte was terrible and way way too expensive
Wanted to try even with the bad reviews, but they were right.
Swiss will be ashame of their representation in Canada"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. Over the years Rue St. Catherine has changed quite a bit but Alpenhaus remains somehow untouched. The service is warm, the atmosphere is convivial and romantic and the food is just darn good eating. 

My favorite combo so far is an order of the pate followed by a cheese fondue and a beef fondue for two. The goulash is pretty good too. 

This place is best when it is cold!"}
{"text":"I came here with a groupon. The food was great and the service was excellent. The owner was very nice as well! Taxes and tips are calculated for you after the groupon, which is great! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side but you'll not regret the cost. Wonderful German Swiss food in the heart of Montreal. Everything was wonderful from the wine to the dessert. The Chocolate fondue is worthy of the calories. If you want a special meal, this is the place to go. They can accommodate large groups well."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Cheese fondue comes with bread with no sides. The portion is small and the quality is poor. The tip is enforced and the service does not live up to the price. Not the same place / experience as I've remembered. it's true that human has terrible memories. Don't make my mistake and avoid this resto at all cost."}
{"text":"This underrated and unassuming little gem in the downtown core has been a curiosity of mine for ages, and when I finally got around to trying it out last night, I came out stuffed and happy to have gone in!

The Bavarian interiors of wooden beams and real log burning fire place, already sets the tone for this charming restaurant. It is dimly lit and not too large, and it reminded me of going to a sugar shack type of place. 

I thought the staff was friendly and on time. 

The food menu was extensive in the type of fondue you can choose from, though they do serve a page full of other types of meals including steak tartare. 

I chose to eat the beef tenderloin fondue while my boyfriend had the roasted lamb. Both were equally very good and the lamb meat was incredibly tender and juicy. I had a rosti, which are like hash brown pancakes, and looked a little burnt and kinda bland.

I ordered an apple strudel for desert and it came with vanilla ice cream, and the strudel was peculiar for certain, not in a bad way, but there's something about it that makes you wanna guess what spice is in there.

We also had a live pianist play during dinner, which was a little loud if you sat next to it like we did, but otherwise, I had an enjoyable time.

Price will set you back quite a bit, but an occasional meal on juicy meat, I would return."}
{"text":"Based on yelp reviews we chose this restaurant. Sad mistake. Cool ambiance, but so dimly lit the waiter brought us a flashlight. The waiter failed to tell us they were out of the salmon dinner and goulash after we tried to order. The rolls weren't fresh and worst of all that was the same bread that seemed to be cut up for dipping in the cheese fondue. The fondue itself was pretty good, but did have a very strong flavor of wine and 'kirsch', which is mentioned on the menu. I also ordered the escargot bourguinon, which wasn't too bad, just an overload of parsley and not much garlic. My husband had the 7oz sirloin and it was average. We've had better steaks at chain restaurants. The service was below average. You won't get an awful meal here, but it won't be that good either. If the other reviews on yelp weren't so highly recommended and our bill not so expensive, I might not have been so dissapointed."}
{"text":"I was absolutely underwhelmed by the food and service at this restaurant. I came with my mother and sister in hopes that we would be able to revisit certain tastes of the Swiss(we had lived there), and considering the price we had to pay for this experience, calling it sub-par would be too kind.

We ordered the following: Swiss cheese fondue with wine and kirsch, veal cutlet jägerschnitzel, Zurich-style veal with cream and mushrooms, goulash soup, poire belle hélène, apple strudel.

The fondue wasn't to our taste but it was decent; the veal cutlet was bland and soggy; the Zurich-style veal was over cooked; the potato cakes were savory (unfortunately, one of the only things they got right); the goulash soup was a touch salty but flavourful; the strudel's pastry decided to play hide and seek (it was cinnamon-apple mush); and the pear dessert was average (I suspect canned pears were used); so, overall, mildly disappointing. Not to mention, our orders were mixed up.

However, what really took the cake was the service. While we may have been greeted by a warm server who lent ear to our concerns, her sweetness was very much soured by another server who was impatient, very impertinent, and lacked savoir-faire. What attitude! I am so appalled.

May the fondue gods be kinder to your visit."}
{"text":"just stepping in the 1st thing you smell is urinal block - Yuck! The place I super dark, it was only because we choose to be seated next to a window we were able to read the menu.

The menu said this resto has been here since 1967 - I believe nothing but the prices have changed since.

Carpeting does not belong in a clean restaurant, it was damp and smelly.

For our first 30-40 minutes we were the sole guests. The service was good.

I didn't care for the ambiance? it left me with the sensation that I was eating in a barn, but it had windows garishly decorated with $store flowers. The plastic pencil-holder on the table had bandage tape stuck to it to make the white cross of the Switzerland flag, only upon close inspection discovered it contained a tea-light candle. It was made of plastic?

The green salad was lettuce (tossed in a dressing; too frugal) topped with some shredded carrot. My companion shook almost a teaspoon of pepper onto it, it was still very bland.

+ The bread roll was served hot with butter.

My plate was to have been trout (not) instead a white fish forgot the name. Have to say the portion size is generous. The fish was bland & I was thankful for the tartar sauce. The potato rosti was good. The carrots served I'm sure were old and fibrous.

My friend had Jägerschnitzel, the cutlet was a good size, major lack of seasoning, she used the remainder of my tartar sauce.

The desserts looked great; Pear \"Belle Hélène\" would have been way better if the poached pear had been drained longer/well. The ice-cream was either not stored properly or old as it had ice-crystals in it. Meringue was better.

I won't return."}
{"text":"This unassuming little resteraunt has great atmosphere and may be a good place to entertain a medium sized group of friends or business associates.  The interior is constructed to resemble a small cottage one might find in an alpine village with it's warm wooden beams, posts and plaster walls.  A fireplace build out from one of these walls helps to light the place as well as keep the guests nice and toasty warm.

The menu consists of traditional German/Austrian dishes as well as a few entrees that may appeal to the less adventurous types.  For small groups there is also a host of Fondue choices.  The Fondue can be ordered by the pot or in combinations, with cheese, meat, and chocolate pots served respectively.

My wife and I ordered the Geneva combo which featured a swiss cheese with bread fondue followed by a beef fondue served with a variety of sauces.  If you like your cheese sharp, you will love the cheese fondue.  The beef fondue was everything I expected and although the sauces were a little bland for my tastes, there was enough variety to keep me interested.

We finished up with a chocolate fondue, which I should have ordered in the Geneva Delux combo, because they charged me full price and did not offer to upgrade the combo for me.  The chocolate was a tastey dutch process chocolate melted over a low flame and served with a variety of fruits.  Although they usually have bananas, they were out of them at the time, but the melons, grapes, and pinapple were all good and didn't overpower the chocolate at all. I would have liked to see a strawberry or two, but I'm not sure if this was simply an omission on their part or the fact that strawberries were way out of season at the time.

Overall the Alpenhaus resteraunt is a good place to eat, but don't expect to walk out the door with anything less than a $100 bill, especially if you've ordered any dessert or wine.  This is also a place where you should know what you want before you sit down or you may find yourself caught between the constant pesterings of an untasked wait staff that are not prone to offering suggestions for first time customers."}
{"text":"Excellent service and attention to detail to go along with great food and a cozy ambiance."}
{"text":"Ah. This place kills me......for two reasons. Firstly, it USED to be amazing...Then all of a sudden, the quality of the food and service kind of crashed. And secondly, what kind of restaurant DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO TAKE YOUR FOOD TO GO?!??! This is the reason I won't be back. I had gone there with a friend, and we ordered and appetizer to share and then a main dish each. I had the veal with mushroom sauce which in the past was pretty amazing. However, halfway through that dish, I got full (shocking, I know). At the end of our meal, both of us asked for the rest of our dishes to be packed to go and we were told by a very unhappy woman that this would not be possible. Either eat it all here, or too bad. It was SHOCKING. So.....although the food is ok, I won't be returning here. I don't like feeling ripped off, and the fact that they won't give you the rest of your paid-for food, makes me feel totally ripped off.  :|"}
{"text":"A cold November evening couldn't have had a better end! We went looking for some fondue and couldn't be happier with what we found. Cheese, beef and chocolate, all of which tasted amazing; excellent wine for reasonable prices; staff was extremely nice even though it was late and past their closing time when me left. And the wooden cozy interior was the perfect match for the meal. They even have a real fireplace! Can't wait to dine here again!"}
{"text":"This dirty, poorly decorated, dark restaurant is to be avoided at all costs. You're better off at McDonald's. 

The meal was bland, and flavourless. Everything was fried in the same pan. The wine was warm, and overpriced. 

The dessert was fruit from a can. 

The service was mediocre and a 20$ mandatory tip was enforced. Seriously, just go get a BigMac, you'll be a lot happier than wasting time or money at Alpenhaus!"}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant we went to while in Montreal. Owner Derek was very welcoming and nice and service was exceptional. The food was the only authentic French food we found in Montreal from escargot to French onion soup and the Swiss food was fantastic as well. Must go-to while in Montreal."}
{"text":"Si j'y suis allée à 2 reprises. Il y a plus de 20 ans et tout récemment. L'impression reste la même. Beaucoup de dépaysement côté ambiance. Une cuisine vraiment traditionnelle mais aussi plutôt classique. Mon Potage goulash était bon mais peu relevé. La Saucisse \"Debrizner\" avec choucroute était classique et la recette ne s'éloignait pas beaucoup de la recette traditionnelle.

La Fondue au fromage suisse avec vin et Kirsch goûtait la fondue traditionnelle.J'ai beaucoup aimé la fondue à l'Amaretto.

Je suis surprise qu'on soulève le prix dans les commentaires. Ce n'est pas plus coûteux qu'un autre.  Aussi, un personnel impeccable. Bref. Pour un dépaysement et pour vouloir goûter la cuisine traditonnelle sans écart, c'est l'endroit"}
{"text":"Good, filling meal. I got the escargot app and veal in mushroom sauce entree. Thoroughly enjoyable. Though, I think the waiter didn't like that we didn't know anything about tennis. lol Nice, rustic ambiance."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place but were very disappointed.  We were in Montreal just for a day on our way back to the Boston area after skiing a little further north.  We were looking for Fondue and though the cheese fondue itself was good only stale bread cubes were served with it.  The escargot was pretty good but the entrees were completely uninspiring.  Everything was the same color and it all pretty much tasted the same.  Our waiter who seemed flustered with only a few tables needed to point out that a famous tennis player ate there which only tells me that this tennis player likes mediocre food.  It was very expensive even with the US to Canada exchange rate and we've had so much better more creative food for the same amount of money.  I'm sure there are many great restaurants in Montreal so we'll just have to come back for a longer trip and try some others."}
{"text":"This authentic German-Austrian-Swiss restaurant has been around for 50 years! Yep, 50 years. 
Come on a Friday night, they have live music, turn the lights down and it can be everything from a romantic to a festive fun night. 

The food is lovingly prepared with many homemade recipes from generations ago. Start off with the cheese fondue for two and the escargot. For your mains you can't go wrong with the savoury veal, chicken or fish dishes. We didn't have the meat fondue as we had 5 people in our party so decided to share everything family style. 

For dessert, we had to try the magnificent meringue, a thin slice of Black Forest Cake, the sumptuous apple strudel (Oma's recipe) and of course the chocolate fondue with fruit. My only sadness came from the lack of strawberries. 

Our server Maurice was the best of both worlds, informative with the menu when asked but left us to visit and enjoy our meal with little disruption. Our water glasses were topped up constantly and other staff brought food and cleared dishes away. It was a real collective effort. 

Unfortunately I had to take off a star because of the poor condition of the tablecloths (holes), cloth napkins, packaging of sugar & cream for coffee and the condition of the bathrooms (tiles missing, rubber mats on the floor, and doors that don't lock in the men's washroom). This place is in serious need of a restaurant make-over! 

If you get a chance, check out Groupon. It's a fantastic way to experience this little neighbourhood gem on a budget!"}
{"text":"Absolutely first class food and service.  Ironically we originally decided to go to Geneva but eventually ended up in Montreal.  Derek, Marcell and the cook staff really put on a show for our family so we decided on going there the following night because there is no way we could top the experience for New Year's.  We ordered the Matterhorn and were blown away.  Thanks guys - see you mañana or le demain."}
{"text":"I wish i could eat at this place every day of the year but due to our hot summers Ive decided its a fall and winter spot. I love this place beyond words, the owner and his wife are great and all the staff as well. I know that they have been open for 100 years ( clearly not 100) but they still have the same recipe they did since i started going. 

Richard used to be my favorite waiter but since hes no longer with them i guess that my fav cosmos are being made by someone else :( 

I love the cheese fondue and most people will say its basic its nothing fancy but its great! Ive been to other fondue spots in Paris where cheese is their life and they nail it clealrly but so do these guys. I always crack pepper on top of the cheese to give it that extra flavour.

I think the best part about coming here is the fact that they always give me the spot in front of the fireplace and that they have a guy playing the piano on the weekends, hes been there for ages and hes always got a big smile on his face."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to the restaurant on a whim, after seeing the Swiss flag. We were there to celebrate a new job. The experience was far more than we could hope to have expected. The fondue - cheese, Oil, and chocolate - were perfect. But the best part was the staff. Derrick, Marcel, Richard, and the whole team went above and beyond.  We are excited for our next visit, and more excited to see our new friends"}
{"text":"First of all: HOLY BATCAVE BATMAN!
And not in a \"gadget\" sense, but in a \"wade through crazy darkness and hope you survive\" sense. 

The Swiss cheese fondue was... very Swiss. I'm not a fan of the harsh kind of fondue, so it wasn't for me.
I wish they had more cheesy-fondue options and skip the fondue Chinois stuff (not very Swiss to begin with huh?). So more people would be able to enjoy a good cheese fondue.

It's also kind of pricey for what it is, not extremely, but enough to mention.

The rest of the menu varied from schnitzels (no zigeuner dammit!) to cajun chicken (lol wtf?).

It's not the best Germanic restaurant ever, but it's ok I guess, if you really can't make it yourself or know other places. 
I'm going to continue my search for better and make my own schnitzels, currywurst, goulash and fondue until I find one."}
{"text":"I have to agree with what someone else said, \"This used to be the place and it no longer has it.\" I can see how this might have been amazing at one time but now it is something I would pass on. It looks like the owner is tired of running a restaurant and just can't let go. The interior is kinda cool and if someone with passion came in and brought in some cool import beers and found a few dishes to make signature, it could be hopping again. Sadly it is not."}
{"text":"We ended up coming here for dinner on New Year's Eve after searching for something unique and happening to stumble upon it. I have to say that the staff were amazing and the place is beautiful. The atmosphere set is very nice with beautiful decor and dim lighting. It really does look like how I would imagine a Swiss chalet (though what do I know?) 

The staff were incredibly attentive. It's the type of place where you have someone to greet you at the door and take your coat. At one point, my date dropped his napkin on the floor. A server noticed this and brought a new one to replace it within seconds. One interesting thing is that we didn't seem to have one server and it seemed like they served tables as an ensemble. However, there was never any confusion and so whatever their method is, they have it very well organized.

Now on to the meal... Meh. It's so sad because after all of this, I was really expecting greatness. I ordered from the table d'hote menu and so had 3 courses. The escargot were quite good. For my entree, I decided to go with something Swiss-seeming and so chose the \"Züri Gschnätzlets\" (which is veal with a mushroom sauce). I was not a fan. It came with the veal cut up into bits which I did not expect and it seemed like it was boiled. The sauce was kind of bland. It was also served with carrots which were quite good and hashbrowns which almost seemed like breakfast hashbrowns. 

Being that I clearly didn't enjoy the main part of my meal, I'm tempted to give this place 3 stars but the appetizer, dessert (I had the apple strudel), charming decor, and impeccably friendly service mean I'd definitely be willing to try Alpenhaus again next time I'm in Montreal. I knew I should've gotten the fondue!"}
{"text":"It's my own fault. I should have read more reviews. This place is very very overpriced.  The food is a mess. The lights are down really low so that you cannot see the dirt and disrepair. I really do not understand how they manage to keep the doors open. Avoid."}
{"text":"I went there almost 2 years ago, and was very disappointed by the fondue. The worst I ever had actually.
It tasted like they used only 1 kind of cheese, a real fondue has 3 different kinds.

Hopefully it's better now. Not sure I want to get back there though, I don't want to feel ripped off again."}
{"text":"Great place for fondue, good quality and quantity, but a bit over priced. The owner very much wants to please as he has been doing for over 30 years."}
{"text":"Visited again recently. Delicious fondue! Not much has changed. Atmosphere is still the same, fondue is still awesome. Service is excellent. You can't miss this place if you want excellent fondue!"}
{"text":"Restaurant très très sombre, ils ont dû penser qu'il n'y avait pas de lumière en Suisse... Les plats sont fades et n'ont rien d'extraordinaire. Le service et sympathique mais pas très chaleureux. Attention message spécial aux gens un peu déprimé, le pianiste pourrait vous donner envi de passer à l'action."}
{"text":"Overpriced (even with a groupon) mediocre food. I've been eating fondue since I was a kid and this place was disappointing. Strong boozy tasting cheese fondue, and strange textured meat. Service wasn't great either. 

Next time will be looking for a better fondue option!"}
{"text":"As a student, I don't have much money to spend on nice restaurants, but a groupon came up and I had to splurge because I was so tired of walking by this place without ever having been in for a bite. Had the green salad, veal in mushroom cream sauce and creme brulee. They had a broad wine selection at a reasonable price. My friend also had a veal place, it was stuffed with ham and cheese. Although the creme brulee and salad were expected, both of our mains were absolutely delicious.The wait staff were professionals, not just teenagers running around with their first jobs. I only wish we had gone during the winter to experience the great hall with fireplace that they use that time of year."}
{"text":"Oh The Alpenhaus! It's quite a fun restaurant for the Onion Soup and Fondue! 
Its a place to visit 1-2 times a year. It has a interesting log cabin decor, and the food is quite good. You are having fondue, so it is a slow evening to eat at. Have some good conversations with family and friends"}
{"text":"Nous adorons aller au Alpenhaus pour une petite soirée en amoureux! De plus, les prix (avec le coupon Groupon) sont vraiment abordables et tu manges à ta faim (et un peu plus) ! 

Nous prenons toujours la fondue au fromage en entrée, la fondue chinoise en repas et la fondue au chocolat en dessert ! On ne se trompe pas, c'est tellement bon ! 

L'ambiance aussi est super, avec le pianiste qui joue derrière! Bref, je vous le conseille fortement pour une sortie en amoureux."}
{"text":"To sum up the experience: PERFECT

We went on a groupon but despite that, were treated courteously and without discrimination.

Food: entree: Swiss fondue = was literally tempted to lick the pot after we had scraped every cm of the pot clean.. Super delicious.. 
Main: Jagerschnitzel which is veal cutlet with mushroom sauce and my boyfriend had Zuri Gschnatzlets which is veal in creamy sauce.. Both super filling.. Came with hash and carrots. The server offered some bread too which was nice and considerate.. Huge portions!! Nice and flavourful.. 
Dessert: Swiss meringue and my boyfriend had coupe Danemark = both which made me sigh with pleasure deeply as soon as I took a bite! (I kid you not!) so super awesome!

Wine: perfect recommendation. Met our preference and complemented with everything we ate. $35 (excl. tax) for the bottle but since we were saving through the groupon, we decided to indulge.. :P

Ambiance: would love to live there, if possible! It was as if Montreal disappeared outside and as if we were vacationing in the alps! It was such a homey cozy yet elegant cabin! Very well decorated and live piano music! Candle lit tables.. (super romantic :D) even if it wasn't a date like the one we'd plan, dress up and behave,my boyfriend and I literally felt as if we were in such a planned date.. Just the restaurant did all the arranging!

Service: super nice: I felt pampered!! Kind and considerate servers. They literally asked us if we'd like to take some break and just enjoy the wine between the main and dessert and this was so deeply appreciated since the portions were super huge! We opted for that, finished the wine because didn't want to have wine with dessert.. Listened to the pleasant piano music in the background, conversing away like we never did before!! The time to become ready for dessert was so convenient and comfortable, we both really really appreciated that break! 
Mind you-this was a Saturday evening peak dinner time during the long weekend!! They were at full capacity! DESPITE this! They asked us if we'd just like to take a break. Now THAT is hospitality and a courteous, amazing dining experience!

I would definitely recommend and personally return! Yes it's pricey but omg so worth it!!! I would rather go some place like this than be snubbed/have pretentious service despite paying $$$$ for the meal or be discriminated for being cheap for paying half the price. Definitely worth a visit people! Complete immersive Swiss experience :)"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great stuff about this place so decided to check it out. Really wanted to try the cheese fondue. It is made with kirsch. Should have asked what \"kirsch\" was beforehand because I didn't realize it is so strong. Turns out it is a liquor made with cherry. The white wine is nice but kirsch took it up like 5 notches so it's very strong. . Didn't really like the bread that came with the fondue, it is quite stale and cold...and even after dipping it in the fondue, didn't really warm up. 

Also got the escargot in cream and mushroom sauce - it was good but more mushroom than escargot, (I think we also found 3 escargots and tons of mushrooms), tastes great when dipped with the hot bread that's served with your meal. 

Wanted a bit of meat with our meal so we also ordered the smokies which came with broccoli and a potato pancake. Wasn't spectacular but was satisfying and greasy good. 

Ambiance was cozy as the place is dimly lit and woody, with a weird smell throughout the restaurant which I was not a fan of. Is. Overall an okt experience but I'd like to try the cheese fondues at other restaurants in Montreal to compare"}
{"text":"This was probably the best meal we had in Montreal. Firstly, there are many deals online for Alpenhaus and I highly recommend you book one of them. There used to be a Groupon and when we went there was a Living Social deal. You can probably find others online or just call the restaurant and ask them. Plan in advance because you often have to buy these coupons 24 hours in advance. Also, sometimes there are extra fees for a weekend. We started the meal with delicious bread that was complimentary and lobster bisque which was one of the appetizers to choose from on the Living Social dinner. We paid a little extra and got the delicious traditional cheese fondue with bread. For dessert, I had a delicious chocolate cake. We also split the house white wine. The entire meal with tax, tip, the living social deal, etc. was the equivalent of $75 American dollars. This is a steal. Also, the service is great and the interior makes you feel like you're in a Swiss lodge. I'll be recommending Alpenhaus to all of my friends who visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"I have on a number of occasions passed by Alpenhaus and wondered what it would be like, but was always frightened by the prices which were prohibitive. Most people to whom I inquired about it said it wasn't special, but then my partner got a Groupon so we tried it out. 

One thing that I think this restaurant has is ambiance. The decor is like a cabin, with low light and a decor that depends heavily on rough timber and shepherd's cross. There was a steady stream of adult contemporary piped in over old speakers: crackling Neil Diamond, and whatnot. This somehow goes very well with swiss cheese fondu and pictures of burly men in leiderhosen. The bathroom is really special, but in an eerie way, not a Cactus Club restroom.

Our server was kurt, rushed and really absent, and I assumed this was due to our Groupon status, as some neighbouring tables were getting little peels of attentive laughter and I noted other grouponers getting the shaft. I remarked to my boyfriend that this restaurant probably needed to be relegated to a Groupon purgatory to knock it down a few notches: irrelevant, over-priced, and the food was missing a certain attention to detail. The bread was pretorn into dipping-sized peices, but it was cold and dry. The vegetables for the fondu were pitiable and too sparse. We decided to skip dessert when they didn't have black forest cake. If my company weren't so pleasant, I probably would have left mad."}
{"text":"Very dark but still cozy. The service was very fast. We had fondue as entree. A lot of previous reviews complained of the taste of alcohol being a bit too prominent and i have to agree but we still enjoyed. For main dish, my partner had veal medallions in brown sauce & i had the cordon bleu. The former was really good. The cordon bleu was ok but I wouldn't recommend. For dessert, he had swiss merengue which again was amazing and i had the apple strudel. The strudel was really disappointing. I basically ate the ice cream and then shared the merengue with my partner. All in all we enjoyed our date, but i would definitely go with my partner's choices of dishes if I was to come back!"}
{"text":"Eating German (or Germany-related food) is surprisingly difficult in Montreal, but Alpenhaus solves all this by promising your favourite artery-clogging delicacies. Well, it is a Swiss restaurant, but it'll do. The place is an institution, and has been around since the late 60's, when apparently, it was THE place to be for the up-and-coming young guns in the advertisement business. The place has no windows and back in the day, you could smoke all you wanted. I'm simply amazed to think the place has survived the combination of cigarettes and over-sprayed beehives! 
The interior is very kitschy-60's chalet and intimate, which I adore, and so did my parents. The ambiance alternates, from time to time a pianist will serenade the room, to be replaced by 70's hits. As mentioned previously, everything is pretty steep. My mom chose to try the swiss fondue and both my father and I couldn't resist Schnitzel. The fondue was delicious but my mom was quickly disappointed when she realized the portion size wasn't what she had anticipated. I have nothing bad to say about my Schnitzel and Spätzli, except that they were a bit cold. 
The Black Forest cake is on the other hand totally disappointing, and was probably bought at a local supermarket. Maybe you'll have better luck with the Kirsch cake? 
The chocolate fondue (for two) really is good enough for one. Or maybe it's just time I take a hint and quit eating already. It was very sweet and didn't strike me as particularly rich or unique. Meh. The service leaves a lot to be desired. The waiters weren't rude, but forgetful, and I can't survive on one glass of water a meal.

So for me Alpenhaus is all about the experience and a big hearty meal, I wouldn't come here expecting fine-dining.
Oh, and they don't speak german. My father tried that; total embarrassment. The maitre d'h does speak Swedish tough, go figure."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience, from the owner taking our coats on arrival, to the piano player, to the delicious classic swiss cuisine.  We had a variety of food restrictions that they were very accomodating for.  The cheese fondue was a delicious appetizer, and the chocolate fondue and coffee a wonderful way to end the meal.  We'll be back, and I highly recommend for others!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. I like my dishes. This place is well located. There was dimmed light and with classic Swiss decoration.
The cheese fondue is very traditional, same taste as I had in Zürich. The recipe should include some alcohol. 
Zurchergeschnetzeltes: strips of veal cooked with mushrooms, onions, wine and cream. I liked it too. 
The main dish came with Rösti, which is a flat round potato patty. They are crisp on the outside and soft and melting inside. 
I also had a deep fried pork. It was very crispy, with cheese inside.
Very nice experience. Worth a try."}
{"text":"This cute and romantic restaurant had the best Onion Soup (or as we call it in the USA, \"French Onion Soup\") I have ever had.  It had such a delightful layer of cheese on top of the onions, bread and broth.  Great starter for us - we shared one bowl of soup for the two of us as we wanted to get the cheese fondue as part of our meal as well.

The cheese fondue is excellent here.  They serve it with good crusty bread and for an extra couple dollars they will serve you a plate of vegtables to dip.

We also had the filet mignon which came with the hot oil to cook on your own.  I liked the meat but felt bad about eating deep fried food and cheese in one meal.  Oh well, it was good.  The sauces for the meat were all interesting as well."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal-attentive,but not obtrusive service by friendly waiter. Would recommend the onion soup,-superb-as well as the fondue. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with heading to the Alpenhaus on a cold winter night, it just seems like the perfect place to be when the weather outside is cold and dark. Nothing like enjoying a beautiful fire and filling your belly with hardy foods like Escargots, french onion soup, wienerschnitzel, raclette or my personal favourite, some great fondue. I always love starting with the cheese fondue followed by the Chinese Fondue and finished with either the delicious chocolate fondue or going out of the routine and having the best Crème brûlée you'll ever encounter.
Not to mention that the nice dark cosy atmosphere along with the piano player make it perfect for a date night"}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriend's birthday. The ambient is great, authentic Bavarian Swiss style. We had a Fondue meal which included cheese, meats, and chocolate for desert. Chinese style Fondue in a boiling broth. We really enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Décoration typique d'un chalet suisse et serveurs sympathiques. La nourriture est bonne, sans être excellente. C'est un endroit  où on passe un moment bien agréable."}
