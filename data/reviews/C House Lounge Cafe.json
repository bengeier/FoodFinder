{"text":"I went here last night with my boyfriend  for dinner and both of us were anxious to leave. It was by far my worst experience.  We were seated right by the door, despite seeing a couple of tables open. There was only one waitress who was also acting as the host, so that was part of the issue. I asked for no ice in my drink, there was ice in it. The pizza we shared as an appetizer was less than appetizing. My boyfriend order the shrimp and cherry tomato pasta that didn't have any cherry tomatoes in it. I was very underwhelmed by my open sandwich. I would describe seating at this place as uncomfortable; the chairs sat too low and the tables were too high, which made eating a little interesting. The music was so loud you couldn't have a conversation without screaming. And for a place that pricing itself to be contender with other pricey restaurants in Yorkville, maybe getting rid of the fake flower on the table and investing in fabric napkins, rather than the paper, would be a good idea. Save yourself the disappointment and money and stay away from this place for dinner."}
{"text":"I purchased one of those group deals of this place with the intent of organizing a bridal shower.  I had communications with the restaurant a few times before the shower and everything seemed fine.  On the day of the shower, my co-organizer had arrived at the restaurant only to see it closed with a sign noting they were closed due to \"pluming issues\".  So here, we were a group of girls, stranded with no place to go.  Needless to say, I was completely upset, disappointed and angry - as I received no notice from the restaurant about this.  I will never return here."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Waste of time and money.  If you don't believe me.  Go to urbanspoon site and see other people's comments there.  So bad. 
I made a comment at C House Lounge facebook, instead acknowledging their mismanagement, they just deleted my comments, so convenient."}
{"text":"I am a fan! It is a fabulous cafe for meetups and dates. Desserts are delicious, and their coffees satisfy my Starbucks tastebud. Yah, maybe I'm used to bad coffees but they tasted delicious to me. They have all kinds of sweet treats, which look so pretty too. At night it is turned into a lounge. I like their cocktails too but a bit overpriced for my student budget. I'll be coming back more often!"}
{"text":"I went to C House for a small christmas gathering.   The place physically looks nice but I think they need some consulting when it comes to food, ambiance and customer service.

I ordered the lasagna and a few of the others order the open sandwiches.  The open sandwiches were pretty much a piece of bread with lettuce on top and some cold cuts.  It was very difficult to eat.  I think they would have been better off just making a salad with cold cuts on top and the bread on the side!  The lasagna wasn't \"typically italian\".  Considering the place is from Milano I can't say it's very authentic.  The lasagna presentation was nice I suppose but it was a little hard and I was left hungry :(
There was music at the front of the restaurant but it was not evenly distributed throughout the restuarant.  

I was ok overall.  I had good company with me so I guess after a few drinks it doesnt matter where you are!  To be honest I don't know if I will go back.  I think they are new though so they be just working out the kinks.  I would go back for a coffee and dessert.  On my way out I saw some really nice desserts at the front counter but I don't think dinner is there thing"}
{"text":"The C House Lounge Café is a Milanese chain which has landed in Yorkville.  The interior décor is the typical Yorkville fare - posh and pretentious.  On opening night, a ceiling tile fell and shattered on the ground - 7 years of bad luck has already started?

This place caters to 2 crowds:

A)  During the day:  Stay-at-home-moms or rich housewives who have time in the afternoon to stroll in and enjoy overpriced drinks and glorified desserts.

B)  At night:  Girls seeking rich men, men seeking hot girls.  At night it's a lounge.  I do have to say however, that their cocktails are quite fabulous.

The floors are extremely glossy, I almost slipped and fell a few times.  This is definitely the place if you want to be seen/heard.  High heeled shoes, designer suits, and lots of bling are what you should expect to see if you walk in here.

Cupcakes were good, antipasti was also quite good (though how can you screw up cured meats and olives?)"}
{"text":"I was going to write a full length review, but seeing how Karl R. just pointed out that this place is possibly closed, I won't bother.

In case they reopen here is the quick and dirty:

I came here with a Groupon and the place was deserted. They were missing tons of ingredients and made me the wrong drink, despite there being only 2 other tables. Inside looks like they are trying way too hard to look fancy and upscale. The waitress told me that the owner is never around and that they never order enough ingredients and that stuff was broken and never fixed... Basically I'm not surprised this place went under."}
{"text":"** POSSIBLY CLOSED **

As of the end of June 2013, a bailiffs notice was up on this place's window

----------------------------------

Came here for the High Tea. I gather this is some major high end Italian chain with outlets in jet setter type places. Its basement location and over the top shiny gloss reminded me of the 10-won-a-dozen coffee joints you find in Seoul's Gangnam. Loads of money poured into gloss but at the end of the day you get a $5 cup of instant coffee.

What business they have serving high tea, I'm not sure. Windsor Arms certainly has nothing to worry about. The sandwich tier features sandwiches made from the finest Wonder Bread. Next tier up you get a crumbly scone and a mini croissant you might get in economy class traveling Air Canada CDG to YYZ. The cake tier is some passable bites of fluff. The tea comes one pot per table, not each patron selecting their own pot and tea. The champagne was certainly a nice enough derivation. 

Service, while earnest, didn't seem polished. I guess this place is new. 

The bathroom situation seems untenable. 1 stall for women. 1 stall for men. That's it. A place that could pack in 80 people per sitting have to share 2 toilets.

We came here on the groupon-y thing. Full price this will set you back $80+ for two. $40 each for a shared pot of tea, one Wonder Bread cheese sandwich, and a few other morsels. Oh, and a flute of bubbly.

Meh. Wait for a seating at Windsor Arms."}
{"text":"C House is a relatively new addition to the Yorkville strip and in my view a very welcomed one.
We stumbled into this place one chilly weekend and I was really delighted with my first experience. I'm not the biggest fan of the area, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that C House manages to maintain a classy atmosphere without giving off a fake or pretentious vibe that is usually associated with the area. Hopefully the cafe can attract the right crowd and with a good menu, I can see it becoming established as a fresh alternative to what was once interesting about Yorkville. 
Additionally, despite the fact that it was a Saturday night, I found the mangers very welcoming and open to the fact that our party was just looking for a stop to pick up a quick hot drink late in the night! Everyone seemed impressed with their drink choices and I personally really enjoyed my espresso made with the fancy Ferrari machine!"}
{"text":"I notice that any feedback on their Facebook page gets promptly deleted. Instead of engaging with people and perhaps apologizing or asking for more details, their management just wants to ignore us paying patrons. 

Why would you not want to engage in dialogue to improve your service? We're not here to trash your business. We're providing feedback so that you can improve and provide better experiences for all your future customers. 

I'm sad that you're choosing to conduct yourselves this way - this tells me you aren't willing to learn from your mistakes and cements my decision not to return to your restaurant."}
