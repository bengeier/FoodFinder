{"text":"Whoever manages this establishment obviously is inexperienced and cant!"}
{"text":"do not go here its an absolute dump!!!!!!!!!!! the most filthy toilets ive ever encountered and portions not big enough for a 2 year old"}
{"text":"I am from leeds originally so I love Harry Ramsdens. I was suprised to see one on the front at Scarborough as there are so many fish and chip places already. It has a lovely upstairs position (the downstairs is a Harry Ramsdens takeaway) with veiws across the sea.
It does a varity of fish, has a few other dishes and a good childrens menu. You can also subsitute chips with mash, baked potatoes or salad or have an extra portion of chips (included in the price) if you still have room.
It is a £1 or so over priced compared to other fish resturants in the area but you are guarrentted quality. I have been dissapointed so many times with fish resturants in Scarborough but never with the quality of Harry Ramsdens fish and chips so I am quite happy to pay the extra £1."}
{"text":"Went here because ( and I'm sad to say) it had the name above the door, and I assumed that might give us some guarantee of quality. How wrong I was. Slow service, barely cooked chips and an immediate visit to the toilet following. I cannot condem this place enough other than to add they don't sell \" batter bits\". A chip shop that doesn't sell batter bits? Come on....."}
{"text":"I would never eat in this Harry Ramsden's again. The chips were soggy and heavy or tough and leathery on the outside, the fish was overcooked and tough. Those friers really need to learn how to cook fish and chips properly!


 The place is vastly overpriced, and I would rather eat locally-caught fish at other (and cheaper) fish and chip places on Scarborough seafront than pay the over inflated prices at this establishment for the dubious privilege of eating frozen, imported haddock from Russia!


 I wish I could have awarded no stars to this dump because one star is too good for them!"}
{"text":"Avoid !!! Nice but very small, stuffy restaurant, 6 members of staff on our visit yet after we were seated we waited an hour until someone took our order. It wasn't busyonly 6 tables were occupied. Staff running round like headless chickens obviously not having a clue who was doing what, drinks and food were being sent to the wrong tables. Big disappointment when the food arrived, the fish was tiny compared to other cheaper places in town. The tables are so close together that we struggled to actually get out.nobody brought our bill despite asking 3 different people so we decided to stand by the till. We could have very easily left without paying as nobody would have noticed. After paying, we went up some more stairs to use the looonly 2, 1 was out of order and the other was disgusting, toilet roll strewn everywhere. On returning home, I contacted Harry Ramsdensbut as yet i've not had a reply and seeing as it's been 4 months I don't suppose i'm getting one!!!"}
