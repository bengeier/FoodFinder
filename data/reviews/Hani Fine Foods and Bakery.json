{"text":"Went here for some koobideh. I found the quality to be subpar compared to other persian restaurants.  this is also not an authentic persian restaurant (it's afghan but they serve persian food). I was impressed by the different types of pastries and bread they have on display but I'm not sure how they would taste since my koobideh wasn't great. I also bought a joojeh meal and it wasn't very tasty. conclusion: just go to a real Persian restaurant if you want authentic Persian food. Kababsara in Mississauga is a way better alternative!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great and most importantly the owner is very friendly and cheerful person. The only thing is that they don't have a place to sit beside that the service and food is good.  Atleast don't have to go all the way down to Toronto for good Iranian food"}
{"text":"Its a great food, made with high quality ingredients you can say right from the first bite. The closest you would get to a home cook."}
{"text":"This mini-Arz/Adonis with a hot table/takeout counter has been opened for about a month.  It sells fresh baked Persian breads (Honey, Milk, Barbari), tea, spices, packaged sides, various rice puddings, drinks, and specialty teas.  Store itself is new and very clean!    It's in a residential area, in a small plaza, just north of Square One - less than a 10min drive.  So unless you live in the area, it's not likely that you'll drive by this place.  A Persian friend & I got the $6.99 specials:  Jujeh (Chicken) & Koobideh Kabobs.  Both came with saffron rice, a roasted tomato/hot pepper, and even a piece of Tahdig (crispy yellow rice that's at the bottom of the pot).  They were generous to include a complimentary lentil soup!  Koobideh was better than the Jujeh, so I recommend that one if you're going for kabobs.  I also got a Showlah Zaard which, at the time, I thought was a custard rice pudding, but turns out it was saffron.  Good size for $3.99.  So what's the difference between Hani and the numerous Afghani places that have taken over the city, you ask?  Well, I find the flavours in Persian food much subtler.  If you're used to eating at Watan/Bamiyan/Pamier, etc. you might find this bland.  However, they include butter, sumac, s&p to add to your rice.  No thanks for me, I might just use the sumac!  GREAT alternative if you're watching your sodium/cholesterol levels.  Service was kind, but a bit slow.  Look at all the pics I took while waiting!  Probably waited approx. 20mins, but at least you know that the food is fresh!  :)  Tip:  Takeout ONLY!  No seating."}
