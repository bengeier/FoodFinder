{"text":"Having a bday celebratory dinner with family. This place is a hidden treasure. They serve salad & bruschetta as a starter with your meal which are both delicious. They also have a live entertainer on weekends which is a definite bonus & he is pretty talented"}
{"text":"Have been going to this Restaurant since I was 16. First with my parents and now my husband. Love it. The food is great and reasonable."}
{"text":"Nothing positive to say on this my first visit.  Poor locale, dated decor, atrocious service, and mediocre food. 

Went with a group of colleagues and despite being one of the only parties there the service was bad.  

We had bruschetta that was too dry, and I had the worst gnocchi I have ever tasted.  The portions also seemed quite small

It took them 15 minutes to clear our plates when we had finished our appetizer, and the waiter had the nerve to assume I would tip 15% on the total bill.

I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"i've had better,  i've had worse, the place is kinda dated and the food is ok, 
you wont get sick or nothing, but you wont be craving it either. you make up your mind based on my thoughts... the place needs a little modernization in the menu and in the place itself"}
{"text":"I used to go here every Friday with my parents when I was younger. The food is a bit pricier. I've definitely seen it go up because I have been going there since I was 8 or younger. I love the bruschetta and I always order the linguine pescatore. It is my mom's, my sister's, and my favourite. My dad orders the steak. The waiter is friendly and in the winter I like to sit by the fire because it is nice and warm. 

Sometimes we order the linguine pescatore and pizza for take out, it is always delicious.

Fridays there is a guitar player.
The food is consistently delicious :)"}
{"text":"The service was ridiculous, the staff seemed more concerned with  the customers who were regular there.The food was good, however I will never go back. Never have I ever experienced this type of service. It's so disappointing."}
