{"text":"Got the carne asada burrito combo and a chile relleno.  The meat was very good, well seasoned and perfectly cooked for the burrito, only one problem,  thats all that was on it.  No pico or anything, not even a sprig if cilantro. There weren't even the customary little salsa cups in the bag. The rice and beans were sad with no flavor or anything that would make them stand out. That being said the relleno was ok(doesn't look like the on line photo), not too greasy like most places.  Just remember you have to ask for anything besides the tortilla and meat. I really hope this place improves as I can see the potential and need for a good mexican place in our little area."}
{"text":"Basic Mexican food. Average. Not impressive at all the corn tortillas were rubbery in the enchiladas. Hot salsa had a. weird unpleasant taste to it. Rice was ok and the beans were good. I do agree the rellenos are very good."}
{"text":"Never knew this little place was over here. Good food, seemed authentic. Chips and salsa to start and both are good. We had tacos and a carne asada burro both which are definitely good.  The margaritas where small but also only .99 so you can't beat that.   Overall I would recommend this family owned restaurant.  Service was really good also."}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner and everything was AWESOME! The meat in the tacos was very tasty, the nachos full of cheese, big and tasty kids' meals. Nice place, very \"relaxing\" atmosphere in this family-operated restaurant. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First and last time there. Asked before I ordered \"how's the green chili?\"  Was told it was great-NOT!! It had allot of pork but green chilies were few and far between, very bland... Hot sauce was not hot, no flavor or spice. Enough said I won't even go into describing the rice, beans and stale chips.  When I eat Mexican food I expect my taste buds to stand up and notice-I love Mexican food!! But, won't be going there."}
{"text":"Delicious food! 99 cent margaritas are as good as 99 cents will get ya, but if you ask for a good rita they will make a good one! Flautas are amazing and the pork and green chili burrito and everything else I've had there!  Not a fancy dining room but great food!"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch.. not quite sure how I feel about the food yet. The hot sauce wasn't very good. My shredded beef burrito was good but if you want cheese it's extra (?). Nothing that really stood out to me. I might try it again just. Not sure yet tho."}
{"text":"We found Bibianos on groupon, and tonight was our first time going. The food was superb, we both had the #13, cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco and tostada with rice and beans. They worked with me very well regarding a food allergy. My friend found the two different salsas to be very satisfying.   Can not speak highly enough of our server Terri. She checked in with us often but was not obtrusive. The entire staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I love the food and service. My kiddos enjoy their burritos and sopapilllas! Paula is amazing. She's a great owner who runs her business with pride. Happy Hour offers are great too! It's always clean. Try something different every time"}
{"text":"In a time when the Mexican food from Patagonia, AZ to Anchorage, AK can be as consistently bland and boring as a meal at McDonalds, this little place makes a good effort to offer Mexican food with a flair. Friend and I had Carne Asado and Pork Adobada \"street taco\" plates.  They were very good and I saw enough interesting things on the plates of neighboring tables to strike my curiosity to try this place again.  Pluses: interesting menu, great Mexican beer selection, full bar, friendly service, clean establishment, reasonable prices and Mexican mariachi music piped in.  Minuses: TV in corner with basketball game blaring over music and nobody watching it and cheap, unimaginative decor (the lemonade fountains on the countertop is Sooo 1960's Dairy Queen).  A weekend trip to Nogales and $1,000 would go a long way to spicing up the ambiance, folks. You could do it a lot cheaper by just buying some colorful paints and texturing tools.  We did experience the \"family restaurant\" level of service mentioned by another reviewer, but the young man cared about doing a good job and was bidable to taking advice.  I will return."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the problem. I really like their food. It's good. However; when I went to pickup an order they had placed my food in the microwave to melt the cheese in a styrofoam container. I asked them if they knew you aren't suppose to do that and they replied it was ok and they had never heard that :-/ Needless to say, the styrofoam was melted and had a small whole in it. The first time I had seen my food container in this condition from them I assumed it was from dumping food in the container that was too hot. Now I know what really happened. So, I don't trust that they know how to handle food. Which is sad because I like their food. This was however a while back, maybe they've wised up since then."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and was craving some Mexican food, so I decided to check this place out. I got the Shrimp Burrito and absolutely loved it! I was originally planning on just eating half and taking the other half home but before I knew it, I cleaned my plate. Ha. And my five year old ate her entire burrito with beans and rice. We will definitely be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"we came here to use a Groupon and were very pleased with the service and the food. We did not even know this restaurant was this close to our home. We will definitely be returning. Thank you so much for adjusting the salsa for us as we are wimps. very pleasant staff and large portions."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. Great food and friendly faces here. Try the street tacos meal.... So good!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. The place is clean and well kept. Has a serious family restaurant feel which is EXACTLY what you want when you're looking for good Mexican food. The salsa was ON POINT!! Our food did take a while to come out so I don't recommend it if your in a hurry. HOWEVER the food came out piping hot and was INCREDIBLE. The rice and beans were surprisingly good as well. Most bigger chains focus on the entree and leave the rice and beans in the dust. This place seriously gets 5 stars all around. If you want amazing home cooked Mexican food and aren't in a hurry, this is the place to be!!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for the past few months about 2 times a week.  We always have the BEST service from Nancy who goes above and beyond to refill our drinks and get our food to us fast since we have to get back to the office. I love the burritos that are HUGE and all the ingredients are FRESH.  My husband loves Fajita Thursday for $9.99...The steak is so tender and flavorful and they pile on the goodies with fresh peppers and onions that I love to pick off his plate :)  YUM!  Did I mention how clean the restaurant is?  It is consistently SPOTLESS and everything is made FRESH!  I tried the Navajo taco last week...WOW!!  AMAZING!!!  If you want a great meal with a clean and enjoyable atmosphere and FANTASTIC SERVICE then come and try Bibiano's...you'll be happy you did!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant they have taco Tuesday.  Tried all three soft tacos - crunchy beef this best"}
{"text":"Good food.  Liked both of the salsas.  The taco was crisp and fresh.  A good simple taco.  Tamale was flavorful and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Ok.  Outstanding Mexican food.  My mom lives near by and I've taken her here a few times.  I think the Peoria police hang out here for lunch too.  That made me think it was awesome.  And I was right.    In fact we had an issue where a stalker was fighting with one of our neighbors.  The police took less than 2 minutes to show up. And like 6 cars showed up.  They were just finishing lunch!!!  Breakfast has been great.  Dinner is even better.  Their beef fajitas are outstanding.  Tonight I had one of the House specialties: one taco, one taquito, one tamale and one cheese enchilada.  It was the bomb. Their salsa is also some of my favorite.    They have a full bar with margaritas.   They have a really good selection of beers for a Mexican place.  They have a good IPA and Scottish ale, plus lots of good Mexican beers including Victoria.   Makes me want to move here :-)"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood hidden gem! Always amazing customer service and always amazing food! Everyone is so welcoming makes you feel like family."}
{"text":"My wife and I got a Groupon for here,and were hoping for the best,since we live so close,it would be great to find another place to frequent.We came a little after lunchtime on a weekday,and there were only a few tables occupied,but finding a table that wasnt still dirty was a challenge.The waitress was very friendly and helpful.First came the chips and salsa.The chips were cold and stale,and the green salsa didnt have much flavor.The red salsa wasnt much better,and it came in a ketchup squeeze bottle,one of my new pet peeves at some Mexican restaurants.            When the food came out,it was hot and very attractive.We both had a platter with a Cheese Enchilada and a shredded beef Taco.The beans were good,but the rice was very bland.The Enchilada was bland,also.The taco shell was one of those preformed ones like you get at Taco Bell or in a box from Old El Paso.The meat was flavorless and tough.             If the food was decent,we could overlook the messy dining room.But with two strikes against it,I dont think we will be coming back,Groupon or no Groupon."}
{"text":"Doubtful that much is homemade. Chile relleno fair but can get better at filiburto's. ordered a beef tostada but waitress must have misunderstood and I got a bean tostada. Cold and bland.  Prices were low but I won't be back."}
{"text":"So far one ifthe best Mexican food places we've eaten at in Az. Very friendly staff. Fast service. Delicious food. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Wow!  Called to place an order for take out and was immediately turned off by the rudeness of telling me it's going to be a 45 minute wait.  Like a discouragement to order...  I don't care, I wanted food.  Really sad since this is a place our family frequents.  Very disappointed, not sure I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The place is clean, and everyone is very friendly. Food is very reasonable. I had a taco salad, and it was good:))"}
{"text":"This is OUR favorite spot, we visit at least once a week.  The ladies are awesome, super friendly and know us well.  Its like going to a friends for dinner.  My husband likes to tease, and they call him a trouble maker.  My little man always gets the perfect taco for dinner, or the bacon and fruit for breakfast.  Thank you Thank you Thank you"}
{"text":"Carne asada Burrito and the meat was kinda tough and there asada burrito doesn't come with anything when you order it  like no cheese in it cost extra"}
{"text":"This was our first time and it was DELICIOUS!! It shattered my expectations. I had the combination plate, shredded beef flautas. They were perfect. My nana has competition. They have a full bar and a board with specials. We'll be back for Thirsty Thursday's all day happy hour. The service was great. The chef was amazing. We will be back over and over again."}
{"text":"You know...when this place first opened, it wasn't bad.  In the year or so since then...just not good.  Especially the service.  This is a family run place, which I am all for.  To me, there needs to be a level of service though that goes beyond the friendly face and the whole 'Oh goodness....I can't believe I forgot that' routine.  That happens All The Time here.  The food is average, at best.  They do have some good drink specials for happy hour, but it's not worth going back for when in the west valley.  Sad to see a nice little place regress so much."}
{"text":"Poor service  The queso dip is similar to what you'd get at a college or pro game on the nachos.  It's out of a can and not fresh.   I had chicken enchiladas.  The chicken was cold.   Friend had cheeseburger (they don't eat Mexican food).  Asked for medium and it was charred throughout.   Cool came out to play with his kid and wife who were visiting.    Ever seen that episode of Seinfeld where Jerry won't eat the pizza his girlfriend's dad made him at his restaurant because Jerry was in the bathroom with the dad at the same time and the dad didn't wash his hands?  That's what this place felt like.    Not authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"The best off the menu spicy shrimp I have ever had!!!!!!!  And I am old!!!!!!  Great place!  Great Service!  Ask for the Cameron's Ala Diablo OMG the best and I'm from Los Angeles Ca!  You will love it!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very informal with lots of regulars.  Great food.  Nancy is always running the front - funny, friendly, smiling.  This is my only lunch spot weekly."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Mexican restaurant so keep trying different ones - sometimes with the help of a groupon.  Not good, not bad just meh.  My search will continue..."}
{"text":"Just got back from Bibiano's Restaurant with our friend Kathy R. and my wife. In a place like Phoenix where delicious Mexican food is so easy to find, Bibiano's  was just OK. I kind of expected more from a \"mom & pop\" establishment.   Nothing about this place is particularly memorable except the fact that we had a superb server (Ashley) who was great. Right away she greeted us and got our drink orders and brought us a basket of complimentary chips. The chips came out with a taco like sauce.... The chips were not home made I'm guessing they came from a bag. What Mexican restaurant doesn't serve salsa?!?! I pretty much judge a Mexican restaurant on how their salsa tastes.   I asked Ashley how long Bibiano's had been in business. She told us it was bought out just under two years ago by new owners.   I ordered a bowl of Albondigas Soup for all of us to try. We all truly enjoyed the soup. It was absolutely delicious and flavorful.  I asked our waitress what was good there since we had not been here before. Our waitress was very helpful in her recommendations   Our friend Kathy ordered the Enchilda / Tamale Combination Plate. She thought it was excellent.    My wife got the chicken Fajita. She always judges a Mexican restaurant by their Fajitas and  Bibiano's failed her taste test. Her chicken was dry and the dish was underwhelming at best.  I got the Carne Asada Sonoran Street Tacos with floor torillas. The meat was bland, tough and  apretty tasteless. Even putting the \"taco sauce on the meat didn't help much. The torillas were burnt and I was able to eat one out of the whole mess.   FOOD: The food is mediocre at best. All l I can say is I wish it were better:-(  I've been to quite a few Mexican restaurants around the city and this was not high on my list. It just didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  AMBIENCE: Bibiano's had very simple decor. The enviroment was not very memerable. SERVICE: The service here is excellent.  As soon as we walked in, the bwaitress greeted us and told us about the menu.  CONCLUSION: Everyone can have  a \"off\" day... but there is so many great Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area I guess I shouldn't completely write off Bibiano's but unfortunately, I won't be in a rush to revisit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and prices.  It is hard to beat this place. If your looking for great Mexican food. I have been here 22 times and never have I been disappointed."}
{"text":"I had been  to Bibiano's  about 5x in the past year. By far this was the worst experience I have had. Upon our arrival, we had asked for a table for 6, member of our party wanted to sit by the wall outlet to charge her phone. We proceeded to arrange the tables for our party by the outlet to accommodate. The waitress appeared to be disturbed by the request. Needless to say the outlet did not work. We then proceeded to sit at another table where she had originally sat us.  We then asked her if they accepted the Entertainment Coupons, she proceeded to walk back to the staging area and asked the manager. She came back to the table and said that they can only accept one coupon and that we could not include any of their daily specials or happy hour deals. We told her that the rules in the Entertainment Book that there was a maximum of 3 coupons per table they we could use, she then proceeded to tell us that they had tried to tell the \"Entertainment  Book\" group that they did not want to participate in the book anymore. We told her that maybe they should put a disclaimer on the front window informing their customers of there non- participation. Now she finally took our drink order.  We then proceeded to order our food. We had ordered a Flatus which was so skimpy on the meat. They also charged  an 18% gratuity on a table of 4 or more which was not stated anywhere on the menu and an additional .50 if you use your charge card. We were so disappointed in the customer service and the attitude that we received just because we wanted to sit by an outlet. Loyal customer, NOT! They lost my  business."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food. I just moved here from CA and I've been looking for a good Mexican restaurant. I'm glad to say my search is over"}
{"text":"First time here. Poor experience overall. Our server got to us quickly but was pretty disconnected after initial visit to get drink orders. I tried a patron blended margarita that was almost completely ice and my date had one as well that was a bit better. It took about 30 minutes for the server to take our food order despite us being 1of 2 tables in the restraunt. I ordered the green Chile enchilada which was O.K. at best. My date ordered two tacos and it looked like we got them out of a taco bell drive through. The chips were stale and didn't come with salsa, but had a taco/enchilada sauce with them. All in all we paid 70$ for a meal and two drinks each. This price is very reasonable for quality food and drink, however I do not feel we got that here. I will not be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! The restaurant is clean and has a good ambience. It is family owned and it has that feel to it.   Staff is always friendly and helpful.  Most importantly, the food is authentic. Everything tastes fresh and the meat is well seasoned.   They give military and law enforcement 10% off."}
{"text":"Service was great, friendly staff and lots of food for the price. Our group was 5 and everyone enjoyed what they ordered to include the huge sampler. Chips and? salsa were perfect with the meal. Recommend you try at least once for your own experience."}
{"text":"A group of us went there for lunch yesterday Service was slow. Half of our party had to leave because it took so long. We watched other tables be served that came in after us. When we tried to say something to the owner her response was \"try doing what I do\" I WOULD NOT recommend this place. The food here is comparable to Taco Bell. I'm being generous by giving one star"}
{"text":"I love this little place! The chicken enchiladas are to die for, the chips and salsa are always fresh, and the people are super friendly. They give you a sopapilla ( idk if that's spelled right) at the end of your meal that's pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food! This is a great little restaurant that serves fantastic food. Chips and salsa, make sure to try the spicy salsa. Today we had the chicken taco, chicken enchilada, tostado and the red chilli carneta burrito."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Just went there for lunch. We sat down, ordered, and then waited an hour for our food. They kept saying it was coming, but the food never showed up. Finally we just had to leave. They never apologized or gave a explanation. Don't go there unless you have a lot of time to waste."}
{"text":"One waitress , just for that 4 stars.... Need to wait for everything if one group came just ahead of you. Food great & margaritas good!!!!"}
{"text":"While the menu is authentic, the atmosphere is strange. Tables are sticky, small, and hard to sit with a group. Service is mediocre. Not rude, just rushed and impersonal. The tamales are good and the green chile pork is worth a visit. But get it to go. The dine in experience is missable."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon breakfast burrito. It was good. Pretty good sized too... It wont be the last time Bibiano's supplies my breakfast..."}
{"text":"Shredded beef is great but the crispy taco shells are the pre made ones like at Taco Bell.  Also had a chicken enchilada with green sauce and it was very good.  The beef flauta was good and seemed home made.  The waitress was very nice and checked on us frequently.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just had my first breakfast burrito here this morning.  My only complaint was that it was too big for me to eat it all.  I had bacon and my husband had chorizo.  He was very happy with his also.  Wish I would have started going here a long time ago.  Yum!  Can't wait till I'm hungry again to try something different."}
{"text":"It's a great little Mexican place in the area, which is great because there are not many options close. There food seems more like fast Mexican food (like Romeros and places like that) but more quality! I have tried a lot of different items from here and they all are very good. The only thing I was very disappointed in was the chile rellenos. This is one of my favorite Mexican dishes but it was basically wrapped in a fried egg. The soppapillas are very delicious! Hot and fresh with honey and powdered sugar.   (Sorry for the spelling on the dishes, some might be incorrect)"}
{"text":"This place sucks I've been waiting 40 minutes for my TO GO order. What's the deal? I've been waiting 40 minutes for 1 taco and a burrito good thing I smoked before and I don't have anything else to do but wait for this mediocre food that is conveniently placed a mile from my house. Thanks for the bad salsa and slow service. The food was good tho."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, Bibianos, but this just was not that good. I got a groupon and ordered takeout. We ordered the green tamale with a cheese enchilada and the taco and enchilada. The tamale was pretty good, but very mushy. Everything else was just very bland. I would rather eat at filibertos. I'm sad because this place is the closest Mexican restaurant to my house but it just was not that good. It was not gross, but it was very forgettable."}
{"text":"A neighborhood mexican restaurant that I enjoy. Staff is very friendly and attentive. I can order my fish grilled instead of fried for my fish tacos. Not on the menu but the waitress offered. I always order double beans instead of rice, no problem. Street tacos are yummy. Beer is cold and they have Modelo Negra, my favorite. Their breakfast burritos are large enough for my breakfast and lunch! Again, they will customize. I don't like potatoes in my chorizo egg  burrito so they make it without for me. Still a huge, spicy cheesy indulgence. Be sure to have the green salsa. Tomatillo? They won't give me the recipe, lol! Good, not gourmet, food at reasonable prices and with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's always been a good experience.  Great red and green hot sauce and the shredded beef tacos are awesome.  I also recommend the cheese enchiladas.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Had the Carne Asada burrito and loved it! I got fries on the side but really shouldn't have. The chips and salsa was generous enough to fill me. Loved the salsa too."}
{"text":"This is a gem that we found. The servers were very pleasant and efficient. The food did not disappoint. The chips and salsa were good (and plentiful). The guacamole was the best I've had since moving to AZ 3+ years ago. And our meals were good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my Grandma. Excellent service right from the start! We both got a breakfast burrito, they are delicious! We are definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fish Tacos were so fresh with great flavor! Amazing chips and salsa! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty fair but more inconsistent than good tasting their customer service/wait staff lacks a sense of urgency. Extremely poor in that category. Too many good Mexican food spots in Az/ west valley to waste ur $ here hoping to b served. MOVE ON.... Epically  HORRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better restaurants on this side of town (that's away from the busy-ness of Park West and Westgate). With not much other than a Subway, McDonald's, Pizza Place, and Chinese restaurant nearby, the quality of this place is pretty great. It's small and seems locally owned, which means they focus on the quality where it counts: the food.   The aesthetic is common with a Mexican bar/restaurant, but the \"bar\" part doesn't really exist, which is fine. Places that are a bar-1st, restaurant-2nd generally offer lower quality food anyway.   I've only eaten there three times so far, so I can't speak for the whole menu, but the  burritos are phenomenal. Their tortillas are clearly made the best way they could be, and everything else seems to just fall into place after that.  This is one of those places that doesn't have a host seat you, you just walk in and find an open seat. Since front house staffing is generally limited (I've seen only 2 people up front at a time, even during busy hours), you may find yourself waiting a little bit longer to get your service but it's never a problem. The servers have always been as attentive as they can be, which is all anybody should ask for. Don't be a rude customer if you need more chips, cause these people are clearly busting their asses.  My recommendations would be to spruce up the decor to make the place feel brighter, maybe have another front-of-house staff member on weekend evenings, and crackdown on an addictive salsa recipe."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated Fresh and very tasty. Wait staff was super nice even on a busy Friday night.   Found on Group on.  We will visit again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars, and that in itself is generous. The husband and I decided to try something new, and with my love of Mexican food I was hoping this place would be good... especially because we live down the road. Unfortunately, our hopes were destroyed. We found a spot to sit, and were surrounded by dirty, unbussed, tables. The server was also the cashier. She was nice, but didn't really have much of a personality. Nevermind all that, let's talk about the food. Everything was very bland. Guess we've never heard of seasoning... you know, salt pepper, garlic, onion, the staples to Mexican Cuisine? All well. Guess my search for delicious Mexican food shall continue... happy eatings people."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a groupon for this restaurant. It was worth the drive from North Phoenix.  We were greeted right away by the staff and seated quickly. We were asked for our drink order and we ordered ice tea with lemon. We ordered the #10, cheese enchilada,  beef taco and shredded beef flauta.  While we were waiting for our food, tortilla chips and salsa that was freshly made was brought to our table. Both the chips and the salsa were delicious. The chips were crispy and light, the salsa had the right amount of spice to it. The food was hot and delicious and very tasty. Sour cream and guacamole were on the side. Re-fried beans and rice came with the combination dinners and were also very good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. She checked on us often and refilled our tea.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try a new place to eat. It is worth the drive. The restaurant is in a strip mall that is anchored by a Safeway."}
{"text":"To be honest, Bibiano's was my second choice, as I didn't want to wait around for 45 minutes for the other place to open up. So, I walked in, as took a seat at a both.  The menus are already on the table, so the waitress didn't have to come over, until I was ready to order a drink (they serve beer and some select hard liquor. But, at 11:15AM, I wasn't ready for either). And, since they didn't carry the soda that I like, I had water.  The waitress, Lorena was very nice. She brought some chips and Picante Sauce and Sala Verde, which were colder than anticipated. The chips were flavorful, and the sauces mild (more so, than I expected). But, they were good.  Since I've been eating out more often, I'm trying to watch the $. So, it's easy to hit $$ per person with food and drink. But, with the ala Carte, and certain other dishes, low cost is doable, and is better than fast food. I had their crunchy taco. Lorena asked if i wanted ground, or shredded beef. I went with the ground.  When the taco arrived, the beef was hot, the lettuce crisp, and the diced tomatoes fresh. It was very good.  Truthfully, the sauces and taco spices could have been kicked up a notch. But overall, good food and good service.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! The burritos are great and the chicken soup is amazing. One of my favorite things to have here are the Micheladas. I recommend this place to anyone wanting to have great Mexican food in a great environment, and with great service."}
{"text":"Both food and service is just average.  The main objection we had was the TV was on while we were dining , not to a sports channel but to brain-dead CNN.  This is not the way to enjoy a family meal."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent and friendly.  Can't wait to come back and try their tacos and green chile pork."}
{"text":"My friend Jason told me about this place this is the second time I've been here but so far I like it it's small but people are good they're happy the owner is really nice and the food is very good. So far I tried the tacos and I liked them. Today I'm trying the carne asada burrito it is so good must try next time you come in here"}
{"text":"Awesome family owned and operated Mexican restaurant. Great salsa and everything is homemade. Save room for the sopapillas that come with your meal!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Both for dinner and breakfast. The chili relleno has to be about the best I've had, and as a native Phoenician, I've had a bunch. They're baked, not fried. They might get a little higher rating if their salsa was a little better. I'm sorta picky on salsa. The service is always terrific."}
{"text":"If you have all day to sit and wait for food and drink that is just ok... run to this place.  If you expect normal service and not to wait 30 minutes for a margarita then go anywhere else.  The server was very flustered with only a few tables.  When we spoke the manager/owner, she did not care that service was bad.  They really only care for their regulars... in fact so much that regulars who walked in 30 minutes after us were invited to quickly put their order in before us.  I have visited this place twice in the last two weeks and both times I felt like an inconvenience.  If they only want to serve their regulars they should close for a private party EVERYDAY!"}
{"text":"Good food  fast service Very friendly staff.  Beer is cold and good selection  Had the menudo which was very good"}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite places! The cheese enchiladas, burritos, and street tacos are amazing! Love that they give you 2 salsas- both of which are so delish! Wish they had beer on draft but the bottle selection is good. Lastly, don't pass up the sopapillas!!!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Mexican Restaurant I have been to since moving to Arizona.  I moved here from California in 2015.  Every Mexican Restaurant  in the West Valley falls way below my expectations.  We ordered Cameron's Ala Diablo.  Not on menu and the chef Lidia made it special for us and it was the best I ever had anywhere.  I'm over a half of century years young and was amazingly impressed.  Our server Samantha was so awesome! Very nice!  When we asked for Cameron's ala Diablo  she could have said \"Sorry not on menu\". She went above what was expected and made sure we were happy customers!!!!  We live in Buckeye AZ kinda a drive but worth every mile to get to this awesome place!  If you love spicy food and cold beers!  You must visit This awesome place!  We will be back once a week to order our off the menu Super Spicy Shrimp.  Keep up the great work!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bibiano's was a good stop on our way home from Surprise tonight.  It is a little strip-mall based Mexican joint that is clean and simply decorated in the traditional Mexican restaurant fashion. My son was happy because they had the football game on TV. The service was excellent.   The food was above average.  My daughter loved the flautas and enchiladas. Pork adovada got mediocre reviews from my hubby. And my carne asada was very good...good flavor and no tough bites.  Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Velveeta is not queso!  Waitress was friendly but service was slowwww.  We call it Guinea Pigging, going to new off the wall restaurants.  We won't be going back to this one.  It is cheap, 5.95 lunch specials but blah food."}
{"text":"I ended up here because of the Entertainment Guide. I had a bogo coupon and was going to be in the area. I checked the reviews on Yelp so it seemed like a safe bet. We both agreed that this was the worst lunch that we have ever had. So basically that means that was the worst meal we have had in a long time, as far as I can remember to be fair. It looks fine from the outside. It's definitely clean. I didn't mind the tvs or the music. The waitress was decent as well. We seated ourselves and that was nice. There were only 2 other tables occupied at the time. The salsas she brought were good. The chips were greasy and cold. I ordered the #8. Chili Relleno and Cheese Enchilada. I don't know if the poblano they used was canned or the cheese was just watery but I couldn't finish it. There was so much water coming from the relleno. I have never experienced anything like that before. The batter was pure egg. It was like an omelet on the outside. The enchi and sauce was tasteless. He had the tamale and Cheese Enchilada. There was no meat in the tamale. There was no flavor to the green sauce. No texture either. It was vinegary and watered down. I refuse to go back. The specials were listed on a chalk board in front of the window where the god awful food is expressed from the super weird looking dude cooking. Thank goodness I had a coupon. She came by and asked how it was. We aren't the type to complain so we just said fine thanks. We will not be back. They need to work on their recipes. I eat Mexican at least once a week in Phoenix. I have experienced high end and super traditional but nothing like this. This is like the Denny's of Mexican. #neveragain"}
{"text":"Love eating at family owned places. Homemade food is so much better than all the crappy chains. The service was stellar! Amazing street tacos I tried all the variety of meats and was blown away. Burritos here are so big you will need a doggie bag. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Menudo is great and the red salsa was yummy!! Service was fantastic & clean atmosphere. We are definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"So I wanted Mexican food for lunch while at work. Simply typed Mexican food into Google maps and found this location. Location is only like two minutes from work. I head in and order a shredded beef taco and a bean and cheese burrito. I pay with my card and take a seat at the high top table. On my receipt it said 12:29. Mind you I only ordered a bean burrito and a shredded beef taco. At 12:45 I walk up to the counter to see what's taking so long. At that moment they started to prepare my order, in a matter of minuets and I mean like two minutes my order was done. I watched them make my burrito and my taco and literally in two minuets they were done. I arrived at 12:29 and left at 12:48 with just a bean burrito and taco. Thirty minutes for two items. DON'T GO!!  The taco is no bigger than a dollar bill, actually smaller, and was almost three dollars. My bean burrito is nothing special, beans sit in a pot. That was $5.00!   NOT WORTH THE TIME OR THE MONEY. PAID $9.00 for a bean burrito and a little taco. First time going LAST time going.  Drive the extra miles to either Carolina's or Federicos."}
{"text":"Just a little hole in the wall.. But it is good. Amazing service \"thank you Rica\"... Glad we stopped!"}
{"text":"I was craving a bean and cheese burrito and Bibiano's was the closest and only Mexican restaurant around were I live.  Even though they closed at 1700 on Sundays we got there just shy past 1700 but they still welcomed us and made our food delicious!  The food was pretty good.   Friendly customer service and clean environment.   Even though we took the food to go we still paid attention incase we were to ever dine in.   Their salsa was okay I have had better but not bad.   I did like that it had a bit of a kick.   The sopapia was good, probably would have been great if we ate it when it was freshly made.   We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's great to have such good food, so close to home. Our whole family loves eating here and we find ourselves here at least once a week. The been and cheese chimi is to die for and I can't get enough of the guacamole. ABSOLUTELY recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The only reason we would give it less than a 5-star review has to do with the occasionally spotty service due to understaffing. The place can get really busy, especially on Taco Tuesday. Try to get Nancy -- she will work hard to keep you happy!  The food is very good and an excellent value. Their green salsa is our favorite in the valley. I have tried nearly everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. I highly recommend the street tacos or the chili relleno.  Save room for a sopapilla!"}
{"text":"It was just pretty good. Nothing that sets it apart from the 100s of other Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I was so upset with this restaurant and I will never be back...a group of us volunteered our time at the food bank and decided to go eat afterwards and was shocked at the service we received. There was only one server and got bombarded by people in for lunch. We were in for lunch and already sat down when more people came in. The server proceeded to  serve the regulars and it took over an hour for them to take our order..:I actually left without even ordering because I wasn't going to wait. The manager or owner sat in the corner with her spouse and never even got up to help her server. After our group tried to hang in there and just pay for the drinks we got and they were being very disrespectful to us.  I would leave a zero star review if possible but it made me pick a star."}
{"text":"Bibiano's is a great locally family-owned Mexican food restaurant off of 107th Avenue and Olive Avenue. I have been going there for many years (since they opened) and have tried most things on the menu.   Bibiano's has the best pico de gallo I have ever had. I recommend requesting it on the side and adding to as a garnish to whatever you order. It has great flavor and can be used to add more flavor to any dish or to make their smooth salsas chunky. I have affectionately started calling the restaurant \"Paula's Pico\" when I come in.   I highly recommend you go in with an open mind. They have all of the standard Mexican dishes - but if it is not just how you like it make modifications when placing your order. The people at Bibiano's will take care of you and make it how you like it if you just ask.   Along with the standard Mexican fare they also serve wonderful breakfast dishes on the weekend that I highly recommend. The breakfast burritos are the best breakfast fare and can be quite massive (easily over a pound) if you load it up with extras (peppers and onions, beans, etc). If you are not in the mood for a burrito they also have pancakes and other standard breakfast dishes. Their breakfast skillet (eggs, potato, several different meats) is to die for.   Beyond the food, the company of Paula, her family and wait staff is worth the visit. They are friendly and will take care of you when you go. However, do not expect Bibano's to serve at the speed of a fast food restaurant or a chain. You won't be waiting forever - but freaky fast service is not what they are about. They are a family run establishment that will have you feeling welcome and a part of the family after just a couple of visits. After just the first you should be impressed by the food, the friendly atmosphere and the wonderful value."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here a few weeks ago, because it was hot and they had a sign outside that read \"best margaritas in town\".  \"Heck yes\", I thought to myself.  I should've kept driving.  Let's start with the chips and salsa.  The chips were stale, and the salsa was some sort of red water with no other flavor.  There was nothing to \"scoop\" as it had no actual tomato, onion, cilantro, or other yummy ingredients you find in salsa.    Next we ordered guacamole and margaritas.  The margaritas were far from the best in town.  In fact, they were kind of weird.  It's hard to describe, they were blended, but somehow formed into some funky salty foam.  The guacamole had one ingredient, which was avacado.  Again, no spice, cilantro, jalapeno, or other ingredients you'd typically find in a good guac.  This place is bland at best has no imagination, no quality...almost like they don't care what they are giving their customers.    I was very disappointed in my visit and will not be returning.  I will also add that I used the restroom and there was no soap, so I'm not sure how the employees are washing their hands, but it's not happening after their restroom use.    Bottom line, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Went here the other night and ordered the house special taco, tamale, enchilada and tacoito. It was just aweful no flavor at all the chicken you can tell is just boiled in water the rice was dry to could tell it had just sat there all day. The tamale had no filling was all masa dough and no flavor or spice and the taco was not a taco authentic taco, same as tacobell but worse. This whole dish was just bland no seasoning, spice. If looking for authentic Mexican this is not the place and the service is terrible took 25 minutes just to pay do yourself a favor and skips this place. There grandmas are most likely rolling over in there graves at the just sheer lack of soul that goes into there food. Will never come back there again."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. Crispy Taco was made with a prefab shell and the shell was rubbery instead of crispy. Enchilada was okay but sauce lacked flavor and red sauce wasn't very red.Beans and rice ok but weren't broiled bubbling hot with lots of cheese as I prefer. Overall very \"fast foodish\". Won't be returning. Did have a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered their chicken salad bowl and it was delish. My favorite dish for sure! Everyone is extremely nice. True gem."}
{"text":"Good food, and a friendly waitress. These tacos don't disappoint. Beers cold, food is good, what else do you want?   Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We first dined here 2+ years ago, after moving to the area. We were not impressed and did not come back for a good 6 months to a year, when we decided to give it another shot. I believe they had a management change, and the food was much better this time. The prices are very reasonable for the portions you receive, and it's even better when we have a Groupon or Entertainment Guide coupon! The one complaint I have is that the waitress we tend to get each time is nice, but very slow on her service (receiving the food, refills, check, etc.)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an employee's birthday lunch and was not disappointed. The place does have that whole in the wall vibe and the food matches. Everyone at the table really liked the food and we all mentioned we would be back. The weekday lunch specials were very reasonable and so was going ala cart. I opted to go ala cart as the menu stipulated that there were no changes or substitutions for combo plates and no combos include tamales. I ordered a cheese enchilada and tamale. Both were good, but I have to say the enchilada was better. The tamale was good, but some of the stringy beef inside was a bit dry/tough. The red sauce made up for it. The waitress was really friendly and nice and made sure we had everything we needed almost before we asked. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food all around, friendly staff... decent prices too..  Go to place that is near where I live..."}
{"text":"Waitress priscilla gets 5 stars.  Food a 0.  No flavor, no alterations.  Really?    Asked for whole beans...cooked in water and not much else.  Asked for the talked about Pico salsa.  Extra charge.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Finally went back to try again. It was much better this time. Had chili relleno and enchilada. It was good. My husband had a green chili burro. Chips and salsa still meh, but overall better experience."}
{"text":"Good food and plenty of it for a nice price.  Fish tacos were good as was the beef chimichanga!  We'll do this again for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.....love the family atmosphere,  chips and salsa are delicious and the food is fantastic with generous portions."}
