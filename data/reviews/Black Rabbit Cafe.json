{"text":"There is a limited selection of sandwiches despite the expansive and upscale feel of this place. I had the mash up sandwich, soup, and a smoothie. I was expecting something great, but everything was just bland and watery. The soup was completely flavourless, the smoothie had no trace of any fruit flavour, and the sandwich might as well have been styrofoam. It's hard to believe but they managed to strip every bit of taste out of these ingredients. Service was ok; nothing too engaging. Decor and ambiance were top notch. This is more of a place to be seen rather than a place to eat."}
{"text":"Food I had was pretty yummy and not the typical (which I liked) and the rest of the menu looked pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"have visited a few times since opening and im sad to report that both the service and quality are already going downhill .  had the turkey soup which literally tasted like dirt .  totally underseasoned and flavourless aside from the overpowering earthiness .  turkey pieces were so tough they were inedible .  i was very hungry but could only down a few spoons .  requested gluten free toast as it had previously been offered to me when i inquired about gf options .  it was served essentially untoasted and the person who served it asked if wed like it toasted more ... um yeah it wasnt toasted at all , clearly just warmed and spongy so this made no sense .  had to ask them to butter it .  ordered the carrot sweet potato puree for my son and when he refused it i tasted it myself : so bitter !  definitely tasted like raw carrots ; not sweet at all .

its sad that the food is so lacking because i really do love the atmosphere and concept .  with inept teenagers serving subpar food im not that keen on returning , but will probably be back due to lack of options in the neighbourhood ."}
{"text":"Wow! Stopped in for breakfast, coffee and a fresh juice and was impressed with everything from the food to the service. The girls behind the counter were so sweet and accommodating and everything tastes so fresh and healthy. Definitely recommend for a casual light meal!"}
{"text":"Checked out Black Rabbit Cafe with a friend for lunch.  Was pleasantly surprised by the bright, clean dining area with good sized tables comfortably spaced so that I could pull my stroller in!

Orders are taken at the counter and then delivered the to the table.  I got a ham/cheese sandwich and a coffee ($11.50).  They toasted the sandwich for me which was nice.  Vegan friend got a tempeh miso sandwich ($8.50) which she said was also good.

Service was very friendly and staff checked in on us as they were clearing our table.

Baby mama's note:  They do have a change table in the bathroom downstairs.

I'd be happy to come back with the Little One for lunch or just coffee/snacks.  A fantastic addition to the BWV 'hood."}
{"text":"A new addition to Bloor West Village, the Black Rabbit Cafe is a sleek, modern, yet cozy space. The food is fresh, organic and I can verify that the scones ($3) are full of flavour and compliment the delicious coffee on offer. I was impressed with the 'kids' and 'baby' menus available. The shop is exactly what the Bloor West Village cafe scene (or lack thereof) needed - a bright, modern family friendly space with plenty of seating and room for strollers and highchairs."}
{"text":"Decent new cafe that features vegetarian/vegan friendly options. A bit overpriced for what it is, especially since the food is nothing spectacular. Friendly service, but a bit overzealous when recommending more food (How many times do I have to say a soup and sandwich are more than enough?)  Cute homey decor. Would like to see a bit more flavor in their food."}
