{"text":"We enjoyed sitting out on the street. They have a large enclosed terrace in the back which is very nice as well. Wait staff is very friendly. I had Filet Mignonette with Brie which was excellent. The mussels were also very good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with very friendly and helpful service. We sat in the lovely garden and had caspachio, and for entrees the veal and the lamb followed by creme brullee."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this cute restaurant. It looks empty from the street, but I am glad a waiter came out to let us know they are opened. The garden is where you want to be."}
{"text":"Un petit resto sympathique pour dîner, souper ou tout simplement prendre un verre entre amis!"}
{"text":"Staying up the street & looking for a close place for dinner- so glad we found this place. Don't be alarmed by the lack of people in the restaurant on a nice night- they are all on the lovely garden/patio in back.   Raphael, our waiter, was a gem. Our French is only basic and he was great at translating the menu and explaining items to us. He never rushed us but also didn't make us feel like he had forgotten about us or not paying attention. The food was amazing- the meat cooked just right with wonderful sauce and not overly salty. The table d'hôte was a great deal and plenty of food. Overall, great first dinner in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Good french bistro. Friendly service. Food is tasty, nothing fancy, but very homey!  Lot's of French tourists, because well rated in \"Le Routard\" guide.   Wine list very short. Well spotted in Quartier Latin."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  We came around 9pm on a Wednesday and after reading the reviews here on Yelp, were not alarmed that there weren't too many people in the restaurant. Go in! You won't regret it!  Our waiter was incredibly nice and helped us through the menu which is entirely in French. We chose and recommend the following: - Mussels: best cooked mussels each of us has had in a while. Perfect appetizer to split or meal for one  - Tartiflette: Duck, potatoes, mushrooms, and I think ham, all covered in cheese! What's not to like?! This was the showstopper and a must order - Bavette: Extremely tender cut of beef in a gravy like sauce and served with French fries. Recommend! - Lamb Meatballs: don't remember the French name for this one, but it was a special served in tomato sauce with rice and vegetables.   We had such a lovely time and enjoyed the atmosphere with leather bound books and dim lighting. Will certainly come again and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent, cozy, unpretentious french restaurant conveniently located in the Latin Quarter. Friendly staff who spoke English as well. We had the bison burger, which was excellent, and the vegetable gratin, which was even more so. Portions were large, which I'm finding standard in Montreal. Wine was good as well. My one complaint was that it took us some time to get the bill, but the staff were so friendly it's hardly a complaint. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was very quaint - we sat in the backyard terrace.  We had the pea soup and goat cheese salad to start which were delicious. For the entrees, we had the duck confit and tartuflette which were delicious as well."}
{"text":"Our last night in Montreal and what a disappointment! Mexican music made us wonder if we were at El Torreo. My mixed grill was indecipherable as to the meats as two were over cooked and the third was raw. I usually can't have it rare enough, but this was so raw I couldn't cut it. Claire's grilled shrimp salad was with steamed shrimp, anemic and bland. No bread plates, paper napkins, and cheap utensils on a paper placemats. Never again!"}
{"text":"Excellent French food, great service, cozy bistro atmosphere. This was my first French meal in Montreal and I enjoyed it so much.  I had the filet mignon with brie that came with fries and salad, and everything was delicious. I definitely would love to return again if I visit Montreal again. Love their garden with outdoor seating in the Quartier Latin neighborhood as well."}
{"text":"Sort ta pipe mon pellerin on s'en va chez la Saguine !  Le Quartier Latin c'est bien beau pour se divertir...   Dans le fond,  on se gâte avec sa blonde, on sort au ciné, on lève le ptit doigt en prenant le thé... mais avant tout ca. Il faut manger tamtiménir ! Le problème c'est à part de boire de la bière et se bidonner sur une terrassse je n'ai jamais vraiment associé le coin Berri-Uquam avec gastronomie.   Ce soir là alors, j'ai mis mes lunettes roses et ouvert ma pensée positive ... bon dieu un resto francais prêts d'une pizzera et du Presse Café. Rentrons!  Ce resto est surtout un plasir pour sa terrasse arrière en été. On y mange des plats typiques français : bavette, filet mignon, poisson du jour. La cuisson est fait avec goût et attention, sans fla fla... un endroit tranquillo avec des serveuses qui sont très sympa.  Dans le fond, c'est un peu pour vous reposer les oreilles du traffic et discuter entre amis.  À la revoyure! Péribonka m'attend! Ben oui c'est au Lac St-Jean mais je pensais au début que c'était dans le bout de Matane... donc Pellerin ... Matane.  Bref, je me sensure pas pour vous autres...  Yelp-u-later"}
{"text":"My friend who is a professor at the nearby college brought me here on a late Sunday afternoon, which was empty at that time!    I had the smoked meat sandwich (which came out as \"ass smoked meats\" on the receipt).  The decor is a cross between cafe and living room, in a nice area of town with a lively street full of many stores and restaurants.  Generous bottles of water and comfortable seating was welcome after a long walk before, the meal was filling and comforting.   My local friend gave this place a good review as a regular and I endorse it!"}
{"text":"Malheureusement, le manque d'employés font en sorte que l'expérience au restaurant est plus ou moins agréable. Nous avons attendu facilement une demi-heure avant d'avoir une interaction avec la serveuse. Le plat conseillé par le chef (bavette de boeuf) était bien, mais sans plus."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem of a restaurant. It isn't as fancy but their food and service is excellent here. We all loved our food here and the prices were fair. I have to say this had the best French fries that I ever tasted. They were so creamy inside. I will be coming back here next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Deuxième fois que nous allions et probablement la dernière. Plusieurs plats n'étaient pas disponibles, le serveur semblait complètement perdu ... bref pas super!"}
{"text":"First impressions are everything and as the first restaurant I tried in Montreal, I am impressed.   The service was fantastic and the food was delicious. I enjoyed the bison steak which came with a good portion of fries and greens.   The chef was very accommodating as my friend is a vegan and the menu is very limited in terms of vegan options. A special meal was put together for him in which he has raved about ever since.   The ambience of the restaurant is romantic and the small patio warm and welcoming. A nice spot for couples, families or a trio of friends."}
{"text":"Nourriture excellente pour nos trois tables d'hôte différentes. Service rapide et ambiance relaxe. À recommander ."}
{"text":"A quaint restaurant off in the side street, away from the rowdy crowd. We came late in the evening and sat outside - lovely ambience. Husband had the duck loaded with cheese in a bowl (I forgot the menu name) and his eyes almost popped out considering how big they were - in his words \"this is amazing!\".   We didn't get our servers name but he was very friendly and gave us a few pointers of what to do on a monday night and also good places to go for smoked meat ^^"}
{"text":"To get away from the strip of restaurants that is crowded of college students and tourists, this restaurant is on the side of the block hidden away.  At first as we looked in the restaurant, we thought it was empty, but as the waiter told us to come in to be seated, he walked us into the back into a garden looking seating area full of people:  Filet mignon - 5 stars - for $22, this dish was my favorite because they stuffed brie cheese in the middle of the meat, that made it so delicious. Came with salad and fries, which were  good too.  Duck Confit - 3 1/2 stars - for $21, I got a duck leg and drumstick.  However it was a bit salty. Came with cheese over potatoes which was an excellent addition, and salad.  Duck tartiflette - 4 stars - this dish was a unique duck casserole topped with cheese. Came with salad.  Bison bacon cheeseburger - 4 stars - for $17, my son loved his burger so much he didn't want to share it with us.  The burger was thick with two bacon strips, tomato, onions and lettuce. The bun was sweet and crispy. Came with fries.  Blueberry creme brulee - 4 stars - for $5.75, this dessert had a creamy flavor with a crunchy top, and the blueberries added a nice flavor to it.  Soft chocolate cake - 4 stars - for $5.50, we got a round chocolate cake with a hot pudding mixture inside and another type of sauce on the side to mix with it.  Elizabeth cake - 4 stars - for $5, this cake had a shredded coconut topping and creamy sauce on the side to tip the cake in to get the ultimate flavor.  Service - 3 stars - the waiter was a bit rushed because the kitchen was closing soon.  We came in late so some dishes ran out and the usual bartender was not working, so he said it was best to order wine instead of the mixed drinks. He also couldn't explain the dishes and drinks in English so well, but at least there was an English menu so we could order what we wanted."}
{"text":"The food presentation was lovely and the food tasted even better. The garden patio was a pretty place dine. The staff was really agreeable and friendly and our waiter Raphael was super, knowledgeable, helpful with menu items, all with a great sense of humour. He recommended a great local beer and excellent main courses. The potage (potato and ? soup) was scrumptious and the salad tastefully dressed. The beef bravette tasted great,  with a delish mushroom sauce. The tilapia. also appeared to have a lovely sauce. The Queen Elizabeth cake was a delicious confection of dates and coconut and I'm not sure what else.  Highly recommended restaurant to eat. Right near the very lively St Denis nightlife district."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this French restaurant for a long time but never got the chance. I finally tried it for brunch when the summer heat was too much to handle, and their shaded back patio was exactly what we needed. The brunch was great and the prices were surprisingly low for Montreal. I will definitely go back to try it for dinner very soon!"}
{"text":"Food: This is a French restaurant with excellent food. I had their filet mignon with gambas and a glass of Syrah. However they brought out the steak with brie instead. It was somewhat a fortunate mistake because I love brie and it went very well with the steak. They were apologetic about the mistake and brought out the gambas later. The steak was delicious. The meal came with a nice salad and some fries.  Service: The service was excellent. They were friendly and able to speak to me in English. They messed up my order and was able to correct it right away without any fuss.  Location: It's located on Rue Ontario in the Quartier Latin. It was very convenient for somebody without a car. You will have to look for street parking if you drive here. If the weather is nice, they will most likely seat you in the outdoor patio area in the back which is really nice. Inside the lighting is a bit on the dimmer romantic side."}
{"text":"A nice French bistro--a bit old-fashioned, with limited menu choices, but good quality.  We had dinner, one of us had mussels, the other bavette with champignons.  Substantial portions, well cooked, both dishes included salads that were quite good, with plenty of greens, tasty tomatoes, and good dressing.  French fries included as well.  Service very pleasant, English spoken."}
{"text":"A colleague brought us to this nice establishment.  The decor is very cozy and you will enjoy the atmosphere.  The food is nice as well.  The filet mignon with brie is an excellent choice for dinner.  A must have is the blueberry creme brulee.  You can't go wrong with these choices for dinner."}
{"text":"Tried to get away from tourist's crowd  and found this gem. From the minute we came till the last bite everything was just simply amazing. Waiter Francesco was very good and attentive, gave us a great advice about our choices. Duck confit was melting in the mouth and creme brule is unbelievable! Greatly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great experience from the moment we walked in.   We were kindly greeted and quickly seated by whom I believe was the owner. We were started with a free ginger soup, which was delicious and appreciated after coming from the cold outside. Our server gave us great recommendations.I had the duck and the Mrs had salmon, both were amazing.   Dessert was followed up with a cheesecake and a sugar cake for me, both were delectable.   This place has a personalized mom and pop kinda feel to it, and I love it. It took a little while to cash out but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. I will be back here next time i am in montreal. ."}
{"text":"I order the same thing every time I go out for breakfast since I'm in the search for the best eggs Benedict in montreal. I would give pèlerin Magellan the number two spot based on their sauce and number one based on their plate. The eggs had caramelized onions in the mix and the fresh fruit on the plate was the good stuff... pineapple, strawberries, watermelon... many breakfast places break my heart with soggy melon and warm grapes. I wish they had a 1 egg option though as two is usually too much for me. Regardless, is come back for sure. Yum!"}
{"text":"I was checking out Montreal on my own and this place got good reviews on yelp.  The servers couldn't have been sweeter and the outdoor area in the back was very quaint.  They even gave me some advice on tipping in Quebec.  Unfortunately the food was just good.  They did have an English version of the menu, but it didn't match up to the French menu.  I went with the Duck confit salad.  It was good, but had about three times more oil than I would have liked.  I'd go back, but I wouldn't rush."}
{"text":"From the outside the place looks very ordinary, but as soon as you step in, you're in another world. The dimmed lighting and 'colonial' style decor successfully create a cosy ambiance without being old fashioned. We were free to choose our own table which I appreciated a lot. As for the food, I had the bavette de boeuf bordelaise while my companion had the filet mignon with brie, with rillette de canard as entrée. My bavette came with salad and fries. It was delicious (the sauce was excellent) and to be honest with you it exceeded my expectations - I find French bistro food to be rather bland in general. The staff was very friendly and left us linger around after the meal but still made sure we had water. The lady who brought the meal accidentally dropped the little cup of mayonnaise that came with the fries and a bit of the mayo splattered onto my jacket. I'm glad she did because I learned something new from what she did after: to make sure the grease goes away, she wiped the spot with vinegar (with a cloth) and then covered it in salt. At the end of our stay, I shook the salt off and whaddaya know, there was no trace of mayo! Overall great experience and I highly recommend this to both locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"Probably one of the coziest brasseries I've visited in quite a while.  A friend and I came here last night for a last minute dinner before heading out to a concert. Sunday night in Montreal generally is NOT a good night for going out to dinner, many establishments are either closed or shut down very early.  That said, we stepped in here and were instantly charmed by the decor and ambiance, vintage and antique maps, old, thick books and book cases, fireplaces and wood panelling figure prominently here, you have the feeling you just stepped into some old brasserie in Paris or something, with Leonard Cohen sitting at the bar.  We were told that the bavette here is especially good and I have to say the recommendation was correct. Simple brasserie food, very tasty, an excellent wine list, decent prices and great location, this is exactly to sort of place you come to in the winter to get warm and cozy while enjoying some great comfort food."}
{"text":"Quand je pense à un restaurant français, mes idées allaient directement vers la haute gastronomie, mais ces derniers temps, j'ai un réel plaisir à découvrir le style bistro-pub à la française et je suis en train de tomber en amour avec ce genre d'atmosphère. De la très bonne bouffe, des vins délicieux et une ambiance relaxe dans un décor à la fois art-déco et ramasse-tout. Le Pèlerin-Magellan est exactement ce genre de bistro avec zéro prétention, plein de chaleur et de réconfort, puis c'est simple et authentique d'abord et avant tout. J'y suis entrée en ayant faim et besoin de me réchauffer, puis je suis ressortie pleine et de bien bonne humeur. À essayer entre amis pour une soirée plus relaxe, ou pour le lunch une journée froide et pluvieuse. Ça va vous remettre sur le piton!"}
{"text":"Let me start with I'm American. The food was delicious, however the service left a little to be desired. My waiter was unsure about the appetizer of the day and told me that he hadn't tried the soup of the day but assured me it was \"very tasty\". He took an extremely long time between courses to check on me and a long time to bring the check.  The meal was a beef bavette and it was cooked perfectly with a scrumptious side of fries served with a side of mayo. Never getting used to that   I would totally eat here again"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. The filet mignon with brie was tasty and perfectly cooked. I was glad that everything from the appetizer to the entree included a little bit of salad. Creme brulee with blueberries was awesome - not too sweet. Our server was attentive! The garden in the back is in a nice shaded area."}
