{"text":"I loved everything - menu, service, atmosphere, decor, look of the food - except the taste. Sorry, A N' A. We sat there wondering why everything tasted a bit off. It was like the sous chef was left in charge or maybe the chef had a sinus infection and couldn't taste. In any case the fried potatoes in the brunch were good. The amount of food was generous. I wouldn't go back for the food. I hope they figure it out because everything else is great."}
{"text":"Place is kind of small, but I'm a fan of the decor & atmosphere.  Low-key, cozy, quaint, dim-lighting, wood benches and tables, and very friendly & attentive service!

What I liked the most about this place is that the food we tried was definitely better than your-standard-gastropub grub and it had a unique flair to each.   I mean, if you're going to go out to eat, you want to eat something that  is different from what you can make yourself!  And if you're going to go to a gastropub for some flavor-packed, calorie-filled, heavier foods, you're definitely going to want it to taste DELICIOUS!

We had the Mac N Cheese, Shepherd's Pie and Fish & Chips.  All were yummmmy!

The Mac N Cheese got the seal of approval from the BF, who is a huge Mac N Cheese fan and really wanted to try Alchemy's version.  Very Cheesy, but not too greasy.

The Shepherd's Pie was pretty good though and, even though I was expecting to taste more truffle, had lots of flavor.  

Most impressive was the Fish & Chips.  The batter was different from any other I have had before and soooo yummy!  I'll definitely be getting that again next time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, her mother, and I went all out at ANA due to all the rants and raves on here about it. Could we get a refund possibly due to bad reviews? We had a banquet of food as well...mussels for an appetizer ..this was a good dish. Got the \"frites\"...uh, whats the big deal and idea? wendys has better fries. I guess the truffle oil was a plus but still. We ordered the lobster roll...is it supposed to be cold warm and hot all at once? It was very small and rubbery and overpriced! 18 dollars for average doesnt suit me well. Shepard's was pretty good but Ive had way better before. The crab pierogies...psshhh, dont even consider getting these tasteless bits of nothingness....didnt even taste like crab. My girlfriends crabs are tastier. hmmm, what else did we get....oh ya, the pork belly...it was also overrated...very greasy, ya i know its fat, but it tasted like oil too much. They had 90 min IPA on draft and our waitress was cute. So all in all, this place was just okay."}
{"text":"The decoration/setup was very well done, the food was pretty good, the draft list was short and the server was not knowledgeable.  Overall it was a let-down since I've been passing it for a while thinking it looked really cool and I don't think I'd go back for the food or beer list."}
{"text":"For those that may not have time to read the entire review. The food is ghastly, the service is horrid- avoid this place like the plague.

I don't like to write negative reviews. However, it is what it is. The only thing positive I can say about this place is the decor is pleasant, albeit the size of the dinning area is extremely small. My husband and I actually eat here 2 months ago. I had hoped once time passed, I could be more fair about the experience as I was completely aghast after dining here.  I sincerely hope the owner(s) of this place will try to improve the establishment. In restaurants, as in life, you need to be humbly enough to learn from your critics. Else, I would be very surprised if this restaurant will be here even 24 months from now.

When I first heard about this place I was very excited to check it out. What especially caught my attention were the statements that this establishment would have organic beer. However, when we arrived they actually did not yet have organic beer yet. Bummer. They should not be telling people they do, if they do not.  Let down number 1 of many.

 My husband ordered mushroom soup. It was bland, cold, and the mushrooms hardly looked like the \"wild\" mushrooms their menu purported them to be. It does not take a genius to figure out the difference between wild and mushroom farm mushrooms. We were speaking about this quietly amongst ourselves when our waitress interrupted us and said she would get a manager. It was a little creepy that our waitress was spying on our conversation but we let it go and waited to see what the manager said. The male that arrived to our table, calling himself the manager was abrasive and rude. Instead of apologizing for the bland, boring, cold soup that was served, he was defensive and the first words out of his mouth were \"I hear you don't like my mushrooms\" followed by a self-righteous snort.  

The soup was taken off our bill, which would have left us satisfied enough to not mention a negative word about it- but with a creepy wait staff and buffoon for a manager one must share this experience so that would-be diners won't waste their money on this place. The food is terrible and bland while the staff are arrogant and dim-witted.

I ordered the mussels as an appetizer. It was awful. They were dirty- no one bothered to clean them properly and half of them were completely closed. How does a restaurant serve such a thing? It is a wonder they have not killed anyone. I was honestly so put off at this point I almost canceled our dinner. And I should have.

My husband had the greasy, bland Shepard's pie. Which does not make sense to me. If they are using fresh ingredients how can they screw up such a simple dish? Has no one told the kitchen staff that salt and pepper are used to season food? Mind boggling, really.

I ordered the A n A burger. It was overcooked and a under-seasoned greasy mess.  One would think with amazing burger establishments nearby such as Burgatory and BRGR - if you dare to serve a burger it should be AT LEAST as good as the competition.

We were excited to finally get the check so we could get out of there. The manager was right outside the door, smoking about 1 foot from their front door.  Not that I expected much less."}
{"text":"A menu that Pittsburgh needed!!!!!! I haven't had a bad item on it yet. The service was fast an friendly."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Pittsburgh from NY and have been missing the food culture there and I was very excited to read that the chef formerly worked in NY. 

The gastropub menu at Alchemy N'Ale was enticing, especially the grass-fed beef burgers, something that can be hard to find at a local bar in Pittsburgh, so last week, we set out for a late dinner at what we were hoping would be our new neighborhood spot.

When we arrived at Alchemy N'Ale, there were 2 people behind the bar and maybe 7 people sitting around the bar. It was not busy. We sat with anticipation, ready to spend money, ready to see the menu, order some beer and some food, but our menus never came. In fact, neither did a greeting or simple acknowledgment from anyone working there. We sat there for nearly 15 minutes (what feels like an eternity on a slow night) before deciding to leave sadly, in utter disappointment. 

I am stoked about being in Pittsburgh. As it turns out, I also love to drink and eat delicious food and have worked in the food and wine industry for a long time. Pittsburgh is such a great place to start a business and with a little love and effort, it could easily rival restaurants in NY. This is why I am so disappointed to see a place that HAS so much potential, fall flat on such an EASY and crucial element: Hospitality. 

You'd think a new establishment in a new market would be enthusiastic to greet some of their first potential regulars. On the contrary, we felt like unwelcome guests entering a stranger's home. At times, we observed 3 people behind the bar (plus 2 floor servers), the lead bartender being obvious to us and often within arm's reach. To add salt to the wound, it seemed as though manager/owner was present at the bar just a few stools beside us. Not once did any of the 5 staff members make eye contact with us. A very simple 'Hello, I'll be with you in a few minutes' would have made all the difference.

We continued to wait considering the newness of the place. Maybe they were working out some kinks, I thought. And as we sat there waiting, we watched as the bartender downed a shot with a group of men at the other end of the bar. Outrageous. I'm not against a laid back, drink-on-the-clock bar style, but a good bartender knows how to multitask and should at least greet people who are sitting there before he puts one back.   Instead, he avoided all eye contact and neglected those eager to engage. He apparently had no interest in putting more money in his pocket. We left without even a beverage to quench our thirst on a hot summer night. 

I don't like to write negative reviews on yelp and maybe there were circumstances that I was unaware of, who knows. Before I decided to share my experience publicly, I sent Alchemy N'Ale a personal review similar to this one, and heard no response. I sincerely just hope they will read this and try to improve. 

It's a shame that I wasn't even given the opportunity to review the real nitty gritty: the food and beverages. Maybe I can convince myself that it is worth going back and trying again. I really wanted to love them."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review in a while because most of my experiences have been on par with what most other yelpers have said about restaurants I have visited.  Nothing I read on yelp could have prepared me for my experience last night at Alchemy N' Ale \"gastropub.\"  

 I will try to be brief:

Every table that was seated around us, 6 different groups mind you, had one problem or another with service.  One table in particular stands out:  they had been there for about 40 minutes and had only received drinks and no one had checked on them in that amount of time.  When a busboy/manager tried to pick up their silverware they informed him they had not eaten yet.  10-15 minutes later the server came over and asked if she could get them anything else or if they were ready for their bill.  They informed her they had not eaten yet.  They were comped drinks, but when their food came out, it was the wrong dish.  It wasn't even busy, not that it matters, since every table seemed to have a problem.  I am not attempting to speak for other groups, I can only comment on what I saw them go through.

They may have been pleased with their experience, but it made me uncomfortable watching all these mistakes go on around us with the manager clearly having no interest in fixing it.  I got the pasta special which was underwhelming but not dreadful.  My girlfriend got the burger ($14!!!!) and had to drench it in ketchup to make it a decent sandwich.  If I am paying $14 for a burger I expect it to be phenomenal.  An $8 plain burger at BRGR puts this burger to shame.  

Our server brought the bill and I inserted my card....and I waited...and waited....and waited... She spent 15 minutes at the bar talking to what looked like 2 managers.  I walked it up to her and she said \"thank you\" as if nothing was wrong.  I went back to my seat... and I waited....and waited...and waited.  I looked around and guess what, she was talking to them again.  Finally she brought it back to me.  I left the smallest tip I have in my life, and we got out of dodge as quickly as possible.  

Also, they are pushy.  They keep bringing drinks that you have not ordered and expect you to pay for them.  

Also, the tables suck.  The two tops don't allow you to put your legs underneath the table.  You kind of have to straddle with one leg in and one out.  The four tops also do not allow two people to sit together on the side with chairs unless the chairs are touching.  Really awkward.  

Just don't go here.  Seriously.  If you want a gastropub, go to Meat & Potatoes.  James Street on the North Side is also a much, much better option than A n' A.  There are so many good places in Pittsburgh to eat that it makes me sad that people waste their time here.

When I left A n' A I did the only thing I could to take my mind off the experience.  I drove straight to Tamari and enjoyed incredible cocktails and great sushi.  

In the survey when it asks if there is waiter service I am putting no, because yes seems like an overstatement."}
{"text":"I'm particularly excited about a new establishment in this end of Lawrenceville since I live in the area.  I've been to Alchemy N Ale multiple times for drinking, once for brunch, and tried my first pierogi since coming to Pittsburgh.  I have not dined in the dining room so cannot speak for the servers, but the male bartenders and owner are fantastic-really fantastic.

I cannot compare pierogi's since they were my first, but I thought they were tasty enough.  I've heard great things about the salad and can't wait to try it.  The brunch was fantastic.  I had the yogurt (greek), granola (with candied ginger) and fruit.  Way too much granola, but it was delicious.

The Moscow mule is very good and the copper cup it comes in is a nice subtlety.  I do wish they had a drink menu and more liquor to choose from.  For example, they don't have any brandy or cognac to make a sidecar-which I think is a basic drink.  I'd like to see a menu with specialty drinks (and listed prices!!), mostly because I never know what to order or much about cocktails, and it's easier to pick one off a list.  And I want to know what it costs before I order it-sorry, I hate when bars don't list prices.

I will be back many times, and sit at the bar.  It's nicely decorated (the lighting is a bit odd), usually aptly busy without too much ridiculousness, and there's ample street parking.  And I like that I can be dressed up with heels.  Be sure to check it out at least once."}
{"text":"We just moved back to the Burgh after spending 3 years in California.  We always kept track of what was going in the Burgh so this place was on our short list to try when we returned.  Love the changes inside.  We had been to the place when it was Geno's.  We sat at the bar near the end close to the service area which is NEVER a good idea but they were the only seats at the bar.  The draft selection did have local beers so we liked that.  We ordered the mussels and fish and chips.  Both came out barely warm to the touch.  The sauce for the mussels was delicious, however, they should have been steaming when they were brought out.  I was born in New Zealand so I'm pretty picky about my fish and chips which is kinda stupid since it is a pretty simple dish.  I expected the triple fried fries to be amazing but they were barely warm and soggy.  Weird.  The fish.  Ahhhh the fish.  The batter was crazy bland.  The fish was a thick cut and wasn't cooked all the way through.  Now, the only thing that saved this dish was the mushy peas.  I would go back for the mushy peas and that is all.  Well I might go back for a dark and stormy too.  The bartender was very attentive which is always good.

How do you screw up fish and chips?"}
{"text":"Ughhh. I gave alchemy a second.. third.. Chance.  They finally had enough sense to drop their absurd prices ($15 for a pretty average burger? Come on...) so I thought they were worthy of another shot.  Welp, they replaced their absurd prices with absurd service and a lack of pretty much every item on the menu.  I mean, at 10 PM on a Friday night, how can you possibly be out of almost all of your draft beers, Captain Morgan, and half of your appetizers, INCLUDING the one that the waiter recommended?   Maybe you should make sure you actually have something before recommending that your customers order it?  And OH WAIT... they didn't ACTUALLY drop the prices.. they just stopped included fries with your meal and charge 4 freaking dollars to add them on.  So let's do the math... 5 lbs of potatoes costs about $3 - you get about 4 oz. of fries -  so the true cost is somewhere around 15 cents?  Sounds like a rip-off to me.   

Sad.. this place could be cool.  But alas, it sucks.  Spend your money elsewhere.  And hope that the schmuck running this place takes a look at some of these reviews and gets a clue."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while.  I saw a lot of mixed reviews here and wasn't sure what it I'd find.  My wife and I tried this place out tonight and I was very impressed.  The atmosphere was low key, but very nice.  We were immediately sat at our table and the very knowledgeable hostess took our drink orders - a large and very good selection of beers to choose from.  I ordered the Shepherd Pie and my wife ordered the Frito Pie.  Both pies came out at the same time.  It was my first ever Shepherd Pie, and I loved it, it was great.  My wife liked her Frito Pie (fritos on the bottom covered with chili, then cheese and then an egg over easy).  All of the tables, in the small-ish restaurant were occupied during our dinner.  It seams as though they have the kinks worked out and the place is getting pretty good business.  We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"They barely finished the restaurant the chairs are incredibly annoying there are not caps for the exposed brick and the food though it is delicious came out at probably 300 degrees! And for a business with the last name ALE doesn't have a very good beer selection. This is a newer bar and I just think there is a lot of room for growth just yet. Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible."}
{"text":"I think it's a pretty adorable spot and worth a try. Our meals were very good tasting but priced a little too high for what they were.  The servers were kind of the aloof hipsters who make you feel stupid for asking questions about the menu, but at least he managed to keep our drinks fresh, the attitude of the staff in general kind of made me feel out of place eating there with my dad, who always asks questions.  You know that whole hipster pretension thing that is plaguing a bunch of Lawrenceville at the moment?

I was really impressed with my scallops over this wonderful creamy polenta and then when I returned they changed it to over a red pepper risotto, which really didn't speak to me the same way but both times the scallops were really well prepared.  My dad go the Frito pie when I went with him and that was definitely a heart attack in a bowl, decadent to say the least but probably not priced appropriately for ground beef, cheese and frito chips baked in a crock.  

I'd go back again, but there are a lot of other places I want to try first."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  My initial impression was very good from the atmosphere to the service.  However when our meal arrived I was very unimpressed.  The $14 lobster deviled eggs were bland and the lobster tasted rubbery, I ordered my burger medium well and it was practically still moving, the broccoli on the menu came with what was described as cheese curls.  I assumed that was possibly shaved parm but I was surprised to find soggy Cheetos intermingled, it was nasty!  The concepts were good but the execution was horrible!

The food was lousy but the atmosphere and service were very good, I would only recommend if you are there for a good beer.  PS Don't order a cocktail unless you like to drink form plastic glasses :-) To sum this up in four words....trying way to hard!"}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant.  Limited menu.  I assume the menu will grow as this place finds its way.  We had the cheese plate(ok), beets(very good), mussels(very good), iceberg sald(big and good).  Pretty good beer selection.  The music was defintely off.  I am sure this will change as well.  The brunch menu looked very good.  

I'll go back sometime to see what changes have been made."}
{"text":"Alchemy & ale is a great addition to upper Lawrenceville (is that what we're calling that area?) and a dramatic improvement over the previous Geno's. 
Bartender and host (manager?) were extremely helpful and attentive. Waitstaff were a little confused - but tried their best. 

We tried a number of dishes, most were fine to good -but we were left feeling most of the food was missing something. 

The fries with Truffle gravy were great, I would have drank the gravy if I could have. 
Lobster deviled eggs and lobster roll were OK. But unremarkable ... and those are two dishes if you're going to serve - should be rock stars. 
Mussels were good and would order again. I can't remember what else we had at the table - but that's a testament to it's unremarkableness. 
High hopes for this place as the menu continues to tweak and adapt. I think the format is great and will go back - just not running back yet."}
{"text":"Love the concept and long over due in P-Town!

This one should be broken out:
5 star - the idea
5 star - the beer
2 star - the fancy food
4 star - the burgers and the like

BUT I bet they start doing their seafood and such better.  I'm always so excited about a lobster roll, but meh, I'd not order the ANA one again.

So get a burger, and a beer!"}
{"text":"Alchemy N' Ale could be a great restaurant. The space is nice, the menu is full of hearty food that will appeal to most Pittsburghers (pork belly, interesting burgers, fried chicken dinners, and Shepard's pie), and they have great beers in bottles and on tap. 

Right now, however, they're still working out the mechanics. It seems like the owner is trying to run a restaurant by staffing it with friendly people who haven't had a lot of experience in the food industry. The bartenders had to look up how to make an Old Fashioned and a Manhattan. Our waitress brought out a huge cheese plate with four pieces of bread (and cheeses she couldn't identify). Then she dropped off a stack of dishes, pile of silverware, and paper towels for us to pass around the table. She didn't know which wines they had. Half of our party's food was cold because the kitchen didn't time out the prep so they would all be done at once. 

This would all be normal if you were BBQ'ing in a friend's backyard, but would be kind of surprising even at a dinner party. I will wait 2-3 months to let them work out the snags before trying it again."}
{"text":"My friend and I bought the Groupon for it when it was available and were both pumped to eat there.  Unfortunately, I think A n' A still have some work to do to.

First, the positives:  
1.  The space on the inside and outside was beautiful.  Love the decor.  Stylish and comfortable.
2.  The bar is definitely on point.  Fantastic beer selections, friendly bartender.  A little expensive but nothing unheard of for the area.  My friend got a rum and coke, which I think was $7, but it was so strong it was definitely worth it.  My fiance and I both got Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPAs, one of our favorites, and they were both $7, which for a beer with 9% ABV isn't out of this world.  
3.  The wait staff is extremely friendly and attentive, even when busy.  There was some confusion initially when we walked in about seating, so maybe they should have a clearer \"check in\" area.  Overall pleased with the service, especially for a new establishment.

Unfortunately there are important areas that are negatives for our A n' A experience.

1.  I don't want to be rude, but there was an odd stench throughout the entire restaurant.  There were people eating mussels, but this was not a fresh seafood smell.  This was more of a garbagey/pet store smell.  All four of us smelled it, but maybe it didn't bother others as much as it did us.

2.  The food was just OK.  My fiance got the pierogies, which at $16 you would assume be enough food for an entree.  What it consisted of was about 8 small pierogies with corn and bacon tossed on top.  He said it was OK, but he was still hungry.  These would be a much better appetizer.  Me and my friend both got the house salad, and I had chicken added to mine.  These were good salads with decent dressings, my only minor complaint is that there were way too many olives and way too little cheese.  Another friend got the Alchemy Fries and said they were good and they gave him a ton of them.

3.  There was no 3G in the restaurant and there was no Wifi available.  Minor complaint, but noticeable since this is becoming common place for trendy new restauants.

For what I was expecting, Alchemy n' Ale was a disappointment.  For the prices and space, the food should be much, much better.  The comparable restaurants in the L-Ville area offer so much better quality food for less.  The menu seems kind of random and all over the place, so maybe they haven't found their identity yet.  I did see a plate of mac n' cheese go by that looked great, so maybe I'll give it another try.  

This place has promise, so I hope it improves so we have another fantastic place to go to in L-Ville."}
{"text":"What a gem in L-ville! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Definitely enjoyed the ambiance created by the exposed brick walls and the bare wooden tables & chairs. Did I mention they have at least 5 different pumpkin beers available this fall? Quite divine served with a maple brown sugar rimmed pint glass. Salt-roasted Beets as an appetizer with creme fraiche- delicious! I kept stealing bites of my husband's Shepherd's Pie also... so good."}
{"text":"It was a ceviche kinda Sunday in Lawrenceville...

Following an exhausting morning on the rivers courtesy of Kayak Pittsburgh, myself and a friend headed to L'Ville to sample brunch at Pittsburgh's newest gastropub.  Gastropubs in general make me giggle.  They sound kinda silly, but who doesn't like to dress up in their finest hipster attire and pay too much for too little?  WRONG - not the case with Alchemy (and possibly any other gastropub, given I've never been to any others...).  The decor is relaxing and oozes exposed-brick charm.  Since it was brunch-time, we were given the brunch menu, which was ripe with delectable options ranging from french toast to pork belly.  Before our meals arrived, we were treated to a basket of pastries, including croissants, danish, etc..  Honestly, they were slightly Costco-ish, but I like Costco, so no complaints.  Brunch is served with choice of sangria, mimosa or bloody mary - and might I say my drink was, hands-down, the best damn bloody mary I've EVER had.  My guest ordered the sangria, which seemed a little underwhelming, but on to the food...

I ordered the Shrimp & Crab Ceviche, while my friend ordered the much-raved about Drunken French Toast.  I ADORE ceviche, and this dish was no exception.  The right-sized bowl of shrimp & crab could've done with slightly fewer onions and more crab, but in general it was absolutely delicious.  The shrimp was plump and fresh and I quickly gobbled up every last bite.  Surprisingly, it was the complement of fried potatoes that really did it for me.  I try to stay away from potatoes, as they are my undeniable weakness, but on this rainy Sunday, I couldn't say no.  And I have zero regrets.  They were fried to perfection, with just the right amount of seasoning.  In addition to the potatoes, my dish included plantain chips.  Sweet and a little gooey, these chips were very satisfying and I'm certain I could eat an entire platter alone.  

I also had the chance to sample my friend's drunken french toast and it as DELICIOUS as it was pretty.  Final thoughts: no air-conditioning, so if it's hot - forget it; very few tables, so if it's busy get ready to wait; the wait and the $20 you'll spend will be worth it to enjoy a unique brunch in this unique little place."}
{"text":"We went for a late night (10 pm) snack and a drink expecting a great time based on all the brunch reviews. It's likely a different show being run... or we're just snobs.

In order of things that happened, where our disappointment looks like a bell curve, skewing left and then spiking on the right tail:

They're in the process of revising their menu, which is fine - this happens at good restaurants. Except that the current menu was extremely confusing because items were crossed off and items were starred and it turned out that both meant that they weren't available. Our waitress was suspiciously enthusiastic about the secret new menu items on her notepad. Fine.

We found out that their french fries with truffle gravy have veal. Beef stock, I would have considered okay and got it on the side for my vegetarian husband's sake. Veal is not fine with me, so we changed our order to scallops and a cheese plate.

Alchemy N' Ale is mostly about the ale, but we're known to be cocktail hobbyists/writers/reviewers and went for their specialty: the Moscow Mule which was explained to us with the baffling inclusion of SOURS MIX. We got it anyway, being optimistic. It came with fresh mint in the standard copper (colored, at least) cup, as do many of their other drinks - but for $9 each it had barely any vodka in it. Not at all fine.

The cheese plate ($10) arrived with 3 cheese and 3 accompanying condiments. I cannot be 100% certain but we immediately noticed that 2 of the 3 as cheeses bore a striking resemblance we had bought at Trader Joe's recently. Not just like \"all cheddars look the same\" but these were the specialty cheeses they make. Odd but fine, I guess, they were good enough and came with grilled bread.

The scallops, which weren't on the menu, were cooked perfectly and came in a great creamy polenta. We got the bacon on the side and quite honestly it was nothing special (like normal, hard, crispy diner bacon). I had to snap the two strips up and put them over the delicious scallops. We didn't know how much it would be, but we're only half-shocked to find on our bill that the 3 large pan-seared scallops were $22. I can live with that. It added a star to my final rating.

While waiting a long time for the waitress to get back to us, and give us the check and then process our cards, we had time to ponder the music selection. This is when we noticed that we had been listening to music that is typical of a bar mitzvah - Everybody Dance Now, You Turn Me Right Round, and other really dated selections with volume adjustment problems from the \"DJ\" who just couldn't get the right level to get the party going to Abracadabra. The whole atmosphere was just... off.

Final verdict: brunch is probably great, but other than that if you're looking for a GOOD cocktail and food worth the sticker shock please do yourself a favor and just go to Meat & Potatoes.

And just to drive this home, as it is the most important thing to me:
What they serve here is NOT, I repeat NOT, a real, proper, or good Moscow Mule. They are doing it so wrong. Moscow Mules have vodka (a lot of vodka, not a big splash), real ginger beer, and lime juice. Not sours mix."}
{"text":"firstly, this place has a great vibe -- cool exposed ductwork & brick, reclaimed wood behind the bar, and a clean separation between the bar & main dining area.

secondly, the staff was super-helpful and nice.  richie was totally spot-on behind the bar and made it a point to introduce himself to us, show us the menus (even though we weren't eating and just wanted to creep on it), and explain the drinks to us.

thirdly, the joint carries both local & other domestic quality beers on-tap (bell's, east end brewery).  and, the moscow mule?!  goddamn delicious.  comes in one of five frigid copper cups (richie told us these are $30/piece -- so, if you're gonna drink one of these at the bar, they want either your CC or driver's license so they don't disappear), tastes like ginger, and is full of delicious booze with no taste of it!!!

can't wait to go back and try the food, including both styles of beets (is that weird?!)...and hopefully give the fifth star!"}
{"text":"If I was writing a review based on food alone, Alchemy N' Ale would definitely be a five-star experience.  Their burger is one of the best I've had in Pittsburgh and the seasonal Pumpkin Pierogie dish was amazing.  But we waited longer than expected for our food, and when it did come out,  our dishes did not come out at the same time (something we noticed at several tables around us as well).   

The ambiance of the restaurant is great, with exposed brick walls and rustic wooden tables, but the set up also seems to not make the best use of their small space.  More two-top tables or moving tables closer together could accommodate more people and create less of a wait for tables.  That being said, the whole time we were waiting, the bartender and host were very attentive to us and others who were waiting.  

Knowing that it is a newer restaurant and still working out kinks, I would definitely still go back and give it another go because the food was great and that's really what I was there for!"}
{"text":"Ugh!  I want to LOVE this place. . . but:

This weekend my wife and I went out to eat here for my birthday.  I liked the place, having gone there with my Dad a few weeks ago, and wanted her to get to try it.  The plus side is, she really liked the food.  I did too. . . sorta (explanation follows).  

They were out of a few things, but I decided pumpkin pierogies sounded awesome and different.  She got steak. . . rare. . . as usual.  We got mussels for an appetizer and the sauce was fantastic!  I always want to drink what's left as soup, but I didn't, cuz I'm klassy.  

They brought out my wife's steak (cooked just the way she likes it, bleeding as if stabbed) and chose that moment to inform me that they were out of the pumpkin pierogies.  Now I'm very easy going when I dine out.  I'm mostly just excited to have someone cook and clean up and try new things.  But if you're out of something the time to inform them is not as you bring the other person her supper.  I stared blankly at the waiter (who seemed sort of \"new\") and said, \"And you're telling me this now?\"  

I eventually settled for skillet-seared scallops with bacon on honey-siracha polenta.  They were good, if somewhat over-sweet, and we were going to cap the evening with coffee. . . but they were out of it, so we settled for their version of a molten chocolate cake.  After a few minutes they stopped over to the table to inform us they were out of that as well.  At that point it seemed appropriate to say, \"we'll take our check now\".  

Although the owner, and both waiters came to the table to apologize for effing up my dinner so spectacularly, when the final check came, there was no \"hey, sorry about your dinner, we took one of your cocktails off the check\" sort of gesture, and I admit I was thinking they would do that.  Not that I expect it, or even ask for it when it's not given (unless it's a total debacle) but it's still something that a \"good\" gastropub should do.  

I was mostly disappointed because I really wanted my wife to have a good experience there so I could convince her to go back, and it was my special magical birthday week dinner. . . and they botched it. . . so I tucked my birthday tail between my legs and we went home."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I had brunch here with a few of my girlfriends on a Sunday.  We started our brunch with some great drinks: mamosa's, sangria, and bloody mary's.  The sangria was one of the best I have ever had.

We were seated at a charming table that was meant for a king & queen.  The large seats and table were all made of wood and went perfectly with teh brick walls.

We were treated with delicious pastries while looking at our brunch menus.  You could tell the pastries were fresh and there were a variety of them.

The menu for brunch had a variety of delicious items such as drunken french toast, chicken and biscuits, crab & shrimp ceviche, and fruit and yogurt.  The food was delicious and served timely.  The group ordered a variety of things with the drunken french toast as the most popular item.  Everyone seem to enjoy their food.

The service was great and the people were very friendly.  The bartenders and waitresses seemed to love what they did and created a laid back atmosphere.

One item to note is that there is no air conditioning.  It was warm on the day I went and the room was not uncomfortable but it could be if the place was packed.

I would reccomend the brunch to anyone.  It is completely worth the $20 for the food, friendly service, and decor."}
{"text":"We want to preface this review by saying that Ale and Alchemy's service was excellent and their decor was appropriate. We also appreciated that they had DogFish 90 minute on tap. 

The menu posted on facebook had a roasted chicken option and this dish was a main attraction (along with the beer menu) for dining here tonight. The roasted chicken had been replaced with a fried chicken and the rest of the menu was equally as heavy. I ordered the pork belly. Parts of the pork were a bit tough (not acceptable for a pork cut with such a high fat content) but I did appreciate the crisp exterior. The rice accompaniment was a bit mushy and had an overwhelmingly vinegary flavor from a vinegar based hot sauce. 

My companion had the \"seasonal pasta dish.\" It was \"ok\" but bland and not particularly appetizing. 

We ordered chocolate sorbet in a \"chocolate shell\" for dessert. We were not given spoons with the desert but that was easily rectified by the helpful staff. We were even given a steak knife after one of the waiters saw us struggling with the shell. We did not realize that it was a strangely shaped coconut shell until a third server told us 5-10 minutes later. 

We want this restaurant to succeed. Its concept is promising. However, they must include lighter options on their menu and execute their current menu better. We look forward to trying them again once they make these improvements!"}
{"text":"Haters be damned, Alchemy and Ale impressed me tonight. While dining with a friend yesterday, I was tipped off that my Groupon would be expiring in the next two days. Great, I know that Groupons usually mean long waits and a a certain disdain for the people using them by the time servers are exhausted with the rush of forgetful cheapies near the end of a groupon's life. Hey, it's not my fault - if I could use it day of, I would... My mind has wandered by the time they're active, though.

I arrived at the door to a jovial man who simply asked my name and wrote it down on a notepad - no wait time offered, didn't even ask how many were in my party(maybe it doesn't matter). Regardless, he was willing to talk after what I assume to be an influx of people slowed down. The space is small: Upon entering there is a bar with two bar tables to the side on the right, a dividing wall, and a 'bistro' area with probably 10 tables or so. The decor is cute, the dividing wall has fake ivy and streetlamps to give an outdoors-indoors feel. We were seated in about 15 minutes.

We were seated and immediately given glasses of water, and the short black-haired waitress asked if we had been there before. We told her it was our first time, and she went off on quite an in-depth speech about her favorite items on the menu and why she enjoyed them, touching on probably 70% of the menu unprompted. When asked about vegetarianism and nut allergies, she was extremely accommodating. This girl provided service that I thought was top notch - slightly informal, but passionate, and a desire to make sure the customer is happy. The line \"The chef will do his best to make sure no nuts come anywhere near your plate\" shines in comparison to the usual \"uh, the chef says he uses nuts, is it like.. I mean will it kill you?\".

We chose our entrees on her recommendation, and being lovers of the mighty beet, we also chose the Beet Panzella($9) - roasted beets, caramelized goat cheese, chunks of bread, arugula, supposedly new to the menu. The flavors in this dish were excellent, the bread soaking up the beet juice, and the goat cheese was phenomenal. This was my favorite dish of the night. 

One complaint I have about the dishes here is that it seems like the chef doesn't like to use too much salt, which may be good to some, but I like salty food - even though I hate to use a salt shaker when I go out. Regardless, I found it to be a common theme throughout the meal.

Our entrees arrived, my girlfriend getting some sort of mushroom pasta dish($14) and me opting for the shepard's pie($16) that the server raved over. I don't eat mushrooms, so I can't speak for that, but the shepard's pie was served hot in a decently sized portion. The quantity was not so large, but this was quite heavy and I was hurting by the end of it. The flavors were good, the truffle stood out well in the gravy, the potatoes were extremely smooth and creamy, and the short ribs at the bottom were tender enough to eat with a spoon. When I got to the bottom of my dish, I snuck a couple shakes of salt onto it. Yeah, even better.

My girlfriend took over half of her entree home, and I finished mine but sit here with quite a lump in my stomach - I could have easily stopped half way through without much regret, so the portion sizes here are large enough to split a starter and an entree between two if you aren't super hungry. I thought the service was outstanding and the food was good - including the price of our groupon coming to around $40 was a steal. 

I was hesitant to come after reading the recent reviews An'A has been getting, but I have to say I would love to come back. Maybe they're stepping their game back up?"}
{"text":"After seeing the numerous reviews for A N' A I HAD to give it a try! It was a pleasant Friday August evening, and luckily the rain stayed away since Darren and I had to wait outside for nearly an hour before a table opened up. The owner (?) of the establishment did keep checking on us and gave updates on how much longer he thought we'd have to wait. There is a menu posted outside the restaurant doors and we had plenty of time to mull it over. 

Once seated we were happy to already have our mind made up as to what we wanted to eat and wasted no time giving the server our order. We started with the Steak Tartare: \"fresh, chopped rare seared fillet, pickled shallot, mustard creme fraiche, garlic brioche toast\". This is a first for me so I do not have anything to compare it to, but did enjoy it greatly. Just not sure it was worth $14.00. 

I then proceeded to order the Crab Pierogies. Lump crab meat, bacon, fresh corn, old bay grilled onions, sour cream. These were rather good as well! I didn't want to run out of the delicious crab stuffed dough pockets but alas I did! 

I also ordered a Moscow Mule, as I saw it mentioned in other reviews and was very curious. Ginger beer never tasted so good! Served in a copper mug! What with the price of copper I teased that I was going to take the mug home. Darren, who isn't much for booze, even enjoyed this drink! Reminding me a bit of ginger ale (YUM!). 

There was no air conditioning and we both were sweating in the tight crowded dinning room before we even got our entree. The trendy crowd was loud and in no rush to leave A n' A. I passed the time singing along with the 80's pop tunes blaring from the speakers. \"Set me free why don't you babe. Get outta my life why don't you babe...\" Gotta love Kim Wilde. Good times! Be warned though, it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"The spinach and artichoke, was very VERY good.  Probably my second favorite ever, behind Culpepper's in my college town of Indiana, PA.  I was skeptical about the flimsy pitas that came with, but I think had they been thicker or fried, it would have been such a heavy dish.  The small unassuming pitas kept it light, and kept the focus on the dip.  

I got the fish and chips, which was also very good.  I asked for tartar sauce, and alas, they did not have any.  But they had one better - their remoulade - which went very well with the fish. 

And they had Arsenal cider on draft.  Perfect! 

We had a chance to chat with the manager, who is super nice.  Great restaurant, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when coming to A n' A for a drink.  I was actually impressed, it was smaller inside than I anticipated, but felt like an intimate place to grab a drink or bite to eat.  I liked the decor - it just made me feel comfy.  

I had the Circus Boy Magic Hat bottle.  It was really good - I like hops and wheat beer and this was a great combo of both.  

The waitress was very friendly and it wasn't overly crowded for a Friday night.  While we didn't order food here, the waitress mentioned that their Shepherd's pie is a big hit.  

I would come here again and this time try out the food."}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner last night with my girlfriend and parents.
After being seated in the dining room I noticed how dark it was
whenever everyone in my party had a slightly hard time reading the
menu.  Our server came over to us shortly afterward to offer us
drinks.  He twice had to go back to the bar to see what was on draft
and never mentioned anything in bottles even though they seemed to
have a fair amount.  A beer list would have come in handy and I hope
that they make some up in the future.  I ended up ordering a draft
Slyfox IPA while everyone else stuck with water whenever we were told
that they were out of iced tea.

Before we ordered our food the server mentioned that they were out of
a few other things: salmon, scallops, the chicken thighs and mixed
greens although they could substitute romaine for the mixed greens.
Our table was disappointed as this eliminated 3 of the 10 entrees that
they had.  Even so we decided to order the hummus as an appetizer.  It
came out with fried pita circling a large bowl of hummus.  While I
really enjoyed the fried pitas, some other members of my party did not
as they thought it was overly fried and thus, too crunchy.  The hummus
itself was underwhelming and seemed to have come right out of a
container.  For my entree I decided on the macaroni and cheese with
bacon.  It came out with a nice crust on the top and a fair amount of
bacon.  The taste was good and cheesy but it was also pretty runny for
mac n cheese as I had a hard time eating it with a fork.  I did enjoy
it and it filled me up even though I was worried about that whenever I
had originally ordered it.  Both my girlfriend and my mom ordered
different wraps but agreed that they were dry.  I also find it comical
that they asked my girlfriend how she would like her steak cooked for
the wrap.  The reason for that is that it ended up being what we think
was Steak Ums.  The fries that came with her wrap were good and seemed
like they were freshly cut.  My father ordered the fish n chips and I
did not hear anything good or bad about it so it must have been ok.

The bottom line for me is that I would probably not head back here to
eat in the future.  In general the food seemed to be hit or miss with
half of the components on a dish good with the other half not so good.
 I also found it bizarre with how many items they did not have when we
visited.  With all of that being said, I still like the idea and
location of it and could see myself going for a drink."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, great experience both times. Great service and great food. Salmon was delicious, perfectly cooked and the side of cauliflower gratin was crazy good. Boyfriend loved his crab cake over dirty rice. In fact, he said it was the best meal he's had in awhile, which would be insulting if I had cooked recently. Luckily that's not the case. 

Great live music every Thursday.

Great experience, super confused by all the negative reviews."}
{"text":"On paper, I really like what Alchemy 'n' Ale is trying to do here.  But in practice, and I really hate to say it, a lot of things fell apart.

So I got a Groupon for this place when it first opened, and I was super excited about it.  Got a little nervous as I noticed more and more mediocre reviews, but we went in for dinner on Friday with an open mind.  Easy parking across the street, easy to get a table.  Our server strolled by to describe the drafts and give us the bottle list.  I got a draft of Michigan Pumpkin Spiced Ale, which I didn't like very much but that's my fault for not tasting it.  Strong spice flavors, like cinnamon and cloves, and there was a sugary rim around the glass which I didn't care for.  Oops!  I'll taste it next time.

So we drool over the menus before ordering an appetizer of Salt-Roasted Beets.  And let me say - I really need to rake them over the coals for this one.  This dish is described thusly: \"Chilled, creme fraiche, peppered greens, pickled grapefruit, chives, lemon oil.\"  In reality?  Someone roasted a beet.  Then it got cooled down and cut into random size wedges.  Someone put the wedges in some salty-watery liquid, then put them on a plate next to some arugula.  No.  No.  Nothing about this was $8.  The beets had this sort of filmyness on them from the liquid that was really unappetizing.  Nowhere did I get \"pickled grapefruit, chives, lemon oil.\"  or creme fraiche for that matter!  I mean, really.  This was ridiculous.  And I love beets!  It's hard to get me to NOT enjoy beets!  But somehow, they succeeded.

So we awaited our dinner, somewhat nervously.  So my boyfriend's \"A 'n' A\" burger arrives - that's a burger with blue cheese, caramelized onions, port glaze, and probably some other stuff.  We are told my food is coming shortly.  At LEAST five minutes go by, no sign of my food.  My boyfriend shares his fries with me until we finally decide to just start eating his burger.  When I took my bite, I took a look to see if it was properly cooked medium-rare.  What I saw on the inside was, frankly, uncooked meat.  I am sure of this.  I'm not being picky.  The texture was different - it was the texture of raw beef.  Like a patty that hadn't been thrown on the grill yet.  No.  We stopped a server to mention both that my food didn't yet exist, and that my boyfriend's food was basically not finished cooking.  

The server took it back, and a few minutes later came back to apologize, saying both she and the chef totally agreed that this burger was not currently in a state of being edible.  She said, \"can I get you a drink on the house?  Or a shot?\"  We said yes, and as she went off to get the shots I thought to myself that I'd rather have been offered, you know, a free burger.  Or something.  We still had beers to drink and hadn't really planned on taking shots.  In retrospect, I think it'd be better service to take something we had already purchased OFF the bill instead of giving us a free something we weren't going to get anyway.  But we didn't really feel in a position to negotiate when she suggested shots, so we accepted.  My boyfriend got lured in by the word \"Jameson,\" turns out the shot was something like Jameson + butterscotch schnapps, tasting much more strongly of schnapps than Jameson, with an orange juice chaser.  Kind of weird, but okay.

So a little while later, my boyfriend's burger appears and I am told that my Shepherd's pie is still cooking and will be out soon.  What in the hell?  Seriously, 5 minutes later, my food appears.  Why is that happening?  There are only two of us!  I understand when you have large parties, the meals get staggered.  But you can't time a burger and a shepherd's pie to be done at the same time?  Seriously, it kind of sucks.  I was starting to believe my shepherd's pie didn't really exist, and then it arrived, bubbling super hot from the oven. My boyfriend's burger was properly cooked this time, so he got to eat it - and quite liked it, I think - and I got to eat my pie.  I liked my food too - it was pretty simple and traditional, but rich with meaty gravy and yummy potatoes.  If the food had been brought out this way to begin with (and those salt-roasted beets didn't exist), this could've been a 4-star review.  But alas.

We finished our food, I needed to take some of mine to go since it was humungous, and then we got our check.  Now, our server told us later that he was training so I forgive him this, but he put down that I got an $11 beer on the bill (when really it was $5), which I'm really glad we noticed and brought to his attention.  Not down with accidentally paying twice as much!  When we left, we pretty much agreed - the servers did their best to make up for our experience, but we're pretty much scared away from Alchemy 'n' Ale.  I really wanted to love it, but sadly I didn't even come close."}
{"text":"The hubby and I stopped by Saturday night for a quick bite and something has changed here.  The lovely Brit was still there waiting tables with as big a smile as ever, but she was tending bar as well.  Hmmm.  Where's Richie?  Oh, he and another bartender are gone and now working the bar at Static in The Strip.  The amazing Brit and another waitress handled the bar AND the floor all by themselves and did it well, I might add.  So there was some lag time - to be expected when the joint is so understaffed.  But why?

I had the scallops atop a delicious polenta, crowned by 2 big slices of bacon.  No veggies.  The polenta was cold, good, but cold.  Three out of the four scallops were sweet and beautifully caramelized.  The 4th was browned well, too, but was just this side of being bad - I pushed that one aside.  Why 2 whole slices of bacon?  I love bacon, but it wasn't a Devonshire...perhaps if the bacon had been crumbled and scattered over the tops of the scallops?  And why no veg?  Had I been aware of that fact, I would have been happy to order a side veggie or a salad. Even a green garnish would have helped the all beige plate!

The hubster had the fried chicken.  Meh.  Boneless chicken does not qualify as fried chicken.  It lacks the depth of flavor and dries out without the bones!  He was underwhelmed.  Again, no veg.  And no bread basket either.  ???????

The Moscow Mule, as usual, was superb.

What's going on A & A?  Staffing problems, food quality missing the mark, empty tables and spots at the bar are not looking good.  Oh...and please hand out fresh, clean, unrumpled menus....the ones handed to us looked waaayyy past their prime and set a bad tone.  Print up new ones and, if you have to, laminate them and wipe them off occasionally to keep them clean, please."}
{"text":"Alchemy N' Ale is just what \"The Other\" Lawrenceville needs. Butler St is hot, and the trend is rapidly spreading from LOLA on up. We have been 6 or 7 times since opening night, and have always had an awesome experience. The owner, Dave, is really friendly and actually lives in the neighborhood (props for community commitment). He has staffed his restaurant/bar with very personable and engaging employees, who welcome and remember you.  The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable, perfect for happy hour or an impromptu bite. 

   I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food is...as a constant dieter, I'll admit to being overly familiar with the house salad; but A N' A's salad is something to be remembered. Fresh and local, with house made tortilla strips decorating the top and a lite, summery herb dressing to finish. The bite of my boyfs burger that I tried was deliciousssss too, and their fries with the port gravy superb. 

     We did brunch once so far and will definitely do it again- the cornflake-crusted french toast was killer, the complimentary mimosa refreshing. 

    Only thing I'd say needs work is the lighting at the corner end of the bar, as it seems there isn't any. But really, NBD. Overall, this place is great.  Endearing plus, there is a water bowl for dogs out front. 

     Check it out, I'll bet you'll dig it."}
{"text":"Alchemy 'N Ale is an establishment that I'd despise if I were in my right mind. The reasons for my mixed feelings are as follows...

*The clientele leans decisively towards the yuppie/hipster crowd. I genuinely didn't think people like this existed in Pittsburgh. It was as if a movie was being lensed during our visit and everyone aside from Kay, myself, our server, and a gent we'll call The Alchemist (a fellow I assume is the owner) were background players. These people were living, breathing stereotypes and were on parade along with their seemingly expensive dates. If you are one of these people, this is the light to which you will fly, the fish bowl in which you will be gawked at.  If you're a working-class socialist like me, you might feel somewhat out of place, especially if you come here straight from a menial, grimy job like mine. 

*AnA is an agent of gentrification; let's be clear. The prices are not going to agree with everyone's wallets. Mine felt particularly sore after having had dinner here. An appetizer, two entrees, two desserts, beverages, and one mixed drink cost me nearly $80! 

*There is no air conditioning. As if it wasn't awkward enough for me to have come here straight off the clock in my cargo pants and pocket t-shirt, I was sweating like Phil Knight being held hostage by an anti-globalization group. Fortunately, we were seated at a table way in the back on really high stools. The Friends, Sex and the City, and MTV reality show cast-offs were too busy to notice us anyway. That cloak of invisibility works after all. 

*On a Friday night, your patience will be tried as you will have oodles of downtime prior to getting a table. Kay and I sat on a bench watching various characters pass by, The Alchemist occasionally coming out to see if we were still there, hunger aches and all. 

\"Man, you guys are in LOVE,\" he commented when he saw us holding hands. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ8286CdIn4

Our most affable host was the only person in the house dressed as casually as I...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpM1Yk9-BqM

This long interval (2 hours!) did give us time to glance over the menu, which was displayed outside. Once I spotted Steak Tartare and Lobster Roll on the yellowed scroll, there was nothing else to consider. 

This was my first brush with Steak Tartare, and no I didn't go Mr. Bean over it. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6QqSxmpRMM

This filet was chopped into fine chunks of rare filet, involved mustard creme fraiche and pickled shallots, and was ring-molded for our viewing pleasure. This wasn't the raw egg-adorned heap of meat paste I've seen on television. 

And enjoy it I did. In truth I was surprised at how subtle the flavors were, and that might be my only possible gripe about it. This having been my introduction to steak tartare, I'm not sure whether or not needed more seasoning. In spite of something being marginally, vaguely amiss to my palate, Kay and I ravaged the flesh-disc like hyenas. 

Then came my Lobster Roll, complete with a liberal portion of massive, peeled, thrice-cooked french fries. 

I suppose I'm in the minority about the lobster roll because I relished it for the most part, even if the tryst was fleeting. Is the heaping helping of fries, fantastic as they are, designed to compensate for the less generous lobster roll? I finished it in a trio of bites, but those bites of the cold, burly, \"butter-poached\" lobster chunks were astounding, especially when coupled with the kind of thick, sweet, spongy bread that peanut butter and banana sandwiches were made for. The mayonnaise is allegedly, \"handmade,\" which is partially what caused me to order it. If so, I think that the mayo could have used a splash of citrus to really make it shout. Nonetheless, I was pleased with it overall. 

Kay's Crab pierogi made me green with envy with but a taste. As if lump crabmeat wasn't enough, bacon, corn, sour cream, and grilled onions dusted with Old Bay crashed the party. Baba's 'rogi these aren't; a tattooed roller derby queen rocking a babushka lovingly invented them. 

Dessert for me was a wheel of divinely creamy graham cracker-crusted Key Lime Cheesecake. Dessert for her was a Triple Berry Creme Brulee (?). Each was a sugary, successful end to a meal made interesting through its minor imperfections. 

Beyond genial service was the order of the evening. The Alchemist (my nickname for him is more fun I think) went out of his way to make us feel welcome, patting each of us on the shoulder, checking on us periodically -- essentially treating us like old friends. Our waitress treated us in much the same manner, almost doting on us in a cute way. It was as if they sensed my skepticism and wanted very much to win me over, and they did. The prices might keep me from coming to A 'N A often, but I will surely cast a shadow on their doorstep again sometime, somewhen...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq7wNt8upJ4
P.S. The Moscow Mule is a plot to turn me into a lush."}
{"text":"While the staff was friendly and the service very good, the prices seemed steep for what we ate.  The lobster roll was very small in proportion to others I've eaten around the city, and overwhelmed by the massive fries!! Crab perogies were a good portion, but bland.  Beer selection was great, and ambiance was cozy...very warm inside that day...felt sorry for our waitress."}
{"text":"We went in today for Brunch.  Without a reservation, we were concerned about a wait.  But getting a table was no worry.  

We were greeted right away by Brittany.  BJ got his favorite Bloody Mary and I got a Mimosa.  My drink was one of the best I have ever had.  We also loved the pastry basket.  My fav was the cute little sweet roll covered with almonds.  So good.  The spicy jams were also a very nice touch.  

BJ had a difficult time with his choice, but ended up picking the Chicken and Biscuits.  I was anxious to try that much Yelped about Drunken Stuffed French Toast.   I have to say, I was very disappointed.  I did not like it at all.  Not good.  Didn't like the combination of flavors, didn't like the crispy crap it was dunked in.  I couldn't even eat more than two bits.   I believe that even if I was the drunken one, I still would not have liked it.  Also, my eggs tasted weird.  The sausage was the only edible thing on my plate and even it was a bit hard and not moist at all.  Strange.  BJ's meal on the other hand, was good.  He finished up every bite.  I even had a couple.  The chicken was good and so were his potatoes. 

The best part of our meal were the drinks and the service.  So, we are still on the search for the perfect brunch.  Boy, we didn't find it here!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Lawrenceville, we were looking at this place from the beginning. My girlfriend read a review of the place somewhere giving kudos to their Moscow Mule... and that is one of my favorite drinks so we had just one MORE reason to go here. What was the outcome/verdict... pretty darn good!

When we went in, it was very quiet with no one really in their... with it being 6pm on a Tuesday when the Pens have a home game against the Redwings, it is quite understandable. This was good news for us though... as we were able to engage with the GM and enjoy our time at the bar. 

She had a dark & story and both of our drinks were very good... so 2 thumbs up on them. We did not want to have anything too crazy so we ordered the mac & cheese and pumpkin pierogies. The mac & cheese was VERY good, along with the price for an appetizer... it was a very good portion size. The pierogies were on the smaller side (portion-wise) as it was for an entree, but again, they were VERY good.

I would recommend this place again for just a drink or even a meal... nice atmosphere[phere and we loved the overall look/feel."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 2.5 stars, but was generous and gave 3 since 2 seemed a little mean. 

We chose A&A  for dinner for Girls' Night Out, so the three of us had a bit of a wait for a table but were able to find a couple chairs at the bar and have a drink. How does a place with ALE in the name only have 6 beers on tap?!?! Ok..moving on. They do, however, have a fully stocked bar. The owner came over to us several times to chat and be friendly - and finally found us a table. 

This place has potential, for sure. However, I don't think they've hit their stride yet. I wouldn't describe the menu as anything relating to gastronomy - just slightly eclectic. For example, one of the gals ordered country fried chicken. It was boneless breast meat with a cornflake-type breading and served with mashed potatoes and sauteed greens. Nothing unusual here - but the chicken was pretty good. 

My other friend and I split a lobster roll. Good thing we also decided to share the cheese plate. The roll was the size of a hot dog bun and the chunks of lobster were overcooked and chewy but tasted OK. 

Again, A&A definitely has potential but could use a bit more creativity on the menu to really label themselves a gastropub."}
{"text":"Met friends there.  Bartender and wait staff were knowledgeable and provided good advice.  The decor in the dining area was nice--it's a small bar but it doesn't feel that way when you are there.  Good beer selection.

We had the pork belly which was very good.  My friends had the fried chicken and the hamburger, both of which looked excellent."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Alchemy N'Ale!

What we tried:

Alchemy Fries (sort of the steak fry variety with good flavor, not my favorite but that's because I prefer thin fries.  Definitely a stellar version of the steak fry!)

Broccoli (this was great and the home made cheese crisps tasted like upscale cheetos which may not sound great to everyone, but I loved it!)

Pork Belly Entree (definitely good if you are sharing because it can be very heavy, but delicious)

Shrimp Boil (another great entree to share, and there was definitely a lot of food here!  The sauces that accompanied were delicious especially the bloody mary cocktail sauce!)

Overall the food was solid, nothing very new or innovative but solid gastropub fair that made me want to come back and try more!

Also the Moscow Mule is TO DIE FOR! It is the perfect cocktail ice cold and not too sweet."}
{"text":"I just want to share about what an amazing brunch I had here on Sunday!  If you've got good french toast, you're most likely going to win me over.  But with the name Drunken Stuffed French Toast, I may just be in love!

The french toast is filled with lemon ricotta and bourbon spiked peach compote.  They were everything you'd want them to be and more.  Crispy on the outside, creamy dreamy deliciousness on the inside!  It comes with eggs your way and sausage or bacon.  Another mega plus....it's a Champagne brunch, YES!  You can also get a Bloody Mary....but I'm a fan of the Champage, so this was a no brainer for me!

Did I mention they also serve up some delectable pastries and fresh jam to nosh on before your food comes out.  I am ALL ABOUT the complimentary bread baskets.  

Slap down 20 bucks and you're good to go for the rest of the day because believe me, you'll be stuffed!"}
{"text":"Ginger beer.... did you say Ginger beer.  OMG!  The specialty cocktails, while are limited, are damn good.  I love the Moscow mule which contains vodka, ginger beer, and some other good stuff.  I would go back to this place purely for this.... but wait the food is actually pretty good too!  The DH and I went here with a group of friends, so we ordered quite a bit, and shared everything.  So I'm pretty sure this place has some good food, and I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews?  We ordered the Shepherd's Pie, Fish And Chips, P.E.I. Mussels, Roasted Beet Salad, Scallop's, and Crab Cakes.  Each dish was better than the next.  My favorite was definitely the scallop's and the fries on the fish & chips entree.  The only thing I disliked was the batter on the fried fish, it was not crisp!  For shame.  The place is very unassuming, you would never think that they serve such fantastic food.  Give it a try!"}
