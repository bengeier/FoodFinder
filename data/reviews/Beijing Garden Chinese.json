{"text":"My favorite dish is flog leg casserole. I love it so much. I went there many time due to missing this dishes. Some people afraid of flog legs. They think it is very terrible. I didn't like flog before I ate this, after I tried that, I cannot stop love with it.  Actually, flog leg is like chicken leg, but it is more fresh and tender than chicken. Beside of flog legs, it has some vegetables in it, like lotus root. The cooker will have deal with on flog leg, than put legs and vegetable into casserole with some spicy sauce to fried. There will be a small cooking range with the casserole to keep the dish keep warm."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch for my wife's birthday. She ordered the Singapore rice noodles and they were excellent. The orange chicken was superb, as were the crab puffs. I also highly recommend the high tea. The people who run the restaurant are extremely nice and the service was great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and courteous staff. Ordered shrimp fried rice and chicken chow mein. They were both delicious other than chicken that I thought was a little too bland for my taste. Other than that, overall great experience. Will return again in the future."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! It's next to impossible to find decent let alone good Chinese food in Phoenix. They actually have real Chinese food!  We had the wonton soup, spicy chicken chili (like a hot pot) and pork dumplings. All were delicious and amazing and I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"It's  a good Chinese traditional foods restaurant. Last time we 10 people ate there, and so many special and traditional  dishes that other restaurant doesn't have. It is very hard to find a very traditional restaurant in unite states, but this one does. Definitely I will be back again."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find Peking Duck highlighted on the front of this restaurant as I walked by.   A few days later I called ahead to ensure they had time to prepare properly.  With great anticipation I arrived to discover very poor approximation of the real thing.    The skin was not separated from a large layer of fat (yuk!), meat was overcooked, pancakes were thick and incorrect.    Maybe some of the other dishes are good (I didn't try any), but the Peking Duck ... bu hao chi!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I am shocked by some of these reviews. This is simply the best Chinese food that I have ever had in town. The lunch specials are outstanding and more food than most can eat for under $6.00. I have tried evey one of the lunch specials and enjoyed all. I have brought several people to the resteraunt and they have all loved the place. The staff is great and Paul is a great guy that knows the menu very well. Also, this is the BEST hot and sour soup without a doubt....highly recommend. I had stopped going to the previous resteraunt at this location because of poor quality."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here and thought the food was good. We ordered spring rolls,  eggplant in garlic sauce and the sweet & pungent potatoes. It was a little difficult communicating because of the language barrier though."}
{"text":"The food is alright and wait time is short and that is the only good thing about this place. The wait staff is really very rude, don't refill water and literally shout at you while taking the order. Never even going back to this place."}
{"text":"If you call this is authentic chinese food. I don't know which part of China you came from. I mean black bean fish had tofu ,but no black beans. Only spicy. West Lake soup had tofu too . But no beef. And they only nice to the regular customer."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona! One thing I do, when trying new ethnic foods, is look around the restaurant to see if native peoples are are ALSO Eating The Food.....if they are you've found a Winner....if not, you should RUN!   This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and is basically the \"China Town\" of Arizona. The bad reviews ( weird meat like chicken having a bad flavor and odd texture ) is inaccurate. There are 2 restaurants, one on the left and one on the right of the Ranch Market, when you enter the plaza. The one on the LEFT is Beijing Garden and always taste Great...the one on the Right is Szechwan Palace that people always seem to confuse with Beijing Garden...that restaurant has the weird tasting food! ....also, for some reason... When you go to phxchinatown.com and look at restaurants Beijing Garden is not shown...?  Now that the Facts are straight, let's get to the review :) I always get the sweet & sour chicken / steak in black pepper sauce / pot stickers / crab rangoons and they are AMAZING! The staff is always friendly and when placing an order that large it never takes more than 15 minutes to be ready for pick up. Also, the serving sizes are HUGE and you'll almost always have leftovers for 2+ meals. For 5-15 bucks you won't find better food at a better price. Couple all the positives with the fact that the architecture is Cool and landscaping Beautiful you couldn't ask for a better experience. Finally, there's nothing like eating left over Chinese Food (Pizza is a tie with Chinese in my opinion Lol)  So the next time you pass the stir fry section in your local supermarket or see a commercial for Panda Express just know this.....you deserve Better! ;)"}
{"text":"I will say one thing positive for this place, Its their speed during lunch. F A S T!  The service is flat and disengaged however speedy they try to be. BTW, they are only speedy to clear the tables because they want you to LEAVE.  Their sesame chicken is awful and tasteless, if you are expecting anything crisp, be prepared to be disappointed. In my opinion they get the chicken from some bulk supplier in a big plastic bag and apply whatever sauce to suit the order. It had no character and was very mystery meaty. Maybe a good meal at a state nursing home or institution but nothing I would pay for again. I left more than half of it on my plate.The spring rolls are of poor quality and mushy. They taste like a 12 year old tried to make them in a toaster after buying a pack of frozen craptastic junk from Walmart... You would have a more authentic (and better) Chinese food experience at a Panda Express.  I've also had their Shrimp and WATER sauce and that sucked too. My friend seemed to like his chow mein which honestly didn't look that bad. The only thing they can do right is seems is their soups.  Their Hot and Sour and egg drop are both pretty good, but not good enough to go there again. No 3rd chance for this place... I would rather have a cup of ramen made in the office break room then eat there. It sucks..."}
{"text":"When I went to this restaurant I ordered spicy chicken broccoli the food had a good flavor  but the server was nice at first and then when asked to cancel an order he stated the food was already cooking and I was not able to cancel anymore and became aggressive and rude  I was never asked for a refill the whole time I also had to ask for more rice and spices to add to my food  To be honest I will never go back to this restaurant I give this restaurant 0 stars"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it is consistently one of my favorite restaurants, and THE BEST authentic Chinese food in town."}
{"text":"I gave it 0 Star. Arrived at 5pm and got seated but no menus were given. At 5:10pm asked for menus. Ordered food at 5:20pm. Got my 2 Thai Iced teas at 5:23pm, nice service is picking up! At 5:45pm asked why food hasn't arrived yet and was told that they are backed up and seeing the table behind us which ordered 10 minutes after us getting their order. Walked out at 5:55pm and still no food. Sad place for restaurant, could not even get a Shrimp Fried Rice in 35 minutes....."}
{"text":"We just ate here. We're from out of town and live in a city and have lived in cities with large Chinese populations plus my husband is Chinese. He knows good Chinese food and this place hit the spot. We had the soup dumplings, the noodles with minced pork in brown rice and the shrimp with broccoli. Everything fresh and cooked perfectly including the shrimp - not over cooked! This place and its neighboring restaurant are located in the Chinese Cultural Center which from what I understand has been bought by some new owners who are trying to turn it into an office park. How disastrous and terrible it would be because the building is beautiful with its old Chinese tile. I don't know the ins and outs of the deal, but if you live in this city and care about its cultural diversity, clamor to the appropriate authorities before it's too late and you have another bland and boring corporate structure that won't contribute to the features of your city one bit!"}
{"text":"Bad business move:  I have been going to Beijing Garden at the Chinese Cultural Center for three weeks now as I've been rehabbing my hand across the street. Every Monday I have ordered two lunch specials  for myself and my wife trying out different lunch entrées with their lunch special which they advertise both outside on their billboard and inside on the lunch menu. Their advertised lunch includes soup, and egg roll and rice. For the past two weeks I've ordered hot and sour soup for both of us as our side soup. I was told that hot and sour soup and egg drop soup are the two options available as part of the lunch. Good. I like Hot and sour soup...not so much egg drop soup.  One thing to note:  when I ordered my lunch for the first time, an older maître d' lady told me that they no longer offer soup as part of the lunch even though it's advertised but said I can have the soup like she was doing me some grand favor. I didn't make a big deal out of it at the time but I could have pointed out that since she advertised the soup is part of the lunch she therefore by law has to offer soup or take down her advertisements and replace them with something that fairly advertises what she purports to serve. Okay, this might be me being a little asinine but hey I got the hot and sour soup as part of our first-order. I let it slide.   The next week I came in I again ordered two lunch specials with two hot and sour soups. I asked the gentleman who took my order at the front register if soup usually comes with the lunch and he said yes and he reiterated that my options are hot and sour soup and egg drop soup. One thing to note is that when I did get to my two hot and sour soups, both containers were only half filled. Annoying, but again I let it slide without a fuss.  Today I went back prior to physical therapy ready to try out another two lunch entrées, getting to know the restaurants better and fast becoming a Monday regular. Once again I encounter the older maître d' lady. After ordering my two lunch entrées I requested hot and sour soup as my soup of choice for lunch and she immediately tells me no. \"We do not offer that anymore\" she says. \"You don't have hot and sour soup\", I ask.  \"No, you cannot have hot and sour soup\" she replies. I'm like \"what you talking about? You just change your policy this Monday?\" Her reply was no. We don't offer that anymore.   So I'm a little taken back and I  tell her \"look, I got hot and sour soup last week and hot and sour soup the week before last week so why are you tell me I can't get it today?\" What she said next didn't make a heck of a lot of sense but she told me she only offered it before because the restaurant was busy. I look around the restaurant and it's practically empty. I ask her \"are you telling me that you don't have hot and sour soup ready to go because you're not busy right now?\" She replies \"no. You can order hot and sour soup on the side.\"   \"So you do have hot and sour soup\". She says yes. So I ask \"why can't I have the hot and sour soup as the soup with lunch?\" She replies \"no hot and sour, egg drop\". So I tell her \"I don't like egg drop soup\". She says \"that's what you get\". So I tell her \"this is ridiculous. You rather lose me as a regular customer for no reason at all other then 'I don't want to give it to you' even though you served to me the last two weeks?\"  She asks \"you don't want egg drop?\" I tell her \"no. I don't like egg drop soup. I don't want egg drop soup. I want the hot and sour soup\" which is been part of your menu for the past two weeks as part of the lunch special.   She tells me again I can't have it. So I tell her \"well I don't want your lunch. Just give me what my wife ordered, I don't want the other order\". She asks me \"you don't want the other order?\" I tell her \"no. I am never ordering anything for you guys again\". You had me as a regular customer and now you have lost me because for no reason whatsoever you got to make a big stink about the hot and sour soup.   This is bad for business. This is so utterly stupid. What's so special about your hot and sour soup that you have to make such a stink about it that you're going to disenfranchise a new loyal customer and send him out your restaurant so pissed off that he would sit here now and write out this diatribe? Wow! It's like something straight out of Seinfeld. No soup for you!   In any case, for customer service zero stars. To be fair to review, the Mongolian beef is good, the  black pepper shrimp is good but the garlic chicken, the beef broccoli and the orange chicken are quite pedestrian and no better than PF Chang's. Actually PF Chang's beef broccoli is probably better. But the hot and sour soup? Pretty good if they would actually serve it to me. Not a big fan of the egg drop soup."}
{"text":"Food is authentic and a variety of choices. I like their Beijing roasted duck, red soy pork rib, woked lotus root and steamed flounder?(long-lee) fish to name a few. We had a great gathering for the Chinese New Year 2018 celebration. The owner premade special chive pork dumpings that are very unique.They are a small family owned business so not many staffs to hang around that you can grab every sec. to refill your water. The dish is a little salty but flavorful and less spicy than the other Chinese restaurant nearby. They're both at the Chinese culture center, 10 mins drive from the PHX airport."}
{"text":"Had a lunch special today as a takeout.  I couldn't believe the prices of the lunch specials starting at 5.95 for:  choice of dish, choice of rice, egg roll and soup.  There were also specials in the 6.95 and 7.95 pricing depending on what you wanted to eat.  For the 5.95 that I selected, I had  shredded pork with dried tofu. The died tofu intrigued me as I had never had it before.  I asked that it be made spicy.  My choice of rice was brown rice which is usually up charged in chinese restaurants.  Not here.  I also got the egg drop soup and an egg roll with the order.  Despite great value on this meal and the generosity of the portion, I would not have called the dish tasty.  Usually pork dishes taste really good.  There was some spiciness as requested but it was made spicy by using hot szechuan oil which made the dish quite a bit greasy.  The egg roll and egg drop soup were fine, but nothing to write home about.  I hope that restaurants in the Chinese Cultural Center up their game.  They should be serving some of the best Chinese food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our dinner was absolutely fantastic! I have never had such a well seasoned and flavorful  meal. The service was quick and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Night out with the family......first the zoo lights then Authentic Chinese food. Fresh veggies, shrimp, fish and my fav eggplant. We licked the platter clean. We will return."}
{"text":"Went there with my co-workers this past weekend after a long day working at the Chinese New Year's Festival.  We didn't get there until 8:30pm and the restaurant closes at 9:30pm.  We know the owner there and we want to try it out and see how the food taste.  It wasn't very busy because it's already late at night and they close in an hour, we sat in the middle of the restaurant and Paul (one of the manager) helped us out with ordering.  All of the food items from the menu looked delicious, we ordered a noodle, bean curd, and a chicken dish.  Personally I won't go back again because the prices are so high and the food portion isn't all that enough for the price we paid.  Four of us went and we paid $30 before tips."}
{"text":"Well I read some of the other reviews and we must have hit it on a great day because the food was hot, prepared to order (Hunan Shrimp was extra spicy and loaded with big ol' shrimp), and everything tasted great.  The servers were attentive and didn't have to be asked to fill drinks, bring a few extra napkins, etc.  Lots of dishes under 10 bucks and a similar amount in the 13-16 dollar range.  Portions are big enough to share.    The menu is quite extensive - I'm not into frogs, but you can get them.  The dining room was tidy and well arranged.  They were busy but we didn't feel cramped for space.  Overall nice place and tasty food.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this jewel by accident much to my delight.  I had poke bowls for dinner that was out of this world!  Very friendly staff, clean and comfortable.  Next time I'm in town I will stop by again."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would not eat food from here if it were offered for free.  I tried the sesame chicken and General Tso\"s chicken. They were both mushy and the flavor was bland. I ordered additional spring rolls for someone else in the office but did not receive them. I did not discover this until I was already back at my office and was not about to turn around to go get them. I called and asked if my account could be credited and was told no, not without the card, and that I could come in and get them any time. The spring rolls were small, greasy, and gross, so why would I want to? Also, I asked why soup was not given to me (as it was part of lunch special) and was told I would have had to tell the guy who took my order what kind of soup I wanted. Umm...he didn't ask. Terrible service and terrible food."}
{"text":"Food was good- ok. I had the lunch special- almond chicken. They give you a good amount of food for the price. I would eat here again if in the Chinese Cultural Center- but would not make a special trip."}
{"text":"I came here after my graduation ceremony to celebrate with my family.  The service was horrible, for lack of a better word. We didn't leave a tip due to the service. The owner came and asked me why there was no tip and I thought it would be for constructive criticism but he started arguing with me instead. In addition, he made a racist comment. Very unprofessional. He was in denial that they offered terrible service and refused to listen to what I had to say to improve their service. I have never experience such treatment or service and I eat out daily. To top it off, the food was salty.   There is a Chinese restaurant next to this one, Szechwan Palace, that offers better service and food...go there instead."}
{"text":"This places rating should be much higher than they are simply because the food is so good!  I'm from the mid-west and let's just say that west coast Chinese food is a lot different and not what I prefer. Until I found Beijing Garden.....the best Chinese food I have had in my 4 years living in Phoenix.  The service isn't that great and the restaurant is nothing fancy but the food is everything I want. I've had around 10 dishes off their menu and everything has been great, always fresh & sizzling hot.  Not the best appetizers but still worth it."}
{"text":"As i am reading the reviews on this place....I am shocked! I don't think most of these folks have ever had really good fresh Chinese food. There is one person who waits on tables, buses tables and is the cashier. When we were seated, I should have walked out when I noticed the filthy wall. When the server asked for our order he never asked if we wanted to order a drink. Never once checked on us to see if all was ok. Had he done that I would of returned my food. He brought out my husbands order first, some nasty looking, flavorless pork dish. Five minutes later, my lousy orange beef showed up. On the menu it read egg roll, but they are spring rolls. Big difference. Even the white rice had a funky texture and no flavor.  You'd think that because this restaurant is located in the Chinese Culture Center that the food would be as good as it gets..............it isn't."}
{"text":"Located in a shopping center next to a huge supermarket, I should've known better. Might have been the worst chinese food I've ever had. The veggie fried rice was bland. I added chicken. Honestly, it was mystery meat and it was undercooked. Horrible. The spring rolls must have been frozen, freezer burned and dropped into a deep fryer. They were hard and stale by the time they got to me. I ate one of the two. I had a Sprite with a slice of lemon. Best part of my meal. The service wasn't great either. My waitress really tried to be nice. She clearly has not had much interaction with people of color. Upon entering I asked one woman if they were still honoring the lunch special as I was just moments past the lunch special hours. She must not have spoken English that day or at all. All she did was point to the other young lady who ended up being my waitress. She didn't appear to want to be there and refused to honor the lunch special by a few minutes. She wasn't warm or cordial. I was already turned off at that point. She took my order, brought my glass with ice and a dirty can of Sprite. After getting my food I refused to pay for the mystery meat and literally picked out every piece. It was not chicken! I also asked for no mushrooms. I had them in my rice. They did take the price I paid for the meat off my bill.  Honestly, if it wasn't 109 degrees out and I wasn't hungry and needed to kill time, I would have never eaten here. It's my own fault. I should've Yelped it before I decided to eat here. So disappointing. I wanted to like it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Chinese lunch specials, and I make it a point to dine here during my periodic trips to herbal shop next door at the Chinese Cultural Center. The restaurant is clean and pretty cozy, the food is inexpensive and service is fast and efficient. You know you're getting authentic stuff when even simple lunch specials include ingredients like wood-ear mushrooms, succulent fish or shrimp, and perfectly cooked vegetables - none of the overcooked stuff that you often find in Americanized Chinese places."}
{"text":"I am in Phoenix for work and was craving Chinese food since I would be spending Friday night in my hotel room.  I ordered the beef chow fun and Chinese broccoli to go at 5:00 p.m.  The food arrived in less than 10 minutes.   Customer service: friendly, quick and hassle free.  They accept all credit cards, including American Express - bonus! Food: big portion size, chow fun was delicious/tons of beef and Chinese broccoli was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I will definitely return and recommend.  For the price, customer service and quality of food, this is a definite keeper."}
{"text":"The staff seems to be very friendly and engaging, menu looks great.... waiting on food now.. will update once I receive and eat..."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese restaurant in the east Phoenix metro area. Enjoyed all three dishes we had - not exactly sure of the names because my guests (who, unlike me, had been there before) ordered in Chinese, but I think we had Triple Delight, General Tso's Chicken, and one other dish. Very reasonably priced, and good service. I prefer Beijing Garden over Szechwan Palace (in the same complex), though I have had many good meals at SP in the past."}
{"text":"I've frequent this establishment a couple of times for takeout. Each time I got the hot and sour soup. I decided to dine in tonight because I wasn't feeling well. The restaurant was half full, yet quiet. My hearty shrimp in lobster sauce was delicious and filling. I didn't realize just how hungry I was until I saw the bottom of the dish!   The staff was very pleasant, but they speak Chinese. I found it difficult to understand them at times. They sent their best English-speaking guy to my table and I was able to order a dish that wasn't on the menu (yay!)."}
{"text":"My parent's wanted to try this place out, I was a little wary because of the reviews but I thought it was pretty good. We ordered the following: Garlic Chicken: very flavorful, with sliced garlic Pork & Bean Curd - Also very good, slices of pressed tofu with a brown sauce, skimpy on the pork though Scallion Pancakes - very tasty, light and fluffy Pork & Cabbage Dumplings - flavorful fresh dumplings  I really liked that they had a dim-sum menu so we could try a few more things, there were also a lot of items that I haven't heard of and would like to try. The service was good too. Dinner for 3 of us was $30, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the Chinese Cultural Center, I ate at the Beijing Garden. I thought the Mongolian beef had way too many onions and I was trying to find the beef. Thinking... Where's the Beef!?! I would recommend going to Szechwan Palace at the other end of the strip mall. It's usually crowded during lunch which is a good sign. I thought the hot and sour soup at Beijing was extremely salty. I thought this place was nothing special and won't go back."}
{"text":"Go here.   What you don't believe me?   What reasons do you need? I'm telling you, you want to go here.    Can't just take the advice you seek, gotta be convinced, gotta make sure you're being sold?   Fine, then I'll Give reasons & Point fingers -- or Point Reasons & Give Fingers, which ever you prefer.   So much better then their local competitor. I won't name them here, but if you don't believe me, find out for yourself and then come back and apologize -- We find your lack of faith disturbing.  Anyway, picture this: its midday, the lunchtime crowd is flocking in patterns through the courtyard, Arizona sun is yawning just enough where people actually wanna get out of their house and stroll. When's the last time anybody 'Strolled' in AZ?   Ha you're too right, strolling doesn't happen. It's more just butt clinched power-walking from shade spot to shade spot through the parking lot.   Aaaand back to the story: I love these guys cos im fat. Like imma fat kid. Always was. I was always the smallest in our group but one day, driving in from spending the day shooting in the desert, I was Knighted an honorary \"Fat Kid\" after I shoved an entire Big Mac in my face without dying.   ( Grossed and impressed, i know, us too. )   It would please the court to inform thy peers this act was performed whilst dodging Arizona traffic -- you know The Californication types...  Yeah. I rest my case.   Listen, we roll in unannounced, 10 deep, at lunchtime. It's pretty busy.   Oh and did I mention it's a holiday? Like it's busy. Biiiizzy...  We eat large, gorge, and share laughs & company, drinks and 2 hours tick off the clock.   In the end, there are nothing but smiles,  to-go boxes neatly wrapped.    But then I notice, it's not just our table, the entire room is like that.   If you don't know why that's impressive, drop a cinder block on your head until you achieve Percussive Maintenance Reset or \"TILT\".   Was it good, yeah it was good, or you would have read this far.    But that's not why I tipped big. I tipped because of the sheer Bad-Ass-Ery I witnessed from kitchen, to food, to staff.   Lemme just say: In-fucking-pressed.   Go here.     - ( this is the end of review. For further review, Flip the cassette over or simply scroll down. ) -    Sooo We weren't the only family celebrating today. This place is wall to window of multiple families and large groups.   Every table is full.   But what I'm looking at is the drinks, they're full too...Hot teas, sodas, waters--they're ALL full.   Each table is clustered in plates & condiments. Noodles for noodling, dim sum for fun, soups and stews, a whole damn duck! Like day'm!   ( All right I'm exaggerating on the duck. I just wish I had enough money & stomach to order it )  But understand this, at any restaurant, under the best circumstances, it's hard to find so many smiling faces throughout the room.   Food is being pushed out the window at a rate that would've had average servers spun.   (This is just my imagination, I'm picturing one man in the kitchen standing over 10 wok's. & he's ancient Old, The way you think of antediluvian as old, deep time or Orogenisis--He's all Father Time beard & mustache, pale white and reaches just above his stomach.)   Ooh yeah, And they were taking call-ins and pick-ups! Can you Adam & Eve it?   Lemme tell you about my family: 1 generous heap of Hawaiian, with heavy a few dollops of Mexican, served with two slices of White Bread ( who you callin' Cracka, Honky?! ), season with Colombian & a pinch of Italian to taste.   If any demographic could complain about this meal it would be one of us.   But that's the point, isn't it?   There was no complaints not even from the children - which I've taken the liberty of including myself in.   So go. What are you waiting for? Go and tell me I'm wrong.   Ooor...   You can thank me later.   ( your welcome )"}
{"text":"Yum! Beijing Garden Chinese is a surprising oasis of authentic Northern Chinese food, served at great (great, great) prices. Ask the waiters and waitresses for order suggestions, and wave off generic Americanized dishes- this restaurant has so much to offer.  In a single 3-day vacation, my family ate here on multiple nights, ordering delicious dishes like the: ???? (thin-sliced spicy garlic pork belly), the ???? (soup dumplings), the ????? (tender, chewy rice cakes with slivered pork and pickled veggies), the stir-fried bean curd with pork, the ???? (deep-fried salt & pepper jalapeno pork chops), the ???? (chive, shrimp, pork and vermicelli turnovers) the ???(cumin-spiced roasted lamb skewers), the ????? (dry-fried string beans)... and the list goes on. We don't believe in moderation. :)   Items we ordered that I would not so heartily suggest (but were honestly fine; it's just that you only have a finite amount of stomach space) were: The ????? (red-cooked beef noodle soup), the ????? (pickled cabbage, vermicelli and lamb soup- I'm thinking soups are not their forte) the green onion pancakes, the ???? (crispy fried seafood noodles), the ????(stir-fried lamb and scallions), and the ? A-? (stir-fried garlic Arden lettuce).   For a family of 5 adults and 2 children to scarf down all the food they could (and we can really put it away), and then take home another dinner's worth of leftovers, our bill came in at under $100, 20% tip included.   If I find myself in Phoenix again, I'm making a beeline to Beijing Garden for the ???? and ?????. (Drooling.)"}
{"text":"Food is awesome, of course mostly spicy food but good authentic chinese better than some restaurant in philly ctown  It it worst to try"}
{"text":"Authentic traditional non-Americanized Chinese: some dim sum & servers fave hot & spicy beef. Very gracious staff."}
{"text":"This place is actually really nice and cute but what brought my \"should have been\" 4 stars to 3 was the food. First off, the service is great! They are very respectful and mindful of there customers! They were always there to ensure our food was good and drinks filled. Secondly, the decor was great! Very authentic looking and clean. The bathrooms were really nice as well and the whole place smelt like flowers. However, they fell short on the food. The only problem I had was the food was....plane. The vegetables didn't seem they were cooked all the way, meats had no species, and sauces were ok. Sorry to say this because they had great customer service but if they can fixed the food too where it has very complex taste that leaves you satisfied, then it probably get a 4-5 stars. I am a public auditor who gets to dine out often so I have to say this isn't \"Auditor Approved\". Please update if the food does get better!"}
{"text":"This is probably the most authentic Chinese restaurant I have ever been to.  Lots of dishes that I don't have the courage to try with frogs and other things I don't eat.  However, I was able to find things I could eat, and boy were they great!  The onion pancake is a taste I haven't had in 20 years since I was in LA.  The pot stickers were wonderful as was a sizzling rice dish with pork.  Their dim sum is not the traditional type; no siu mai, no har gow, no charshu buns.  Wasn't thrilled with the heads on the shrimps, but again, that's my timid stomach.  Very few recognizable dishes, but I will definitely return to try new things.  Nice, clean place with no funky, challenging odors to deal with."}
{"text":"Just got off the plane and wanted to get some beer and snacks at Ranch 99 market so we decided to get a quick bite to eat next door at Beijing Garden. It was 2:30 and all the other restaurants were closed. I had been there before when it as another Chinese restaurant. The decor was the same. The menu was colorful and extensive. We were the only ones in the place from beginning to end of the meal. We ordered two dishes the rice noodle soup and the house special crispy fried noodles. The Crispy Noodles had chicken, pork and shrimp and was OK 3 stars. The other rice noodle soup was terrible. A little ground pork in a bland greasy pork broth and some thin rice noodles. no stars. see pics. It comes spicy and they way it's spiced is the waiter gives you some siracha to add. The people who work there didn't know their own dishes. Sorry but, I don't think I will be coming back. Also, they turned  a nicely decorated restaurant and added some stainless steel hot food tables in the back. It makes the place look like a cheap street food stand in the back of a Hutong open air market in Beijing."}
{"text":"I had an appointment in the area and decided to go here for a late lunch.  It was just after 2 pm.  I looked at the extensive menus outside and was disappointed I didn't see moo shu pork anywhere on the menu.  I decided to get the lunch special General Tso's chicken.  It came with soup, rice, and an egg roll.  They brought out egg drop soup automatically.  It tasted exactly like packaged chicken broth with a little egg in it.  Then the chicken came out and I'm guessing they fried the chicken at 10 am and had been under a heat lamp since then.  It was dried out, tasteless, and tasted burnt in places.  They put it in what seemed to be sweet and sour sauce straight from a bottle with no extra spices or seasoning and threw some overcooked snow peas in there.  It came with a scoop of plain white rice.  I tried  the egg roll and the wrapper was fried crispy, but that was the best part of it.  I couldn't identify any ingredients in the egg roll.  I couldn't tell you if it had meat of cabbage or anything in it.  It was just a glob of something.  The frozen egg rolls that I get from Sam's and stick in the oven turn out better."}
{"text":"When in Rome... Okay, this isn't Rome. And this isn't an Italian restaurant review. This is the Beijing Garden restaurant at the Chinese Cultural Center. And this is one of the regular lunch stops which me and my \"culinary co-horts\" like to frequent.  Beijing Garden is a tastefully decorated Chinese restaurant located toward the rear of the cultural center. Apparently, there is another Chinese restaurant in the vicinity. To make sure you are at the correct restaurant, just open your eyes and read the sign over the door.  I've eaten Chinese food at lots of restaurants, including China Town in San Francisco. So I know there are better options out there. But we are here in Phoenix, and there are only three Chinese restaurants I like to dine at locally. I will eventually get around to reviewing the others. And no, they are not buffets.  Today, I was joined for lunch by Mr. W. He is the one who introduced me to Beijing Garden. He let me sample his Egg Plant in Garlic Sauce. It was really good! It's not something I would've considered ordering, but I will now. I went a little more mainstream with my Sesame Chicken. The entree was delicious as was my Hot and Sour Soup. You really can't beat the prices or portions of their lunch specials! My only disappointment was having to substitute for regular rice because they were out of fried rice. That's never happened before.  Glancing at the reviews, it appears that people are unhappy about the service. I've dined here at least a dozen times so trust me when I say, I've never had bad service. And I've never been kept longer than my lunch hour would allow. It appears they are short handed, but they manage. As soon as you are seated, the house salad (which I really like) is brought out and drinks follow quickly. The food always tastes fresh and is served hot. Beijing Garden has always satisfied my appetite and tastebuds, so I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"the service is good the beef roll is amazing we also had rice cake which was ok and the beef with broccoli was ok too"}
{"text":"It was only 4:30pm but had a case of the hungries so went to Beijing Garden for an early dinner. They were empty but love being the only people in the restaurant. Usually get great service and today was no exception.  Started with jasmine tea, don't get the black tea when jasmine is available, it is so much  better.  Wife ordered and we got thinly sliced pork with bamboo and fried tofu. There is also sliced leaks and celery. It is one of my favorites. Pretty healthy and tastes awesome. I could eat most of it myself.   Also had the sliced pork and rice cakes (mochi for you Japanese aficionados). This is sautéed with salted mustard cabbage which is just amazing. One of my favorite vegetables. Got to find out how they make it. Rice cakes are tender and flavorful.  Those two dishes are not your run of the mill. They have orange chicken and Kung pao too but you can get that at Panda Express.   The one thing that I want to try is the Peking Duck but you need to call ahead. Perhaps next time."}
{"text":"Great food! FYI... state the dish name and do not use the number affiliated with each entree. The waitress did mess up one of the meals as we ordered based on the number, other then that I had a great time and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Here for 2 nights and was recommended to visit this place. Ordered one dish veggie and shrimp dish. It was really good. Got some egg rolls and they were just ok."}
{"text":"Service is awful, even for Chinese people (I'm Chinese, so I am socially qualified to make that statement.) Food is good occasionally, but I question their hygienic standards.  For example, I know that Peking duck is not supposed to taste rancid. It tasted rancid twice in my frequent visits, and I eat there mostly because my in-laws like the place.   \"The duck tastes off.\" I said.  \"No it doesn't.\" said the waitress without missing a beat.  Once, while dining with my toddler son, my wife asked if they had anything for him to drink along with his water. We asked for milk or orange juice, both of which they had none. \"What do you give kids, then?\" asked my wife. \"Just give him soda.\" said the waitress. My father-in-law decided to have the Special of the Day.   \"We don't have the Special of the Day.\" said the waitress, her deadpan face never betraying the dripping irony of the statement. The manager came out soon thereafter.   \"Sorry, we don't have the special of the day today, sir. Can I get you the wonderful fresh cod that we're known for? It's steamed with traditional spices for half an hour and served on a bed of greens-- a delight to the taste, especially with a splash of light Pinot Noir.\"  ... is what he never said. Instead, the cap-and-jeans dude looked irritated and said, \"Get number 44. We don't have special. Get 44.\"  \"What's 44?\"   \"It's good.\" And he walked away."}
{"text":"In spite of the mixed reviews, I decided to give them a try.  Oh!  What a mistake!  I went there in attempt to get some lunch, but with no success!  I cannot comment on the food since no one took my order even though I've alerted 2 different staff members that I was ready to order.  When I walked in, the lady just gave me a menu and told me to seat myself.  Then, there was no table settings or anyone asking if I wanted tea or water....a few minutes later, someone just dropped off a tumbler of iced water and walked away...then another few minutes later, another lady brought silverware and napkin...then no one came to the table to take my order.  The waitress with glasses and long hair was just too busy making sure that people paid their bills while the male waiter was too slow...all I can say is, based on the level of service...it's a 1 star at best."}
{"text":"Yummy Crab Rangoon, Orange Chicken, Beef and Broccoli and Veggie Chow Mein!   I'll probably get Dim Sum next time"}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp and had to try it out. The service was great and good came out fast. For having one person waiting, bussing, checking out, and serving, it was better than most places with multiple people working. I would highly suggest the orange chicken and the steamed dumplings. 100% will come here again!"}
{"text":"This is pretty authentic stuff.  You get the feeling you're eating in Chinatown.  Staff is friendly, but you can tell there is a bit of a language barrier.  The prices are very reasonable.  And the food choices vary from \"traditional\" Americanized Chinese food to dishes like Pig Kidney and Chicken Cartilage. I thought the food was very good.  I ordered the spicy pork with chilies.  A cook came out from the back, with better English skills, to make sure I understood it was spicy and that I could handle it.  Yes, it was spicy, but I've had spicier. Most importantly, it had good flavor. It may not have been the prime cuts off pork, but that's traditional.   The portion size was quite generous.  I don't live in Phoenix, so I may not go back, but I definitely would if in the mood for a more traditional meal."}
{"text":"First off, those of you that expect a suburban mall type of Chinese place will be disappointed.  Secondly, those of you who have never really eaten Chinese food will also be disappointed.  How can I say this?  I spent many years eating wonderfully Chinese foods in and around Chinatown San Francisco and have been to proper formal Chinese dinners.  I'm looking at reviews to my right as a write that illustrate this point exactly, \"...meats on the menu I didn't know you could eat...\"   What I can say to these people with mall expectations; stick with Panda Express, it's just for you.  There are two kinds of Chinese restaurants, the kind in the strip malls that cater to suburbia, and then there's the kind that cater to Chinese. This is the later with a menu that is amazing!  First off we went later than lunch and earlier than dinner. This afforded us a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. I mentioned the menu? It was extensive, but they had my husband's favorite, Beef Chow Fun! I ordered the Orange Pepper Beef (not to be confused with that Orange Chicken they serve at the mall). Both came with superbly sticky rice too.  A final Dim Sum we enjoyed was a Beef roll which we had for a snack later that evening.  The Orange Pepper Beef I had enjoyed a light sauce that didn't overpower the beef and just the right amount of pepper so as to infuse the dish, but again not overpower it.  The Chow Fun was, my husband declared, one of the best since he'd left San Francisco and moved to Arizona! Again, the sauce complimented the meat but didn't overpower it and there were ample green scallions to make anyone happy!  Next time we go, he'll have the Brazed Beef and Wonton noodle soup that kept tempting him...  Service was present but not in our way, isn't that the way you like it? As for the overall cost? Well priced for the selection -"}
{"text":"Food here is very tasty and the wait time was minimal. We had 5 people, all ordered different dishes, and ate it family style. Each dish was delicious and couldn't be more satisfied. The chow mein and sweet and sour chicken was amazing and I would definitely recommend. The service was mediocre, they weren't good but they weren't horrible either. All in all I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We came here for a surprise birthday party.  We had about 30 people.  The place was clean.  Some of the dishes were good & some of the dishes were ok.  We have 3 different appetizers (cold noodles with beef, veggie platter, etc.); roasted duck (not bad); spicy fried pork chops (good); seafood on rice crackers (good), soup (didn't know it had noodles and goodies in the bottom of the pot), etc.    I would come back to pick things that I would like to try next time."}
{"text":"Spacious and nicely decorated, I was impressed with genuine and wide selection (not egg foo young or General Tsao's chicken type. After all, what are those?) Chinese food dishes. We ordered Peking Duck and were very happy about the quality. Service was great. ???????????????????"}
{"text":"Food is good but not great Service was fast And friendly got the orange chicken lunch combo not sure that I'll be back I guess I'm just used to Panda Express which is no way similar to their orange chicken"}
{"text":"Taste/Flavor below average  , I won't go again to Beijing Garden Chinese in PHX"}
{"text":"My son ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken along with the Shrimp Fried Rice, which he enjoyed.  My husband was not impressed with the Broccoli Beef.  While I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup and the Hot and Spicy Lamb.  The Hot and Sour Soup was mediocre I've had much better and the Hot and Spicy Lamb was extremely greasy.   The quality of the meals is not what will keep up us from coming back.  It was the fact that as we were waiting for our check my son noticed a cockroach next to my husband's shoe on the floor. Which brought our attention to the reminder of the dining room floor and we saw another one.  Totally gross!!"}
{"text":"We have been dining here for about one year a few times each month. Never once have I been dissatisfied with a dish. Knowing how much we dine here and considering probability, there should have been something I did not like. That is not the case. I love the staff as much as the food and would recommend this hidden gem to ANYONE who likes Szechuan style dining."}
{"text":"They offer a great lunch special and their hot and sour soup is very tasty.  Bad part is that they NEVER have enough hot and sour soup to offer.  Clearly, if you're running out of the soup that most folks are asking for, make more soup!  It's like a bad episode from Seinfeld, they're basically telling me, NO SOUP FOR YOU!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant for the Beijing style.  It's a bit on the expensive side (Why in the world are the beef wraps 8 bucks?)  It has all the staples you come to expect from Northern Chinese food, and the items I ordered leaned toward the delicious side.  I ordered a beef stew noodles, tofu and pork strands, and of course the beef wraps.  Although the noodles aren't hand made, and everything else is pretty basic, I honestly can't find much to complain about.  Beijing Garden is good, and I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I'll just say I'm not a fan.  I was waiting for my tea from the apothecary and dashed in for a late lunch.  I was shown to a table quickly as the place was pretty much empty.    I ordered the seafood sizzling rice soup and to my dismay it included imitation crab which I abhor.  I also order hour tea. But when I requested lemon or lime I was told they didn't have any.. who serves seafood outer tea and don't have lemon available?  Who died that?   The servers pretty much left you alone so if you need something you have to go find them. Then there was a language barrier as well.  The menu could be frightening with the very authentic meats.  It is not for the American Chinese food lovers.  That being said I most likely will not return."}
{"text":"This place has a very extensive menu - and a lot of pictures for those who may be concerned about knowing what they are getting.  So many options that you don't usually find - frog; sea cucumber - along with more traditional fare.  This is a family-friendly, no fuss restaurant, and we've always had great service.  It's also a great place to go if you have limited time because food usually come out quickly.   I always have challenges with places that serve a lot of seafood options - sadly, I'm deathly allergic to shellfish.  They have always taken very good care of me and I've never had any issues. They have been good about special orders (removing shrimp or substituting chicken).   My favorite dishes?  The lamb skewers (with the most amazing spicy dry seasoning);  the hot and sour soup; the orange chicken; the sizzling black pepper steak; garlic eggplant; and the fun chow.  On this last trip we tried their spicy fried chicken - it was flavorful, but it was the first time we had something a little on the salty side.   It's our go-to place when we are in the mood for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Back for a meal...again the Singapore -style rice noodles while my friend enjoyed eggplant in garlic sauce with white rice. Both meals were hot. Since they still have no liquor license I went with Boba milk tea...an interesting change in drink."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick lunch before meeting customers nearby. After we sit down, no menu is brought to us. It's difficult to call the server and once I called, he just let us wait again and again. Food is cheap but quality is below average. Won't go there again anymore because I can't imagine the service can be this bad."}
{"text":"A little conflicted here. The food was a solid four stars. The portions were ample and the taste was spot on. The \"service\" on the other hand is non-existent. My server was unfriendly and hurried. Not the normal all business type that you usually get in Asian restaurants, but just plain horrible at his job. Came up to the table and just stood there looking out the window...not a word to me, just stood there. You can get the same good food elsewhere with better service and cheaper prices. Don't bother here."}
{"text":"I have not had the chance to try anything other then their soup. However,  the soup hear is addicting.  At least their spicy beef nuddle soup is. I always get my soup to go and find they give you a lot of it. Sadly, the portions you get, really are over priced at it nearly $9.00 tub-to-go. That's one reason for the rating I have chosen to give it.   Now the people are friendly here, the place is clean and food does not take that long. At least thw soup does not. Your on you own guessing how long it will take to get othet foods.  So far I lije this place and will return."}
{"text":"Outstanding, authentic, Chinese food.  Fresh ingredients. Delicious Peking Duck.  Go here. We found it by accident. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a co-worker.  The initial seating and ordering of our meals was fast but the customer service overall was severely lacking.  Not even a \"Hi, how are you?\"... just \"What do you want to order?\"  I can appreciate speedy service as most of the patrons are there for their lunch break but I felt a little unwelcomed.  Checking out was my biggest issue.  No one came by to pick up my bill and I ended up going up front to pay as it was taking way too long.  Food was OK and super affordable.  If you want a cheap, filling meal and don't care for customer service then this isn't a bad place.  I don't mind mediocre food but poor service is something I really dislike.  I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"1.  Poor service as there were only two people for the entire lunch crowd (one busboy and one cashier/server).  2.  Tables were sticky, floor was dirty. 3.  No offer of drink choice, just plopped down water.  No offer of complete menu, just the very Americanized lunch specials. 4.  Hot and sour soup was neither spicy nor sour, nor was there an offer of a different option for soup. 4a. Not an egg roll, but a spring roll. 5.  Kung Pao chicken had an odd aftertaste that I didn't like the taste of - and it was only the chicken that had that taste.  I ate the vegetables after trying a couple of bites of chicken. 6.  The busboy spraying bleach-smelling stuff right next to us while we were eating was not good.  All in all- very disappointed.  I would like to see if Dirty Dining has been there."}
{"text":"It was really good and fairly cheap! I got the chicken with garlic sauce and chicken fried rice. My friend with me the spicy lamb( that's all I remember to the name) and chicken wings. The portions are fairly large! All of our food together would easily serve 3-4 people! The place was clean and we had no problems with the staff! The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I wish I knew how big the portions would be from the get-go. They have a lot of menu items that I want to try next time I go!"}
{"text":"Authentic as? There were meats on the menu I didn't know you could eat. I had the chicken fried rice and that was ok. I probably won't go back but only because the food was a bit far out for me. The service was good and the people were nice. A mix of cultures were in there eating. Sorry for the poor score - just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I've been to China. This reminds me of the real thing. Authentic, good prices, and so delicious. Never ordered something bad here."}
{"text":"Grown relationship with a staff. They are really homey and treat me and my friends like family. They've also made special dishes for us! Absolutely love this place"}
{"text":"Can someone please tell me what the hell i ate? I ordered a chicken dish but it tasted like pork and had a strange texture ... Really very disturbing ...  I should note that this could be grounds for a lawsuit ... What the hell was the mystery meat? I invite Beijing garden to respond."}
{"text":"When you're looking for cheap Chinese food that hits the spot this is your place. For me it wasn't too authentic but I went for the lunch special. Although the authenticity isn't there the prices cannot be beat. I must admit I do not have a huge appetite but it was a lot of food. There was enough for me to get full and bring home the left overs to my boyfriend. Soup, rice, an egg roll and some protein for 6$ before tax! It can't be beat."}
{"text":"I had been to the Super L Ranch Market next door at the Cofco Chinese Cultural Center, and was craving Chinese food so I headed for Beijing Garden Chinese for a late lunch. As I approached the entrance, a group of 4 diners came out - headed to their car. I asked them how they enjoyed their meal. One of them said he really enjoyed his shrimp dish, but the others didn't want to comment. Since the one gentleman was enthusiastic, I decided to continue inside.   As I entered, I was greeted and led right away to a table near the kitchen entrance. As I took my seat, I could see that the plates on the table in front of me were both chipped. I asked for a plate that wasn't chipped, and it took my server a minute to find one which she switched from another table before she delivered a glass of water, and left me with the menu. Looking around, I noticed that there were very few diners present.  The menu was quite extensive and a bit overwhelming. It helped somewhat that photos of some of the dishes were included, but dishes were less than completely described, providing little sense of flavor profiles, or how one sauce might compare to another. I love vegetables, and wanted to be sure that whatever dish I ordered had plenty of them, in addition to meat or seafood. Understand that by vegetables, I mean nutritious vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, snow peas and the like, not just onions and bell peppers or celery. I also wanted lots of flavor as opposed to a bland dish.  The more I studied the menu, the more questions I had about the various preparations, but for at least 10 minutes, no one came within hailing distance of my table. Finally, with a couple of potential items in mind, and a host of questions, I closed my menu and put it down. Only at that point did my server re-appear.   She wasn't particularly helpful in terms of being able to describe flavors of the dishes, and we appeared to be having some language barrier difficulties. I had been leaning to the Beef with Broccoli, perhaps with garlic sauce instead of brown sauce. After explaining that the garlic sauce was a white sauce that they used with chicken. She indicated that I should just get #82, the Beef with Black Pepper Sauce in Sizzling Plate, which had more spice. I finally convinced her to have Broccoli added to the #82 after clarifying that bell peppers and onions were not sufficient to meet my taste for vegetables. When I asked if they could add a level of spice to the dish, she said no, but she would bring me some hot oil. While not busy at all, she appeared frustrated by my questions, so I left it at that, in addition to some hot tea - hoping for the best.   She brought my tea almost immediately, along with a dish of white rice covered by a bowl, and hot chili oil. I opened my book (dining alone, I always carry one) poured some tea, and settled in to wait for my meal which I thought would be out in short order since the rice had already been brought.  After a good while, a young man set a heated metal plate in a wooden base before me. From a white soup bowl, he poured my beef dish onto the hot plate where the ingredients at the bottom against the plate began to sizzle and give off a delicious aroma. The slivers of beef were in a bit of sauce, and were clearly seasoned with black pepper. The beef apparently had been sautéed with pieces of bell pepper and onions about the size of quarters, and broccoli. Overall it smelled wonderful, and looked appetizing, and the portion size was generous.  I spooned rice, which I realized was now barely warm, and the beef dish onto my plate. After an initial taste, I added Chili Oil to my plate, and to the remainder of the beef dish.   The dish was overly salty overall - although not too salty to eat initially, provided each mouthful included lots of rice. After my first few bites, I realized that not only was the rice not hot, but neither was the beef dish. I found that by digging to the bottom of the metal plate, I could find meat and vegetables that were warmer and almost hot. Each bite tasted overwhelmingly of black pepper. I soon gave up trying to eat it, poured some more tea, and went back to reading my book. No one bothered to approach my table for another 15 minutes - this time I checked my watch...  When someone did return, it was with my check. No one ever asked me how my food was, or if I wanted a take-out container for the large amount of remaining food. They simply removed it. When they saw that I had produced my credit card, they came to collect it right away, and returned in very short order with my card, my receipt, and a fortune cookie, and left my table with no further comment.  Overall, my experience was disappointing. There may be wonderful things on the menu, but they are not helpful at assisting you with finding them."}
{"text":"You can find authentic Chinese food here, but I feel as though they're selling out offering Americanized food here as well.   I asked the waitress for recommendations and she recommended the Sizzling Beef plate and the Ranch Chicken dish.  I ordered crab puffs (girlfriend's guilty pleasure) and the sizzling rice seafood soup.  The puff were subpar; severely understuffed and over-fried.  The seafood soup was great.  The two dishes she recommended were super salty.  Both of the proteins got the corn starch treatment.  I expected it from the beef because we all know the texture from Beef and Broccoli and all Chinese restaurants.  But getting that chewy but tender texture from the chicken was new.  It was okay but I do know that both of these dishes were incredibly salty!   We are thinking of going back for the duck because it seems like they dedicate a big portion of their business to this.  You just need to preorder it in advance."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Chinese food. Well priced too. Make sure you are at the correct restaurant when you go to the Chinese Cultural Center!! This one is to the left of the market.   (The restaurant on the right of the market is terrible.)     We have always been greeted and seated quickly and have had excellent service.      I love, love, love their Thai tea.  I am actually addicted to it and have gotten others addicted to it as well.        They have some interesting dishes to choose from, not your usual Chinese take out joint . But they also have traditional favorites, like Kung Pao, sweet and sour, etc. We try to sample something different every time we go and have enjoyed each meal."}
