{"text":"Great food, fast and friendly service! Very affordable too. I had the potato pancakes stuffed with bacon and cheese and I side of biscuits and gravy. Very good!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast new year's morning and totally enjoyed r breakfast. It was made perfect and the way we asked. The service was excellent. We don't get to enjoy breakfast that much with r work schedule s but when we can we all ways enjoy spinners."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint...Fast service, servers were very pleasant.  I had eggs over easy (cooked perfect, and I'm really particular about my eggs), hash browns (perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside), bacon (could have been cooked a bit longer, but I like mine super crunchy).  My bf had the country fried steak (little too much breading for our liking), with bisquits, and sausage (he said the casing was so chewy, he had to pull it off), but the sausage gravy was spot on, sooo good.  We'll def be back."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. The place is clean. It would be nice if the same 4 Beach Boys songs weren't played on a loop. Don't get me wrong, I can dig the Beach Boys, but play some Pet Sounds or some other bands. The Grilled Chee was great. The server was friendly but a bit unsure about items on the menu. Prices were pretty fair. Anyhow, I would recommend Spinner's and I will go again."}
{"text":"Breakfast is bangin, got the BYOB breakfast sandwich, good service, inexpensive pretty delicious"}
{"text":"Good local diner. Food is good and fairly priced. Service is ok. Decor is patterned out of the fifties. It can get noisy if crowded. By no means is this a romantic dining place. However, if you want a good meal at a fair price or if you are tired of the fast food joints, then this may be the place to try."}
{"text":"I have only gone here for breakfast and the food is great along with the service. Prices are slightly high, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great little Mom and Pop diner. Very friendly waitress and very clean. Food was good."}
{"text":"Such a great place that we found totally by accident.  Very small,  quaint diner that is completely out of the 1950s.  We were greeted almost instantly after we walked in,  our waitress absolutely great.   The food was even better than advertised.  One of the best breakfasts ever.   I cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I had a very poor experience here last Sunday. It took over 1 hour after ordering for our food to come out, and keep in mind we only ordered simple breakfast food...eggs, bacon, pancakes etc. Finally after 1 hour had passed I asked to speak to the manager because we had been told numerous times that our food was \"coming out now\". The lady that came to our table was rude, said that we certainly had not been there for 1 hour (although our server was standing beside her and verified to her that it HAD been over an hour) and that they were busy (not even 3/4 filled). When our food finally did come it was not hot anymore, you could tell it had been sitting for some time. I want to add that our waitress was excellent. She was very attentive and did what she could. Whoever this person was that came to our table (manager, owner, whatever) was the one that ruined it for me and my group and this group of Sunday regulars will be going elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.kinda 70tys
Sausage wasnt cooked through.eggs were runny even though I asked for medium.salt shakers were empty.potatoes were deep fried barely crisp.how can you mess up so much.its breakfast"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Holy Cow, these guys have the most amazing breakfast selection ever! We had  pancakes with ham in the batter and the best chicken fried steak with sausage gravy. Hearty, hearty, hearty! Men will be especially happy to eat here. Everything was homemade and tasty. And the girls there are a riot. Absolutely  a must if you are super hungry for early eats! They serve breakfast all day, and also  do lunch."}
{"text":"Good food and service! We actually drove out to Middlefield only to find the restaurant was closed on Sundays so we hit Spinner's on our way home, starving.  TBH, we thought we were going to be settling but we were wrong! Do not judge a book by its cover!
The prices were great for the amount and quality of the food and our server checked on us about 10 times during our quick meal."}
{"text":"You know how when Yelp asks you about a place and it asks \"Good for Groups?\" This one truly is. I came in with a group of 9 and we were accommodated very easily. There were other large groups in there and it was very friendly with a small town feel. The service was good. They were patient with us. 

As for the food, all I can say is that it is pretty traditional diner fair. The establishment itself is diner style. I guess I would say go here if you need a meal, but nothing special to see here folks!"}
{"text":"Great little diner. Very cute inside with 50's themed decor. The service was as expected, quick and friendly without any frills, but you could see that they knew their regulars. The tables and menus were clean without any stickiness when we were there. 

The prices were spot on for this type of place and the breakfast menu had many fill you up kind of combinations. You won't really find any healthy options here from what I saw. I had the potato pancakes stuffed with bacon and cheese with eggs. It was more than I could finish and I left stuffed! The potato pancakes were as large as the plate. It was hearty. I cannot eat like that often, that's for sure! My husband had a traditional breakfast with pancakes, sausage bacon eggs and potatoes. The potatoes were redskins and tasted fresh and nicely seasoned. The pancakes had good flavor. The sausage also was good. 

This is a great traditional breakfast joint for those who like big, fill you up sort of meals and the price is right!"}
{"text":"Followed yelpers advice to give this spot a whirl....target hit. Perfect lunch spot.  

Food:  very yummy diner fare
Service; awesomely friendly
Cleanliness:  very good
Timeliness: good, giving you time to look at neat pics on walls

Give it a try, I know I'll be back when out in Chardon area."}
{"text":"Service was cheery, and that's the best thing I can share about this place. No offerings for vegans available. Looked sort of old and outdated, in need of some upkeep and a good cleaning. Food was not good at all. Tasted greasy and not fresh. It's a cool idea and we liked the theme, but it's not a place to which we'd return."}
