{"text":"The bald headed owner who looks like Karl wolf is very rude to customers ! He gives off a very negative vibe and acts like he's the shit. Not professional at all."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong- the food is great! Fresh and tasty and better than any Greek place around. But the service sucks! In all the times we have come here, we have never gotten our food in less than an hour and our order has never been right. Not even once. This place needs some decent wait staff and  to get organized. If it did it could be one of the best restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Ordered this for takeout tonight... if you are looking for Greek or Mediterranean food this is NOT it. I'm only giving it two stars because I actually ate most of it but it was mostly due to the fact that I was starving and had already paid and brought it home and not the taste. 

There was nothing Greek about my \"Chicken Souvlaki\". I asked for well done Chicken thinking it would be grilled like every other souvlaki I've ever had... it was definitely not grilled nor did it taste anything like souvlaki. It was some kind of stewed Chicken. It lacked flavour and the breast was fatty and not clean cuts at all. The rice was ok but it would be sad to mess up rice. I was told it comes with Greek salad which it was definitely not... besides the one olive and feta cheese the dressing was not even close to a traditional Greek dressing and the amount of oil in it was horrendous."}
{"text":"I just had to take the time to write a review for this place.  This is by FAR the BEST Greek food I've ever had in my life! Serious!  I tried the chicken the first time and it was ok... then I decided to try the lamb and OMG! it was delicious!  Just AMAZING!  I've been thinking about this food for the past week.  I had it twice last week.  Trying not to have it too much but I can't help myself.  The Tzatziki is the BEST!!! I want some now! ...."}
{"text":"I love coming here! My favourite thing on the menu is the super chicken shish with fries inside. It's my go to food when I come here. The poutine is also to die for! Although the service here isn't always the greatest and it always takes forever to get the good, I still go back because of how good the food is. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking to grab a bite to eat but expect to wait a while for your food on a busy night."}
{"text":"First time visit, went in looking for a quick meal on the go. 

I ordered the Boss -- pita loaded with chicken, lettuce, tomato, hot sauce
I enjoyed it, tasted fresh, great cuts of chicken breast and the pita bread tasted homemade
I would recommend it.

I took out, but the dine in area seemed cozy, relaxed and had a nice decor

My only complaint:
The pita can be messy because of the sauces, so not ideal for eating on the go. 

Another issue to raise, nothing to do with the food
The kitchen is exposed, you can see the cooks preparing meals, and the guy with the shaved head(I think the owner) speaks pretty badly to his employees which can make you feel uncomfortable if you're dining in and you feel sorry for the staff. 
I know as a boss you have to keep employees in line, but when the customers can hear what you say and the despondent looks on the employees face can ruin the dining experience

Overall I will go back"}
{"text":"The pita portions are huge but not worth the price they are listed for. I got the special pita wrap with chicken and fries. The fries were soggy and tasted frozen. The chicken was cooked right but it was bland.  The sauce had no flavour.  The poutine was smothered with too much, super salty gravy.  The quality of food was just average.  The quantity was a generous amount but save your money if you want exceptional tasting food."}
{"text":"Great Food ! Fresh ingredients ! Authentic Taste ! Good Service ! Moderate Prices ! What else you want !!! 
Table Management, Ambience and hygiene can be better ! Staff gets confused when busy but still a good place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem...nice decor and yummy Greek food. I love the chicken clro.  The hummus is really yummy and you have to have the haloumi. The staff are super nice and you can tell the young employees that work there are getting a great opportunity. Each time we visit,  it's really nice."}
{"text":"I tried this store on a whim. Best choice I've made. The place is cozy and clean. The lady at the counter is very nice and always smiling. The food is top notch and always fresh. I've tried pretty much all they have and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Was hungry and was in the bovaird airport area and felt like having some Greek food .. When I yelped I came across mosaic and decided to try it out.

It's a nice small location in a strip plaza looks better inside than out ... Menu had a lot of options so I went for the chicken souvlaki dinner.

Received my dinner portion was huge and food was simply on point!! Was very impressed and to be honest it was definitely better than the mr. Greeks and other Greek restaurants out there.

Service was good had no complaints I would definitely bring my family here again in the near future"}
{"text":"Delicious, love this place. Find there is too many Greek places that are opened in Brampton. Always a great feel good full feeling."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I love this spot.  Its a hidden gem in a busy plaza (if that makes sense). I first came here years ago when they first opened through a friend of mine and been coming here ever since.  This place has changed but for the better and what I do like about them is that the things that matter stayed consistent : food & service.

No matter who is servicing us, I'm always greeted and welcomed into their establishment.  They make you feel comfortable and dont let you leave with the feeling that you're just another customer.  

Food here is finger licking good but I have to admit I'm addicted to there Chicken Shish (Super).  Discloser: its huge and packed with meat (I normally can't finish the whole thing).  Its essentially a Chicken Shawarma with French Fries in it, yum yum yum :) because I classify this has a Shawarma, I can confidentiality say this has to be the best Shawarma spot in Brampton.  There's something about their white sauce that has me coming back every time."}
{"text":"Food: Very Tasty and Fresh! We tried the kafta roll, chicken soulvaki with rice and humus. The fries were delish.

Service: Amazing! We went after they had closed but they let us in for take away.

Decor: Warm and inviting. We will definitely return for a sit down meal.

If you are looking for Mediterranean food in Brampton, give this a try!"}
{"text":"I think I just have had really bad luck.  The food is mediocre and the service is horrible in fact one time the person behind the counter was falling asleep while taking my order.  He then disappeared to go nap in the back, while the food cooked.  He finally came back only disappear again at which point it seems that he may have passed out.     He had just fallen asleep again.  Let's say I did not eat their food that night"}
{"text":"Used to be amazing. Gone downhill in the past couple years. Salad dressing used to be amazing. Now it's meh. Chicken enterees used to have flavour, now bland and unedible with out the taziki sauce, half a solo small side cup is what u get for a pound worth of food,only one hot sauce and never received the garlic butter I asked specifically for...not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Food is good . Best baba ganoush I've ever had but the service is soooo slow . I've called in takeout orders 30 min in advance and I always still have to wait till I get there. If u want to eat here, u better have the time to"}
{"text":"Honestly?  The food was amazing!  Decor, staff, meh but food amazing! Ordered the  tzatziki and pita to start while we waited for a friend.  The tzatziki was amazing but very garlicky so fresh breathe beware!  We weren't super hungry after the starter and I had seen some super large plates of food go go by to other tables so I was content with my order of a chicken wrap.  When those arrived they were huge!  Delicious and huge!  I ate almost all of mine but had to leave the last bite.  The flavours were really really good.  I made good use of the leftover tzatziki on my wrap.  The staff could have been a little more attentive with the utensils and water.   We had to wait a while for both.  It might have been easier to just have a station where guests can grab it for themselves.  All in all good experience and would go back."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. This restaurant is below Jimmy the Greek standards ... and not nearly as good Paramount Fine Foods. This place is going down hill and fast ... also I think they have sold the business to some other people. Also there is child-chef making the food now -  who has no experience making good mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing and Chef Tony is a gem! You must try this place if you haven't already."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty darn good but the service is slow and not very good. The waitress was really confused the entire time and I had to flag her several times. 1) The ketchup bottle she gave us was practically empty 2) She forgot to bring out one persons salad (she didn't get it until everyone else was pretty much done) 3) One person didn't get their main course until we asked for it. Also, we had said it was a birthday but they didn't even so much as acknowledge it."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite places to order, the wait time used to be justified as the quality and taste was amazing. However, no more. Ordered a beef souvlaki dinner, chicken pita and falafel pita with a gravy. First off a hour and a half wait...followed by a beef souvlaki consisting of 6-7 burnt beef cubes so overdone that the tzatziki could not save it. Both wrap were so soggy that they fell apart right when opened. The gravy was so bland, there was no flavour. Im truly disappointed that this once great gem of brampton has abandoned all the qualities that once made it great, and im dissapointed that i rather have ordered mr greek."}
{"text":"Great food and owner takes a special interest into all his customers to ensure they enjoy their meal; goes above and beyond.  It is in a plaza but dont be fooled, the quality of food is awesome and consistent.

-The Roasted Veg penne in Alfredo sauce is amazing(Yes a Mediterranean resto with great pasta)
-Chicken Slovaki also real good
-Veggie Poutine a must try"}
{"text":"Found this place using yelp as I was in the area with some friends. The reviews were good, so I decided to check it out. Greek good cooked by people of South East Asian decent, but they do a good job. They place needs a Reno, and the free water tasted odd,  probably due to the cups being used not having been properly rinsed after the wash. That aside, everything went well there after. Tried some of the appetizers that were ordered. Excellent. Had the beef kabob with rice, potatoes, and salad -  same was excellent. Will be going back if I am in the area. Needs some work as mentioned above. 4 out of 5"}
{"text":"Love this place! Would recommend anyone who loves greek food to go here. It's a cute little romantic restaurant with huge portions and not that pricy either, about 14$ for the chicken solvaki dinner plate."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is of great quality. A little pricey for an everyday hangout spot, but a solid choice if you're looking for Mediterranean food. Considering nearly everything else in the area is fast food (i.e. McDonald's, Pizza Pizza), this a rare find in Brampton."}
{"text":"Owner was EXTREMELY rude to his wait staff when we were there. I tipped the poor girl $20 on a $70 bill because I felt so bad for her. Food is ver good but WAY overpriced. 2 stars could be 4 if the owner wasnt such a rude person & 5 stars if he didnt pillage the people that come in with his insane pricing"}
{"text":"I ordered from them about a few days ago through skip the dish. The food was awful, salty and cold. The salad was drenched in white sauce, the calamari were so salty, the rice had no taste, even the chicken was a little hard..I spent 65.00 bucks and it went all in the garbage."}
{"text":"Just ate here this afternoon with my fam and really glad I did. We got the family platter which was $45 and gives you a sampler of 2 of everything. 

Place was quiet but don't let that fool you. Everything was on point and delicious. My falafel did come out well done but the inside was salvageable so I won't complain. 

The gentleman who served us was very friendly and attentive and did it all with a smile. Place was clean. Serving utensils etc were neatly wrapped in napkins. 

Be careful though - floors are a bit slippery! Which isn't unusual for restaurants with tiles. 

Bonus is their house made hot sauce and unlike other yelpers - our food came out faster than we could put it away. 


Will definitely be back! BRB I'm gonna go finish the yummy food I brought back home from there now."}
{"text":"When I want homestyle greek cuisine I usually come here since its a couple minutes away from me. Its a small, quiet but a friendly place. I grab the chicken souvlaki dinner, and my plate is normally packed, I love places with no portion control.. especially when their foods great. This is a family owned businesss so they always try their best pleasing the customer with a smile. Sometimes when I'm on the go, I call in for pick up, I grab the chicken/beef souvlaki wrap and its soo good. Their hummus & tzatiki sauce is fresh and delicious everytime. Also, it may take some time for you to get your food since these guys make things from scratch, which I dont mind at all. If your in the Brampton area, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Certainly wouldn't know of this place if it weren't for Yelp. In my hometown, but on the otherside of it. I found myself nearby today, so finally gave it a shot. One of my things has long been to have a trusty go-to Pita/Shawarma place, and thankfully I can add this to the list.
I had the chicken pita wrap and decided to go with fries in it. First off, they pulled out marinated chicken out of the fridge and cooked it fresh right then and there - a good sign. The staff were really friendly and talked as I waited. I also had to ask about the owners as I know a lot of 'Greek' places, aren't actually Greek. I also had heard of their hot sauce, which I don't associate with Greek food at all. This isn't a bad thing, as I actually tend to prefer Turkish and Lebanese food to Greek. The hostess thought that they were Syrian - which would make sense since I've had some seriously hot sauces at Syrian-run places before. But I digress...
When I received my pita, I'd liken it to the first time I received my children at birth. The thing is huge! It was to-go, and they double wrap it in tinfoil and was told to peel as I eat - like a banana. What a novel idea!
LOVED the huge, tasty, and generous portioned chicken - that's really the star. The veggies did their thing by being fresh. I didn't see any pickled veggies in case that matters to some. The hot sauce was nice, and certainly builds as you reach your way down. Enjoyed the the Tzatziki as well (they is certainly some Greek stuff there) Again, I just have to applaud the genius way of wrapping this thing, as it would've been almost impossible otherwise. Is there a downside? Oddly, it was too big. Towards the very end, I was kind've looking forward to it being done. A small complaint, and maybe if I were famished I may have felt differently. Oh, and the fries weren't weird at all. They're fresh cut, so it was just like having potatoes inside...which I guess would make sense.
I want to give the full menu a try another time by dinning in, though I'd agree with another reviewer that the ambiance is so-so."}
{"text":"The hubby and I wanted to grab some good food after a long day and we weren't disappointed! Their food is amazing, full of flavour and was made hot and fresh as soon as we ordered. 
The staff were very friendly and the fact that it's all halal is a huge bonus!
I'm definitely going to be back here!"}
{"text":"When my friend and I pulled in to the parking space across the restaurant, we were debating if we should really eat here. But the food and service were exceptional. We had a great time catching up along with the delicious food. 
We ordered mosaic chicken and chicken cleo and it was just soooo good!
It's my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend based on reviews we read on yelp. I have been to the plaza numerous times but I've never noticed this restaurant! We order the vegetarian meal which included salad, 2 dips with pita, rice with grilled vegetables (eggplant and zucchini) and falafels. I've tried many falafels  but these were delicious! The two dips we ordered was hummus and baba ganoush. The hummus was amazing, I did not want to share! The baba ganoush on the other hand tasted burnt.

The store owner was nice to also give us tzatziki and specially make our rice. The rice included in the meal used chicken broth so the owner made us rice without it!!

I definitely would recommend this place and I most likely would visit again!"}
{"text":"Came back mostly for the friendly staff. The food was average. The Lamb kababs were the most memorable, I would suggest the gyros... It's the best bang for bucks. They tend to get busy during dinner service so the wait for service can be a little long. The ambiance is nice, been there for a date and girls' night out, so it's a place that you'd be able to talk with your dining partners...hopefully you bring back up subjects as there will be lots of time to converse between seating-ordering-eating-bill...patience is required when things are busy. The owner has spunk but can be friendly :). Glad to have tried this place out."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Does get busy on Friday and Saturday nights but totally worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend told me that he made a reservation in this famous mediterranean restaurant for vday,  I hoped to myself it better be good.. :) it was our first time, he just Googled it and believed that is famous base on the reviews... when I found out that it's in a plaza I almost cry deep inside.. I mean, seriously.. vday dinner... in a plaza??.. you've got to be kidding me!  When we arrive it was packed and there are people waiting inside. It's small but it's cozy and you can see how people  in the kitchen are preparing your food.. which i think is pretty nice.. you can see what you're about to get. 

This place reminds me of Anatolia,  the resto to go to whenever we crave for something mediterranean back in New Zealand. The setting,  the coziness,  It felt like I'm home again..:) ... I like how Chef Tony is so passionate about his cooking... everything was NICELY DONE, FRESH and by jeez the food tastes EXCELLENT!   We ordered fried calamari for starters,..it was cooked to perfection...with tzatziki dipping sauce,  oh goodness!.. I almost forgot my boyfriends name! :) we had shrimp and mosaic chicken for our mains and we knew we have new fave resto to put on our list. 

Keep it up chef Tony! Words are being scattered. . So don't let me down! :)"}
{"text":"I'd come back if i lived closer!

The place is somewhat small but i ordered the Chicken Cleo which is chicken and pineapples... This is a Mediterranean place so they sell souvklavi, and other stuff as well.. You can choose from regular or large size and i got the regular. it was still massive!!! oh my...

we also ordered hummus as well and that was nice and garlicy! amazing! 

this place is pretty good! the taste of the food was good and flavourful, generous portions, friendly staff (Greeted by the chef immediately) and the atmosphere was great as well..very comfortable! 

my meal was $11.50 i believe so it's not too pricey either for a huge dish like that! will definitely come back if i ever come back to the Brampton area :)"}
{"text":"Lets just call this place a hidden gem.  Its in a fairly large plaza off to the side.  The food is great service is a bit slow.  All food is made fresh and cooked to perfection.  I went out on a limb and ordered a Philly cheese steak from a Greek restaurant and I must say it was one of the best cheese steak sandwiches that I have ever had.  I have dined here quite a few times and always left pleased."}
{"text":"This place has the best food ever.  Everything taste amazing!   Tony is so friendly and pleasant, he makes sure that everything is perfect for you.  If you want amazing food this is the place!!!! Seriously!!!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely phenomenal!
The boyfriend and I came here for the first time the other night, and I couldn't have been happier!
First of all, it's in a plaza with a sign that says \"Greek Food\". We drove by twice without realizing it was the restaurant we were looking for. Don't let the outside fool you.

We ordered the Bathenjane Dip to start. It was a pretty big portion for 2 people. It was incredible! Served with warm pita, and topped with olives. So. Good.

I then ordered the falafel plate with rice and potatoes. It comes with a salad (Greek or Caesar), but I asked them to sub it for tabbouleh. This was no problem for them. The salad is HUGE. This plus the dip was more than filling. When the rest of the meal came, I was overwhelmed with the amount of food. It all tasted fabulous. Those were probably the best falafels I've ever had. Ever.

My boyfriend ordered the Mosaic Chicken Classic with Greek salad and rice and potatoes. Another massive portion. He mentioned that the vegetables were nicely cooked, and that the texture of the chicken was great.

We couldn't order dessert because we were so full!

You could see the cooks working in the kitchen, and you could hear the owner giving directions and keeping on top of things. A few times, I heard him tell the chefs to add more of this or that, and attended carefully to the details. I appreciated and respected this... This is how you get repeat customers!

The only reason I didn't give this place a full 5 stars was because the service was a little slow. However, this was totally understandable when seeing how many take-out orders they were making in addition to the dine-in orders.

I'll definitely be asking my boyfriend to bring us back here again :)"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem ! 

I love the cozy atmosphere at mosaic grill .
The place is very inviting & family friendly . I brought my two year old nephew and he was comfortable and satisfied with his food ! 

I always get the boss pita with a side of maple glazed fries , absolutely Amazing !
Be sure to come by and check it out . 


One of my favourite Brampton spots   !"}
{"text":"Mosaic is a hidden gem. The food is fantastic and the owner is as nice as his food tastes good. I may not live in Brampton, but I sure do eat here every time I visit!"}
{"text":"If I can give these people 0 stars I would I came in a 9:15 pm and the guy working say they close at 10:00 pm I proceeded to show him the time that it wasn't even 9:30 and I drove very far to eat here and he didn't care and just told me they were closing soon. This is so rude why say you close at 10 than just correct your closing time to 9 pm instead, than I would understand. I was just in town for a couple hours and wanted to try this place instead I went to lazees shawarma in the same plaza open till 11 pm they were a little busy but our food was ready fast and was delicious."}
{"text":"The food was definitely good but the wait time was a bit long for me. They make the items as you order and good food takes time so just keep that in mind if you are in a rush to get in and out."}
{"text":"Their food is always consistent and that's very important too me. I love that they make their own hot sauce from cracked peppers awesome!!!. I always order the Greek pita and have them smother it in it. The guy that owns this place is awesome and his mother who works there as well is very nice which make the customer service a bonus. Food is Always fresh and their meat is hormone and gmo free!! Honestly I feel like this restaurant is too good to be in Brampton but on the flip side I'm lucky to have such a great find so close."}
{"text":"Mosaic Mediterranean Grill...one of those neighborhood places that is you go to when your looking for a quick bite that is tasty and not too expensive.  An good selection of Mediterranean food choices with a few special Mosaic versions of classics.  Fresh ingredients, tasty menu choices keep me coming back. The menu portions are quite generous and the Greek salad is my wife's favorite dish.  The dressing is the key here..not like other Greek dressing...this one has a unique taste and color.   I personally love the Pita's.  Nice big pita's, if you order them \"special\"
you also get french fries rolled into the pita!!   One small downfall, the service can be slow and a little unorganized.  It has happened on a couple of occasions when me and my wife have sat down for dinner or lunch.  This is probably because they get a lot of walk in traffic, plus the diners in the restaurant can be a little overwhelming for the small staff.  The business is family owned, so you would usually see the son or the mother either cooking or taking care of guests.   A great little place in North Brampton if your looking for some tasty Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place 4-5/month. It's more like a 3.5*. The food taste is great. The garlic sauce & tzatziki are out of this world! I ordered the Chicken Mosaic Classic which came with roasted potato & rice. The chicken was over cooked. The potato's were a little on the cool side & the rice was runny. They had the order of food delivery messed up as well. The salad was first then came the appetizer & then the main course. The pita didn't arrive until we were 75% through the meal. Here's the issue....this place could be great & the food could be more fantastic but the chef/owner is \"difficult\". The kitchen turns out some great food but the service is slow & the staff is un-engaged. This place could turn from good to great if they could fix these issues."}
{"text":"Just ok in my opinion.  Name of the restaurant sounds way, waaay more exotic than what it actually is, re:  greek food.  

And btw, sign says GREEK FOOD, so it was sorta difficult to find in this busy plaza with a bunch of units crammed tightly together.  So look out for that and not \"Mosaic Mediterranean\" in the same plaza as Fortino's.

When I stopped by for lunch today, lady was running the entire place by herself, picking up the phone, taking peoples' orders, cooking, cashing people out.  As a patron, who has retail background, this isn't the most impressive thing to see.  It translates into possible mismanagement issues.

Due to the short staffing, food did take a while to get - approx. 15-20mins for the lunch special which was a pita sandwich (of your choice) + fries + pop OR salad.  If you choose salad, you don't get a drink.  Lady was pretty explicit about this.  

At $10, it's not uber-cheap by any means.  Ok, but again, seems like there is more value in dining Asian.

My chicken shawarma wrap was pretty good, esp. if you eat it fresh and hot.  Not so great after it cooled.  What did impress me was the freshness of the veggies in the wrap/Greek Salad AND the fact that the fries were hand-cut, not frozen.

Would go again if it was in my 'hood, but it's quite far!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended by a friend, and rightly so!! EXCELLENT recommendation for a Greek restaurant. Casual environment, fantastic food, huge portions, chicken is amazing, and prices are fabulous. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Food taste and quality is AMAZING!!!   Worth taking a look.  Don't come unless you have time.   Food takes a while...that is the reason for the missing star.  If your in Brampton stop in. 

So far I can recommend:

Chicken and beef kebab 
Hummus
Tzatziki - put it on everything
Fries - Just passed on salad; too good
Pita
Rice"}
{"text":"This place serves great portion and food.  Some staff seem to be more knowledgeable.  Love the food here!"}
{"text":"2 stars coz the descriptions \"Meh I've tasted better\" is the truth. First off it is pricey. Next...although that pita sandwich was stuffed and fat, the words \"quality over quantity\" applies here. I'm not going to say that this is a bad place to go to but for my first visit it was disappointing. I do feel the options in Messini are a lot better but since this is in brampton then why not root for the home team. With that being said I am open to returning to this establishment. There are a lot of good reviews promoting it. I will update my review and hopefully provide a better one next time."}
{"text":"Bigger portions than I expected but tasty nonetheless. My only concern - I wish the kitchen was separated from the dining area. Your clothes will smell a bit when you leave. 

There is a good selection of Mediterranean food choices and service is timely. You will not leave hungry. I like the mural on the entryway too.

What it lacks: it feels more like a snack bar than a restaurant. I couldn't help but feel this place would be a great candidate for restaurant makeover. 

I give it three stars for great food, good service but giving me he sensation that his restaurant could be more than what it actually is"}
{"text":"We ate the bruschetta - yum! The balsamic was a nice touch. I prefer a little more basil though. 

Hubby ordered the lamb souvlaki and I had the chicken souvlaki. Both were incredibly juicy. The portions are crazy. No way I was going to be able to eat all of the rice and potatoes. Great tsaziki!

We arrived shortly after 5pm on a Sunday. Place was pretty busy. Service was great, staff were friendly and the owner cares! 

I'd come here again if I was in Brampton."}
{"text":"I waited almost 2 hrs for delivery and it was well worth it! Although, nobody should have to wait that long.  Try the chicken parmeason penne and the chicken souvlaki dinner and Greek salad! Amazing, I'm surprised I forgot to write a review for this place. Extra taziki sauce please. Reason for the 4 stars.. the delivery. Food 4/5 out of 5 easy."}
{"text":"So, food taste amazing. No doubt about that. The major problems I noticed the 3 times I visited since new owners came in:
1)I ordered my food and it came  75 minutes later. 2nd visit I took two other friends, their food came after 1 hr and when they had finished their meals my food arrived which was 1.5 hrs after ordering. Today I went and two polite gentlemen waited for 2 hrs and finally left.
2)they have poor ventilation and the whole place is full of fumes; thick opaque fumes where people inside kept coughing, to the point where two customers stepped outside and held the door open.
3) Owner shook my friends hand and didnt have the decency to acknowledge me and when i extended my hand and let it hang for a few seconds he didnt notice it, which may have been because he was very high off of weed because he stank like it. Not to mention he was asking my friend if he wanted to \"get smashed\", \"let's drink\". Keep in mind it was a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Great food .. Great portion .. Great service :).  You gotta eat here because the flavour of the food is out this world .. Quality fresh ingredients  is a must and if you don't believe me then try it for your self .. You won't be disappointed  I promise"}
{"text":"Food and services is great but little bit higher on the price consider the location but the portion is very generous so sharing plate is a good option too"}
